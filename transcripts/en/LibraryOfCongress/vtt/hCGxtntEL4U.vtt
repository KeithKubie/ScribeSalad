&gt;&gt; Jon Parrish Peede:
Good afternoon,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.420
and welcome to the
18th Annual Library

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.020
of Congress National
Book Festival.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm Jon Parrish Peede, chairman

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.200
of the National Endowment
for the Humanities.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.060
NEH is proud to sponsor this
year's Understanding Our

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.930
World Stage.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.720
An independent federal agency,
NEH was established in 1965

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.030
and our agency was part of
LBJ's Great Society legislation.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.950
And the NEH and our sister
agency the NEA still follow

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.020
that original mission.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.960
Our agency supports museum
exhibitions, documentaries,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.640
books that bring history,
literature, philosophy,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.820
archaeology and other
humanities fields to the public.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.530
We fund a preservation
of historical records,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.410
collections and objects.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.380
We sponsor educational
opportunities for teachers

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.650
and students in the humanities.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.160
And we underwrite fundamental
research across all disciplines

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180
of the humanities both
by professors as well

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.020
as by independent scholars.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.830
Our distinguished guest today,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.000
Gordon S. Wood, has
long ties to NEH.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.940
Not only has he received NEH
grants as far back as 1967,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.860
some 50 years ago when we
were an infant federal agency,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.020
he was awarded the 2010
National Humanities medal

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.390
by the president of
the United States.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.830
And you will have a chance
to meet him yourself shortly

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.080
after this presentation at 6:30
PM where he'll be signing books

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.700
at line number 11
on the lower level.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.040
And I'll say both to this
audience and to the public

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.360
at large, Gordon Wood hardly
needs an introduction.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.100
Once described as "almost
an American institution"

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.910
by the New York Times, Wood
has profoundly shaped our

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.390
understanding of America's
democratic institutions

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.210
and the visions of the founders
who laid out their blueprint.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.170
He is the author and
the editor of 25 books,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.160
including the Pulitzer
Prize-winning The Radicalism

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.100
of the American Revolution,
and The Creation

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.450
of the American Republic

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.580
for which he was awarded
the Bancroft Prize.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.210
He is the Alba Way University
professor and professor

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.050
of history emeritus
at Brown University.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.090
And I'll say too on a personal
note, I had the pleasure

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.920
of going to grad school
with his daughter Amy

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.310
who is herself a fine
and important historian.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.460
And throughout his long career
as a historian, Wood has focused

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.200
on the pivotal period after 1776
in which our nation was forged,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.460
and unpack for us the essential
radicalism of the founding era.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.680
In a letter dated
July1813, John Adams wrote

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.120
to his political rival

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.290
and sometimes friend Thomas
Jefferson, "You and I ought not

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.930
to die before we have explained
ourselves to each other."

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.290
And of course, the latest book
that we're celebrating today,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.400
Friends Divided: John
Adams and Thomas Jefferson,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.790
Wood fulfills Adams'
wish, explaining the ideas

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.580
that brought these
two men together,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.730
and the philosophical
differences that led

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.390
to the original schism
in their friendship.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.940
And I will say that these
letters are compiled,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.180
edited and published through
decades of NEH support.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.060
And since we are a
federally funded agency,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.290
that is through your support.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.010
So thank you.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.550
Professor Wood will be in
conversation with philanthropist

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.400
and cofounder of the Carlisle
Group David Rubenstein.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.660
Deeply invested in the practice
of patriotic philanthropy,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.730
Rubenstein's generosity has done
much to preserve the monuments

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.490
and records of our founding era.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.520
Those of us in DC are grateful
to his financial support

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.580
in creating the National
Archives Visiting Center,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.310
repairing the Washington
Monument after it was damaged

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.420
by the earthquake, and
sponsoring the current expansion

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.760
of the Kennedy Center.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.630
And of course I would be
remiss if I did not say

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.930
that the book festival

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.650
as we know it simply
would not be occurring

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.240
without his support, his
vision and sponsorship.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.460
[ Applause ]

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.510
Thank you.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.950
And if you'll allow me a
few sentences before we get

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.780
to the main event, what comes
to mind for me when I think

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.220
about these gentlemen and what
they have achieved is an 1816

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.120
letter that Jefferson wrote.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.930
And he said, "A nation that
expects to be ignorant and free,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.990
and a state, a civilization
expects what never was

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.200
and never will be."

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.690
So ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.070
please help me welcome these two
gentlemen who have done as much

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.620
as anyone I can think
of as living Americans

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.290
to help us have a society that
is both free and informed.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.510
Thank you.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.340
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So why don't we start

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.900
with the second Continental
Congress.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.080
At that congress, John Adams
is the dominant figure.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.380
Is that fair to say?

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.830
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Yes,
by all means.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And he was dominant

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.340
because he was the
principal person who thought

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.780
that we should secede
from the British Empire.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.260
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.340
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So he was then probably

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.800
in his 40's I guess it was.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.110
And Thomas Jefferson was new.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.030
He hadn't been at the
first Continental Congress.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.330
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: That's right.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.630
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: He comes

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.930
for the second Continental
Congress.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.230
He's only 33 or so.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.530
He goes begrudgingly.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.830
He doesn't really
want to be there.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.130
Is that right?

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.880
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: No, I think
he wanted to go to the first,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.760
but he became ill and he
sent a pamphlet instead,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.860
or some instructions which
turned into a pamphlet.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.830
His fellow delegates from
Virginia published it

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.050
without his permission and it
became the most radical pamphlet

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.280
at that time in the whole
debate with Great Britain.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.820
This was a summary view
of the relationship.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.300
And until Thomas
Payne's Common Sense,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.460
it was the most radical
pamphlet.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.860
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Okay, so he goes there.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.950
His wife was ill at the time of
the second Continental Congress.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.280
He didn't really want
to be there, I thought.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.550
But he gets there and ultimately
John Adams proposes a resolution

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.030
in effect that says we should
break away from England.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.330
Is that right?

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.630
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.150
Well, others proposed
the resolution

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.800
but certainly he
was the proponent,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.480
the most eager delegate
for independence.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.780
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.280
so he's the most eager
delegate for independence.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.520
And ultimately the
delegates don't have the right

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.230
to break away from England.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.520
They haven't been given that
authority from the legislatures.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.960
So I think Adams and Richard
Henry Lee basically say

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.680
to the delegates, "Let's
pass a resolution to go back

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.980
and get the authority."

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.880
Is that more or less right?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.180
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well,
they pass in May --

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.480
the 2nd of May, the
May Resolutions,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.500
which essentially
were written by Adams.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.800
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.380
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: And they
essentially gave advice

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.210
to the colonies that they
should suppress all mention

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.630
of royal authority.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.650
So it's tantamount to a
Declaration of Independence

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.290
which Adams felt was the real
Declaration of Independence.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.590
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.890
We'll get to that.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.190
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Of course
later on he tried to claim

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.780
that he had anticipated the --

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.420
So the delegates go back
to their 13 colonies.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.840
But while they're back, there's
a committee that's appointed

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.820
to deal with this situation.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.670
If they come back and they
vote for independence,

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.670
they want to explain
why they're doing this.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.970
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.270
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So they
decide to have a committee,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.570
and there were lots
of committees

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.870
in those days in the congress.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.050
But they have a committee
appointed to figure

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.030
out how they should describe
what they're going to do.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.330
And who's on that committee?

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.250
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well,
five representatives.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.500
And they're sectionally,
depending on location,

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.280
a New Englander, a New
Yorker -- two New Englanders,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.100
a New Yorker and a Virginian.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.180
Yeah, and so they
represent, and Jefferson

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.230
and Adams are both
on the committee.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.530
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.830
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Jefferson's
the young man.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.530
Adams is on about two dozen
committees in the congress.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.840
So he's on the board of law

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.450
which is essentially
conducting the war effort

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.750
against Great Britain.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.600
So he's very busy, and so
let's let this young guy

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.680
who just joined us, let him
go off and write the thing.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.470
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Little did
Adams realize how important the

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.770
Declaration would become.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.070
He would have written
it himself.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.830
He was appalled later on
of course by the acclaim

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.900
that Jefferson was getting.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.050
Neither Jefferson nor Adams knew
how important the Declaration

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.350
would become in time.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.890
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Adams
I thought originally said

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.540
something like, "Well, I'm not
that popular and you are not

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.770
as disliked as I am, so
you should write it."

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.280
But also he was from
Massachusetts and maybe someone

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.580
from Virginia would be better.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.170
Is that more or less right?

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.470
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Yeah,
that was true.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.810
Both colonies were of
course in the lead.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.020
But Adams also said, "You're
a good man with a pen."

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.210
Because of the summary
view pamphlet,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.410
Jefferson had already acquired
a reputation for being facile

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.950
and good in his writing.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.250
So it was a natural thing.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.980
But Jefferson was a junior
member and it was not at all

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.860
in Adams' mind that
this was going to amount

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.160
to anything important.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.460
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.980
So Jefferson has roughly I
think 17 days to write it.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.660
Like most humans, he
waits till the end.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.450
So he has three days
to go, he sits down

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.540
and writes the Declaration
of Independence,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.060
takes it back to the committee.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.620
And the committee, they're
happy with it and they edit it.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.810
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: They make a
few changes, but minor things.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.490
And yeah, Jefferson.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.790
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And one of the people

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.510
on the committee is an editor
named Benjamin Franklin,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.830
so he edits a little bit.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.130
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.430
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: All right.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.730
So then the delegates come back,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.730
they vote ultimately
to be independent.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.170
That vote occurs
on July the 2nd.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.160
So what does Adams
say to his wife then?

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.920
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, he
thought that would be the day

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.150
that would be celebrated
with bonfires and fireworks

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.090
and what became the 4th of July.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.390
He missed it by two days.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.420
He didn't realize that
the actual Declaration

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.760
or the document would
become the important thing,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.780
rather than the vote itself.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.830
And so he missed that.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.230
But he got the notion that
it was important right.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.530
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:46.830
So on July the 2nd they
vote to be independent.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.160
July the 3rd, July the 4th,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.270
they take up the
Declaration of Independence.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.070
And do they just take
whatever Jefferson has written?

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.420
Or do they modify it?

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.820
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: No, no,
they make some changes.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.120
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.990
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: The congress
makes some very serious changes.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.590
About 40% of the Declaration
is changed, particularly

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.000
on the slavery question.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.630
And Jefferson is suffering
through all of these changes.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.440
Franklin makes jokes
to him about it,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.230
referring to a hatter I
think, a sign and so on.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.300
And it becomes a humorous
incident, but not for Jefferson.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.400
He really suffered.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.910
No author likes to
have his words cut out.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.800
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: During
this debate it's alleged

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.610
that Jefferson never
said a word.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.520
He didn't say, "Don't
edit this."

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.820
He says nothing.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.120
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.420
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Why did he say nothing?

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.080
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: He differs
to -- he's not a public man.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.370
He does not like speaking out.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.860
He was good in small committees,
but he's not an orator.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.430
Completely different from
Adams in that respect.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.940
Adams is always on his feet,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.940
always arguing and
always debating.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.460
Jefferson, not at all.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.590
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay,
so ultimately they agree

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.550
on the text on the 4th of July.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.680
It's printed up, it's
sent around to everybody.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.980
They know what the text is

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.940
and then the Continental
Congress more or less disbands

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.850
as they go to fight the war.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.300
Where does Adams go and
where does Jefferson go

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.010
after the second
Continental Congress?

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.310
What are they doing?

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.230
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, Adams is
finally assigned to go abroad

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.210
to negotiate a treaty.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.980
He's going to negotiate the
treaty with France, an alliance.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.700
And he arrives but it's already
then accomplished by others,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.110
including of course
Franklin who has been there

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.700
from the very beginning, 1776.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.740
And so Adams is over there and
so he's got nothing else to do,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.920
so he goes to Holland and
becomes a very important figure

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.980
in extracting money from the
Dutch and also getting the Dutch

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.930
to become the second country
to recognize the United States.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.170
And Jefferson goes back
home and eventually ends

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.610
up becoming governor of the
state, of the commonwealth

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.280
of Virginia, the new state.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.270
And a very unhappy
experience for him

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:11.010
because he mishandles
some events.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:16.510
But he would love to get abroad
himself, and is asked later,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.670
but can't leave because of
first there are difficulties

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.230
with the ships, and then
there's difficulties

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.210
with his wife's illness.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.190
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But in that
period of time, during the war,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.860
when the war is being fought
from essentially 1776 to 1781,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.050
the relationship between
Adams and Jefferson is okay?

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.350
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Yeah.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.030
I think there's one
letter exchanged.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.320
They had known each other,
but they're not close

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:46.210
until Jefferson finally comes
abroad as one of the ministers

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.770
to deal with treaties

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.530
of commerce following
the acceptance

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.040
of the peace treaty
by Great Britain.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.690
So when they're together
in Paris,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.460
that's when the two families
really come together.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.890
Or Jefferson's a
widower at this point.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.490
And Abigail has joined John

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.690
and John Quincy Adams
the young son is there.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.330
And Jefferson is adopted so to
speak as a member of the family.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.630
He's lonely.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.670
He's got his daughters there,
but the daughters are in school.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:28.210
And he becomes a member of the
Adams family and takes to them.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.650
Really I think that's when the
relationship is most enriched.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.830
They become intermingled.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:40.570
Jefferson would take John Quincy
to a concert or to a museum.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.410
They would go to places
in Paris together.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:50.730
And then of course when Adams
is appointed as minister

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.320
of the United States to Great
Britain, they go off to London

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.630
but they exchange
letters back and forth.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.980
Abigail herself writing
to Thomas Jefferson,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.540
and they exchange presents.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.520
And there's a little
flirtation that goes

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.600
on between Jefferson --
not much by our standards.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.210
But in one letter Jefferson
writes to Abigail, "I was going

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:19.700
to purchase a little statue
of Venus for your dining room,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.960
but then I realized
that having two Venuses

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.030
in the same room
would be too much."

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.760
That's Jefferson
flirting with Abigail.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.380
He's really taken with Abigail.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.780
He never has met a woman
like her who knew so much

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.190
about literature, who had read
the same things he had read,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.850
Shakespeare, Milton.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.630
She could quote things
from memory,

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.760
and at the same time
was a household manager.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.970
And the combination to
him was just overwhelming.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.020
And he really is taken
with the Adams family.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.820
I think that's the point where
the two men really are close.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:03.400
And the bonds of
affection are really sealed.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.730
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: When
Jefferson is over there,

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.870
he asked to have his younger
daughter sent over to France

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.170
so he could meet with her.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.470
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:13.770
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: He hadn't
seen her in a couple years.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.070
The daughter didn't want to go,
but eventually they trick her

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.180
into going on a boat
and she's accompanied

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.020
by a young slave
whose name is --

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.580
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Sally Hemmings.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:28.690
And Sally Hemmings and
Polly come to London first.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.810
And Abigail takes
them in and hosts them

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.670
for a few weeks waiting
for Jefferson to come

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.560
to London to pick them up.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.190
But Jefferson doesn't do that,
much to Abigail's surprise.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:47.900
He sends another person, an
agent, to pick up his daughter.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.090
That's when Sally joins
the Jefferson household.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.390
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.690
She's 14 years old.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.990
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Very
young at that point.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.540
And presumably she's
one of these young women

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.050
who really blossomed in
the next couple of years.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.950
By the time she's 16,
she's a woman instead of --

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:09.250
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
The age of consent

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.010
in Virginia in those
days was 12.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.200
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, I don't
think there was much in terms

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.990
of consent needed in this case.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:22.170
But this is the relationship
with Sally as a concubine.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.070
And it's the Paris experience
that helps explain it.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:26.440
Because Sally came --

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.270
her brother was already
there, James.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.220
James Hemmings has been
brought over by Jefferson

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.990
to learn how to cook
French style.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.980
And he's going to come
back to Monticello

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.960
and become the chef
at Monticello.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:49.970
Being in France -- and James is
older than Sally, he's about 20.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.950
He realizes he can
walk out the door

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.210
and be free under French law.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.970
He uses that leverage
to negotiate a deal

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:02.830
with Jefferson that, "Look, I
will come back to Monticello

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.900
and train another servant,"
as Jefferson referred to them,

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:12.400
"to learn how to cook French
style, if you then free me."

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.450
Jefferson does that,
makes that deal.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:20.180
And presumably he makes the same
deal with James sister Sally.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.070
Which she does not
want to be freed,

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.760
but she wants her children
freed when they're adults.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.060
And that's the deal.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.230
As one of the Hemmings
boys, offspring,

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:37.020
Jefferson's offspring
says later in his memoir,

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.130
"The deal that my mother
made with Mr. Jefferson."

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.430
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
That's Madison.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.730
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Madison
Hemmings.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.300
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Did
Jefferson honor that commitment?

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.640
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Yes, he does.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.510
Of course, by that time, the law

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.580
in Virginia was they
were octoroons.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.260
That is the boys, the
Hemmings are octoroons.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.320
They're one-eighth black
and there's no one-drop rule

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.170
in Virginia at that point.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.770
And they are legally white.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.720
And so as you know
today, when the Hemmings

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.020
and Jefferson heirs
get together,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.960
many of the Hemmings heirs are
white and others are black.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.310
So some of the Hemmings
successors passed as white.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.790
They were only one-eighth white.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:33.880
Sally herself was a quadroon,
so she was the half-sister,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.330
if you can believe this,
of Jefferson's wife.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.900
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
In other words,

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.990
Sally Hemmings father
was a white slave owner,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.930
but he was also the father
of Jefferson's wife, right?

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.230
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Betty Hemmings.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.460
He's the father of
Jefferson's wife,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.360
but he also has a
concubine himself,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.680
Betty Hemmings who
was herself half.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.010
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.360
So some people say

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.870
when Jefferson saw
this 14-year-old girl,

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.830
he was seeing his
wife as a younger --

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.490
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well,
he could be.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.240
She may have resembled,
since she's the half-sister,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.540
she may have resembled.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.840
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So let's go back

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.180
to the Jefferson/Adams
relationship.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.850
So George Washington
is elected president

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.410
of the United States
unanimously,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.600
and John Adams is
elected vice president.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.900
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.840
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And this is in 1790.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.960
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: 1788 was
the election, and 1789.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.910
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Right, 1788, right.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.130
And they take office in 1789.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.430
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.210
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
Jefferson is still in France.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.300
He comes back and three months

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.880
after the election,
he's told what?

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.180
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, he finds

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.250
out that Washington has
appointed him secretary of state

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.330
without informing
him that he was going

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.640
to be secretary of state.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.790
And he takes the position.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.950
It's a great honor.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.830
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay, so
he becomes secretary of state.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.700
And eventually Jefferson falls

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.800
out with Washington
and he resigns.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.100
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.400
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Why did
he fall out with Washington?

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.530
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well,
he and Hamilton clash.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.550
They had very different views.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.900
Hamilton has a program to
makeover the United States

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.420
in the image of Great Britain,
a fiscal military state,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.960
a standing army with debt,
solving the debt problem

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.470
of consolidating the debt,
and making the United States

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.580
in time a nation that could take

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.980
on the European states
on their own terms.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.210
That's very different from
the vision that Jefferson has.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.310
He wants a very different
-- Jefferson is a radical,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:54.120
a liberal radical of the 18th
century who feels that armies

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.410
and war machines are dangerous.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:04.070
They lead to fighting and
they can only cause harm

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.130
to the international order.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:11.110
And so Jefferson is
as radical a liberal

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.610
as an elected official could be.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.790
He and Thomas Payne
do not differ one bit

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.120
in their ideas of government.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.240
Adams is a very different
kind of person.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.540
He's a conservative.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.780
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
Washington serves two terms

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.760
and decides not to
serve a third.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.110
He could serve presumably.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.410
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.560
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: There's
no prohibition at that time.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.310
So then who's running
for president then?

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.480
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well,
Adams assumes

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.110
that he would be the
natural successor,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:45.120
and he's a little surprised
to see the emerging new party,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.000
the Republican party
led by Madison

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.160
and Jefferson is the candidate.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.600
And Jefferson comes in
second in electoral votes.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.900
In those days the
party system was not --

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.460
we don't have the
12th Amendment.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.180
So the person that got the
most electoral votes gets

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.480
to be president.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.190
The person who gets the second
most electoral votes gets

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.800
to be vice president.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.990
And so you have this
awkward situation

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:15.210
where a federalist Adams is
president and a Republican,

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:19.560
an opposition party --
although these parties are not

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.970
like our modern parties --

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.910
the opposition party
is the vice president.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.210
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
In those days,

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.080
the vice president didn't
have that much to do,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.430
maybe preside over the Senate.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.140
But the Congress is only
meeting a couple months a year.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.750
So Jefferson really
doesn't spend

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.310
that much time with
Adams at all.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.610
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.120
At first Jefferson thought
that this was ideal.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.800
He actually differs to Adams.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.430
And he thought maybe this would
end the partisan conflict.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:50.810
And he writes a letter to
Adams more or less asking

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.110
for kind of accommodation.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.940
"Look, we can get
along and so on."

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.350
But he says, "I better show this
to my colleague James Madison."

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.770
And Madison says,
"Don't send that letter."

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:06.710
Madison is far shrewder in
that sense politically, says,

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.760
"That's going to cause
you embarrassment later

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.720
because this conflict between
us," meaning the Republicans

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.840
and the federalists,
"is not normal politics.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.680
That's going to become more
serious and that letter's going

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.290
to come back and haunt you."

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.920
So Jefferson does not send it.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.370
And he simply withdraws
from the government,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.670
does not get involved.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.180
And Adams comes to realize

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.750
that his fellow federalists
do not want Jefferson

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.690
or Madison involved in
the government at all.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.420
And you have a really serious
split between the two parties,

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.800
much more serious than
anything we have today,

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.530
as hard as that may
be to believe.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.830
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.540
So Adams is, like
most presidents,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.230
going to run for a second term.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.030
And he runs for a second
term and is it easy

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.120
for him to get elected again?

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.420
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: He assumed

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.670
that he would be easily
elected the way Washington was.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:05.290
But suddenly his
former friend ousts him.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.590
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Jefferson.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.870
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Jefferson
gets more electoral votes

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.960
and Adams is humiliated.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.040
He's furious.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.130
And he refuses to attend
Jefferson's inaugural and leaves

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.380
on a 4:00 stage that day.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.650
The only other person who did

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.830
that was John Quincy Adams
his son when he's ousted

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.280
after one term by
Andrew Jackson.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.000
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
Adams takes the carriage back

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.340
to Raintree, Massachusetts.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.640
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.940
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But how
long does that actually take

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.240
to get there in those days?

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.540
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Oh,
several days.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.840
A week or more.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.140
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.440
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Yeah.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.740
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So
Jefferson's president,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.040
Adams is stewing
in Massachusetts.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.340
Did they have any
conversation or correspondence

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.640
in that period of time?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.720
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: No,
not after 1800.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.320
So for eight years
they essentially had

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.620
no communication?

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.920
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.600
Well, Abigail writes in 1804
when Polly the young daughter

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.920
that she had hosted
in London dies.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.330
And so she had just lost a son,

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.190
so she's feeling very
sympathetic towards Jefferson.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.930
She writes a letter of
condolence to Jefferson.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:22.400
And Jefferson takes it
and I think assumes more

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.430
than he should have,
because he writes back a very

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.730
friendly letter.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.750
Except at the end of the letter
he says, "Look, your husband

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.820
and I have agreed on every
issue," which is not true.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.150
Jefferson was of course
notoriously disingenuous

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.890
in his correspondence
with people.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.580
He said, "We agreed
on almost everything.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.010
There's only one
thing that I objected

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.380
to in your husband's
administration,

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.110
and that was the appointment
of the midnight judges."

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: These
were judges right before Adams

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.320
left office.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.620
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.920
Adams is elected in November,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.390
but in those days the new
president did not take office

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.690
until March.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.030
So Adams in that interval
appoints a whole bunch

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.840
of judges including John Marshal

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.780
as the chief justice
of the Supreme Court.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.790
Jefferson and the
Republicans are furious

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.380
at those appointments,
and as soon as they get

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.940
into office they eliminate
this whole appellate system

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.240
that Adams had.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.010
But he makes that criticism.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.150
"That's the only thing, Mrs.
Adams, that I objected to."

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.920
Well, that's not
satisfactory to Abigail.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.410
She's furious.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.480
She comes back with an
attack on Jefferson,

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.770
defending her husband.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.370
And Jefferson writes back
trying to accommodate her.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.730
And she comes back even
harsher the next letter.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.900
And Jefferson throws up
his hands and gives up.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.020
If he had avoided that, I think
it might have led to something.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.630
If he avoided criticizing
Mr. Adams in any way,

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.840
Abigail might have
gotten her husband

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.480
into correspondence
with Jefferson.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.210
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Is
there any lingering animosity

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.230
because July the 2nd is not
considered the big day compared

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.530
to July the 4th?

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:07.830
Or that's not a problem?

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.130
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: No,
I don't think so.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:14.540
The problem comes when July the
4th and the Declaration itself,

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.290
the written document, takes
on enhanced importance.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.210
And that starts in the '90's.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.810
The break from England
which was the important part

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.090
in 1776 is irrelevant
by the 1790's.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.700
But what's important is
the second paragraph,

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.350
"All men are created
equal," and so on.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:37.050
That becomes the rallying
cry of the Republican party.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:42.700
And Jefferson is extolled as the
leader of the Republican party

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.100
who had written these
famous words.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.540
And Jefferson suddenly realizes,
well, this is really important.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.250
He had no idea in 1776 it
would become important.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.180
And so at this point in
the early 19th century,

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.240
he writes to his
son-in-law, "Look,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.010
the desk on which I wrote
the Declaration is going

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:06.310
to become a relic.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.610
I'm going to give it to you."

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.430
He realizes that this is
going to make him famous.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.730
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Wow.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.430
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: It really
is an extraordinary change.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.890
And of course it drives
John Adams jealous.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.620
I mean, he's so jealous
of this reputation

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.150
that Jefferson has acquired.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.450
And Jefferson of course lists

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:27.210
that as the first
accomplishment he wants posted

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.510
on his gravestone.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.030
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
So ultimately,

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.250
Jefferson finishes his
two terms as president

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.330
and he goes back to
Monticello, right?

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.630
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.990
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And then
somebody decides it would be a

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.530
good idea for Adams
and Jefferson

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.280
to kind of be friendlier.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.680
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Benjamin
Rush who is a mutual friend,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.990
though he's closer to Adams
than he is to Jefferson,

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.640
works two years to
bring these two men,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.080
these two patriots
back together.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.640
He thinks it's important for
the country that the northerner

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.020
and the southerner
should correspond.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:04.470
And he's the person
that made it possible

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.040
for them to come together.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:13.100
And finally he's saying, "He
loves you, he loves you."

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.020
And finally Adams
writes a letter

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.940
to Jefferson and breaks the ice.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.260
And then the letters flow
for the next 14 years.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:27.780
With Adams writing about two
to every one of Jefferson's.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.540
Jefferson's embarrassed by that
and Adams says, "Well, look,

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.060
you're probably busier
than I am."

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:39.270
So he asks him, "How many
letters did you receive

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.570
last year?"

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.870
And this is 1820.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:46.250
And Jefferson says, "Well, I
received 1,200 and something."

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.080
Adams is appalled
and embarrassed.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.840
He says, "I only received 120."

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.480
I mean one-tenth of what --

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:58.890
you see, Jefferson is an
international superstar already.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.980
He's corresponding with
the czar of Russia,

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:06.950
with Alexander Humboldt,
the great German naturalist.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.250
There's no comparison.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.720
Adams is in a different league,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.240
celebrity league,
than Jefferson.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.540
And that's still true.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.670
I mean, we have this great
monument in this city

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:21.000
to Jefferson right off the
tidal basin, right off the maw.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.750
Monticello is vised by hundreds

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.120
of thousands of people
every year.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.440
There's nothing like
that number that go

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.180
to Adams' home in Quincy.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.270
In fact, I found out recently
that during the offseason,

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.510
they close the place,
his home, on weekends.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.400
The National Park
Service runs it.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.280
The two men are in two
different spheres of celebrity,

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.690
and that was true then
and it's still true today.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.810
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Now 50 years to the day

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.570
after the Declaration of
Independence is agreed to,

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:03.110
both men are ill and
what happens to them?

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.980
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, as
everyone seems to know

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.650
or most people know, they died
on the same day, July 4th,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:17.470
the jubilee celebration,
50 years since 1776.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.940
And it's such a coincidence that
the nation can only conclude

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.240
that its providential.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.060
Of course, there's a
little bit of manipulation.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.330
These men are dying but they're
hanging on as best they can

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.320
because they know the
importance of July 4th.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.150
And Jefferson at one point says

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.220
to his physician,
"Is it the 4th yet?"

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.450
And he says, "No, sir,
it's only the 3rd."

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.010
And so Jefferson's got to
hang on a few hours more.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:42.310
[ Laughter ]

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:43.610
And Adams, the same thing.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.680
He wakes up and he
says, "Is this the 4th?"

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.980
And they said, "Yes, sir."

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.680
And so he's prepared.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.010
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: To some
extent they can engineer that.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.540
But they didn't take any
drugs as far as I know.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.460
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So when
Jefferson sends a letter

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.410
to Adams or Adams sends
a letter to Jefferson,

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.350
how long does it actually
take to get these letters?

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.650
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, a week.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
A week or so?

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.010
Okay. And when Jefferson
writes a letter,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.510
he has a way of keeping a copy.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.960
How does that work?

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.510
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, he had
a machine that he had worked

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:19.090
out where he would write
and it would be duplicated.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.360
Jefferson's a gadget man.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.580
And somebody who
loved that kind of --

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.140
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
What did Adams do?

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.440
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well, Adams,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.830
I think at one point he's having
somebody write letters for him.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.270
His eyes had become --

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.600
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: How
did he keep copies of them?

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.580
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: He would
have them copied over.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: I see.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.710
Now given your expertise
in so many areas,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.490
let's focus on the
Revolutionary War

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:43.790
in the time we have available.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.380
Let me ask you a
couple questions likely

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.310
on everybody's mind.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.080
Could we have won
the Revolutionary War

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.100
without George Washington?

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.800
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Well,
it's hard to think.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.220
I think we could have.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.240
I think someone else
would have emerged.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.100
But it would have
been difficult.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.830
I think more important was
Washington's presidency holding

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.510
the sectors together.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.540
The war probably
could have been won.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:13.280
I think the British after the
initial year really had an

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.060
impossible situation, trying to
fight a war 3,000 miles away.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.300
Rebellion of this
sort was similar

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.920
to what we faced in Vietnam.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.490
An insurgent population
is not easily put

00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:28.520
down when you're so far away.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.880
So I think the British were
doomed from the outset.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.180
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.480
Do you think they could have
won the war if they had done

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.780
or two things differently?

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.080
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: From the outset
they might have been able

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.690
to do it if they'd come in
harshly, but they didn't.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:42.980
They were conciliatory because
they kept thinking, "Well,

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.700
if we're too harsh, we won't
be able to bring them back.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.190
We have to win their
minds and hearts."

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.540
And that's not the
way to win war.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.150
And it simply didn't work.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.330
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now do you
think Jefferson and Washington

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.550
and Adams for that matter,
and maybe Benjamin Franklin,

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.120
are sitting in heaven saying,
"How come Hamilton has a play

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.030
about him and we have no play?"

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.040
[ Laughter ]

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.340
Was Hamilton really as important

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.680
as that play might
indicate, or not?

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Yeah, I
think one thing that's important

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.840
which we haven't emphasized

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.700
in this conversation is
how different Jefferson

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.210
and Adams were from each other.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.550
They differed on every single
major point you could think

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.080
of except for the
acceptance of the revolution.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.610
But the one thing they
had in common was a deep

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.110
and abiding hatred of
Alexander Hamilton.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.210
[ Laughter ]

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.260
Hamilton was important
in consolidating the debt

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.990
and getting that
solved at the outset

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.690
of Washington's administration.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.760
And that is crucial.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.680
Although that's not
Miranda's point.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.440
Miranda's emphasizing
his immigrant status.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.350
And of course he comes from
Nevis, the West Indies.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:55.550
He's not in that sense a
member of one of the colonies

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.810
that became part of
the United States.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.700
And for Adams, he makes
him out to be a foreigner.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.060
And some historians have
somehow mixed that up.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.580
Of course Nevis is a British
colony and so no different

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.670
from Massachusetts
as a British colony.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:14.970
So Hamilton is as much an
American as John Adams.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.460
But Adams liked to emphasize
that he was a bastard brat,

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.510
a foreign bastard brat.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.650
They hated Hamilton,
both of them.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.260
And that's one thing I
think they had in common.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.170
But everything else,
they differed.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.890
They differed on all
men are created equal.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.980
They differed on the
exceptionalism of America

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.340
which Jefferson created.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.650
He's the inventor of
American exceptionalism;

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.460
we are a special country

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.650
with a special role
to play in the world.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.370
Adams said, "That's nonsense.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:49.560
We are just as vicious, just
as corrupt as other nations."

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.910
And Jefferson's notion that
all men are created equal

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.240
which of course was the
Enlightenment notion --

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.540
it was conventional wisdom

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.100
for Enlightenment figures
-- Adams took it on.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:05.070
Adams took on every myth
that we have as Americans.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:09.290
He said the idea that we're all
created equal is just poppycock.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.430
And he tells Jefferson
and others, he said,

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:17.240
"I went to a founding hospital
in Paris and I saw babies

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.360
who were four days old and
already I saw the inequality.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.390
Some of these babies were
beautiful, some were ugly;

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:28.190
some were smart and some
were stupid at four days."

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.890
And so Adams is committed
to the notion of,

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:35.230
if we talk in modern
terms, nature not nurture.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.750
Jefferson and I think Americans
in general at the time,

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:42.250
the enlightened part of
Americans and today I think most

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.570
of us are committed to
the idea of nurture.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.200
Adams said, "Don't count on
education to change that.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.960
We're born unequal and
we will remain unequal.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.980
And education can't
do much about it."

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.470
That's not a very
American belief.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.260
Jefferson was committed to
the notion of education.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.980
So these two men differ
in fundamental ways

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.960
and represent two
different parts of America.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: The
sentence you referred to earlier

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.840
in the preamble

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.600
of the Declaration is probably
the most famous sentence

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.900
in the English language.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.200
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident."

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.500
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Right.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.800
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But what
did Jefferson really mean?

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.160
He never actually
said what he meant

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.460
by all men are created equal.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.780
He had several hundred slaves,

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.700
so how could he say all
men were created equal?

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.660
What did he really mean?

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:24.960
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: He
meant all white men.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.310
But that is not unique
to Jefferson.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.660
Enlightenment figures
at the time --

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.510
this is a serious rejection
of the [inaudible] regime

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.200
which of course was
committed to the notion of --

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.730
they didn't now about DNA.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.410
But they knew about inherited

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:43.320
because they had trained their
animals, if nothing else.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.280
They knew about inheritance
and they believed

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.390
in aristocracy running
in the blood.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:51.510
The Enlightenment is
rejecting that and saying

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.290
that that's not what counts.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.040
We are all the same at
birth, and any difference --

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.780
and of course they weren't blind
to the differences of adults.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.280
They said, "Of course everyone's
different, but that's due

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.070
to different environments, being
raised in different worlds.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:10.810
And if we can somehow get
the education straight,

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.330
we will become more equal."

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.140
And this is what
Adams challenges.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.710
I mean, that belief
is fundamental

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:22.110
to our Americanism I think,
that Jeffersonian belief

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:26.890
which is what gives him
his spot in our pantheon.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.610
Adams was taking that on.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:31.880
He took that on directly
and he took on the notion

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.510
of American exceptionalism.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.070
So he's a deep conservative

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.970
but not a Ronald
Reagan conservative.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.350
He's sour and cynical
about human nature.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.210
He doubts democracy.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.640
He says, "Sooner or later
our elections will become

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.420
so partisan, so corrupt that
we will have to have the Senate

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.940
and the president
serve for life.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.240
And eventually they'll have

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.730
to become hereditary the way
the English have the House

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.940
of Lords and the king."

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.250
So he's not a part of
the American mainstream,

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:07.760
but he's realistic, he's
cynical and he is a believer

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.120
in what he calls stubborn facts.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.420
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
If you had a chance

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.970
to ask John Adams one question
and Jefferson one question,

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.720
what would you ask them?

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.020
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: What I'd
like to know about Jefferson,

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.650
why didn't you ever admit

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.120
that Sally Hemmings
was your concubine?

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.840
Because other planters did.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.960
They recognized their offspring
by giving them presents

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.880
at Christmas and so on.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.490
Jefferson has nothing like that.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.360
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: He was
accused of this at the time,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.660
but he never admitted
it, never denied it.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.840
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: He never admits
it and indirectly denies it.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:44.530
But he enters the birth of these
offspring in his farm book along

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.990
with new heifers and new pigs.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.160
Child born of Sally Hemmings.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.710
That's in his farm book.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.500
Those are his offspring.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.790
He's pretty brutal about that.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Right.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.390
What would you ask Adams?

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.040
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: That's
a good question.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.470
Why did he want to
get reconciled

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.770
with Thomas Jefferson?

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.780
I think that would be
an interesting question.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.080
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.190
And if you could summarize
in 30 seconds what you would

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.470
like all Americans to know
about the Revolutionary War,

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.620
what would be the most
important thing they should know

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.920
about the Revolutionary War?

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.350
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Look, it's
the most important event

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.060
in American history, bar none.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.850
It created, not only legally
created the United States,

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:30.720
but it infused into our
culture all our noblest ideals

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.020
and aspirations.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.200
All men are created equal,
liberty, pursuit of happiness.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.500
Think of that phrase.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.880
I just read the speech by
Napal on the universal truth

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.170
and he focuses on that phrase.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:47.710
He says that's an
unbelievable phrase,

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:51.350
that individuals have the
right to pursue happiness.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.650
Think about that.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.350
So the Revolution
creates those ideals.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.490
And that's why it's
such an important event.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:02.190
That's what Lincoln used to
get through the Civil War.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.080
And if we forget the Revolution,
then we're in trouble.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.100
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So if you'd
like to learn more about this,

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.060
Friends Divided, John Adams and
Thomas Jefferson by Gordon Wood.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.360
Thank you very much.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.660
&gt;&gt; Gordon Wood: Thanks, David.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.960
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Thank you.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.000
