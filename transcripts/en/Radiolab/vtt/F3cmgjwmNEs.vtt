00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.430
You are listening to radiolab radio, w.

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:10.020
N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
Who's The gentlemen we're on the air with? Not, oh,

4
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.730
there's going to be two of us. So one of them his name Jab, that's not me.

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.900
His name is Jad like his parents call him his Jad. Jad ? but it's Jad really?

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.300
Had they been drinking? No, they live in eas. Oh, sorry.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.570
So, uh, we're going to begin the show with this delightful duo. I'm Julie.

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.290
Julie Moss. I'm Wendy, Wendy Ingram. Hi Julia. Hi Wendy. Hi. Jad.

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.450
They've been friends for a really long time.

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.630
I remember that one time you bought all that. Everything in a tube.

11
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.780
They both like to travel.

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.040
They both like to shop and they both like to run really long distances until

13
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:51.200
they collapsed, usually in front of millions of people. Now, Wendy,

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.770
Wendy was a classic athlete from day one who was apparently born this way.

15
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:57.710
Her mother tells me how she had to channel her energy into sports.

16
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.340
I always considered myself a science project.

17
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.530
What do you mean we, we'd been created. We have the hand speed.

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.000
We have a mind, we have lungs, we have a heart. Let's see what it can do.

19
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.510
Wendy were very opposite in that respect. Julie,

20
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.590
Julie is an entirely different story and we're going to tell you that story in

21
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:21.620
just a moment. But first we should say this is radio lab. I'm Chad Apple,

22
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.400
I'm rob and I'm Robert Krulwich. The topic today is limits,

23
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.560
limits of the body,

24
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.220
rest right there in the limits of the brain and finally the limits of what we

25
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:33.260
can know about everything.

26
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.441
Julie,

27
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:39.740
how did you get interested in this race that you're about to tell us about?

28
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.070
Was it like a, like an impulse or something? Well, no,

29
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:47.300
it was a requirement to graduate. I had, I had to do a,

30
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.700
it's called a senior senior project.

31
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:54.050
I went to cal poly San Luis Obispo in California and I, I was a PE major,

32
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:57.800
which now I think this is, yeah, and I that was just by default.

33
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.720
I was a California surfer girl.

34
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:04.721
I started surfing at 14 but I needed a senior project and there I was in um,

35
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.730
1981. Yeah,

36
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.730
<v 1>watching TV instead of studying. Then</v>

37
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.650
<v 0>[inaudible] comes ABC wild girls</v>

38
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.880
<v 1>is brought to you by Anheuser voice</v>

39
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.570
<v 0>from Hawaii and I watched it and it just sucked me in.</v>

40
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.160
This must have been like really early ironman. Oh yeah.

41
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:32.330
I think it was the fourth one and I thought it's in Hawaii. It's great.

42
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.560
I know my mom will pay for it because this,

43
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.470
I have to do this project for school and so I started doing research on it and

44
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.750
this, just so we know this is you, you, you swim, you bike, you run.

45
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:44.660
That's the order. You swim 2.4 miles,

46
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.400
you ride 112 miles and then you run a marathon. So it was,

47
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.323
wait a second though,

48
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.650
that seems like a major decision to want to go 140 I mean were you at triathlete

49
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.950
type person at that point in your life? Had you ran a marathon before?

50
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.420
It was conceptual. Those were just the distances. Those were numbers.

51
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.650
That wasn't reality.

52
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.770
It was just you were in Hawaii by the time I got off the plane to do the iron

53
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.051
man,

54
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.980
I still hadn't completed the total distance that I need to do on the bike or the

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.150
swam. Oh my gosh. Wow. But I wasn't going over there to be competitive.

56
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.260
I was going over there to do this event, have fun in Hawaiian,

57
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.160
then I'll write up some sort of bogus, you know,

58
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.660
physiological consequences or something. But I really,

59
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.060
I thought I was taking the easy way out.

60
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.220
When you got off the bus or you walked into the room where the other ones were,

61
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.410
did you suddenly think, oh yeah. I mean, people were taking it very seriously.

62
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.600
People had coordinated outfits and I thought,

63
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.020
I'm feeling a little like, um, the country mouse, you know? So I,

64
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:50.870
I think when race day rolled around, it was,

65
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.420
it was sort of my day to get through and never do again. I mean,

66
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.910
that was really, this is a onetime thing. So let's see. Shall we run the race?

67
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.230
Yeah. So, okay, let's just,

68
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.720
you do the first two legs to swimming and then the biking.

69
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.440
I'm doing really well. You see me on the bike. I'm riding along.

70
00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:10.070
I mean from the old coverage of ABC. I'm smiling at the camera.

71
00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:12.260
I'm certainly not in an aerodynamic position.

72
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.820
Why would you want to be all crouched over when you keep the sitting up smiling?

73
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.320
That was your beauty queen too. I was doing parade waves.

74
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:24.380
I really was loving the attention and um,

75
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.190
I had a snickers bar early on the bike ride and I keep thinking if I'd only

76
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.630
eaten that snickers bar instead of throwing it away,

77
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.820
ABC came up on a camera on there.

78
00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:39.050
I was trying to open this melted snickers bar with my teeth and all of a sudden

79
00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:40.670
there's a camera and it's like, oh my gosh,

80
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.690
I don't want to be messy on national TV. So I ditched this,

81
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.020
this beautiful snickers bar and you know, yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.860
<v 2>Okay. Skipping to the third leg of the race. Julie's through the swim.</v>

83
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:59.090
She's through the 112 mile bike ride onto the marathon.

84
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.560
<v 0>I came off the bike, uh, they told me there's a woman ahead of you at a,</v>

85
00:05:03.561 --> 00:05:08.170
she was a top notch cyclist. Oh. So you were in second place? Yeah. Whoa, Whoa,

86
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.670
Whoa, whoa. I was doing really well.

87
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:15.570
And I started on the run and the one gal who had had a great bike ride had a,

88
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.950
an Achilles injury and sure enough, five, I think about eight miles or so,

89
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:23.160
I caught her and there I am in the lead. Wow.

90
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.290
And all of a sudden it was a little, um, things started to shift.

91
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.970
<v 2>Um, I'm, I'm good at something</v>

92
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.270
<v 0>and somebody trying to take it away from me.</v>

93
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.630
And that was the woman who was in second place, Kathleen McCartney.

94
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.550
And even though she was a mile away,

95
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.210
it felt like she was breathing down my neck and trying to take something that

96
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:51.280
now I was becoming very attached to.

97
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.600
I was also starting to fall apart physically. What were those early signs?

98
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.870
I'm cramping and a feeling that you weren't digesting your food,

99
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.380
that everything was sort of sitting there, sloshing around Wendy's laughing.

100
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.560
If she's good, this is serious moment and she's laughing about

101
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.340
<v 1>mini case. Finally,</v>

102
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:15.290
Julie makes it to the last little advt stretch of the race. Probably about, oh,

103
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:20.240
about 400 meters from the finish and she's still in first place. Julie,

104
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.660
let's do this. I'm actually, as we're talking, I'm watching you on a Youtube,

105
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.560
oh stinker. But I joined to take me into your head

106
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.560
<v 0>these final moments cause it's, it's just like,</v>

107
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:35.890
it's unwatchable but you can't turn away. Yeah, it's a train wreck.

108
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.040
<v 3>So I'm looking at you now and you're running and it's dark as people like on</v>

109
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.510
both sides cheering you until you're running and then you're slowing down

110
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.000
and you really slowing down and you're looking a little bit like you're on

111
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:55.200
stilts and then great here.

112
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.450
Your legs give out. They give out.

113
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.980
<v 1>And I couldn't get back up.</v>

114
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.150
I mean I thought get up and my legs wouldn't work.

115
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.280
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

116
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.060
<v 1>So I actually, I sort of laid there on the ground and um,</v>

117
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.990
I figured out if I put my arms in front of me and leaned on my arms,

118
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:26.190
they would sort of form like a tripod and I could sort of lean on my arms,

119
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:28.600
can kind of got one leg up and one leg up and,

120
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.280
and kind of staggered to a walk and started walking again.

121
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.390
All right, now you're walking again, but you're like drunk monkey. Yeah.

122
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.370
Really wobbly. Yeah. No.

123
00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:45.300
All this time your conscious that number two is getting closer and closer.

124
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.640
Are you, are you, are you conscious of her at all? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

125
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.480
I had to keep finding a way to keep going and my thought was this is mine.

126
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.920
Oh, you just fell again. Oh yeah, yeah.

127
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.820
See this is the one that gets me right here.

128
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.710
You fall down and it's in your arms. Go back. It's like you're dying. Yeah.

129
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.580
And um,

130
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:13.600
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

131
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.780
<v 1>as I was putting one hand in front of the other, I saw this,</v>

132
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.700
this pair of tennis go by and a these legs and I thought that's her.

133
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.900
She's gone by me

134
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.560
<v 0>and it was just, I just thought I quit.</v>

135
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.090
I just thought, I can't say it on national public radio, but effort,

136
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.610
effort and all of a sudden

137
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.970
there's this voice that just said, get up, get up,

138
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.830
just keep moving forward.

139
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.210
I could see the finish line about 10 feet in front of me and I thought Getta I

140
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:57.180
cannot, I can't get up again. I really, I'd get up, do not think like I've,

141
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:01.560
I've sort of worn out that tactic. Get up, but I can crawl,

142
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.690
<v 1>I crawl. And so here I am coming along and, and the TV,</v>

143
00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:14.690
camera lights are blinding me and no one's helping her.

144
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.530
My life was going to be different. I mean I felt my life changing.

145
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.530
I made a deal with myself. A deal was struck and I don't care if it hurts,

146
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.850
I don't care if it's messy, I don't care how it looks. I would finish,

147
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.193
I would finish

148
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:34.740
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

149
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.360
<v 1>so Julie Moss crawls the last 10 feet of the race, literally an inch at a time.</v>

150
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.100
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

151
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.050
<v 1>that whole time the cameras are on her and they capture everything.</v>

152
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:50.810
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

153
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.480
<v 1>and I mean everything. Yeah. I, um,</v>

154
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.200
I pooped my pants on national TV. It doesn't get more shameful.

155
00:09:57.201 --> 00:09:59.450
The firm that Wendy teases me all the time, you know,

156
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:02.930
you were chocolate mess from war, you know, one way or the other.

157
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.880
You can get up here,

158
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.250
<v 0>do this next thing. But it was, it was a,</v>

159
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.780
it was a pivotal moment in my life and to the stage. Julie says,

160
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.160
the person she is now,

161
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.380
it all began with that voice that, uh,

162
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.950
that dye hadn't ever called upon that just said, keep moving forward. Well,

163
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.750
that's the thing that gets to me is like, it didn't say to you, you can't, it,

164
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.090
it actually said exactly the opposite. I isn't that cool.

165
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.970
I would have thought it would have said, stop. Come on down.

166
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.870
<v 2>I don't, that's true.</v>

167
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.960
<v 0>Ego. That's your ego that will come in and sabotage your real self.</v>

168
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.960
There is no limit. No, I really believe that. Uh, and I does.

169
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.250
I absolutely do. No, no limit. Nope.

170
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.880
<v 2>[inaudible] nope. [inaudible] nope.</v>

171
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.990
[inaudible] yeah. Now

172
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.130
let's take seriously what Julian Mazda said. Ah, no limits.

173
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.470
I think she meant to psychologically back that. Yes.

174
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.070
I mean they are obviously limits. If she would, well, yes, they could die.

175
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.930
You could die. Yeah, but short of that,

176
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:22.950
you would say it is her muscles that are determining the limits. Right, exactly.

177
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.430
And the sale, your muscles sale. Yeah. Let's just question that for a second.

178
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.500
Let me introduce you to it.

179
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.550
<v 0>His name is a, what's his name? David Jones. His name is David Jones.</v>

180
00:11:33.551 --> 00:11:35.160
Hi. Hi. Matt. Tim.

181
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.800
He's retired physiologist and Metropolitan University and he's got a slight

182
00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:41.800
condition that interferes with his speech, just so you know. Okay. Anyways,

183
00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:42.634
he did a study,

184
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.390
two studies actually that involve bikers and he's on experiments likeness.

185
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.850
He'll have these people ride stationary bikes for really long distances. Yeah.

186
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.090
All the while he'll shoot their muscles full of sugar, like with an Ivy

187
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.930
<v 4>[inaudible] actioning it extremely high levels of glucose in the blood.</v>

188
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.310
How much this look like a whole energy drinks worth of sugar straight into their

189
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:07.210
blood. Oh, more than that. [inaudible] several energy drinks. Oh No.

190
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:07.901
Theoretically,

191
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:10.960
if it's your muscles that are controlling how far and fast you bike,

192
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.000
you should get this injection and just be like,

193
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.290
I shouldn't be performing miracles. That's fine. But it never works.

194
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.270
It never works. Yeah. The people who,

195
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.780
who have sugar in their muscles do the same as people who don't. That's not,

196
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.430
it doesn't work at all in their difference in performance. Whoa.

197
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.750
Bad News for sugar.

198
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.160
And what it suggests is that our muscles have way less to do with our limits

199
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:36.850
than we think, which raises the obvious question. What is making the difference?

200
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.100
So now I'm going to tell you about the second study, which I completely like,

201
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.610
find mind blowing. Oh, that's a hard study to summarize, but I'm gonna try.

202
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.970
Okay. You say you with me, with you so far, you haven't started yet by that.

203
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:51.780
Totally a good place to be. I need your full, uh, participation and interest.

204
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:52.500
Okay.

205
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.800
So he does a study where he puts a bunch of bikers on bikes and he has them

206
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.810
peddle a lot, is about 40 kilometers, long distance. He's got two groups.

207
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.210
Each group gets an energy drink,

208
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.040
which they sort of have to drink while biking while biking,

209
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:10.100
except that they don't drink it. The rule is they don't actually drink it.

210
00:13:10.101 --> 00:13:13.760
They just swish it in their mouth and suspension out swish and spit.

211
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.320
That's right. That's what they do. Swish, spit, bike, swish, spit by.

212
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.950
Wouldn't want to be the towel guy in this particular experiment.

213
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.230
Well have scientists with buckets who just stand next to them anymore.

214
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.410
I spent him an apartment. Okay,

215
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.710
so half the people get real energy drink to swish and spit.

216
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.140
Yeah.

217
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.940
Half the people get fake energy drink to swish and spit and I kind of tastes the

218
00:13:34.941 --> 00:13:37.880
same and nobody knows who's getting what the normal line.

219
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.220
So you would think in this scenario that nobody should get any benefit from this

220
00:13:43.221 --> 00:13:46.340
because no one's actually drinking the drink, nothing's getting into the body.

221
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.330
Or let's say like the taste creates a placebo effect.

222
00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:52.460
Well then everybody should get the placebo effect equal.

223
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:56.090
Everybody should get it. But here's the thing. Only the people who switched,

224
00:13:56.091 --> 00:14:00.350
switched, not drank, but switched the real energy drink got a boost.

225
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:04.580
Oh, how much of a boost in seven minutes? A couple of minutes. Whoa.

226
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.910
That's a lot. Yeah, a minutes. All right. Just demonstrating. Yeah.

227
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.660
Finishing Snelson last. Yeah, so let me think here. Big.

228
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.980
Don't say anything for a minute. Let me think.

229
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.630
So maybe some thing in the first set of athletes who got the real drink,

230
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:25.600
something inside the new something.

231
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.730
Here's the big theory. Do you want a little theory of the big one first? Well,

232
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:36.130
I liked the big theory briefly. Okay. The big one briefly.

233
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.850
There's an idea that's been floating around for a while called the central

234
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:42.790
governor theory, which has it inside your head.

235
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:45.730
There's this little circuit which you're starting to see on brain scans.

236
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.790
There's this little circuit that governs your energy supply and when it feels

237
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.100
like you're in danger of running

238
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.140
<v 0>low, it'll trigger signals paint</v>

239
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.200
to be sent to your body to try and get you to rest.

240
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.780
Now with scientists are finding is that this governor circuit is really

241
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:06.614
conservative.

242
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.730
It'll send you a pain to try and get you to stop way before you are out of

243
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.080
juice. So with your a fuel tank, they would flash e e for empty,

244
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:19.130
but you got a quarter tank left. So what might be happening with these bikes

245
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.140
<v 5>curse is it the sugar is landing on their tongue,</v>

246
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.670
the tongue sees the sugar, sends a message to the brain.

247
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.970
The governors sees this message and says, Oh, if we're about to get some energy,

248
00:15:33.971 --> 00:15:37.350
then it's okay for you to spend some energy and let me just give you some from

249
00:15:37.351 --> 00:15:40.930
my secret stash over here. And so you feel a boost.

250
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.840
<v 0>[inaudible] the conjecture here is you have a reservoir of extra stuff,</v>

251
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.100
but it is so deeply disguised that you can't even know that it's there.

252
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.540
And to skip to the punchline, when you

253
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.730
<v 5>feel tired, Mr k [inaudible] not just tired.</v>

254
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.460
When you are dead spent. Well you are spent. Yeah,

255
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.890
which does not feel like a subjective thing at all.

256
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:10.220
That feels like an objective reality. You are done. Well in fact,

257
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:11.960
at that moment, maybe you're not.

258
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.920
Maybe you're just feeling the effects of that little governor lying to you.

259
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.370
<v 4>Oh, which raises the question, what if you could live back to her</v>

260
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:21.740
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

261
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.480
<v 4>then how far could you go? So with all that in mind,</v>

262
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.650
I'm going to kick it up a notch.

263
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.420
Let me tell you about this competition called the ride across America.

264
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.340
It should really be called the ride into the hell fire depths of despair,

265
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.320
but we're going to call it a the ride across quite the zing that the sponsor

266
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:46.610
wanted. Brian [inaudible] Wrigley's spirit with go.

267
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.730
We heard about this first from a reporter named Daniel Coyle.

268
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.040
So what is the right across America?

269
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.130
It is basically, it's an insane event. You,

270
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.130
you'd get on a bike in California and you bike across the country, 3000 miles,

271
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.690
the equivalent of four Mount Everest.

272
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.740
And they don't sleep at all. No. They will sleep.

273
00:17:08.741 --> 00:17:11.860
They'll sleep a an hour a day, two hours a day.

274
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.760
Hour a day. Yeah. So if, if this is a 10 day race,

275
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:20.590
they will sleep for 10 hours over the full length of the race. Yeah.

276
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.710
It's a race that is designed to reveal what human limits are.

277
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.810
Who Does it? Can you describe the kinds of people who are attracted to this? No,

278
00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:35.170
I think they come from all walks of life. They come from all over the globe.

279
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.530
It's a really interesting cross section. We actually got curious about this.

280
00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:41.860
So we sent our producer, Lulu Miller to track down a few of these guys.

281
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:45.430
Two guys. Who'd you find? Well, the first one? Yes.

282
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.040
His name is Patrick Patrick [inaudible]. I'm 47 years old from France. He's the

283
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.330
<v 7>rookie. Had you done any kind of long distance cycling before? No. No,</v>

284
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.380
not at all. He's actually a scientist. [inaudible] yeah, got a wife. Two kids.

285
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.670
Okay. And then we've got the champion. Okay. A hell of you right here.

286
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.620
So this is Uri Robeck.

287
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.720
He's won this thing four times and on the back he's a killer.

288
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.500
<v 6>My body, it's, I can go.</v>

289
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.000
So in the rain or cold or the heat job and see the soldier implied by a

290
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.690
Slovenian army. What else? What would you like to know? Okay,

291
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.000
<v 7>2005 wow.</v>

292
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.050
This start with [inaudible] in San Diego. Touch name

293
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.390
like 20 people or a hundred people.

294
00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:35.380
20 private things to the tape you're getting right now is actual footage from

295
00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:37.960
that deck? Not Backdrop. Turned out the year he did it,

296
00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:38.980
there was actually a film crew.

297
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.190
They're following every single ride and so I was really scared and scared that

298
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.500
him not Uri though. No, he's just in front of Patrick. I really,

299
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.280
uh, I've seen English. Uh, I'm leery shoring myself.

300
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.113
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

301
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.970
<v 8>then the racism, it's easy. You just start your engine and go.</v>

302
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.490
For me and seaside, they didn't know what to expect.

303
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.690
I was very consultative.

304
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.090
<v 9>I have to back up the back</v>

305
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:23.860
14 states, 3000 miles to go. They don't go very fast.

306
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.220
They'll cross the country going about 13, 14 miles an hour,

307
00:19:27.221 --> 00:19:31.990
which any 11 year old couldn't ride for a Taco. The difference

308
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.330
<v 7>is that they just told stop seven hours later.</v>

309
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.660
California desert, it's really hot.

310
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.300
My Watch says 109 degrees. We're in the shade and the car.

311
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:46.920
Steve Toady,

312
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.820
the camera guy following Patrick in a van hydros out here climbing a hill.

313
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.860
I've never experienced this kind of temperature. You have [inaudible] 10 finite,

314
00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.920
then 150 miles later,

315
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.370
<v 9>Arizona running hills since it</v>

316
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.150
200 300 million.

317
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.780
Then the sun is rising for

318
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.150
500 UTA, it's 10 very hot.

319
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.990
<v 7>Okay. Correct.</v>

320
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.190
<v 9>The mountains, the big mountains, you're using the lead,</v>

321
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.730
he's just crested the top of the 12 mile climb.

322
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:36.140
It was during the middle of the night. It was just raining,

323
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.970
heavy rain and he begins to coast downward sanding without battling

324
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.180
and after two kilometers I was completely frozen,

325
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.680
shaking like I was electric in your bet is like a hamburger. Yeah.

326
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.220
I mean it's all red. You don't have any skin at all.

327
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.990
I mean the bike is the most efficient machine for creating suffering ever.

328
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:06.100
And the pressures on your hands, the pressure is on your neck.

329
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.090
This is this British guy named Chris Hopkinson.

330
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.470
Halfway through the race and his neck just given out.

331
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.340
People who's next have given out. We'll take duct tape

332
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.350
and literally tie their heads up. They'll,

333
00:21:22.351 --> 00:21:25.390
they'll put a quarter to the back of their helmet and then pin it,

334
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.620
say to their belt, Jesus, God. So that they can look, cause they're,

335
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:30.880
they can no longer hold their heads up.

336
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.630
<v 7>The paint is like waves,</v>

337
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.880
<v 9>you know, and I don't know why he's dead, but it is,</v>

338
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.030
it's like waste. It's calming. Candy's going.

339
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.580
[inaudible] he's going to lose assuming that the central governor circuits

340
00:21:47.911 --> 00:21:50.730
inside the heads of all these writers are creating those waves of pain.

341
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.630
How do they soldier on? How do they ignore it? Well, I ask them that and

342
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.300
<v 7>they each sort of have different techniques. So Patrick</v>

343
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.620
<v 9>just start shouting back at it literally. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

344
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.520
<v 7>And Uri, well he gets his crew to come up alongside him and Blair</v>

345
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.020
<v 8>[inaudible] y'all go to speakers? Yeah.</v>

346
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.640
Is that what we're hearing? It is. This is him on his bike during the race.

347
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.010
Singing along

348
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.720
<v 7>works for awhile, but then they hit the halfway point.</v>

349
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.770
I don't know if you've been to, Ken says, I don't know. It's awful.

350
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.340
Scenery gets really monotonous and you don't have any sightseeing,

351
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.750
nothing more than that.

352
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.340
They've gone over a thousand miles without sleeping basically.

353
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.210
Then that's where we see the sort of really interesting stuff start to happen.

354
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.700
It's here that we can catch a glimpse of the hidden potential of the human body.

355
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.610
If you've done everything, if you've handled the heat and hydration,

356
00:23:01.611 --> 00:23:05.570
if your infrastructure is solid, all the stress goes to the last point,

357
00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:07.760
which is the mind it,

358
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.760
Ken's very suddenly twas Doc.

359
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.820
I were in a forest and very quickly the environment got very um,

360
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.710
accuracy. He said he saw shadows running across the road.

361
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.110
It looked like the trees were trying to reach out to get him.

362
00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.230
I was starting to have nightmares, but I was awake.

363
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.740
These kinds of hallucinations are just a fact of the race.

364
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.500
People seeing secret code in the cracks of the road,

365
00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:37.250
riders jumping off their bikes to square off and fight mailboxes,

366
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:41.330
and it's what breaks a lot of people. Strangely,

367
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.830
these kinds of hallucinations might be the very key to Yuri's.

368
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.090
I saw everything.

369
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.290
I mean a lot of like monsters like zombies,

370
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.830
he's gonna attack, you know, and why would that help him? Well, me,

371
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.740
it was really think about why the central governor's in place,

372
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:02.330
the system that's designed to always keep an emergency stash of energy there for

373
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:03.560
you. Should you ever need it.

374
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:08.030
So those feelings of pain are really just a way of safeguarding that last little

375
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:11.930
stash of energy that you could use if you absolutely had to. Yeah.

376
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:13.700
Like if your life was on the line or something, that's right.

377
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:18.110
But what if you are convinced and therefore your central governor was convinced

378
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.480
that your life really was on the line

379
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.140
that year when you got to Ohio, he,

380
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.320
he hallucinated that there were Lucia hot dean's or Afghan horsemen chasing him.

381
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.230
Yeah, with a gun or be the shot gun. And I said to two bikers to your face,

382
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.950
they had a shooting guard. Come on, come on to something.

383
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.370
We are soldiers did something to this idea or attack.

384
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.190
The interesting thing about that is that is the way in which his team sees him

385
00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:49.330
hallucinating. Lose your Heidi and their reaction is, oh yeah,

386
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.930
we see them to go on you. Are you mind? We might escape. Why?

387
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.260
Because they're gaining on us. They're getting on it. It's funny. I know,

388
00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:57.970
but for me it was not funny.

389
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:05.310
They will use his hallucination as as fuel and they make no bones about it.

390
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.030
And when you see that, that's Matiaz planning check Uris, crew chief,

391
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:14.040
<v 4>when you see him riding that fast after five, six days almost dying on the bike,</v>

392
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.020
and then suddenly he explodes,

393
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.220
your hair on your arm would go up on your neck would go up. And then, you know,

394
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.830
that's, that's why we are there because it's,

395
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.230
you don't want to miss that moment because this is something out of this world.

396
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.860
<v 7>[inaudible] says that during the hallucinations, I mean, the pain is gone.</v>

397
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.830
Does it go, does it go away completely? Yeah.

398
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.950
But the tradeoff is that when he watches videos of himself like this punching

399
00:25:41.321 --> 00:25:44.320
mailboxes and throwing his bike into a ditch, he says,

400
00:25:44.321 --> 00:25:46.210
it's actually painful to watch.

401
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.260
<v 4>You know, it's really tough for me to look in myself in this videos,</v>

402
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:55.820
in these films. Uh, how do I maybe or is going,

403
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.630
the reality is he's looking at a madman. It's not to me, that's,

404
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.550
that's not me.

405
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.170
<v 7>Yeah. Let's see. Now I'm thinking like Daniel,</v>

406
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.450
like if madness is the key,

407
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.340
right to tricking your central governor and to giving you access to that,

408
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.373
did that energy,

409
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.530
does that mean that if Robert and I went mad in this particular way that we

410
00:26:17.531 --> 00:26:20.680
would suddenly be really athletic? I mean,

411
00:26:20.681 --> 00:26:23.160
are there actually seriously cases like that? Well,

412
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.920
there was actually in the early 19 hundreds there was a doctor named August beer

413
00:26:26.921 --> 00:26:31.921
who noticed a mental patient making a leap in an asylum and he measured the leap

414
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.460
and it compared rather favorably to the world record at the time. What? Yeah,

415
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.830
and he was one of the early sort of propagators of this governor theory that Oh,

416
00:26:41.831 --> 00:26:45.870
obviously this patient from whom all the sort of governors had been lifted was

417
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:48.840
capable of, um, a feat of astounding strength.

418
00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.040
<v 10>Absolutely. What happened at the end of the race? Well,</v>

419
00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.750
<v 11>he wins. I want to ram</v>

420
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.650
it. 17 and what about that?

421
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.020
<v 7>Well, let's rewind a couple of days.</v>

422
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.500
He's just crossed the halfway point Mount Vernon, Kansas,

423
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.450
and he decides to hop off his bike, take a quick break, and he's in the van.

424
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.410
He checks his email just to give me some motivation and he sees an email from

425
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.310
one of his friends.

426
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.090
<v 12>He said, we're so sad that, uh, the Dr Breedlove accident,</v>

427
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.530
Patrick had no idea

428
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.190
<v 7>what this guy was talking about,</v>

429
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.070
but it appeared to suggest that one of the 25 riders,

430
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.810
a guy named Dr Bob Breedlove,

431
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.450
<v 12>I had just been hurt. And so I asked one of my crew member, uh,</v>

432
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.930
what happened was Dr Breedlove and he said, well,

433
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.600
he got an accident and he died

434
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.520
on the rate during the race. Yeah.

435
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.040
And so when he's, when he's, when he told me this, I mean,

436
00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.060
immediately I was, I was, I mean, I was, I was, I mean that, I mean,

437
00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.770
nothing is shocked, but I was done. I understand. Patrick.

438
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.410
I feel bad too, obviously.

439
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:10.700
And so it has happened, Steve, today, the commandment tried to push me both.

440
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.580
It would be pointless to, to stop here where you have a wide shoulder,

441
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:19.630
a van right behind you, who's going to, to [inaudible] and to, oh,

442
00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:23.190
well, sorry. But a petri just fall down the road.

443
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:26.520
And so he's hospitalized or, or even even, even worst.

444
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.060
I have kids and a voice I went to, I went to found this fish.

445
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.200
I understand Patrick put how far the next time station. Why don't we go there?

446
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.390
[inaudible] dead. I don't want to continue that.

447
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:43.110
That's so sad. That's okay. I don't want to continue that. I'm just saying,

448
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.280
let's not throw in the towel just yet. Okay. So after that, I mean, uh,

449
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.360
I started writing again. [inaudible]

450
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.610
<v 9>but, uh, for them</v>

451
00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.590
it was a magical night is very, uh, very well, a beautiful night,

452
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.650
<v 12>no class, nothing.</v>

453
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.950
<v 7>And there's always this Cruz cheering him on, trying to pump them up.</v>

454
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.980
<v 11>Yes. Patrick, can I ask you why you're doing this?</v>

455
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.400
Can I ask you a question or don't you want to talk?

456
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.490
Why are you doing this?

457
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.210
But he's not saying anything back for hours.

458
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.200
<v 9>[inaudible] around one in the morning, Patrick says, his mind</v>

459
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.840
<v 12>just goes quiet, completely silent.</v>

460
00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.300
<v 4>Out of that silence, he said he heard a voice that said simply</v>

461
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.420
<v 9>you'll step step.</v>

462
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.950
<v 4>So that's what I did. I said, yeah,</v>

463
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.870
<v 12>I'm done. I'm done.</v>

464
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.770
You asked me a question on here. Remember why? How was it doing that? Yeah.

465
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.820
Because I just went, is this my name?

466
00:30:08.821 --> 00:30:13.821
It physically and mentally and I touched twice this week.

467
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.980
Yesterday morning and this morning I don't want to leave that again and uh,

468
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.690
<v 9>I quit. That's it.</v>

469
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.533
Huh?

470
00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.980
<v 4>I'm trying to figure out who I would honor more. Yeah.</v>

471
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.180
The winner of the race or the land who insisted on losing.

472
00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.250
I'm 40. I've got kids identified more with the guy who stopped. Yeah. Yeah.

473
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.570
But I think also you,

474
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.560
you see the guy who wins and it makes you ask big questions about what's

475
00:30:45.561 --> 00:30:49.670
possible. Yeah. Yeah. Like how do he do that? Yeah.

476
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.370
I don't know that I'd want to be that guy or even hang out with him.

477
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:57.140
I like the second guy. I know. I'd like the second guy. Bam. What do you think?

478
00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.620
I find myself looking at both of them, kind of with my jaw on the floor.

479
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.493
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

480
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.050
<v 4>Daniel Coyle. His latest book is called the talent code</v>

481
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.480
<v 9>and thanks Lulu. Yeah.</v>

482
00:31:09.481 --> 00:31:13.920
And a huge thanks to Stephen our back who made the film bicycle dreams.

483
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.300
That's where all this footage came from.

484
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.343
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

485
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.460
<v 14>Hey Michael, this is Wendy [inaudible] and I apologize. I have a few that ready.</v>

486
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.090
A lot of fun. And it's part by

487
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.590
Ltps Long Foundation and the National Science Foundation. This is Chili moms.

488
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.350
Radiolab is produced by W N Y, Z and distributed by n p. R.

489
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.020
<v 4>Hey, I'm Janet. Boom. Right. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab today.</v>

490
00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:51.000
Our topic is limits limits. How far can you take your, your body.

491
00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:54.700
We've done that. We've exhausted that thing, so, so let's go uptown. Yeah,

492
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.930
to the limits of the brain. [inaudible] tackle. Just a piece of that question.

493
00:31:57.931 --> 00:32:00.300
Let's just take a look at memos. Okay. All right, great.

494
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.610
And we're going to do that by telling a story,

495
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.950
a story that we heard from Jonah Lehrer. Yeah. You know,

496
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.480
frequent guest on the show, author of the books, Proust was a neuroscientist.

497
00:32:09.481 --> 00:32:14.481
How we decide the story begins in a small town in the old Soviet Union back in

498
00:32:15.751 --> 00:32:20.310
the 1920s and it's about a newspaper reporter named Mr s,

499
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.970
at least that's what we're going to call him. Yeah.

500
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:26.130
So Mr Eslan newspaper reporter and one day his boss starts yelling at him

501
00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:28.170
because his boss gives out these assignments,

502
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.700
talks to the whole newsroom and he notices that Mr s never takes notes.

503
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.310
And this drives his boss crazy cause his bosses, you know,

504
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.500
saying all these things they have to report on and Mr Estis never writes down.

505
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.730
<v 15>And so his boss calls me to his office and says, are you lazy?</v>

506
00:32:42.731 --> 00:32:45.360
Do you not take this job seriously? And Mr s response,

507
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.500
will I just remember it all.

508
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.853
<v 13>Mm.</v>

509
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.970
<v 15>And the editor says, come on. And He sorta quinces him. He says,</v>

510
00:32:55.971 --> 00:33:00.770
what did I assign you yesterday? His boss gives them this quiz and sure enough,

511
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:03.920
he remembers everything. He remembers everything.

512
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:06.290
The editors had word for word

513
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.320
and the editors thinking, I don't know what's wrong with this guy. I mean,

514
00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:16.700
he's not a great reporter, but he has something queer going on in his head.

515
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.620
So he decides to send him to a famous medical doctor in Moscow,

516
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:26.920
a r Luria who is Luria the book lawyer.

517
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:32.040
He's a classical figure is in neuropsychology and in psychology in general.

518
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:33.820
And who is this host your name? Oh,

519
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.270
her that the Goldberg Abbott Clinical Professor at NYU medical school.

520
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:43.190
Goldberg, New Loreo lawyer was my mentor. I worked very closely with him.

521
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:45.490
Not only was he a student of Loris,

522
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.250
Luria gave him a present once basically visible.

523
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.560
This is the book.

524
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.960
This book is one of the great works of early neuroscience. Oh,

525
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.190
so we're going to the right guy. You have an autographed copy by the guy.

526
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.260
It is a beautiful and almost novelistic description of what happened to Mr s

527
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.130
[inaudible] original title was a little book about big Beverly. Yeah.

528
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:18.320
What is it in Russian [inaudible]. Okay, so Jonah,

529
00:34:18.321 --> 00:34:21.200
this guy, Mr s goes to this psychologist Luria.

530
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.370
Now what does Lauria do with them?

531
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.060
Luria during the book talks about how he wrote random numbers on a blackboard

532
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.670
numbers like one eight, six, four,

533
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:32.480
three about 50 numbers and asked Mr s to remember them.

534
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.750
Here we are on page 60 as what studied the material of the board for about three

535
00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:43.520
minutes. Slows his eyes, opened them again for a burger. Okay. Done.

536
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.470
And with that, he would really love the series. Precisely six,

537
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.510
six, eight zero.

538
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.580
That's like a superpower. Yeah. And this impresses Larry. He says,

539
00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:03.050
so he takes it up to the next level. Then Larry, uh, gives him, Ya know, this,

540
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.530
this,

541
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:08.000
this incredible assortment of memory tasks and everything from memorize Dante's

542
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:12.740
inferno, um, to the whole thing. No,

543
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.570
no. Wow. You're not the whole thing.

544
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.410
Just opening stances and meds that are coming in of [inaudible] near it.

545
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:21.320
Provide Aroma. Salvo, here's the really weird thing.

546
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.890
Mr [inaudible] does not read Italian month's speak Italian.

547
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:26.490
He had no idea what he was talking about.

548
00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.880
Ideally a smelly and yet the thing he memorizes, he gets him word perfect. Yeah.

549
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.480
And not only that, he was tested 15 years after.

550
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.930
He'd memorize those stances and he's still got it right? Yeah. Oh Man.

551
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.260
I remembered everything. He had everything.

552
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:46.440
What did you mean by you mean everything? Okay. So if he,

553
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.840
suppose he interviewed you 10 years ago,

554
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:51.390
he would have remembered the color of your sweater,

555
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.510
whether you held the Mike in the left hand or in the right hand,

556
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.570
you would have remembered everything. I mean, everything.

557
00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:03.070
Larry never talks about a computational limit on Mr s's memory as an experiment.

558
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:09.270
I soon found myself in the state virgin or utter confusion and they simply had

559
00:36:10.021 --> 00:36:13.860
to admit that the capacity of his baby had low distinct limits.

560
00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.940
<v 4>How can there be no limits?</v>

561
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.620
Cause I'm thinking about the size of a normal head.

562
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:25.080
It's like 50 centimeters or something in diameter. The brain is three pounds.

563
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:28.890
It's a very confined little situation. How could there be no limits?

564
00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.030
I wish there was a good answer.

565
00:36:30.031 --> 00:36:35.031
Nobody has any idea why it is he had this infinite capability for recall.

566
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:35.670
Um,

567
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:40.620
what it does suggest though is that the brain has the capability to store an

568
00:36:40.621 --> 00:36:43.890
incredible amount of stuff. How much stuff though?

569
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.280
How much can you GAM into a human brain? I, I don't,

570
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.310
I don't think anyone knows. I mean, so let's just stop. Let's face,

571
00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:57.060
let's call it quits. No, no, no. And if I forget that, in fact,

572
00:36:57.061 --> 00:36:59.850
let me take you to a competition which investigates that very question.

573
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.960
We're going to change locations from, where were we just now? Russia.

574
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.890
We were in Russia from Russia in 1920s too. You ready for this?

575
00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:12.780
<v 0>London 2009 here we are at the world memory championships,</v>

576
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.870
the worldwide, the world memory championship. Cause go with me for a sec. Okay.

577
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.040
So we're in a hotel in central London.

578
00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.060
The lobby is crowded with the world's best memorizers.

579
00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.120
So what was your name yet? People here from like Oman, [inaudible] Raj.

580
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:30.130
I'm Dr Grantee Manchester. Hello Neil Hawk. Netherlands. Yeah.

581
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.580
Rick Deion even have a team of Chinese girls in the corner doing a cheer.

582
00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.720
What are we doing here? Well,

583
00:37:38.721 --> 00:37:41.720
the people here are a little bit like the guy you were describing, Mr s.

584
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.050
They are walking experiments in brain stuffing

585
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.670
<v 4>the differences. They're perfectly normal human beings.</v>

586
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.450
<v 0>Could you start by introducing yourself? Yeah. Okay.</v>

587
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.890
Take this guy on benfit or on the reigning world memory champion.

588
00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.140
I'm 33 years old and I live in Nottingham.

589
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.520
Then can take a string of numbers that is 1400 numbers long,

590
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.000
random numbers, random numbers, and he can commit it to memory instantly.

591
00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:12.280
He can take a deck of cards and memorize it in 24 seconds.

592
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.280
Wow. Yeah. We've not actually reached, you know,

593
00:38:15.281 --> 00:38:18.350
any kind of upper limit of what it's possible to memorize yet,

594
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.030
<v 11>but he's still consistently in faith.</v>

595
00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.460
<v 4>So here's what we did. We, we found a guy, oh, I'm a,</v>

596
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.490
my name is Ronnie White and am the 2009 USA memory champion. He's a,

597
00:38:30.491 --> 00:38:33.500
a Navy reservist from Dallas, Texas. And our fact a,

598
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.060
I had to get permission from my unit to come here, but

599
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.130
<v 7>we followed them around the competition. What's about to happen? Well,</v>

600
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:41.780
the is about to start, you know, you know,

601
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:45.010
it's day one to be a fun day because we wanted to know like, how do you do it?

602
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.480
How do you take the limits of a normal brain and completely shattered.

603
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.280
So I walked in the room that day wearing my Michael Phelps tee shirt, you know,

604
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.770
it said USA on the front.

605
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:01.700
<v 9>Okay. You don't run rates, preparation time.</v>

606
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.500
<v 7>The final minutes before you start an event,</v>

607
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.590
you're sitting in your chair and you're just collecting your thoughts.

608
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:12.940
I put on my military glasses, I got some [inaudible], drew Carey's glasses,

609
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.010
and I put those on to remind me, hey, remain calm. You know,

610
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.060
I wore those all throughout my tour in Afghanistan.

611
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.770
If you're going down a road and, and uh,

612
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.980
you're needing to be on the lookout for ideas, but you're not calm,

613
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.960
you're nervous and jittery, you could die.

614
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:34.330
Then I'll put on some noise canceling headsets. Then I just close my eyes,

615
00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:35.403
sit in my chair.

616
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.990
Maybe neurons on the ready. They say

617
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.130
<v 9>that moment. 60 people turnover papers</v>

618
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.750
<v 7>on these pieces of paper. A numbers six, seven, one,</v>

619
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.490
nothing but numbers in time. Where's numbers? Numbers,

620
00:39:58.491 --> 00:40:00.680
numbers and numbers forever. And what are they doing? Well,

621
00:40:00.681 --> 00:40:01.520
they have to memorize them.

622
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.300
So they just used to seeing all these people staring at pieces of paper. Yeah.

623
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.220
Absolute silence. Heads down.

624
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:13.060
60 heads down, staring at numbers six, seven. But here's the,

625
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.900
here's the interesting thing in their heads. Three, they're not seeing numbers.

626
00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.010
Four instead, those numbers are turning into eight of George Bush.

627
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:27.640
One Randy Richardson, he's a friend. One 45 a rash. Michael Jordan,

628
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.710
Chuck Norris, Donnie Brasco, two Bush. That was boy George, Joe t,

629
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.060
Martha Stewart, George Michael, Ben Franklin, Chuck Norris,

630
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.650
and Frank Indiana Jones. Five my friend Ronnie King, Todd.

631
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.610
Uh, I have a person assigned to every number from zero to 99, eight.

632
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.040
And then I have a verb assigned to every person from zero to 99.

633
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.190
And then I have a noun assigned to every digit.

634
00:40:54.191 --> 00:40:57.250
So you're just taking the person verbs and objects

635
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.210
and you're putting them all together and they really don't make sense.

636
00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.440
<v 16>What were some of the [inaudible]?</v>

637
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:09.580
<v 7>The images? I saw a,</v>

638
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.550
I saw Albert Einstein riding the roller coaster into a bunch of fog.

639
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.480
Five, nine, three, seven, eight, seven. That was one of the images. Um,

640
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:25.250
I saw a fat Albert cartoon character driving a car.

641
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:32.960
Eight one, nine, nine. Um, I saw a Victoria's

642
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.530
<v 4>model, which was one of my favorite pictures.</v>

643
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.530
I saw Victoria's secret models shooting a gun,

644
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.143
uh, stuff like that.

645
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:51.110
So there seems to be something about turning data into pictures that makes that

646
00:41:51.111 --> 00:41:54.410
data edge. It becomes easier to hold on to. Do you have any idea?

647
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:58.110
Why do I have any idea why you you but Jonah,

648
00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.900
<v 15>I dunno, I, I would just be purely speculating here,</v>

649
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.940
but the visual cortex has been hugely enhanced in human evolution. It's the,

650
00:42:05.941 --> 00:42:10.020
you know, the rear half of our brain because we know that memories, you know,

651
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:14.280
there is no memory center of the brain. It's distributed in our sensory areas.

652
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.090
It might make a little sense that given that we've got this huge chunk of visual

653
00:42:18.091 --> 00:42:21.180
cortex that it's easier to store memory there.

654
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:25.690
<v 4>Okay. So let me ask you, how did Ron's visual cortex do in the big content?</v>

655
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.470
Ron? Ron didn't actually do so well.

656
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.440
He didn't [inaudible] he was trying to memorize these 12 decks of cards and he

657
00:42:34.441 --> 00:42:37.900
had constructed this whole, like a stack of pictures. But he,

658
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.290
he did them in the wrong order and he screwed it up. He lost,

659
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.200
he lost really badly. Unfortunately. I was shocked. I mean,

660
00:42:43.201 --> 00:42:48.201
I was just shocked that that knocked me out of any passion,

661
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.330
you know, by the way, who didn't lose it?

662
00:42:54.331 --> 00:42:56.910
Remember Mr s the guy we started this conversation with? Yeah, sure.

663
00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.773
This is interesting.

664
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.950
It turns out that Mr s also had little pictures and little characters running

665
00:43:01.951 --> 00:43:04.410
around in his mind, but unlike Ron,

666
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.500
he never asked for the picture.

667
00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.330
<v 15>No, he couldn't. You know, even when he wanted not to do it,</v>

668
00:43:10.331 --> 00:43:13.930
he couldn't help but do it anyway. What he was born that way.

669
00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:19.040
He had this tremendous memory without any effort that without an mnemonic

670
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.560
techniques viscerally the point,

671
00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.200
you mean his mind made the pictures automatically? Yeah.

672
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:28.090
Mr S had a condition called synesthesia where your senses get kind of tangled

673
00:43:28.091 --> 00:43:33.070
up, so he heard voices in terms of colors, right? Colors of voices,

674
00:43:33.071 --> 00:43:37.030
textures, smells of words, and his numbers weren't just numbers.

675
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:42.310
Sometimes he imagines walking through a crowded Moscow street and the numbers

676
00:43:42.311 --> 00:43:45.580
are scattered along the way and so he describes how I'm walking down the street.

677
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:48.800
There's the number one. This is a proud, well-built bat.

678
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.250
Then I make a right turn onto the side street.

679
00:43:51.251 --> 00:43:54.790
There's the number of tools of high spirit I then I make a left turn.

680
00:43:54.791 --> 00:43:59.740
There's a number three, a gloomy person, y I don't know. Nobody knows.

681
00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.630
Nobody knows exactly what accounts for the individual associations of

682
00:44:04.631 --> 00:44:06.220
synesthesia that they just exist,

683
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:10.900
but they're this extra scaffold for mr s's memory to cling to. Wow.

684
00:44:10.901 --> 00:44:15.820
So he's like Ron, except he's using all his senses to remember numbers. Exactly.

685
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:20.230
<v 4>So, um, getting back to the plot, what did, uh, what did he do with his talent?</v>

686
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.960
<v 15>He became a traveling circus freak basically. Yeah.</v>

687
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.930
[inaudible] like, Whoa, sorry. Mr [inaudible] list. Yeah.

688
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.160
He gave up journalism to perform for just

689
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.200
<v 8>imagining when something I like, yes.</v>

690
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.270
<v 3>She had told me, please feel glow. Zig kept the</v>

691
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.433
memory.

692
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.280
<v 8>[inaudible] a big crowd. He walks onto the stage, he gives them an invitation.</v>

693
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:52.320
He asked them to shout random members,

694
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.630
<v 15>58 55</v>

695
00:44:55.230 --> 00:45:00.070
[inaudible] seven 545 5,203. Then after a little while,

696
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.420
the crowd quiets down, Eh,

697
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.410
Mr s would close his eyes and step forward. Then he would remember them all.

698
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.753
<v 8>This was his [inaudible]</v>

699
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:16.130
<v 15>job. Yeah. And it wasn't just numbers by the way. He was thrown weird phrases.</v>

700
00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:20.860
<v 8>Nonsense sounds, nouns, verbs.</v>

701
00:45:20.861 --> 00:45:24.880
And sometimes you do four shows a day. And the more he did,

702
00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.260
the more obvious it became that this business is,

703
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.200
you'd had a downside.

704
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.500
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

705
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.270
<v 15>here's what we're going to finally reach.</v>

706
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:39.570
Maybe the limits question that we're really examining in this program.

707
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:43.590
You would hear all these nonsense phrases being thrown at him and they would

708
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.540
build up in his mind and I,

709
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:49.050
it's important to note this was incredibly frustrating for Mr s.

710
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:52.590
He had a constant stream of memories pouring into his brain.

711
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.490
He couldn't get any of it out and on top of that, as they piled up,

712
00:45:56.491 --> 00:45:58.340
the memories began to kind of [inaudible]

713
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.570
<v 17>whoosh together. One will trigger another and then another and then another.</v>

714
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.370
It was the suffocating web of association. The moment he encountered everything,

715
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:08.683
everything,

716
00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:13.690
even the both the related in his past to that something was immediately evoked

717
00:46:15.111 --> 00:46:18.650
in his bedroom. For example, let's suppose a man in the audience

718
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.460
<v 8>stands up and you shout out the word</v>

719
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.150
<v 15>doll for a split second,</v>

720
00:46:24.151 --> 00:46:29.151
Mr s sees a dog which suggests another dog and then another dog.

721
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.900
Every dog he ever saw

722
00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.930
<v 3>and the main suggestions suggested not just that meeting, but the main site.</v>

723
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.670
I other than the minute he knew all the other competitions were a similar look

724
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.730
in me and stood up in, chatted something similar.

725
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:54.080
She was [inaudible]. She was the news was all kinds of medleys.

726
00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.500
Totally unrelated.

727
00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.450
Everything in layer one, layer two on top of the other. Oh that's horrible.

728
00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:06.340
<v 15>I agree. Oh that's what be a bloody nightmare.</v>

729
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.550
The mind isn't just interested in storing information.

730
00:47:09.551 --> 00:47:12.250
It really wants to be able to get meaning out of that information,

731
00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.660
out of those memories.

732
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.980
And that actually seems to be turned off to be inhibited by remembering too much

733
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:21.930
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

734
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.590
<v 15>In other words, there really is a limit in our heads.</v>

735
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:30.190
It's a different kind of limit, really not the limitless to remember one

736
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:33.340
<v 4>number after another, but a precious balance in your head.</v>

737
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:39.460
If you remembered too much, you will make no sense of the world.

738
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:40.631
It's weird.

739
00:47:40.631 --> 00:47:45.070
I've never actually thought of making sense of the world as being an act of

740
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:46.970
negation. Yeah. Do you know what I mean?

741
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.910
It's very much that they kind of make sense.

742
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.600
Cause if you think about like living here in New York City, New York City,

743
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.200
all the people you bump into,

744
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:01.810
if you remembered every freaking one you would have fun.

745
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.610
Like you wouldn't be able to have a relationship with your wife or your husband

746
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:09.880
and your child cause they just be lost in this thick crowd in your head.

747
00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.040
Just like get him out somehow. That's the balance.

748
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:18.340
The act forgetting is crucial to create

749
00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.710
<v 18>preciousness. Although I do wish I had a better memory.</v>

750
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.443
It's your day weekend.

751
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.930
<v 20>This is Chris Callahan from Berkeley,</v>

More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

756
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.670
<v 18>hey, I'm Janet. Boom. Ron, I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

757
00:48:56.671 --> 00:49:00.720
This is radio lab and this next segment began with a simple question.

758
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:05.460
Seeing as our topics so far has been limits and sure we've done body and we did

759
00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:07.740
the brain. Now we're going to go really big. Yeah. Yeah.

760
00:49:07.741 --> 00:49:11.340
So we called up Steve Strogatz, mathematician at Cornell University,

761
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.510
frequent guest on the show,

762
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.040
and we asked him are there limits to human knowledge? Yeah.

763
00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:21.330
And his answer sent us on a little adventure. Um, the, yeah.

764
00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.860
Is there anything that's at the limits of our knowledge is a question that a lot

765
00:49:25.861 --> 00:49:28.440
of us scientists worry about and, and uh,

766
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.610
certainly the 20th century taught us that there are many things that limit our

767
00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:33.630
knowledge. For instance,

768
00:49:33.631 --> 00:49:37.980
that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum physics showed us that you

769
00:49:37.981 --> 00:49:42.510
can't know the position and momentum of a subatomic particle at the same time.

770
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:43.440
You just can't do it.

771
00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:47.340
It's not a matter of not having good enough instruments or not being clever

772
00:49:47.341 --> 00:49:51.420
enough. It's just a fundamental barrier that nature puts in your way.

773
00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.213
I'm in logic.

774
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.000
Girdle's theorem tells us you can't prove certain things even though they're

775
00:49:57.001 --> 00:49:59.250
true. So there are all kinds of limits,

776
00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:02.280
but those seem a bit remote from everyday experience.

777
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.090
And yet I think there are really important limits on our knowledge that we're

778
00:50:06.091 --> 00:50:07.020
all familiar with.

779
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:11.840
What I'm thinking of here is our inability to think about big numbers.

780
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.320
Because with your fingers, you've got 10 you know, normally.

781
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:19.210
So we're good at 10, we're barely good at a hundred.

782
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:22.420
And once you start getting to thousands, millions, billions and trillions,

783
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.850
w it gets hazier and hazier.

784
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:28.550
When you hear now about the trillions of dollars in the deficit or whatever it

785
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:32.000
is, the debt, you know, we don't, that means nothing.

786
00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:36.360
How are you supposed to think about that? Now when you ask,

787
00:50:36.361 --> 00:50:40.020
why can't we understand the common cold? But we can put a person on the moon.

788
00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:45.240
It has to do with large numbers, not just large numbers of numbers. So Steve,

789
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.310
but large numbers of things interacting.

790
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.600
But there are so many genes involved and so many biochemical reactions involved.

791
00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:57.480
Our brains are limited, our memories are very limited. And so, um,

792
00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.320
I worry a little bit that,

793
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.310
that we might be approaching the end of our ability to have insight into certain

794
00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:06.700
kinds of questions. What Steve Means by the word insight, there's not like a,

795
00:51:06.701 --> 00:51:08.790
you found the answer. It's like, that's like a feeling,

796
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.170
<v 4>right? You don't like that. Oh, [inaudible]</v>

797
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.320
<v 18>get it feeling you get when you really understand the answer. Yeah.</v>

798
00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:18.990
That satisfying feeling that I can see the reasoning and I can actually feel it

799
00:51:18.991 --> 00:51:23.220
in my bones. That's, that's a very pleasurable feeling. But, um,

800
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.830
one that we may not always

801
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:29.920
<v 4>be able to enjoy. I mean, you can see the space.</v>

802
00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:34.930
We weren't really quite sure how to feel about this, but then Steve said, yeah,

803
00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:38.010
don't take my word for it. Talk to these guys at work down the hall from me.

804
00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:40.650
You'll see. Yeah, we can, we can go right ahead. Cool.

805
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.900
Can you guys introduce yourself? Tell me who I'm talking to. Yes. So, uh,

806
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.400
my name is Hod Lipson. My name is Michael Schmitt. I am a phd student and uh,

807
00:51:48.401 --> 00:51:52.530
I'm a roboticist and hot and Mike have developed this thing which does make you

808
00:51:52.531 --> 00:51:56.310
wonder if Steve's right. It's a computer. Yes. Actually many,

809
00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:00.240
a whole tower of computers that are all grinding away and performing

810
00:52:00.241 --> 00:52:01.140
calculations.

811
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.360
Actually when you get down to it, it's just a piece of software.

812
00:52:06.361 --> 00:52:09.720
But they've named it the Eureka cause. That's what it's designed to do,

813
00:52:09.721 --> 00:52:14.430
to have you Rica moments. Uh, maybe a, a kind of simpler example.

814
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:18.450
The story of Eureka begins pretty simply. Think of it with a pendulum. Okay?

815
00:52:18.451 --> 00:52:22.650
The pendulum, just one of these things you see hanging off a grandfather clock,

816
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.290
okay, I've got a regular pendulum's swinging in my mind. Okay?

817
00:52:25.291 --> 00:52:30.291
Swinging left and right now says hod w instead of a string connected to ball,

818
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.600
make it a string, connected to a ball, connected to another string,

819
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.600
connected to another ball, which is basically like a double pendulum.

820
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.080
The cool thing about this is you just put it up, you lift it up and let it go.

821
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.960
And what you'll get says Mike is chaos.

822
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.370
That's really crazy behavior instead of Nice.

823
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:51.950
And even now you got random,

824
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.430
it's almost impossible to actually try to predict where this thing will move.

825
00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.010
So what they did was they got a camera connected it to Eureka and Jesse just had

826
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:03.620
Eureka Watch this thing, you know, move about crazily.

827
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.850
And then they asked the computer a really simple question,

828
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:12.080
can you make some kind of sense out of this erratic behavior?

829
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:16.880
Like is there something in this system that always stays the same?

830
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.920
Tell me what about these panda?

831
00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:22.850
Lomas overtime is not changing because with everything there's gotta be some

832
00:53:22.851 --> 00:53:23.840
kind of logic in there.

833
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:27.210
So you're looking for a law basically mean you're looking for the law of the

834
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:30.870
double pendulum. Yes, that's the idea. So Eureka is,

835
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.260
they're watching this pendant that was about 3:00 AM in the lab is basically

836
00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:38.250
spitting out all of these different guesses, formulating hypotheses.

837
00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.930
It's getting closer and closer.

838
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:46.130
And then onto the screen pops this simple Pharma f equals m.

839
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.770
What is f equals? I May.

840
00:53:50.771 --> 00:53:54.690
Is that actually the law that f equals the May is Newton's law of motion,

841
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.180
<v 5>the Isaac Newton that Sir Isaac to you.</v>

842
00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:02.650
So Basic Law of physics in one of the greatest discoveries in the history of

843
00:54:02.651 --> 00:54:03.520
human thinking.

844
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:05.700
<v 3>Uh,</v>

845
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.400
<v 21>took it about a day, 24 hours.</v>

846
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:11.060
<v 3>Uh,</v>

847
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:15.350
<v 21>but the interesting thing is that it came up with this thing without knowing</v>

848
00:54:15.351 --> 00:54:18.110
anything about physics, nothing. That's why we kind of,

849
00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.620
we think that this algorithm might be able to find new laws that we don't know

850
00:54:21.621 --> 00:54:22.454
about yet.

851
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:29.600
<v 4>In fact, once word got out about Eureka,</v>

852
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:36.290
that's when the emails start a couple of emails a day to scientists all over the

853
00:54:36.291 --> 00:54:37.430
place who were like, Hey,

854
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.980
do you mind if we borrow your robot for what kinds of stuff?

855
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:40.490
<v 21>Um,</v>

856
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:45.490
anything you can think of from trying to predict behaviors of cows in the herd

857
00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.740
to particle physics, to a stock market

858
00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:52.940
<v 4>and fats. And this is when we get to Steve's point about the limits of insight.</v>

859
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.340
That's when they met this guy.

860
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.420
My name is girl swell girl is a biologist at the University of Texas

861
00:54:59.421 --> 00:55:02.300
Southwestern Medical Center. He got in touch with hod when you said,

862
00:55:02.301 --> 00:55:06.950
I have this amazing data, which is single cell dynamics,

863
00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.950
meaning he's got this tiny little thing. So simple bacteria,

864
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:13.730
really basic and he's been collecting this information on how it works on its

865
00:55:13.731 --> 00:55:17.060
inside. Oh, things go up and down. Certain nutrients increase,

866
00:55:17.061 --> 00:55:19.540
certain nutrients decrease over time. Just like a pen.

867
00:55:19.541 --> 00:55:22.490
A long thing is in a cell. It's like thousands of pendulums.

868
00:55:22.491 --> 00:55:25.670
There's so many part genes turning on and off, thousands and thousands,

869
00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:29.210
tens of thousands of proteins turning on other genes and nutrients going up and

870
00:55:29.211 --> 00:55:29.480
down.

871
00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:34.280
It's this crazy quilt of complicated feedback and you wanted to know inside of

872
00:55:34.281 --> 00:55:37.790
the cell, how are all of these things related. We can measure it all,

873
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:40.430
we can see things going up and down and all that. But what are the rules?

874
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.330
What are the rules here in this? He says is the problem for biology.

875
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.210
Biology is one of the least well understood systems compared to let's say,

876
00:55:47.211 --> 00:55:50.930
chemistry and physics. They're still lacking the basics. So we said, look,

877
00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:51.764
Mr Robot,

878
00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:57.310
can you tell us what you think are sort of the important principles governing

879
00:55:57.321 --> 00:56:00.770
this organism and maybe detect things that were hidden from us.

880
00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.800
So he sent us the data and we analyzed it and uh,

881
00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:11.640
well, OK, let's not let [inaudible] suddenly equation starting,

882
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:12.474
popping out.

883
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:18.180
Almost immediately the robot came back to us and said, okay,

884
00:56:18.181 --> 00:56:21.510
here's a set of two equations that describe your data.

885
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.620
Do you remember by any chance what the, what the actual equation was? Not,

886
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.690
not that we'd understand it, but just sort of to hear it said out loud. Yeah,

887
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:32.920
no, I don't want you don't have my rain man skills develop to that degree yet.

888
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.190
Important thing is that the equation was telling him things like when this

889
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:36.941
protein goes up,

890
00:56:36.941 --> 00:56:40.240
this other thing always goes down and when that thing goes down,

891
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:42.670
this gene turns on and does a loop de loop,

892
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.260
and when he went to his cell to check all this out, the equation was right.

893
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:52.000
These equations matched the data and in fact they explain new data.

894
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:55.090
These equations could even predict what the cell was about to do,

895
00:56:57.710 --> 00:57:01.310
but hold the champagne. There's just one little problem here.

896
00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.730
The formulas checkout, but we don't know what they mean.

897
00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.770
You don't know what they mean, right?

898
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.400
Meaning they don't know why these equations work. I why when this goes up,

899
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.890
does that go down? Why? When that goes up, does this go sideways? Why?

900
00:57:15.891 --> 00:57:20.820
I had to first look at this and try to make sense of it. We said like, oh,

901
00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.850
okay. I think we understand and we're like, oh, maybe we don't.

902
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:28.150
We think that we're close to understanding it, but you know,

903
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:30.760
now we're in this bizarre situation.

904
00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.860
We can't even publish it right now because we can't just publish a equation

905
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.400
without explaining it. So in the end,

906
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.300
they're in this awkward position where they've got the answer,

907
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:42.800
but they don't have

908
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:47.990
<v 21>the insights. And I think it's a preview of what's the common science.</v>

909
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.600
The more we turn to computers with these big questions,

910
00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:54.050
the more they'll give us answers that we just don't understand.

911
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:59.170
We'll be faced with this challenge of having to find ways to get a computer to

912
00:57:59.181 --> 00:58:01.190
explain what it found.

913
00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:04.400
But that will leave us if this really happens in some weird position as

914
00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:08.150
bystanders where we're, we're sort of listening to the oracle,

915
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:12.200
but not really understanding the answer. Is there going to be a time when we,

916
00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:17.330
we can't cut it anymore. We've had this,

917
00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:21.710
this window in human history when we could not just know things but actually

918
00:58:21.711 --> 00:58:25.430
understand them. That is, you could know why they were true. Not just no,

919
00:58:25.431 --> 00:58:29.240
but to know why. And that's a beautiful moment in human history.

920
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:34.630
But I feel like it may only be a moment. Well, I don't really see it quite that,

921
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:40.250
that sort of sad and dramatic because at the end there will be simple principles

922
00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:43.510
to describe even the most complicated of processes.

923
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:48.070
So you have a bias that prevents you from feeling the kind of despair that Steve

924
00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:51.260
feels in that we were hoping you would feel. Oh, well I'm, I,

925
00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:54.820
I have a positive outlook, but I just wondering about the,

926
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.550
we look what we have discovered.

927
00:58:57.551 --> 00:59:00.700
You'll say when you're an old man with your robot sitting there and address next

928
00:59:00.701 --> 00:59:03.310
to you and the robot will be holding your hand,

929
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:06.820
but that will be a cold hand and Jad and I will be thinking,

930
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:11.110
I don't know who's the we here as well. I would say we is sort of knowledge.

931
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.680
I'm just thirsty for understanding and thirsty for knowledge.

932
00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:17.140
Me In the cold hand, holding my hand,

933
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:21.640
we've accumulated and contributed to the overall understanding of something that

934
00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:23.980
we thought maybe 50 years ago. It wasn't possible.

935
00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.620
And that would be something that would make me happy.
