00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:03.403
- And that's when they told me

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.505
I was being investigated

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.673
as an E.O.S...

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.576
An enemy of the state.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.411
(audience laughing)

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.748
(intense hip hop music)

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.928
- Welcome to This Is
Not Happening presents,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:29.996
One Crazy Night.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.097
So this is what we do,

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.432
a bunch of comedians

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.334
tell stories about
a similar subject.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.769
So this is just One Crazy Night.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.003
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.004 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
for Miss Julia
Lillis, everybody.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.174 line:0%
(audience applauding)

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.447
- Thanks a lot, guys.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.917
Um, so this story's 100% true.

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:53.053
Keep that in mind
while we're going.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.888
Back in 2007,

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.956
I had a short but serious

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.859
long distance relationship

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.594
with a douche bag in England.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:05.732 align:start size:97% position:3%
(audience laughing)
Um, yeah, for the douche bags.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
I didn't realize at the time
that he was a douche bag.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.470 align:start size:88% position:13%
In fact, I actually
thought he was the one.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.906
Ladies, you feel me.
(audience laughing)

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.008
I thought we were
gonna get married.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:16.242
I was gonna move to England.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.477
We'd have a bunch of
little British babies

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.112
who would have adorable
little British accents

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.313
and call me Mummy.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.916 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was like wildly
excited about it all.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.151
Um, then one day,

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:28.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm on a Skype call
with him and he dumps me

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:28.955
on Skype.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.758
He Skype dumped me.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
He Skumped me.
(audience laughing)

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.428
Um, and I was devastated.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.896
Like totally blindsided.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.398 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I did what any rational
girl would do, right.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:42.702
I called up my mom, I
called my best friend,

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.772
I called Papa Johns.
(audience laughing)

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.641
Then I called 1-800-Expedia

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.910 align:start size:94% position:6%
and bought a one way
ticket leaving that night

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.745
straight to England.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.748
(audience laughing)

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.718
I just kept thinking, like and
I honestly was thinking this,

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:00.086 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm like if this was
a romantic comedy

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.254
this is what the girl would do

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.188
and then she'd go there

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.256
and the guy would take her back.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.657
Like that is what would happen.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.825
What would Bridget Jones do?

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.627
Get her ass to England.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:08.728
(audience laughing)

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.563
So, okay, so here was the plan.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.499
This was literally the plan.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.935
One, I was not gonna tell
him I was coming, right.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.438
Then I would get there,
he'd still be at work,

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.240
but I would busy myself,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.041
keep myself busy in his backyard

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.177 align:start size:88% position:13%
painting my nails,
doing crossword puzzles.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.412 align:start size:88% position:13%
Then he'd come home from
work, we'd lock eyes.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.581
He'd realize like,
ah she's the one.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.083
He'd propose on the spot,

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.719
we'd go out and bonus, my
nails are already done.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.787 align:start size:94% position:6%
We could get a ring stat.
(audience laughing)

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.457
I had it all figured out, right.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.662
So, I get on the
flight that night.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:45.165 align:start size:94% position:6%
And to keep myself
distracted on the flight,

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.800 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause any time I
started thinking about
what was happening,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.702
I would like freak out.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.338
So to distract myself,
I'm a musical comedian

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.608 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I had a musical I had been
toying around with writing.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:56.943 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I decided to write
it on the flight.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.411
I started writing it.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.979 align:start size:97% position:3%
I pull out a spiral notebook
and I just write away.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.347
And then, next thing
you know, we're landing

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.149
and I start kinda losing it.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.251
I'm like, ugh oh god,
what's gonna happen?

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.719
What if he doesn't take me back?

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.921
This is crazy.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.189
I start crying.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.726
And I get in the customs
line and I'm just crying

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:14.994 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I get to the front
of the customs line

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.030 align:start size:84% position:16%
and there's this
little customs agent.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.000 align:start size:97% position:3%
He was like this 20 year old
like adorable British kid

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.569
and he asked me um,

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:26.139
how long I would
be in the country?

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.076
And I said, it depends if
my boyfriend takes me back.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:33.880
(audience laughing)

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.249
And then I told him the
whole plan, you guys.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.784
I told him everything.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.819
I told him about the Skype dump.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.822
I told him about the surprise.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.525
The nail polish and
the crossword puzzles

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:49.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I look at him and
I'm like, is that crazy?

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.898 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I shit you
not, this kid like,

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.333
straight out of
a romantic comedy

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.068 align:start size:84% position:16%
in his adorable
little British accent

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.603
looks me in the eye and he goes,

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:59.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
"You gotta do what you
gotta do for love."

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.142
(laughing and applauding)

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.911
And I was like, yes!

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.914
You do gotta do what
you gotta do for love

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.116
and I'm doing what I gotta do.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.317
This is my romantic comedy.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.518
I end up with the guy.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.020 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is what Bridget
Jones would do.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.189
Everything is working perfectly.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.958 align:start size:84% position:16%
And right then is
when they detained me.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.194
(audience laughing)

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:24.897
'Cause apparently like,
when you are sobbing

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.500
and have no return plans

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.437
and bought a one way ticket
six hours before your flight,

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.606
those are all things
immigration officials

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.141
consider red flags.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.710
(audience laughing)

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.814
So they brought me into the
immigration detention center

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.450
and I waited there
for like a long time.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.220 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like hours and then
like a lot more hours.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.322
Like a long ass time.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.425
Then they bring me out
for an interrogation

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:56.729
and I had to tell them
the whole plan, you know?

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.499
I had to tell them
like, he's the one

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.566
and I just have to surprise him

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.468
and he'll remember I'm the one.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.470 align:start size:88% position:13%
And they told me,
they'd have to call him

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.639
to verify the story.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.574
(audience gasps)
I know, right?

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.243
Like, they clearly
didn't understand

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:14.847 align:start size:94% position:6%
the importance of the
surprise part of the plan.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.249
So they call him.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.751
And I'm there thinking like,

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.953
ugh, you know, if I'm lucky,

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:22.655
he'll think this is like
charming and halarious

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.824 align:start size:88% position:13%
and something we'll like
tell our kids about.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.226
They'll be like,
Mummy is so funny.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:28.961 align:start size:94% position:6%
They come back in, they're
like, we reached him.

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.998
And of course, I'm
like, how'd he sound?

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:32.832
Was he mad?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.067
Was he kind of excited?

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.268
Did he sound like
he was smiling?

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:36.903
Um, I didn't get
anything from them.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:40.506 align:start size:84% position:16%
They did say, he
verified your story.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:44.310
He told us you're just a love
sick girl from Los Angeles.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.113 align:start size:84% position:16%
No reason to detain
you any longer.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.315 align:start size:81% position:19%
So I thought I was
like home free.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:50.483
And that's when they told me,

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.553 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was being investigated
as an E.O.S.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.456
I'm like, a what?

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.124
An enemy of the state.

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:00.326
(audience laughing)

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.462
And they took the
spiral notebook out

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:06.399
that was in my carry on
which they confiscated.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.271
So here's the thing, this
musical I was writing,

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:14.006 align:start size:84% position:16%
it was 2007, it
was back when like.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:16.008 align:start size:97% position:3%
Remember when Britney Spears
was kinda going crazy?

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:18.177
She was like running around
barefoot and eating Cheetos

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.345
and like she shaved her head.

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:20.580
So this was that timeframe.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.517
So the basic premise of
the musical was this,

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.453 align:start size:84% position:16%
what if Britney
Spears was the pawn

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.289 align:start size:97% position:3%
of a terrorist organization
(audience laughing)

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.258 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they had been
raising her from birth

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:34.160
into a pop singing sensation

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.361
just waiting for the right time

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.230 align:start size:88% position:13%
to unleash her craziness
on the whole country

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.998
so she would distract us all

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.901 align:start size:97% position:3%
while the terrorist
organization attacked America.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.603
(audience laughing)

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:47.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
So that's what they
found in my carry on bag.

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:50.643
And like when I look
at it, I looked at it,

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:53.746
it's like, these are just my
pages of comedic dabbling.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.682
They saw it as more of
a terrorist manifesto.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.451
(audience laughing)

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.886
And that's when I found myself

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.888 align:start size:97% position:3%
in the really awkward
position of having to pitch

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:05.024 align:start size:88% position:13%
Britney Spears terrorist
(audience laughing)

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:08.194 align:start size:94% position:6%
to a room full of Heathrow
immigration officials.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.930
Let me tell ya, they
were a tough crowd.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.866
(audience laughing)

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:18.037
Like, they did not think
it was funny, like at all.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:21.574
Finally, amazingly enough,

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.142
I did convince them

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:27.380 align:start size:97% position:3%
that I was just heartbroken
girl from Los Angeles

who was trying to live out
her own romantic comedy

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:34.887 align:start position:0%
while getting an unconventional
musical off the ground

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.489
and they let me go.

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:41.727 align:start size:94% position:6%
I took a bus to the douche
bags house and uh...

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.131
There was no surprise, you know,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.432
no painting nails or
crossword puzzles,

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.834
definitely no proposal.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.469 align:start size:97% position:3%
We had a brief conversation
that was kinda like,

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.570
but you're the one!

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.404
But you're not the one.

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:52.205
But you're the one!

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.439
But you're not the one.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.074
It was, you know, that's
the kinda conversation

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.043
that can kinda go on forever.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:58.344
Eventually I think
I just got tired.

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:02.381 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like, fine, I guess
you're not the one.

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.916
And he bought me a
one way ticket home

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.551
that left the next morning.

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:06.986
And I woke up, said goodbye,

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.322
and haven't spoken to him since.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.691 align:start size:94% position:6%
(laughing and applauding)
Thank you guys.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:15.094

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.631
