00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.670
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a spy.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.240
The midnight phone calls.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.250
The cool gadgets.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.960
The secret missions.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.950
But I grew up.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.480
I changed.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880
And I’m living out those dreams on a slightly
different path.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.560
Now, I’m a full-time digital storyteller, which means
late nights wrapping up projects, an expensive

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.220
video camera, and some non-disclosure agreements.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.300
And I got here by setting small goals that
were clear, doable, and ambitious.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.320
I know things can seem a bit overwhelming
when you’re out of school, there are no

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.640
more grades, and all of a sudden people are
talking about five-year plans when it feels

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.360
like you don’t know what’s happening in
five weeks.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.450
But we’ve got you.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.450
So today, your mission -- should you choose
to accept it -- is to learn how to set achievable

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.450
goals.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.450
I’m Evelyn from the Internets.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.500
And this is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.100
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.610
Let’s face it, we all have dreams.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.420
And we all want to achieve them, no matter
if they’re big like, “I want to write

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.800
an Oscar-winning screenplay” or small, like,
“I just want to finish this script, right now."

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.660
Looking toward the future is scary and muddled.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.860
Every little decision you make seems like
it’s really high stakes.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.830
At some point, your hopes and fears and insecurities
might get all mixed together as your brain

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.260
starts to panic, and all of a sudden you’re
having a quarter-life crisis in your 20s.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.310
Like, “Am I actually achieving anything
in my life?”

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.710
I know I’ve been there.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.200
But you can limit this anxiety by setting
some SMART goals that break down your big

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.330
plans into manageable steps.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.730
And I don’t mean “smart” like responsible,
although it never hurts to budget your travel

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.960
expenses or think about building a 401k.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.939
Your parents would be proud.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.010
SMART is another one of those business-y acronyms.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.049
It stands for Specific, Measurable, Ambitious,
Realistic, and Timely.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.799
So first of all, your SMART goal should be
specific, clear, and easy to understand.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.549
“Do your best” may be a great mantra or
motivational poster, but it’s too vague

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:08.780
to be a helpful goal.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.980
Breaking down a big goal into smaller, specific
action steps will let you see results, which

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.879
will lower that “am I actually getting anywhere?”

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.879
anxiety.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.139
Second, you can’t see results without
knowing what they look like, which is why

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.530
SMART goals should also be measurable.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.290
If you’re not measuring anything, how are
you going to look back at everything you’ve

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.290
accomplished?

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.760
So make sure each step comes with numbers
to help you see clear benchmarks.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.769
For example, instead of “stop the bad guy
and save the world,” try “complete 3 missions

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.180
from M this month.”

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.400
Now, you might be tempted to set relatively
easy small goals, so you can check them off

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.989
and fill that craving we all have for instant
gratification.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.590
But you should also be ambitious with your
SMART goal.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.480
You’ll work harder and your results will
last longer if you’re challenged.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.660
Like, you probably didn’t pay attention
in classes where you were bored.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.919
Then, you want to strike a balance between
challenging and realistic SMART goals.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.559
Unless you’re Tom Cruise, mission impossible
really needs to be mission challenging-yet-probable.

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.919
Goals that are too ambitious can be frustrating,
rather than motivating.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.090
You might be making gradual progress.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.599
But if you don’t hit that super-far-out
target, you might have a nagging feeling that

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.150
you’re a failure… and that can really
weigh you down.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.099
It’s kind of like being upset that you didn’t
lock up the bad guy forever, and losing

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.779
sight of the fact that you still thwarted
his evil plan.

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.019
If you want to push a little bit farther,
you can set a stretch goal.

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.349
But make sure there’s a minimum where you’re
still happy.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.849
It’s like Kickstarter for your brain!

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.680
Like, if you’ve spiffed up your secret underground
base, your stretch goal may be to build yourself

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.739
another jetpack!

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.269
And finally, make sure your SMART goals are
always timely.

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.799
Because without a timeline, you might keep
pushing your goal off to… someday.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.499
And when you get busy, someday never seems
to come.

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:01.830
If your big goals are complex, like “run
your own spy agency by age 25,” you may

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.200
need 3 to 4 subgoals with smaller timelines,
like, “stop Shego 4 times this year” or

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.569
“partner with Wade to create a new gadget
this month.”

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.599
And remember when we talked about under promising
and over delivering?

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.170
We all generally have a hard time understanding
how long things are going to take.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.820
So set a few incremental deadlines, so you
won’t be up doing an entire project the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.820
night before.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.140
But find a balance.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.010
Tight deadlines can be motivating but also
really stressful.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.410
If you’ve got 24 hours to stop a supervillain,
you’ll work fast, but your blood pressure

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.740
may be through the roof.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.120
Now, if you’re trying to process all these
tips and still aren’t entirely sure what

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.260
you’re aiming for in the first place, make
your SMART goal a learning goal.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.910
Learning goals, like setting up an informational
interview per week, help you figure out what

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.920
you need to do and what goals you should set
as benchmarks along that path.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.260
But even if you put a lot of work into crafting
some awesome, motivating SMART goals, life

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.160
can just… happen.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.310
Things change.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.290
Your priorities might shift as you learn more
about yourself, or you could have to deal

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.220
with an unexpected setback like an injury
or layoff, which can send anyone reeling.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.000
So if you feel you need to adjust your timeline
or abandon a goal, it’s not necessarily

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.240
a failure, even though it might feel like
one.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.380
It’s gonna be okay.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.180
There’s only so much time in a day, and
goal quality matters more than goal quantity.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.870
So you’ve got to think about what’s most
important to you.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.820
If you’re trying to save the world and also
study for that math test, you may need to

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.370
put a 4.0 GPA on the backburner.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.110
But there’s a difference between adjusting
priorities and giving up with a “what the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.460
heck!” just because something got hard.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.530
Balancing ambitious and realistic goals can
be tough, so be flexible with yourself.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.900
If you’re trying to save money, maybe say,
“I’m going to cook for myself this whole

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.920
month… except for brunch on Sundays with
my girls.”

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920
[Evelyn can also swap this &amp; the next line
out for a personal example]

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.130
And if think you might struggle, set yourself
a fail-safe.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.240
It’s like a gentle consequence that pressures
you to stay on track.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.980
Like if you go out more than once, you have
to buy everyone’s mimosas.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.150
Goals and their fail-safes are powerful because
a lot of times, they’re about personal growth

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.730
-- the stuff that intrinsically motivates
you.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.480
But other times goals have extrinsic rewards,
like money or fame or power.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.800
There’s nothing wrong with doing a job for
the cash -- private investigators can still

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.960
bring in bad guys.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.650
But sometimes, extrinsic motivators can make
people want to game the system.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.280
Not necessarily because they’re bad people
doing bad things, but because the incentive

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.590
structure is wrong.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.840
To see what I mean, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.640
Let’s imagine you run a scrappy auto shop
in the heart of Gotham.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.640
With all those robberies and high-speed chases,
your work was steady... before a questionably

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.240
dressed vigilante cleaned up the streets.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.580
Now, things are in a bit of a lull.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.380
So you set a goal for your auto mechanics
to bring in $150 dollars per hour.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.030
Your intent was good.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.120
But when you show up to work the next day,
there’s a really upset customer who thinks

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.070
his Batmobile has spent too much time in the
shop.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.490
It turns out that this high pressure goal
led your mechanics to overcharge and do unnecessary

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.350
work to raise their hourly sales.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.290
You hoped that your sales targets would increase
their work quantity without affecting the

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.290
quality.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.020
Instead, you rewarded them for increasing
billable hours by keeping cars in the shop

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.610
for too long… which is unethical.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.770
Essentially, in the words of business professors,
you “rewarded for A while hoping for B”

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.400
To avoid falling into that trap, make sure
your goal actually encourages the behaviors

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.630
you want.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.660
Think about the worst behavior you could accidentally
encourage and take precautions.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.720
To deter mechanics from doing unnecessary
work, you could create a ‘why so serious

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.710
sales initiative’ and put customer satisfaction
survey links at the bottom of every receipt.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.030
Or you could set a flat price for each kind
of repair and monitor how long cars are in

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.040
your shop with a detailed record system.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.200
And everyone likes appreciation, so giving
them /specific/ positive feedback for meeting

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.240
goals in good ways can help keep your shop
under control.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.320
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.910
SMART goals aren’t just for solo missions.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:08.080
If you’re a team of unstoppable super spies,
goals get everyone on the same page.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.150
But setting personal, individual project goals
for other people could lead to a mission breakdown.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.669
People have different priorities.

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:20.480
Your demolitions expert probably cares about
different things than your data guy.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.440
And no one likes directives from an out-of-touch
bureaucrat.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.301
Or you may underestimate what your teammates
are capable of and set a goal that’s not

00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:28.860
ambitious enough.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.589
After all, many people put more pressure on
themselves than anyone else does.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:37.759
Or you could target the wrong incentives,
and a pay bonus for the most missions completed

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:41.469
in a month could lead to team competition
instead of cooperation.

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:47.029
So, bringing everyone together to agree on
one overarching team goal and set some individual

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:48.889
goals will be motivating!

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:52.279
And it’ll keep people from working against
each other [like Mr. and Mrs. Smith.]

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:55.730
Even if your goals line up, no team is perfect.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:01.059
But clear communication, progress reports,
and feedback will help your mission run smoothly.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:05.260
And after all this goal talk, if you still
don’t exactly feel like you know what

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.889
you’re doing or know how to reach your dreams…
welcome to adulthood.

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:09.889
[Kidding.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:10.889
Sort of.]

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:13.430
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.440
No one knows everything.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.860
No one is perfect.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.860
And everyone’s gotta start somewhere.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.110
So, if you or your team miss it by that much,
it’s okay.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.730
The best thing to do is to learn from your
mistakes.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.790
And keep moving forward to go after those
goals!

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.029
So if you remember nothing else from today:

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:38.790
Reduce goal anxiety by setting a SMART goal
that’s both ambitious and realistic.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.070
Prioritize your goals.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.390
As long as you’re not just giving up, having
to table a goal isn’t a failure.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.150
It’s being smart about your time.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.990
Avoid mission breakdown.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:55.509
Work with your team to set group goals that
consider everyone’s priorities.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:56.940
Set the right metrics.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.439
Make sure your goal doesn’t incentivize
the wrong behavior and reward for A while

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.320
hoping for B.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.360
Next time, we’ll be talking about how to
get better at time management.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.779
Because we can all improve.

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:11.920
I know you’ve said “ehhh, just one more
episode” at least once in your life.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.329

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:18.910
these nice people and Thought Cafe is our
amazing animation team.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.220
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.160
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.920
channels like Healthcare Triage, where host
Dr. Aaron Carroll explains healthcare policy,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.510
medical research, and answers a lot of other
questions you may have about medicine, health,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.510
and healthcare.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.629
Also, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:44.970
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.970
love.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.300
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:49.589
