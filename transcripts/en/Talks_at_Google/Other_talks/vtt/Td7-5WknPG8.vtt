00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.490
MALE SPEAKER: So it's
my great pleasure

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.220
to introduce Bob
Frankston, who imagined

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.860
a world with a spreadsheet
before computers really

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.750
had a useful thing to do.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.330
And so it was world
changing, and I

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.140
think what's really
interesting is when

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.540
I met with Bob a couple weeks
ago and we start talking,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.630
we immediately got into
a really strong agreement

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.180
and a really good argument
all within about four minutes.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.299
And so I thought,
that's the kind of guy

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.132
I want to talk here.

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.002
So thanks for coming, Bob.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.150
I really appreciate it.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.900
BOB FRANKSTON: OK.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.570
As some people here
know, my history

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.455
goes back well before VisiCalc,
which is actually Dan's idea.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.431
I will go through history,
but let's start the talk.

00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.180
Hit the space bar.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
That's a good way
to move forward.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.010
So I'm going to start
at the end point.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.340
Both of the talk, where
the high-level issues are,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.760
and the sense that I
interested in the endpoints

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.080
of connections, and not all
the network crap in the middle.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.220
So the internet itself
is just a technique.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.970
It's the way we can use whatever
is available to communicate.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.690
The problem is that we
have all these people who

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.100
think the internet is important.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.640
That's thinking that there is
a thing called the internet.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.160
And they sort of have to
defend it and make it work.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.350
And for me, it's just
that stuff in the middle.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.550
I just start with
what you do with it.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.340
And you mentioned using
VisiCalc, some people at the St

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.300
Student Information
Processing Board

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.640
at MIT, which I
co-founded in '69, trying

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.720
to get people to use
computers back then.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.070
I had a sense they were useful.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.810
Nobody believed me.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.380
And this is that actually
the culture, the Project MAC,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.990
which is in the building that's
inside one of the Novartis

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.644
buildings now, which
is the attitude of how

00:01:55.644 --> 00:01:57.060
do we make this
technology useful?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.440
What can we do with it?

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.290
So I'm skipping outside my
talk, but for me the slides

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.560
are mainly a guide.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.160
They try to keep me on track.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.410
There will be lots of points
we can discuss later I'll

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.430
just mention.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.000
One of the big insights is
the least important thing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.040
we do is exchange content.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.290
Now that might sound
heretical, but how many people

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.120
have ever sent a
copy of Wikipedia?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.010
You just say the word Wikipedia.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.720
You refer to it.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.890
You never send it.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.010
And that's part of the secret
about what makes this work.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.170
Yet all our policies,
all our measures

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.770
of broadband and everything,
running out of internet,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.790
are based on the idea we're
shipping exabytes of data

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.305
through this one
router, which must

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:43.638
be in the middle of Kansas City.

00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:48.980
But for me, the internet is
really about opportunity.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.400
How do we create opportunity
to do things at the-- well,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.570
there's no real edge,
but outside of the net?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.110
And the other important
point is that the internet

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.000
is a discontinuity.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.260
When you read the classic
histories of in the internet,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.730
they start with the ARPANET
and have a packet radio.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.570
No, that's nonsense.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.020
Yes, the excellent
technologies were there,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.240
but the interent really
started from a very different

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.450
beginning.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.670
It was the revolt against
networking as a service.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.850
You didn't need a third
party along the way

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.640
to read your telegram
like a scribe

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.460
and repeat it down the line.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.490
You do it yourself.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.130
You just exchang these
meaningless bits.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.230
And one of the really horrendous
legacies we're still stuck with

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.930
is the idea the
carrier in the middle

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.720
must make a profit for
you to do anything.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.559
And I was reminded of this.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.600
I understand why companies
need to make a profit,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.410
the question is whether
that's the right model.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.440
For example, airlines.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.400
I don't have a better
idea for airlines.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.525
But the consequence
is I'm not going

00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:00.480
to be able to get to Los Vegas
tomorrow because airlines

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.070
no longer have enough
extra equipment.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.830
So basically, they
canceled my flight

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.020
because a gear was
stuck somewhere

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.880
and there's absolutely
no resilience.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.210
The whole system shuts down.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.020
And maybe airlines
have to do it.,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.829
but for us to use that
technology for networking

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.200
is absurd.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.300
So as I said, the
internet is a technique

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.090
for doing things ourselves.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.850
Now, I put in DIO
as a broader point

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.820
because doing it ourselves
doesn't mean you do it alone.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.570
It could be doing
it ourselves if you

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.630
have communities
that work together.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.380
But it's easy to just
think of DIY as opposed

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.906
to depending on a third party.

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:40.530
Do it yourself.

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:47.610
The other thing that we're
going to get to is once meaning

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.720
is outside the
network-- oh, I just

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.625
realized you're not
seeing my slides.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:55.000
MALE SPEAKER:
[INAUDIBLE] slides?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.960
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes,
there are slides here.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.650
I'm more coherent than I seem,
because the explanation is up

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.680
on the slides.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.889
Speaking of depending
on a third party

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.680
and not having eyes in
the back of my head.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.880
Ah, there it is.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.850
I won't go back to
the other pictures,

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.990
nor show my beautiful picture
of the trolley in the snow.

00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:20.783
That explains why you were
actually looking at me

00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:21.741
and seemed to be awake.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.810
I can go all the way back,
but that's not important.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.500
So there's where you
see DIY versus DIO.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.440
You wondered why I was-- OK.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.810
Do I seem more coherent
now that you can see it?

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.930
OK.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.300
So what does this mean?

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.760
This is really about taking
advantage of opportunities.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.650
And we're limited by
discovering what we can do.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.536
For example, voice over
IP was a discovery.

00:05:57.536 --> 00:05:59.160
Yes, we could get to
work in some cases

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.790
in the early studies, but how
can you do voice over a-- when

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.020
you lose your package,
you got high jitter.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.820
Just like TV.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.246
People thought we
need asynchronous TV.

00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:11.120
But some people were
creative and figured out

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.369
ways to take advantage
of opportunities.

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:14.535
Now it's not always obvious.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.890
The reason VoIP it
works now has nothing

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.156
to do with making VoIP work.

00:06:23.156 --> 00:06:26.640
It was the web that
gave us the capacity.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.720
If we try to make VoIP
work, we actually did.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.330
It's called SS7.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.354
Does anybody want to buy
a used phone network?

00:06:34.354 --> 00:06:35.645
It's too expensive to maintain.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.150
But the key is to have an
appropriate business model.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.170
And this is one of
the main messages.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.200
So we don't need a third party
the middle like the airlines

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.150
do.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.399
Have to run at the edge, to
only do what's profitable.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.190
It's sort of like
depending on the railroad

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.160
to get to a destination.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.740
Not many railroads are willing
to tracks up Mount Everest.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.180
So we want to get away from
this idea of the provider making

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.900
profit for us to do anything.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.620
The other problem we have with
the current business model

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.240
is that providers'
worst enemy, the people

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.430
they fear the most,
the existential threat,

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.960
are the customers.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.180
There's a customer
buying from Netflix

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.215
will remove all the
profit of selling content,

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:30.870
as the cable companies do now.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.200
And there's a slide show
I point to on my site

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.960
from the cellular industry
explaining that abundance

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.760
is the greatest threat.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.450
That if they don't
prevent abundance,

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.650
people are not going
to buy the services.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:54.714
So if you wondered why there's
a problem with broadband crisis,

00:07:54.714 --> 00:07:55.255
it's obvious.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.390
Giving the customers enough
capacity is a losing idea.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.670
So this is not sustainable.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.760
We need to have a
sustainable business model,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.880
and this is, again, Google,
since you use connectivity,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.015
to encourage capacity.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.350
As I said, we exchange
references, not contact.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.120
Capacity is not the
same as bandwidth.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.324
It turns out we have
so much capacity,

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:28.990
we're using, at the
first approximation,

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.630
0% of our capacity.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.059
And that's what's a
conflict of interest.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:39.230
So there is an
alternative model,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.669
which is the way
we fund sidewalks.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.750
The sidewalk owner
does not view the user

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.270
as a competitive threat.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.360
But people talk about
privatizing the Mass Pike.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.230
Then Route 30 becomes
a competitive threat.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.460
We already saw this in Detroit.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.919
There's a private
bridge in Detroit.

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:01.210
They try to keep the city
from building a public bridge

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.530
because it's competition.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.770
So you've really got to
be careful about what

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.960
incentives we create.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.890
Now the resource I describe
as ambient connectivity,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.850
and I use this term for the
idea of wherever you are,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.860
you could just
assume connectivity.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.800
Now this is sort of like
having open Wi-Fi everywhere,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.920
except I don't want to tie it
to any particular technology.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.460
Current Wi-Fi is much
better than it might be,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.770
but it's still a
problematic technology.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.455
But the key is to
be able to assume

00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:39.850
we're connected wherever we are.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.400
I'll get more into this.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.370
I add the word permissionless
because people somehow

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.420
seem to assume you've got to
show your credentials to prove

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.520
you can pay for it.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.460
But how many of you
have to show that you're

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.172
authorized to use a sidewalk?

00:09:54.172 --> 00:09:55.630
That's the exception,
not the rule.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.400
And the thing to realize is
this whole idea of networking,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.000
we so implicitly have a
provider-centric view.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.255
We talk about the network
as what's important,

00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:12.200
and how you maintain
the network.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.585
And as we'll see, our
language, our framework

00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:18.080
is infused with a
provider-centric view

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.070
of protocols and everything.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.610
What you have to do is
forget about the network.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.170
I want to be able to think
just about the relationships

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.570
between the two endpoints and
what I'm trying to accomplish.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.874
It should just work everywhere.

00:10:30.874 --> 00:10:33.290
Or you shouldn't have to log
into this or connect to this.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.790
Yes?

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.660
AUDIENCE: One of the
big struggles we've had

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.575
is that users want to be
able to define what they get

00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:44.110
from an ISP, and the ISP is
usually unwilling to commit.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.810
BOB FRANKSTON: We shouldn't
have the concept of an ISP

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.890
because the interent is not a
service that's being pumped out

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.940
of the salt mines in Louisiana.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.820
It's what we do with
the available resources.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.986
The internet is a technique.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.580
That's what I'm saying
about flipping the model.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.620
People assume they
have to ask the ISP.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.400
No, you're important.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.270
The ISP should come to you
and say, please, I want a job.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.460
Can I do anything for you?

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.260
I'm very interested
in how language works,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.385
so I have to use language
people are familiar with.

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:25.065
So I say open access, even
though words like that

00:11:25.065 --> 00:11:26.190
are still provider-centric.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.786
One of the big words we use,
terrible words, is broadband.

00:11:32.786 --> 00:11:33.535
What is broadband?

00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:39.414
AUDIENCE: Effectively, a
bigger pipe than the other.

00:11:39.414 --> 00:11:40.830
BOB FRANKSTON:
Well actually, it's

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.130
a technical term that comes
from radio technology.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.160
It turns out the companies that
extended the TV antennas up

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.020
the top of the mountain took the
broadband over the air signals

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.820
and put it on a coaxial
cable, versus baseband.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.505
And that became-- we're going
to give examples later--

00:11:57.505 --> 00:11:59.463
associated with a business
model because that's

00:11:59.463 --> 00:12:00.421
the way language works.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.870
And then it became
literally a contronym.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.120
Literally itself has
become a contronym.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.080
A contronym is a word
that's its own antonym.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.980
And the way language
works, literally fills

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.610
in the same slot
as figuratively,

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.590
so people tend to
confuse the two.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.839
So broadband we use to mean the
internet, when the internet is

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.380
really what you tunnel through
despite the broadband business

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.560
model.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.190
This is what makes it so
hard to talk about this.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.674
And I have to emphasize, I'm
talking about an architecture,

00:12:31.674 --> 00:12:33.090
not any particular
implementation.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:38.370
So when I talk about having open
Wi-Fi, that's just an example.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.400
It's one way to do it.

00:12:42.184 --> 00:12:43.975
What amazes me is how
often it's, oh, we'll

00:12:43.975 --> 00:12:46.490
give you wireless mesh.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.850
First, why do I say wireless?

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.800
A wire is just a wave
guide for signals.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.980
There's nothing
wrong with wires.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.135
And mesh is just a
particular technology.

00:12:56.135 --> 00:12:58.510
And if I've got a fiber that
takes me across the country,

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.870
why do I want a bucket brigade?

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.005
It's an economic
problem to solve,

00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:05.020
and technology's just a means.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.690
What we do have
to do is preserve

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.470
the magic of it just works.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.540
And that's the real
architectural goal.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.340
That's the power
of architecture.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.380
Network just disappears.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.344
And apps can use any available
means, including the QR codes.

00:13:21.344 --> 00:13:23.010
So if we're just
exchanging a reference,

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.850
I just give you a QR code.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.540
So one way to explain
this is our view

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.820
of the history of
what I call digital.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.070
Now when I say digital,
I mean discrete symbols.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.070
It doesn't mean 10 fingers.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.500
But the fact that we can
have these sharp distinctions

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.760
and you can regenerate
the meaning.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.720
That's the real value.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.950
The zeroes and ones are
going to be regenerated.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.100
But it's also alphabets.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.160
If I write letters,
even-- . pictographics.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.630
Hieroglyphics were
very distinct symbols.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.400
Little off, you can
guess what it is again.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.772
And that allowed the message
to be preserved over distance.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:00.855
You can carry the message.

00:14:00.855 --> 00:14:02.470
If it got a little distorted,
you can correct it.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.190
Smudged.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.049
But also over time.

00:14:05.049 --> 00:14:07.090
And we actually had some
forward error correcting

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.570
oral traditions,
but that's for when

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.580
you want a discussion
of details of language.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:19.370
But one of the legacies
of the early days

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.370
of inarticulate digital
is the telegraph.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.682
We had to use the wire to
keep the single contained,

00:14:25.682 --> 00:14:27.640
to maintain the relationships
between the bits,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.820
the endpoints.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.920
So it flooded our skies
with all these wires.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.410
Every call needed its own wire.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.460
And you think that's bad?

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.550
Even when we had
wireless, no wires,

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.790
we created virtual wires.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:49.310
This cockamamie idea of
single frequency signaling

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.950
creates scarcity.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.090
It's as if we said no
two people in the room

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.380
could wear a blue shirt
because it'll be confused.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.960
Interference is not a
property of physics.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.830
Waves pass through each other.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.246
Interference is another
word for confusion.

00:15:07.246 --> 00:15:09.120
So whenever anybody
talks about interference,

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.994
they're just saying
we're creating confusion.

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:14.770
If you use all the rich
data, and in a sense,

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.230
if you look at meaning
come from context,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.780
big data's fundamental.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.850
Information in isolation
is meaningless.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.790
Yet our
telecommunications system

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.800
is trying to
carefully preserve--

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.257
this is the
inarticulate digital.

00:15:28.257 --> 00:15:30.090
We have to carefully
preserve all this stuff

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.530
because-- it's a great
hack, by the way.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.070
The tuning fork was a
wonderful discovery back then.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.540
The fact it's been used to
compromise the Constitution

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.260
and prevent free speech,
well, collateral damage.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.970
The other reminder is that
business models-- again,

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.660
like broadband,
the business model

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:56.070
came from the accidental
properties of history.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.460
The single frequency
single hop signal

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.410
gave us the business
model of radio.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.070
And if I make it to CS this
year, I ask about radio,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.340
I've found Pandora is radio.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.902
Tubes and transistors
are no longer radio.

00:16:13.902 --> 00:16:14.735
Beware the language.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:22.940
The talking telegraph
really created havoc.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.290
We had this great technology.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.730
Digital can cover any distance.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.500
And then this guy
across the river

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.730
there disobeyed
his father-in-law,

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.940
stole an idea from
Elisha Gray, who

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.050
retired to West [INAUDIBLE], and
created the talking telegraph

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.910
using analog technology,
and made a mess of things.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.019
Distance now became difficult.

00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:47.060
Distance used to be easy.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.330
Telegraph would go
over any distance.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.190
Distance became hard.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.860
And with that explicit
understanding,

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.860
we could tune things, we could
tune knobs and all this stuff.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.550
But it was very hard to preserve
a signal across the street,

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.030
let alone across the country.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:10.520
So this guy Claude Shannon
did a lot of research,

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.849
created this whole
technology for how

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.960
to preserve a
signal within wire.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.990
Within the channel.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.411
He didn't use the term wire.

00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:19.160
He used a channel.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.050
It wasn't very abstract term.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:26.240
He called it information for
the same reason physicists,

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.540
we'll point out, like
to use words like work.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.130
Well we have giant
brains, all this notation,

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.320
anthropomorphic notation.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.660
We use the word communicate
as if these wires carried

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.980
our meaning.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.515
And we're still
living in that legacy.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.710
Matter of fact, here
it's more than a century

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.040
after that picture I
showed you of the wires

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.610
covering all the streets,
yet it's even worse.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.400
All we've done in a
century and a half

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.200
is learn how to
take all those wires

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.310
and bundle them up very neatly
into little tiny packages.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.380
And worse, we have
multiple bundles and wires

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.820
from competing
bundlers, or bunglers,

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.800
whatever you want to call them.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.320
And it's even worse.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.490
Inside each of those we
have virtual circuits

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.375
to maintain each conversation.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.140
Now how you can maintain a
business model of carrying bits

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.044
where there's no longer
any way to compete.

00:18:30.044 --> 00:18:31.460
In other words,
they're just bits.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.340
They're generic bits.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.360
How you differentiate.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.960
But the reason we
have the legacy

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.720
is we're still stuck
in stage two, the idea

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.030
that you need
pipes, pipes, pipes.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.690
And it comes out in many ways.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.210
One is carriers don't
want to become dumb pipes.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.200
Sorry.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.085
That's not the worst
of it, is the fact

00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:54.910
we don't need pipes anymore.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.580
Bits are all
self-identified, meaning

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.460
it's assembled
outside the network.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.820
We don't need pipes.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:05.790
Yet our business models
are still pipe-based.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.920
Now the digital technology
that gave us computers

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.411
did set the stage
for the future.

00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:11.971
But we first have
to-- again, this

00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:13.720
is why I brought up
the issue of language.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.460
How many people think physicists
should run the NLRB, National

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.500
Labor Relations Board, because
they understand what work is?

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.290
Why would a double
E be allowed to run

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.680
a school of communications
and the PR department?

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.090
Those people understand
communications.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.015
Apparently E's don't because
they confuse information

00:19:33.015 --> 00:19:35.690
in the Shannon sense.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.250
How much information is there
in not answering a question?

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.685
Or in a pause?

00:19:41.685 --> 00:19:44.060
There are people who spend a
lot of time figuring it out,

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.890
and you have to slap
them and say, no.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:45.990
That's a stupid question.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:54.282
Now this sets the stage for
what I'm calling stage three.

00:19:54.282 --> 00:19:55.990
Now we're very interested
in [INAUDIBLE],

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.870
but I took a class in spring
of 1973 from Mike Hammer.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.340
Does anybody remember Mike
Hammer, reengineering?

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.820
It was studying networks.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.570
So one of things we
studied was ALOHAnet.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.150
How many people here
know about ALOHAnet?

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.650
OK.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.050
It was a radio packet
network in Hawaii.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.820
Do It yourself packet network.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.450
There had been various
experiments integrating packet

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.692
networks, but I
remember ALOHA was

00:20:23.692 --> 00:20:26.780
the one we studied in class.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.430
And basically it was
what any hacker would do.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.960
It looks at a packet
and resends it.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.134
No big deal.

00:20:33.134 --> 00:20:34.550
Maybe it's the
latest temperature.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.383
You don't resend it.

00:20:35.383 --> 00:20:38.100
You just give them temperature.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.550
I mean, we called it a net.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.140
It was ALOHAnet, but it was a
network in the sense Facebook

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.680
is a network, or, sorry,
Google+ is a network.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.600
It's a social network.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.340
That's the problem
with language again.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.570
This is why I'm so
fascinated by language.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.580
The word network is
so general as to be

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.610
totally useless
for communicating.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.170
Worse than useless.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.914
It sort of like diplomacy.

00:21:03.914 --> 00:21:05.580
You can both use the
same word, but mean

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.663
entirely different things.

00:21:06.663 --> 00:21:09.760
But you think you're
talking to each other.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.150
And at the end of the class,
some other kid sitting next

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.540
to me-- this is May 1973,
did his baseband project.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.634
He took ALOHA and
put it on a coax.

00:21:18.634 --> 00:21:20.550
Now I wanted to do it
over the campus network,

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.758
it would have been broadband.

00:21:21.758 --> 00:21:25.170
But I didn't follow through,
so it doesn't count.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.800
But it was obvious
this is a great hack.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.980
2.994 megabits,
as he reminds me.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.400
That's Bob Metcalfe, you know.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.300
It was wonderful.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.190
But to get his Doctorate he
had to prove to the EE people

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.580
that it would perform well.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.860
Turns out he was wrong.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.630
It performed much better
than his thesis said.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:57.250
So how many of you are familiar
with the paradigms framings?

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.160
When you change a paradigm,
everything changes.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.940
So when Copernicus
did his little thing

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.442
of moving a reference
point 93 million miles,

00:22:05.442 --> 00:22:07.610
it was a nice
mathematical hack, and it

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.670
did make navigation easier.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.515
But it had two
side effects, which

00:22:11.515 --> 00:22:12.860
he wouldn't have anticipated.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.950
One, it destroyed
people's idea that they

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.200
were the middle of the universe.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.530
And that made it
very hard to accept.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.505
And I'm telling you
meaning is not fundamental,

00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:26.770
if you want a scary concept.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.590
The other thing it did was
give Newton his physics.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.030
Because suddenly you
could see a uniformity out

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.316
of all these disparate
things, and you just

00:22:35.316 --> 00:22:37.610
get a deeper understanding.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:42.990
And in that sense, what the
packet radios forced us to do

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.940
was learn how to preserve
meaning outside of the network.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.180
Discover what we can do
with the opportunities.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.830
And that, I argue, is the
real origin of the internet.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.230
Learning how to solve
problems ourselves,

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.990
learning the techniques for
using any available resource

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:07.170
as a way to communicate in the
human sense, not just EE sense.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.750
And that's why I say a
fundamental discontinuity,

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.180
yet we're still thinking
stage two because, as I said,

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.230
language, information,
communications.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.830
It just sounds just like the
railroads of the 19th century.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.990
And in fact, we have a
thing called the Federal

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.300
Communications Commission.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:30.090
What do they mean
by communications?

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.660
What's worse is they're
explicitly spun off

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.270
from the ICC, Interstate
Commerce Commission, which

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.180
managed railroads.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.610
Now that's gone.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.260
It's been replaced by the
Department of Transportation,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:48.440
which manages the
means we use to travel.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.560
It does not manage the
actual freight itself.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.920
In the meantime,
the FCC is there

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.422
telling us what words
we're allowed to use,

00:23:56.422 --> 00:23:57.880
how we're allowed
to run elections.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.460
Really weird.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.270
You'd think these people didn't
understand how to communicate.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.320
And we're still compromising
the First Amendment

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.230
by creating scarcity in order
to keep the business alive.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.230
So the internet happened when
we're interconnected the LANs.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.826
The LAN, you were , anywhere,
plugged into the coax,

00:24:13.826 --> 00:24:16.400
you were just there.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.440
But the consequence
of that was you

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.100
could not see beyond
the individual packet.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.280
So therefore, we had
to have a system--

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.480
and this is the real insight--
to separate TCP from IP.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.020
And it wasn't just
Vince or Bob Kahn.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.510
There were a number of others.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.630
David Reed locally,
and Dave Clark,

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.210
and all these other people.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.510
How do you preserve an
application relationship

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.370
independent, when you could just
exchange nothing above packets?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.930
And this where the
end-to-end argument.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.855
You had to have meaning
outside the application.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.340
The earlier slide said
TCP, mentioned explicitly.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:10.140
What TCP is, it says
transmission control protocol.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.070
Very interesting.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:17.394
Because if all you want
to do was make sure

00:25:17.394 --> 00:25:18.810
all the bits got
through, you keep

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.030
retrying til it gets through.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.640
But TCP was also protocol
for cooperatively

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.860
sharing the resources in the
middle by detecting congestion,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.370
by backing off.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.630
And what's amazing is
how well that worked.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:37.970
That it's really a social
protocol for sharing resources.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.210
It's not just a reliable
stream protocol.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.109
And basically, yes,
you can violate it,

00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.150
but if more than a few
people violate a collapse,

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.480
you get immediate feedback,
people used standard libraries.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.750
So it's a whole
interesting discussion

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.840
about why that works.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.634
And sociologists should
study this some more.

00:25:56.634 --> 00:25:58.550
And I won't go into
problems like buffer blow.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.945
There were lots of other issues.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.590
So where I come into this,
and this much prouder

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.950
than doing VisiCalc,
was home networks.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:15.970
The original triple play plan,
or n-tuple play. [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.320
is a good example.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.540
They would haul a
pipe into your house.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.852
They would put an a ATM
card cage in the basement.

00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:26.310
ATM was asynchronous
transfer mode.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.390
The base for DSL.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.460
I'll try to avoid too
much acronym soup.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.100
By the way, ADSL is interesting.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.460
You know why DSL exists?

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.140
For interactive TV.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.640
It was not created
for the internet.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.920
That was a later repurposing.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.642
There's a lot of
repurposing discovery.

00:26:43.642 --> 00:26:45.725
Hindsight history makes
things look so purposeful.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.260
People have a reason
for everything.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.460
But if you remember
at the beginning

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.920
when you had to run a separate
wire for reach relationship,

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.135
well those wires,
virtual wires were

00:27:01.135 --> 00:27:04.650
inside a pipe or any
other triple plays.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.820
Each phone line was
delivered to the card cage.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.610
In the early days, remember,
the phone companies

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.500
owned your phone.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.790
The service was
the conversation.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:21.020
It was not the wires
coming into your house.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.270
And therefore in
the 1950s, AT&amp;T had

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.232
to be sued to allow you
put a box around a phone.

00:27:27.232 --> 00:27:29.690
it was a kind of device called
the Hush-A-Phone compromised

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.730
the quality of the service and
dispersed their reputation.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.760
Later the Carterfone
allowed your equipment on,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.990
but the Hush-A-Phone, I think
was a more interesting case.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.980
Where the boundary
of the service is.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.700
And you can see the example
of how that works in practice.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.430
Carriers would want to
charge for each IP address

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.690
as if it were a phone number.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.840
You're going to pay
for each IP address.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.350
Since they looked
inside your house,

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.140
they can do things like
trying to ban webcams

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.275
because those were an
abuse of their service.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.570
It really [INAUDIBLE] home.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:14.124
Repurposing a video distribution
service, rethink connectivity.

00:28:14.124 --> 00:28:16.665
And today, the modern version
of that is called Google Fiber.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.570
And Google Fiber's
attitude is you can share.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.790
They're telling you what
you do with the bits.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:30.024
Now what company
would be so evil

00:28:30.024 --> 00:28:33.340
AUDIENCE: Are you referring
to the no servers allowed?

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.225
BOB FRANKSTON: No,
that the least of it.

00:28:35.225 --> 00:28:36.590
AUDIENCE: That is [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.881
BOB FRANKSTON: No I understand.

00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:39.270
Verizon had the same attitude.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.790
And the nice thing
about terms of service--

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.415
I'll be nice to the
FCC, so I won't say

00:28:43.415 --> 00:28:47.800
fuck them-- but back when I
was doing home networking--

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.525
and I'll get into
that-- I basically

00:28:49.525 --> 00:28:50.900
ignored the terms of service.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.200
Because the phone
companies said you're not

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.880
allowed to add more than
one PC to your home network.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.824
To the router.

00:28:57.824 --> 00:28:59.240
They're going to
tell you what you

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.256
can do with the device
inside your own home.

00:29:03.256 --> 00:29:04.645
AUDIENCE: So for
the Google Fiber

00:29:04.645 --> 00:29:06.460
no sharing, you mean
you can't [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.050
community over to watch TV?

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.900
BOB FRANKSTON: No,
it's not just watch TV.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.700
If I have a Google
Fiber programs,

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.470
I'm not allowed to share that
connection with my neighbor.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.109
Now I can understand
the business model point

00:29:17.109 --> 00:29:19.275
of view, which is why you
need a business model that

00:29:19.275 --> 00:29:22.220
doesn't create such
terrible behavior.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.090
But are there people
who try to bring,

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.480
like housing communities.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.590
You want to bring
broadband to the poor.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.280
You got a gigabit.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.940
That'll serve complete
apartment houses.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.040
Steve [INAUDIBLE] here
uses just a few megabits

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.260
to serve the
[INAUDIBLE] project.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.802
So that it's as if you-- yes?

00:29:41.802 --> 00:29:42.784
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:42.784 --> 00:29:44.765
[INAUDIBLE] one gigabit.

00:29:44.765 --> 00:29:45.890
BOB FRANKSTON: No it's not.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:46.840
You play the odds.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.240
Sure.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.200
But let people
discover what it does.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.910
AUDIENCE: Providers
tell you up front, yes,

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.493
you may have one
gigabit of bandwidth,

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:56.447
but you only have 5%.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.730
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.400
Let the people decide
and discover that.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.100
Sure.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.470
But it's sort of
like a sidewalk.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.090
We're going to limit how many
people can live in the house.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.740
This is where you have
the idea of discovering

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.430
what you can do from the edge.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.260
I don't want guarantees.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.100
The reason Skype can do video
is because Skype does not

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.950
promise to do video.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.590
If they promised video,
they could not do video.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.420
There are a lot of
counterintuitive aspects

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.920
here, which is why
you have to start

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.890
thinking from the
resource and from outside.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.870
And you also have some
interesting things,

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.770
like if you're
above a threshold,

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.200
you've got 10 people with 10
connections, you get 100 times

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.650
of capacity.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:50.080
But basically, if you have a lot
of DSL wires, you share them,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.620
you get disproportional
improvement.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.590
It's like a one-lane highway
will get more than three

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.270
times the traffic jams
of a three-lane highway.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.960
Because you start to use
the resource effectively.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.710
You fill in the holes,
you accept delays.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.520
And it all depends
on the application.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.186
We're just extending
the word Wikipedia.

00:31:07.186 --> 00:31:08.680
Who cares?

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.817
A gigabit is wonderful.

00:31:09.817 --> 00:31:11.150
Even if you've got a 10 megabit.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:11.890
Let me share.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:13.280
Let me decide.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.980
But it affects the
business model.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.470
That's why I keep coming
back to the funding model.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.610
I'm not saying it
should be given away,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.816
we need funding models that
work with societal needs.

00:31:23.816 --> 00:31:24.315
Yes.

00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:25.689
AUDIENCE: My one
big sticky thing

00:31:25.689 --> 00:31:31.560
here still is legal issues,
including intellectual property

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.060
enforcement.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.810
BOB FRANKSTON: No.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:33.950
But that's not in the wire.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.250
The bits are bits.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.770
They have no inherent meaning.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.220
This is a homeopathic
theory of communications,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.770
that bits have a memory
of their original intent.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.704
AUDIENCE: We share
a network connection

00:31:44.704 --> 00:31:47.040
that [INAUDIBLE]
multi-family home.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.500
And one person who was
visiting downloaded--

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.490
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.270
And this is why lawyers
are one of the greatest

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.790
threats to society.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.130
Basically, you
should move the trial

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.620
to Salem, which is
the appropriate venue

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.832
for such theories.

00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:04.730
AUDIENCE: My point is, we
do need, as a society, to--

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.440
BOB FRANKSTON: No.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.456
We have to come to the 20th
century, let alone the 21st.

00:32:10.456 --> 00:32:12.664
AUDIENCE: But isn't the
fundamental problem referring

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:17.083
to the fact that you're trying
to share the resource that

00:32:17.083 --> 00:32:20.040
has a huge level of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.790
BOB FRANKSTON: OK.

00:32:22.255 --> 00:32:24.380
Let me get through this
and I'll get to this other.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.805
The short answer is we're using
0% of the available capacity.

00:32:29.805 --> 00:32:31.805
So before you start telling
me about a shortage,

00:32:31.805 --> 00:32:34.300
start telling me where
that shortage is.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.200
When I've got three broadbands
coming through my backyard

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.430
and 1% of any one of them is
my full internet connection,

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.377
I've already got 100,000
times the capacity.

00:32:44.377 --> 00:32:45.210
So what do you mean?

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.510
Why do you tell me shortage?

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.750
Where's the shortage?

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:53.470
When the police will run a
fiber to their gun detection

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.050
sound thing, which only a few
kilobits you need for gunshot,

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.100
but deny anybody the
ability to share that.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.470
People now run fibers to
fire alarms and things.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.850
That are terabits of
capacity going unused.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.420
So before you run
about scarcity,

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.540
show me there's a problem.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.580
And the other example I won't
get into is meter reading.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.760
Now meter bits are special.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.350
They can't go over
the real internet.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.410
They need their own network
so the phone companies

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.110
can go back to triple-play
and collect money

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.450
for each meter read.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.565
And if you read the IEEE
numbers about how many gigabits

00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:32.896
of capacity and everything
they need to read the meter,

00:33:32.896 --> 00:33:34.520
they need a whole
fiber infrastructure,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.164
gigabits capacity.

00:33:36.164 --> 00:33:38.080
Though if you run the
numbers, you'll find out

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.320
it's less than a bit per second.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.520
But you need fiber.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.900
We're really beholden
to all these myths.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.590
So we need to start
from the edge.

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:50.470
And the other important
point is local connectivity

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.100
is more important than
distant connectivity.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.960
We became fixated
on long distance.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.400
Anybody old enough to remember
when long distance would

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.770
put fear in your hearts you'd
go bankrupt on a long distance

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:02.730
call?

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.700
That's because of the stupid
thing with analog telephony

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.199
that Al Bell did.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.092
With digital it's
no longer an issue.

00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:13.300
And even more important,
the people we know and stuff

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.120
are nearby.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.480
I was reminded of this.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.080
We're so hung up on
social media, the network.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.969
My son last night was
caught-- foolishly

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:25.670
decided to take a
long drive to Phoenix.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.570
And he was going to
go from Indianapolis,

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:31.050
or he was going from
Indianapolis to St. Louis.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.630
It turns out that
outside Terra Haute,

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:39.530
traffic was stopped for 12
hours in the middle of the snow.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.949
Online social media
is no information.

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:46.334
If he had CB radio with him,
and they almost took one,

00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:48.750
he could've found out from the
truckers and everybody what

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.666
was happening locally.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:57.780
And so you can get
across the country easily

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.230
to get to a website,
but you can't

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.880
send a message from your light
switch to the light fixture,

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.670
because that's still
using technology

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.020
Ben Franklin understood.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.740
We have TV controllers.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.832
There are so many
problems with you

00:35:15.832 --> 00:35:17.290
have to be on the
right LAN, you've

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.704
got to point the IR
at the right device.

00:35:19.704 --> 00:35:21.120
We do all this
work at a distance,

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.855
yet we don't realize
it starts locally.

00:35:24.855 --> 00:35:27.330
And then interconnect
these local islands

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.170
is how the internet happened.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.590
And that's important
lesson I built on.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.140
Actually, we're going to finish.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:38.250
So what I did with home
networking is I made it opaque.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.297
I was at Microsoft at the time.

00:35:40.297 --> 00:35:41.880
Basically I prototyped
it at my house.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.087
I did it for myself.

00:35:43.087 --> 00:35:44.920
And I try to do things
that are generalized.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.378
When Dan Bricklin
did a spreadsheet

00:35:46.378 --> 00:35:48.070
so he could do his
homework, we just

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.310
did a general version of it.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.300
So the NAT is a nice hack.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.219
So people couldn't
peek inside your house.

00:35:57.219 --> 00:35:59.010
They couldn't enforce
the terms of service.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.159
You could share all you want.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:03.700
On occasion they'll try to tell
you, and the problem is yeah,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.220
some people look
at the IP address

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.116
and all sorts of how bad ideas.

00:36:09.116 --> 00:36:10.990
Accuse you of being a
witch because your bits

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.192
don't look right.

00:36:13.192 --> 00:36:15.400
But the key is to make it
just so you can give people

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.200
the tools to use the
resources available.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.890
How many people worry about
how many gigabits of video

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.410
they're showing
within their home?

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.400
There's no cost.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.110
It suddenly becomes expensive
once you get outside the home.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.790
So the benefits to the ownership
is you get as many IP devices

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.650
as you want.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:38.110
There's not scarcity of IP
addresses, no meter running.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.260
And right now we ca run
gigabits in the home.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.130
Remember it used to be ten
megabits was very expensive.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.280
Modems used to be
$300 for kilobits.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.430
But we're not quite there.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.820
We still have this perimeter
security, these complex rules.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.574
Instead of abstracting security,
making the application.

00:36:53.574 --> 00:36:55.490
We still think it's a
property of the network.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.420
And these all long discussions
in their own right.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.210
And we still don't
understand generic bits.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.610
We have USB, we have SATA we
have FireWire, we have HDMI.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.595
All these special packets,
as if they're are all

00:37:08.595 --> 00:37:11.197
so special and different.

00:37:11.197 --> 00:37:13.280
I did this display port
here because that's really

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.450
an application protocol
which we should be pushing,

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.730
but instead we're
stuck with HDMI,

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.820
which is equivalent to
the old digital telephone.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.360
Sort of faux digital.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.080
So with home control
we can learn by doing.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.970
But people still
think it's special

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.850
because it's within a home.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.930
It's behind a NAT.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:40.750
When it's really just the
example of a do it yourself

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.070
environment.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.910
We have discovered,
for example, want

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.860
to solve a problem
connecting devices?

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.380
One thing from the edge is, v6
is a dead issue at this point.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.830
Instead we use v4
reflected to the cloud.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.000
Which I think is a terrible
idea, but it works.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.085
It's an example of you
go with what works.

00:38:02.832 --> 00:38:04.400
But I won't dwell
on that either.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.032
Another topic.

00:38:07.032 --> 00:38:08.990
But we still use wires
to define relationships.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.030
So how do we move
beyond the home?

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.020
The answer's very simple.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.895
We do what we did with
the original internet.

00:38:18.926 --> 00:38:20.550
We basically interconnect
this islands.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.800
We've already tunneled
between the islands.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.880
When you get a quote,
"broadband connection",

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.099
you're really tunneling out
of your home through telecom.

00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:30.640
They own the other
end of the tunnel,

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.810
but that's a temporary
historical accident.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.710
We won't go into
why it happened.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.650
But we can take the
same ownership perimeter

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.290
and expand it out
from your home.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.990
So if you and your
neighbors share,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.930
which some people are already
doing, an apartment house,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.630
you can get many benefits.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.050
To get two major benefits.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.540
One is cost savings.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.230
You share the capacity.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.970
But the other thing is you
can get permissionless ambient

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:56.940
connectivity.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.490
You can now do all
those IP-based devices.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.700
You can buy some now, but the
problem with perimeter security

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.814
makes them very
brittle and fragile.

00:39:05.814 --> 00:39:07.730
AUDIENCE: It depends on
what the perimeter is.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.140
In our building we
run our own services.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.670
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah,
But do you have

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.956
a WEP or other authentication?

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.480
AUDIENCE: It's
been years since I

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.450
was using any of those services.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:21.810
BOB FRANKSTON: No,
but the answers is--

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.435
AUDIENCE: A server
you can [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:23.435 --> 00:39:24.747
BOB FRANKSTON: Right.

00:39:24.747 --> 00:39:26.330
You have that, but
what you want to do

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.440
is at least be able to
have devices just connect.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.320
I'm glad to see Google does
not have an agree screen.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.600
But the problem is you get
things like this at Jet Blue.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.237
Now can somebody
explain why first I

00:39:40.237 --> 00:39:43.055
have to call my lawyer
before I can call my lawyer?

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.020
There's something wrong there.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.590
I've already the
airline terminal.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.020
I've already agreed to much
worse things they could do me,

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.850
yet they have me type agree.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.710
This is something
everybody should

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.285
do what they can to
get rid of those.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.030
And again, if you
ask people fear,

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.280
they'll say child pornography.

00:40:08.174 --> 00:40:09.715
They don't have any
better idea, it's

00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:12.826
just they've
learned this mantra.

00:40:12.826 --> 00:40:14.200
But if we paid
for infrastructure

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.695
like we do roads
and sidewalks, we

00:40:15.695 --> 00:40:18.600
wouldn't have a need to shut
things down just for revenue.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.605
AUDIENCE: Will you
accept, especially

00:40:20.605 --> 00:40:23.370
in neighborhoods like where
my house is, that there

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.371
are thieves, drug dealers,
all sorts of criminals using

00:40:27.371 --> 00:40:30.766
those public rights of way
to get by with no record

00:40:30.766 --> 00:40:32.640
that they passed because--

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.320
BOB FRANKSTON: You mean you
let people walk by your house

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.510
without signing an agreement?

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.236
And without paying you?

00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:39.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.964
Well the ping is a
totally different issue.

00:40:41.964 --> 00:40:43.380
BOB FRANKSTON:
Well ask Rand Paul.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.232
He'd demand--

00:40:44.232 --> 00:40:46.190
AUDIENCE: You have a very
different expectation

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:50.010
of how freely usable for
potentially illegal activities

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.880
a sidewalk is, compared to--

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.810
BOB FRANKSTON: And
this is what's amazing.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:01.370
We're lucky by accident
in the Constitution days

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.720
when people were really
pissed off at the king,

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.980
so they wrote the
free speech thing in.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:13.440
But every opportunity since, the
fear is so-- it's spelled NSA.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:20.020
And yes, it's amazing
how people fear

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.477
what they don't understand yet.

00:41:21.477 --> 00:41:23.810
Which means you're not going
to get any discontinuities,

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:25.559
and you're not going
to get any surprises.

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:26.770
Yes.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.330
But an important part
of the whole lecture,

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:32.080
why the First Amendment works.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.780
Why things work despite the
fact that crossing a street

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.040
is too dangerous to do.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.040
So if we fund the
infrastructure-- again,

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.530
as I keep saying-- as you do
sidewalks, these problems go.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.000
The reason for putting up
a wall, putting fear aside,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.900
financial reasons go away.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.160
Because it's so cheap,
you pay for it once

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.720
like a home network.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.560
And then you create opportunity
to discover [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.090
We haven't even started
to explore what we can do.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.650
Because we can do high
value applications.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:07.630
Like at home control.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.920
I don't know where my
slide is, but home control

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.260
is a wonderful example,
because we just

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.090
start to discover what we
can do with connectivity.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:25.290
But one of the lessons I
learned to total control

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.550
is that we could do
high value applications.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.926
We call them trophy homes.

00:42:29.926 --> 00:42:31.550
There are lighting
scenarios, all these

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.400
complicated high value stories.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.010
TVs coming down, the
shades, all this stuff.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.340
We can't do light switches.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.310
OK?

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.610
That's the problem here.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.690
Without permissionless
ambient connectivity,

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.822
simple things become hard.

00:42:44.822 --> 00:42:46.030
It's not just permissionless.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:50.330
The DNS, the current-- you
must ask ICANN for permission.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:51.780
There are lots of
other problems,

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.350
but if we solve the
financial problems,

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.296
we then have an incentive
to solve problems.

00:42:56.296 --> 00:42:57.795
We introduce
resilience to the edge.

00:42:57.795 --> 00:43:00.017
You connect through
an access point.

00:43:00.017 --> 00:43:01.600
You're walking down
the street, you've

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.580
got Comcast and all these
others connected to,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.930
and then Google
Maps stops working.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.840
Because one access
point got stuck.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.790
Authentication chain,
somebody broke it.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.560
The protocols of the
edge aren't resilient.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.460
So there's a lot of work
to do better protocols

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.250
and have resilience
of the whole network.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.220
Not meshy, necessarily.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.220
That's just technology.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.940
But resilience.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.455
So the old model,
we assume value

00:43:24.455 --> 00:43:27.360
is created inside the network.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.980
Thus we could fund the
network out of the revenue.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.830
And that's where the
cable TV companies are.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.650
They own the pipes,
they sell resources,

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.000
just like railroads sold rides.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.230
If you go to Netflix
that collapses,

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.730
which creates the conflict.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.370
Fortunately there's
a new business model,

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:46.160
which is the one I keep saying.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.440
Just pay for the wires.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.240
They're so cheap.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.660
You put them in once.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.330
It's amazing how inexpensive.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:56.080
And if we didn't
put the fiber in,

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.690
we would have been doing
gigabits over copper.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:02.990
DSL was running
megabits 25 years ago.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:04.970
Now it's copper,
right, so not pairs.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.250
You don't follow DSL rules.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.830
You be very innovative, you
do the bundles as a whole.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:15.480
And at this point, one way
to use copper is to sell it.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.840
Less copper and buy fiber.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.560
I don't care.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.770
I'm just saying the economics
is what drives Moore's law.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.290
And then we won't have the need
to exclude people for no reason

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.449
other than forcing
people to pay.

00:44:29.449 --> 00:44:31.240
Imagine sidewalks, the
paywall around them.

00:44:33.784 --> 00:44:36.200
To show you the value of this,
let's look at a case study.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.050
Philips Lifeline is one of
the local companies there now

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:40.120
in Framingham.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.560
They started locally.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.310
And initially they
just had the radio

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:50.500
from the device going to a
phone and it would dial up.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.984
It worked well enough
for the purpose.

00:44:52.984 --> 00:44:54.650
Hopefully the phone
line was not in use,

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:55.270
and all the other things.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.728
But they put it
before, and you can

00:44:56.728 --> 00:44:59.550
get it to work enough
times to be useful.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:03.300
Now people are going to the
next stage, which they carefully

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.350
set up connections
to cell phone.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.995
If you set up the Bluetooth
right and use the right

00:45:07.995 --> 00:45:10.620
phone, and you've paid your
bill, and the matter of--

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.720
and you [MUMBLING].

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.670
It can work.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:17.880
But the problem without
permissionless ambient

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.030
connectivity is the
default is failure.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.120
Shouldn't the default
be to just work?

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.020
And that's really
what I'm getting to.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.239
The idea that we want
just works connectivity.

00:45:29.239 --> 00:45:30.780
Now there are no
guarantees, and this

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.670
is why the VoIP
story is important.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:34.310
Because we can
get voice to work.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.360
It turns out Skype works
much better over lines

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.110
that the traditional
phone companies can't

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.800
use because their
protocols are all

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.530
brittly dependent upon the
network doing everything right,

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:45.910
preserving a path.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.810
Turns out cleverness
can make up for a lot.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.904
So this is why so important
are the incentives

00:45:51.904 --> 00:45:52.945
and create opportunities.

00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:57.220
And then there's a
whole discussion, which

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.300
I won't get into,
is then we can start

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.810
rethinking the current internet.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:02.601
For example, the Post
Office, I understand,

00:46:02.601 --> 00:46:05.262
is routing far better than
any of the internet people.

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:06.720
Because it try to
send mail to you.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.920
It sends mail to a place.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.030
That's its job.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.560
You tell your friends
where you are.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.000
So I can go through,
if anybody wants to,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.950
the other big topic we could
do is where are the smarts.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.070
Smarts are valuable.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.111
So people want to
own the smarts.

00:46:23.111 --> 00:46:24.610
But if you go into
a restaurant, you

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:27.189
don't want your
wait person knowing

00:46:27.189 --> 00:46:28.230
what you're going to eat.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:32.120
You'd like to have
some say in the matter.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.140
So I won't go into
the challenges,

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:39.450
but obviously there's a
telecom industry which exists

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.700
and to rightfully sees
this as a deadly threat.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:46.920
We have an FCC, which is
trying to transition to IP, as

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.690
if they're desperate attempt
to keep us in stage two.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.610
By simply saying IP
is the new phone wire,

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.666
but everything else is the same.

00:46:55.666 --> 00:46:57.510
You don't transition.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.940
You let the whole thing
fade into the sunset.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.280
At some point nobody's
going to care about it.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.870
You resell the facilities.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:07.020
And want does one do
with lead acid batteries?

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.550
How do you decommission them?

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.800
There might be a lot of money.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.130
Somebody find a good use
for lead acid batteries.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:15.415
You'd make a lot of money.

00:47:15.415 --> 00:47:17.040
AUDIENCE: They recycle
them, I thought.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:17.998
BOB FRANKSTON: As what?

00:47:17.998 --> 00:47:19.940
Maybe they do, but
I'm just saying.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.740
The whole internet thing
is just in the infancy.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.390
Everything I read about
it is very special hacks.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:27.870
There's no general connectivity.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.905
But then again, these
long discussions-- I

00:47:29.905 --> 00:47:34.532
just wanted to introduce
these as ideas at this point.

00:47:34.532 --> 00:47:36.490
I can also, if you want,
go to the other slide,

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.823
which I'm proud of, is how
do we run out of the internet

00:47:38.823 --> 00:47:40.965
when it's just a technique?

00:47:40.965 --> 00:47:45.800
After hacking at night
here, went to Union Square

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.650
for French toast.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:51.455
And I was told we're
out of a French toast.

00:47:54.134 --> 00:47:56.050
We asked, said are you
out of bread, milk too?

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:58.320
He said the guy didn't
know how to make it.

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.130
And that's really
those wires are,

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.890
is running out of internet.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:03.300
So any questions?

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.300
Anybody confused?

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:04.980
Anybody awake?

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.970
AUDIENCE: So what happens
to your do it yourself

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:15.970
home small community
network when it breaks?

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:19.303
BOB FRANKSTON: What happens
if your water pipe breaks?

00:48:19.303 --> 00:48:20.719
AUDIENCE: Well, I
get it serviced.

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:21.552
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.

00:48:21.552 --> 00:48:22.920
So we'll have the new plumbers.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.586
And in fact, I'm
actually trying to find

00:48:24.586 --> 00:48:25.850
people who want to start.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.350
In other words, the
point I'm making

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.900
is I'm actually in favor
of business, capitalists,

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:30.980
and all this.

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:33.130
It's just you've got to
have rational businesses,

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.460
and the model changes.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:41.350
If you want to read a book
"Railroaded", by Richard White.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.940
It's a wonderful
story because it

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.966
tells how the railroads in
the West-- this is opposed

00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:48.340
to the ones in the East, which
have different densities--

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.770
were never financially viable.

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.220
That's why you've got the FCC.

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.930
Or subways in New York
were never viable.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:00.130
Each infrastructure, you have to
look at how these centers work,

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.350
what's the business model?

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.360
Instead of just
continuing forward.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.990
So yes, if we're viewing
a time and materials

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.862
model as a business,
we need plumbers.

00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:10.820
Of course they're a time
and material business.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.790
Your plumber does not charge
you for the cost of water

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.650
at the price of whisky.

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:20.020
When you buy flour you
don't pay for the cake.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.467
So you have to understand
where the values is added.

00:49:22.467 --> 00:49:23.300
Question back there?

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.790
The first step, one thing to
do, and people are already

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:33.460
doing it, the first step is
education and understanding.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.010
But if you're in
an apartment house,

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:37.430
get your friends and
neighbors to basically make

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:39.210
that a connected zone.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.090
Because petitioning
the city is hard,

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.400
because there's too much
education, the language,

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.650
everything makes it very hard.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.490
How can you even
talk about the FCC

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:52.480
when they were created to
keep a business model alive?

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.340
They're not a technology
They were designed

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.530
as part of a deal
with AT&amp;T to make

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:03.930
AT&amp;T viable as the stewards
of our ability to communicate.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:06.500
Things have sort of
gotten out of whack.

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.950
And they also got
a right to do it

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.440
based on spectrum allocation.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.900
But you understand
how hard it is

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.358
to get people to
think differently,

00:50:13.358 --> 00:50:16.010
but if you change economics,
if your building--

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.710
and there are a
million buildings-- so

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.085
if you start to
get your building

00:50:19.085 --> 00:50:21.370
to be a connected zone,
and work out from there,

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.500
repeating the history
of the internet,

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.795
you start to get to an
alternative which is viable.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:33.364
And I think that's the starting.

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:37.188
AUDIENCE: When you start to
get, having been involved

00:50:37.188 --> 00:50:39.602
in small building
connectivity zone

00:50:39.602 --> 00:50:42.520
efforts over a couple of
decades, problems you have

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.707
is still, as far as I
know, too much expertise.

00:50:45.707 --> 00:50:46.540
BOB FRANKSTON: Yeah.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.840
If you want a
problem, it's really

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.640
a problem in California,
the Bay Area.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.690
Too many people who
understand too much.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:56.580
That's my parallel to put
in fiber, ripped out fiber.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.590
So yes.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.496
It's a matter of venue
shopping and set example.

00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:04.352
AUDIENCE: But more than this,
plumbing isn't a simple thing.

00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:07.584
But plumbing was simplified so
that it could become a trade.

00:51:07.584 --> 00:51:10.078
And by having it
established as a trade,

00:51:10.078 --> 00:51:12.822
regular people can become
people that maintain plumbing.

00:51:12.822 --> 00:51:14.030
You need that for networking.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.200
BOB FRANKSTON: Well
actually, remember,

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.741
I did that already
for home networks.

00:51:19.116 --> 00:51:20.866
When I first started
doing home networking

00:51:20.866 --> 00:51:23.469
in '95, think of
the reaction I got

00:51:23.469 --> 00:51:25.760
when I said people are going
to maintain their own home

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.175
networks.

00:51:28.175 --> 00:51:29.730
So I did a couple things.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:34.160
First thing, remember I had this
position having been in a class

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.466
where we were doing this stuff.

00:51:35.466 --> 00:51:37.090
So I knew there was
nothing hard there.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.194
Nothing secret.

00:51:38.194 --> 00:51:39.860
I just had to remove
all the things that

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:44.149
made it hard like configuring IP
addresses and things like that.

00:51:44.149 --> 00:51:45.190
I've learned a lot since.

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:47.990
There's a lot of ways they
can make it even simpler.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.990
So yes.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:52.210
Part of it is this is why I talk
about the connectivity of net

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:57.150
routing I compare with crossing
a river by jumping on icebergs.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.390
Turns out we have bridges.

00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.630
Just use the bridges.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:02.760
It's like the Post Office
delivers to addresses.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.590
So insights like that
make things much simpler.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:09.140
All hubs and routers
should be self-diagnosing.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.821
But until we have a market
incentive to do this,

00:52:12.821 --> 00:52:14.570
it's going to be hard
to make that happen.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.360
Unfortunately, I
was at Microsoft.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.920
I was able to keep
them, and I purposely

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.126
made sure they had no
way to monetize it.

00:52:23.126 --> 00:52:25.340
To control it.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.304
But they did get value
out of the connectivity.

00:52:27.304 --> 00:52:29.345
Just like Google has a
value out of connectivity.

00:52:29.345 --> 00:52:33.680
The more people can connect--
even if 99% of the traffic

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:37.540
is local, you can still start
to offer all these new services

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.130
and these new innovations.

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:40.730
But I am actively
looking for people

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:44.780
to work with who do want to
do business in both educating

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.620
people on how to
do it themselves

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.920
and providing the
appropriate expertise.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.010
So yes.

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:53.960
I don't expect most people to
want to do their own networking

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:58.700
or build their own networks,
but there's no reason

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.124
that it has to be hard.

00:53:00.124 --> 00:53:01.040
We're just used to it.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.470
The same as DNS.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.930
We have this whole
legacy because so much

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:07.220
of today's internet goes
back to the mainframe

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:13.040
days, port numbers, all these
issues, which are legacies.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:19.880
We've learned a lot since we
first did the current internet.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:20.807
Yes.

00:53:20.807 --> 00:53:22.230
AUDIENCE: So, to
[INAUDIBLE] idea

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:23.729
up, you just have
to make it easier.

00:53:23.729 --> 00:53:27.520
But you mentioned a problem
being firewalls and such.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.068
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.

00:53:29.068 --> 00:53:34.320
AUDIENCE: One of the [INAUDIBLE]
benefits of that is I

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.325
think at one time if you
put a Windows computer

00:53:37.325 --> 00:53:40.790
on the public [INAUDIBLE], it
would compromise in 10 minutes.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.129
Definitely less [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:43.129 --> 00:53:43.920
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.600
And when I first did it,
what I was saying is OK,

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.330
v4 closed the ports by default.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:57.580
But IPv6 or IPsec, we
wouldn't be stupid.

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.530
We designed it to be aware.

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:01.030
Now it turns out
we're still stupid,

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.870
but that's another issue.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.745
But we can't depend
upon permanent security.

00:54:05.745 --> 00:54:11.750
So now anybody know the
Maginot Line in France?

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.540
And how how well
it worked for them.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:17.900
Now it turns out Andre Maginot
actually was not stupid.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.050
He knew you still
needed an army.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:21.990
But he made a mistake.

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.901
He died.

00:54:23.901 --> 00:54:25.400
And the politicians
then said, army?

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.500
We don't need no army.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.250
We've got a wall.

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:30.570
So people are building
in these hyper things.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.010
But look at Google's problem.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:34.820
Chromecast is on
the wrong network.

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.190
The device doesn't work.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.460
So the answer is yes.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.487
We have to first have a
better security model.

00:54:43.487 --> 00:54:45.570
Because when you go to
Starbucks that same machine

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.000
gets connected.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.880
That's based at the
application level,

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.770
the software level doesn't
depend on the firewall.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.020
In my model, even if you
have permissionless security,

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.980
you still can have
legacy stuff protected.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.173
So I'm not saying we
get rid of all that.

00:55:01.173 --> 00:55:02.423
I'm looking new opportunities.

00:55:05.287 --> 00:55:06.745
AUDIENCE: One of
the big incentives

00:55:06.745 --> 00:55:09.970
to have an apartment
network, basically.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:13.340
A small community
network when I was

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.356
having a college-ish
lifestyle, was

00:55:15.356 --> 00:55:20.665
that we could have our server
serving the copies of our CDs

00:55:20.665 --> 00:55:22.225
to us [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:22.225 --> 00:55:23.910
Now that isn't done anymore.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.374
Maybe it's done centrally.

00:55:25.374 --> 00:55:28.122
Do you see obvious
ways that Google

00:55:28.122 --> 00:55:31.970
could enable that
sort of community hub

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:36.017
when we're otherwise serving.

00:55:36.017 --> 00:55:37.350
BOB FRANKSTON: It's interesting.

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:39.736
One of the things that
Western Digital is selling

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.360
is a personal cloud,
which is basically

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.889
a disk in your house
as a server, Pogoplug.

00:55:43.889 --> 00:55:46.180
A lot of people doing it, so
I can easily see products.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:52.720
Because if you want to
watch multi-screen 3D

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.486
ultra high definition video,
it would be nice to cache

00:55:56.486 --> 00:56:00.340
on a server right
in the building.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.220
It's interesting.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.750
This is sort of a
Maraschino cherry problem.

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.915
Maraschino is you take a cherry,
take all the cherry-ness out

00:56:06.915 --> 00:56:09.310
of it, then add it back.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:11.790
And in a sense, we've done
such a good job of conquering

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:15.730
distance, we have to
put locality back in.

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:16.605
But that's pragmatic.

00:56:16.605 --> 00:56:17.570
I mean, there are two
reasons to [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:18.720
One is performance.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.960
And fine, put a
cache server there.

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.500
You can put that in a box.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:27.910
Chrome PCs should be able to
work with local cache as well

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:28.490
as remote.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:29.967
By the way, a little footnote.

00:56:29.967 --> 00:56:31.300
Be careful about the word cache.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.280
Sometimes you'll
explicitly put it there.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.290
You want to make sure this
information is there in case

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:39.650
you get disconnected versus
just for performance.

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.699
You've got multiple issues.

00:56:41.699 --> 00:56:43.240
So you can easily
have protocols that

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.510
allow peer sharing locally.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:47.000
This is content-centeric
networking.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.440
So lots of reasons for doing it.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:52.470
But you also want your
thermostat, your other devices,

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:56.040
to work within your house when
your connection further out

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.560
goes down.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.510
So we have to understand
that the relationships are

00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.730
separate geographically.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.260
So there are reasons for
having geographic proximity.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.370
Sometimes I want a
light switch to say turn

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:09.540
on the light in this room.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.950
And you might use techniques
like IR not for the message,

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:14.980
not for sending a
message, just so you

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.180
know what room you're in.

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.710
Again, that's why
I'm saying we have

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:23.400
to rethink a lot of what the
internet is as opportunity.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.765
And the distance
stuff, yeah it's nice,

00:57:25.765 --> 00:57:28.730
but we forgot there's
a physical world there.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:31.420
CB radios, we need to
do virtual CB radios.

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:37.980
So next my son is stuck on
I-70 outside of Terra Haute,

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.680
the truckers and stuff have a
local social network, not just

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.570
CB radios.

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:44.740
Though it's probably
nice that nobody else

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.725
has CB radios
anymore, knowing them.

00:57:47.725 --> 00:57:50.266
AUDIENCE: You made a comment at
the beginning about something

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:54.904
like most [INAUDIBLE]
involved in sharing.

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:57.335
BOB FRANKSTON: Well, we
don't exchange content.

00:57:57.335 --> 00:57:58.825
We exchange references.

00:57:58.825 --> 00:58:00.292
Is that what you're saying?

00:58:00.292 --> 00:58:01.250
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:02.000
I was trying to--

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.570
BOB FRANKSTON: When I say
Wikipedia instead of giving you

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:04.250
a copy of Wikipedia?

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.990
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:06.581
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.

00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:07.830
You want me to expand on that?

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:09.280
That's a very interesting topic.

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.260
Because I used to give
my talks and ask people

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:16.130
how much do we compress the
Encyclopedia Britannica?

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:18.310
And I say to an ISBN number.

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:22.000
And if you're a
communication theorist,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.990
you want to fit it
into the old model,

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:26.740
you say, well the
ISBN is a dictionary

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.350
just like any of the coding
we use is a dictionary.

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:32.377
But remember, in
communication theory,

00:58:32.377 --> 00:58:33.710
you have out-of-band signalling.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:36.293
You have an out-of-band clock,
which enables a three kilohertz

00:58:36.293 --> 00:58:38.315
line to carry more than
three kilohertz because

00:58:38.315 --> 00:58:40.070
of precise timing.

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:42.017
But then I decided
that's nonsense.

00:58:42.017 --> 00:58:42.600
it's too hard.

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:47.630
It's really that we're just
making references to things.

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.540
And really that's
what language is.

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:51.470
You send URLs.

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:55.880
Now URLs have URL problems.

00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.710
And then, so your effective
capacity is meaningless.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:02.350
This is why clocking the number
of bits of value is bad enough.

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:03.830
It's already inversed.

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:07.570
The longer the movie, the
less valuable each bit is.

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:09.010
But you can't even measure.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:12.130
Same movie can be
a terabit or it

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:15.311
can be ten bits depending
on whether you just

00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:16.810
need a reference
or you need a copy.

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:25.410
My mother wanted to send a
toy to her grandson in Seattle

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:26.420
from New York.

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.280
I said, fine.

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.716
I'll have it there in an hour.

00:59:29.716 --> 00:59:32.090
I returned it to Radio Shack,
gave my brother the number,

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.131
and he bought it for him.

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:42.776
AUDIENCE: The bit
usage, bit used driver

00:59:42.776 --> 00:59:45.332
has been people watching
movies and such.

00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:47.800
BOB FRANKSTON: It actually
turns our that's not that big.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.050
That's what Akamai is about.

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:50.330
They're cached locally.

00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.080
There are two ways
it's not a big thing.

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.420
Number one, it's cached locally.

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.280
Number two, Netflix
does the compression

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.270
that the originally
DSL people only envy.

00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:01.420
So at two megabits, they can
give you a high definition

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.130
experience.

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.880
You don't really care
[INAUDIBLE] picture.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.630
You want to enjoy the movie.

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.739
A cute idea would be
to put a camera on,

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.530
and if you're enough
feet away from the TV,

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:12.785
they'll de-res it
because you're not

01:00:12.785 --> 01:00:14.035
going to see the extras reses.

01:00:14.035 --> 01:00:18.550
When you come closer-- the point
is there are no rules here.

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:20.002
AUDIENCE: But my
point about that

01:00:20.002 --> 01:00:24.616
is that is a lot of what
people consume from an ISP.

01:00:24.616 --> 01:00:26.782
BOB FRANKSTON: Well, consume
is an interesting word,

01:00:26.782 --> 01:00:27.204
but we'll put that aside.

01:00:27.204 --> 01:00:28.050
Yes.

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:33.240
AUDIENCE: A lot of how they're
sending bits or receiving bits.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.680
What we've found with
the service I work on

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.080
is that if you call something
caching rather than keeping

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.260
a copy, then the content
owners are much more

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:46.805
willing to allow you to have
a copy on the client side.

01:00:46.805 --> 01:00:48.500
Therefore, community
networks that

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.440
merely cache the video in
ways that the [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.000
BOB FRANKSTON: Yes.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.570
Our language, our legal system.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:59.410
Well, our legal system is
still in the 13th century.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:01.600
Instead of science,
which tests ideas,

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.710
our legal system proves
things by example.

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:07.750
Not that I have anything
against lawyers,

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:10.980
but I have something
against lawyers.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.580
OK.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.430
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.
