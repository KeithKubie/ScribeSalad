00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.700
MAN: Whoever it is you
are, whatever it is you

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.237
want, I can get it for you.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:05.671
I know this isn't personal.

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.006
It's just business.

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:09.876
Try to negotiate
with me again and I'll

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.844
have your tongue cut out.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:15.214
WOMAN: Since we brought him in
off the Andrew Hall kidnapping,

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.419
he's given up a total of 23 safe
houses all over the Caucasus.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.254
We will waste a month
looking into that many.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.822
Desiree is the only one
that can narrow down

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.159
the operational window quickly.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.660
I need you to
help me ID someone.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.529
I'm not doing anything
until I talk with my family.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.767
I will arrange a call
after you ID this man.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.534
You can trust me.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:36.769
Do you know him?

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.672
No.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.340
Well, that's not bad.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.842
Try an autumn filter on that.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.644
Pictures are good, man.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.880
They help us remember.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.014
There's only one
kill I have I don't

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.548
need a picture to remember.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.350
Yeah, which one?

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.552
My first.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:55.188
I remember every line
on the guy's face.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.489
Last time I ever saw my dad.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.396
I'm sorry to just
drop on like this, OK?

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:06.599
But I've been thinking
and you were right.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.401
I hadn't been thinking
what it was like to be you.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.268
Who's that?

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:10.937
WOMAN: Mason, he's my teacher.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.471
You sleeping with this guy?

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.239
Joe!

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.540
Stay away from my wife!

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.310
This is not how we
get back together.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.580
Andrew Hall and
two of his assistants

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.583
were grabbed by the [inaudible]
movement in Baku, Azerbaijan.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.185
For those of you who
failed geography,

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.254
Baku is North of
Iran, South of Russia.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.156
So don't start World War III.

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:33.392
Look, Amanda Rankins
is a good officer,

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.427
but I do things differently, hm?

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.896
So let's skip the bull [muted].

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.130
I know who you are,
you know who I am.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.165
Now load out.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.566
Wheels up three hours, boys.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.369
[interposing voices]

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.404
I need you to find out
who our new prisoner is.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.407
I told you, I don't know him.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.241
Michael?

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:50.743
We thought you were dead!

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.178
WOMAN: We need to know
what he knows about Hall,

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.813
where he might be kept.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.781
Can't do that.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:56.882
You know.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:58.551
Find out where they took him.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:04.824
If you're going to own me,
make it look like you want me.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.292
MAN: I want you
to put everything

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.127
you're feeling into the mask.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.329
The biggest obstacle
to full recovery

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.131
is that we struggled
to hang on to who

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.166
we were before the injury.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.968
Come on, man.

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:17.736
It's OK to let go
of that person,

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:20.240
to embrace who we are now.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.911
It's worked for countless
others and it's mandatory.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.278
That sucked.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:27.814
Want to get a drink?

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.750
Nope, I want to get several.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.486
Nice.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:34.887
Andrew Hall.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:35.922
Who?

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.890
Don't tell her anything.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.825
Shut up.

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:43.295
[groan]

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:46.465
MAN: Before this happened,
I never thought or believed

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.900
that this could happen to me.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.502
Invincible, right?

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.271
Every time I'd go
through a door,

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.707
I'd be worried
about my brothers,

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.609
making sure they got home
safe, having their backs.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.413
So what I'm afraid of
is that the next time

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.648
I walk through that door
that I'm worried about me

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.417
and not them, and that's
how guys end up dead.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.819
What if you woke
up one morning

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.121
and you couldn't do that job?

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.256
There's no guarantee
you'll ever gain

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.124
the mobility and
dexterity in your hand

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.426
to return to your team.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.895
No, this is bull
[muted] is what it is.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.463
It's bull [muted].

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:20.266
VLADIMIR: Tell him we're
taking him to the mountains

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.434
to [inaudible].

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.636
It means they're
going by water.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.705
[inaudible]

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:26.839
[inaudible]

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.309
VLADIMIR: What have you done?

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.243
What I had to do.

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:32.211
You betrayed us!

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:33.680
I kill you!

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.751
I don't need to speak to
anybody in this room about who

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.252
we're going after here.

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:44.023
Nasry, he made us bleed,
but this guy, the prince--

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.324
this is the head of the snake.

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:47.160
Capture or kill.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.029
We're going to in
fill at high tide.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.697
Fish, you're going
to peel off once we

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:54.300
get boots on the ground, set up
an overwatch on the south side.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.535
Overwatch is set.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.403
COMMANDER: We'll
reach our set point.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.872
We will wait for Golf to breach
their primary entry point.

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:01.440
[inaudible] one, set.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.710
SOLDIER (RADIO): Golf, execute.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.777
Delta, execute.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.950
Once we have the hostages,
we'll get back in the boats.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.319
We're gone.
SOLDIER: Grenade!

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:22.561
SOLDIER (RADIO): Anyone got
eyes on Hall or his aide?

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:23.262
Negative.

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:24.696
No Hall, no Adams.

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:25.998
Mom!

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:28.400
You put a tracking
app on my phone?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.035
It's for your own good.

00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:31.470
I'm Annabell.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.705
You don't trust me?

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:33.939
No, it's not that.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.175
I just-- I don't know
who your friends are.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.009
Chloe.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.177
[knocking]

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:39.712
MAN: Don!

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:45.284
WOMAN: Tier one, I had a
plan, just a simple follow

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:47.953
through to right a wrong.

00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:51.891
But just before I did the
deed, I closed my eyes.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.928
And for the first time in
forever, I didn't see death.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.896
I saw you.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:00.299
I don't think I'm ready
for what that means

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.401
and I don't think
you are either.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.737
So please don't
come looking for me.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:05.972
Dawn out.

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.539
WOMAN: We didn't
find Andrew Hall.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.442
Well, that's not my fault. I--

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.644
I got Vladimir to give up the
safe house because you told

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.245
me it would help my family.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:14.747
You'd get me out of here.
That was the deal.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:15.981
WOMAN: I know.

00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:16.915
Then this came in.

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:18.584
No more games.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:22.121
Give me Michael Nasry and I
will give you Andrew Hall.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.724
You have 24 hours to begin
preparations for the exchange

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.726
before I start sending pieces
of Mr. Hall to the White House.

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:29.962
WOMAN: He wants me
at the exchange.

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:32.098
He's going to kill both of us.
