[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.430
-This is our third
of three panels.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.800
And this one is on
public discourse,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:21.470
how news, cinema, advertising
gets out to the public

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.460
and is shaped-- presumably to an
audience which is at least 50%

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.189
female-- and on the other
hand shaped mainly by men.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.320
So the panel consists of
Mary Mills, Liza Johnson,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.470
and Christine Matthews
and is moderated

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.650
by Kathleen Hall Jamieson.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.810
Kathleen is a professor
at the Annenberg School

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.750
at the University
of Pennsylvania,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.390
author and co-author of 16 books
mostly on political discourse

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.120
and politics.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.280
She's also a founder of
factcheck.org and more recently

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.019
sidecheck.org in 2015.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.280
And last night I
got to learn what

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.220
it's like to be an outsider at
a George Wallace rally, which

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.060
was fascinating.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.720
So I'll turn it
over to Kathleen.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.130
-Thank you.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.850
Good afternoon.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.000
Welcome back.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.250
The premise of this panel
is that the popular culture,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.330
including politics, shapes the
way in which we see each other.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.500
And the talk in
those environments

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.510
and the visual images in
those environments matter.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.550
We're privileged to have
a panel today of people

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.530
who are what I would call
custodians of that culture.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.480
They understand it.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.540
They've worked within it.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090
They felt the constraints of it.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.530
They are trying to break out
of it, many times successfully.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.360
I'd like to frame our discussion
by going back to the 1950s

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.830
and situate us permanently there
for about a minute and a half.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.860
In the 1950s, the
scholarly community

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.280
recognized that televised
images over long periods of time

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.810
can cultivate our
view of reality,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.859
that we can come
to see a world that

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.650
is far different from
the world we actually

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.650
experience by experiencing
the world of televised images.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.720
And that body of
scholarship, produced largely

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.202
at the Annenberg School at the
University of Pennsylvania,

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:15.660
said that, for
example, when you're

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.800
a very high consumer
of television,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.820
you are far more likely to think
that the world is crime-ridden

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.440
than it is and that your world
is crime-ridden than it is.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.430
We replicated that
finding, finding

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.890
that when you watch high
amounts of local news,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.629
you think the same
thing, in addition,

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.420
you're far more likely
to think that you're

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.600
going to be victim of a fire.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.840
Now what that tells
us is ongoing exposure

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.130
to unquestioned
assumptions can ultimately

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.470
shape the way in which we think
and the way in which we speak

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.870
and potentially the
ways in which we act.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.720
We also know from other research
that these kinds of images

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.940
can teach us how we should
function in situations.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.740
And sometimes that
can be negative.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.820
So, for example, you can
normalize perception of smoking

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.800
by having ongoing exposure of
both young men and young women

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.340
to people who are smoking in
video contexts, a finding we

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.670
just replicated on YouTube.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.210
Well, we found
that when you look

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.650
at an ongoing basis--
seeing a lot of people--

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.200
and that is normative
in YouTube videos

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.780
about smoking-- a lot of
young people smoking often

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.960
in their bedrooms, often
with their friends--

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.590
you are more likely to think
that other people smoke

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.980
and your attitudes about
smoking are, as a result,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.600
more likely to be positive.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.970
So if we say that something as
basic as seeing other people

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.600
doing things on an ongoing
basis can shape something

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.325
as potentially
damaging as increasing

00:03:35.325 --> 00:03:36.720
the likelihood of
smoking, you're

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.990
saying something which
is profoundly disturbing.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.660
But we also know
that images that you

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.300
see in this kind of
environment can help expand

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.830
your world in positive ways.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.870
How many of us saw
a different world

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.870
when we saw Julia
for the first time--

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.630
if we are of a certain age?

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.650
How many of us saw a
different kind of relationship

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.650
when we saw Will &amp; Grace?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.530
How many of us looked at
The Mary Tyler Moore Show

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.560
and saw the struggles that
some of our generation

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.650
were experiencing as we
were entering the workforce?

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.250
Those kinds of portrayals
expand our sense

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.510
of the available options.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.940
And as we watch fictive
characters dealing with them

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.890
either tell us what kinds of
things work or don't work,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.209
what might be
successful strategies

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.730
or failed strategies.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.890
In the process, of course,
it's possible to model

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.140
a whole lot of dysfunction in
interpersonal relationships.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.710
And as a result, we
can ask the question,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.300
what does it do when
people we care about

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.360
and the people we
are are portrayed

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.230
in these kinds of venues?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.910
I wrote a book in the mid-1990s
called Beyond the Double Bind--

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.120
Women in Leadership.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.510
It hypothesized that
historically women

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.280
were placed in a situation in
which no matter what they did,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.485
it was the wrong choice.

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:52.880
And I called them
double binds and said

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.280
that what we've essentially
accomplished as women

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.370
across time and as people who
have been oppressed by others

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.750
as a group across
time is found ways

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.900
to navigate out of those
socially constructed binds.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.410
But we're still experiencing
the residue of them.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.160
So very early women
were told, you literally

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.090
can't go into the academy
because women's brains

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.970
can't work because their
uteruses are functioning.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.130
And so if your uterus is
functioning, your brain can't.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.780
The women who
overcame that came out

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.080
of the science curricula
inside women's colleges

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.470
and they engaged in
experiments which showed,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.290
for example, that a menstruating
woman can add and subtract

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.240
as well as a non-menstruating
woman, that a pregnant woman

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.460
can multiply as well as
a non-pregnant woman,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.780
and interestingly enough,
she can do it just

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.850
as well as a man who is neither
menstruating nor pregnant.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.830
That's what you call
a control group.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.700
Now what is the residue?

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.010
The residue of that
is Donald Trump

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.120
suggesting that Megyn
Kelly is menstruating

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.740
when Megyn Kelly asks a
question about which Donald

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.120
Trump disapproves about the
ways in which he's cast women.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.100
What it suggests
is that something

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.240
is going wrong hormonally,
and as a result,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.840
her brain isn't functioning
as well as it should.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.530
And well, she's
bleeding from wherever.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.960
And as Carly Fiorina notably
said in another context,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.890
we all understood exactly
what he was saying.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.477
We also have a double bind
that I called silence shame.

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:16.060
That is, women weren't allowed
to move into the public sphere,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.520
and if they did, they
were called whores.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.350
As a result, women's
speech was substantially

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.830
speech that was not heard
outside the limited sphere

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.950
in which women were
able to operate.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.870
Well, we ultimately
overcame that historically.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.110
Many heroic women stood up.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.170
Men of goodwill
stood up as well.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.930
And as a result, women moved
into the public sphere.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.210
The residue of that
silent shame double bind

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.800
is one in which people say
Hillary Clinton is shouting.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.280
It's not appropriate to shout.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.180
When you pair that
with a man engaging

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.890
in exactly the
same decibel level,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.480
no one says that
man is shouting.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.680
They say that man is forceful.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.030
The residue of the double
bind is still being overcome.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.350
The argument of the book
was we overcome the residue

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.120
by meta-communicating about it,
making people conscious of it.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.900
That's part of what
we're doing today

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.690
as we move into all
of the other ways

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.780
in which individuals are
marginalized by a society that

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.950
needs help in reframing
its understanding of itself

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.970
and of others.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.810
We saw it as well
with Hillary Clinton

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.580
when Hillary Clinton
pauses before she

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.160
laughs when responding to a
question that is unanticipated.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.460
It was described as a cackle
by The New York Times.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.920
Rudy Giuliani, also a
front running candidate

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.750
during that
election, would pause

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.380
before he would laugh in a way
that seemed a little eccentric

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.290
and no one called it a cackle.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.250
We have a residue historically
of the ways in which we've

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.040
marginalized female speech
in the form of a vocabulary

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.580
to condemn women's discourse.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.430
And there's no
comparable vocabulary

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.520
to condemn or even to
describe exactly the same kind

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.267
of behavior when
we find it in male.

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.100
Finally, there was a
third bind-- I actually

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.308
looked at five; I'm only
going to [INAUDIBLE] three--

00:07:50.308 --> 00:07:52.260
called aging invisibility.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.260
Women were led into
positions marginalized out

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.070
during the childbearing
years and then told

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.278
that they were too old just
as they were about to hit

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.890
their professional stride.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.920
I call that aging invisibility.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.450
Aging invisibility is
ultimately overcome

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.290
as women move into leadership
positions around the world--

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.350
Margaret Thatcher,
Indira Gandhi.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.120
We move onto our Supreme
Court-- Sandra Day O'Connor

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.240
taking a lead there.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.910
Women move into secretary
of state positions.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.770
And what's ultimately the
residue that is still there?

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.320
You have a conservative
talk radio host who says,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.690
do we really want to
watch Hillary Clinton get

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.320
old in front of
our eyes as she's

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.070
president of the United States?

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.120
My answer is, I'd
like to see that.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.919
And with that, as
a transition, it

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.740
is my pleasure to introduce
our first panelist.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.830
Mary Mills is the
Worldwide Director

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.250
of Strategic Intelligence.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.500
Now, labeling matters.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.910
Think about this label
for just a moment.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.660
The Worldwide Director of
Strategic Intelligence,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.340
is that not a powerful label?

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.050
My pleasure.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.894
Mary, to turn the
panel over to you.

00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:02.860
Thanks, Kathleen.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.550
"Gender Fluidity
in Advertising."

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.730
I need to qualify that.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.160
It's actually more appropriately
given this context,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.480
it should be entitled
toward gender fluidity

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.990
in advertising because
it's a big claim.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.270
And it's an optimistic one.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.260
And it's picking up right
where Kathleen led us

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.390
in terms of the
positive influence

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.630
that advertising can have.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.110
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.400
I'm going to show you some
examples of advertising

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.390
using men and women in
respectful and disrespectful

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.480
ways.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.660
Some of it is our own work
from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.690
Some of it is from
other agencies.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.700
But I want to show you
how it mirrors who we are

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.110
and how we can use
it for better good.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.730
First, a context.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.670
So three things I need you
to understand about this.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.590
When we say language in my
business in the advertising

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.280
game, it's words and pictures.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.480
I want to talk about that
in a little more detail.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.510
I want to talk about how we can
use advertising in a better way

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.200
that you might not
have anticipated.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.780
As one of my kids
has on her bulletin

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.750
board on her desk, a
little poster that said,

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.140
if you talk to people the
way that advertising does,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.900
they would punch
you in the face.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.970
So that's my home life.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.530
And my kids remind me
constantly that advertising

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.890
is an interruption.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.440
It's not warranted.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.220
It's not liked.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.560
It messes up our lives.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.180
And my agenda here is to shift
your perception of advertising,

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.330
that, in fact, it can do
some really decent things.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.210
So first and foremost,
we talk about language.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.480
It's words and pictures.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.162
Words are just
part of the story.

00:10:38.162 --> 00:10:40.370
And I don't even want to
put a number on whether it's

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.470
half or a quarter or a third.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.770
It's two very different ways
of communicating messaging.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.700
Just the way this is.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.360
One is art.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.070
And one says, "This is art."

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.560
They do two very different jobs.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.870
We have two very different
jobs within the agency

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.010
as art director and writer,
but they work together

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.934
on everything.

00:10:56.934 --> 00:10:58.350
So even an art
director and writer

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.100
would work on a radio script.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.000
They would work on a
print ad, whether or not

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.500
there is any art
direction involved.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.400
It's two ways of
thinking of things, two

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.570
ways of getting the idea right.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.150
Public discourse-- how
do I fit into this panel

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.300
here in terms of how we
affect views and beliefs

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.950
in the public discourse?

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.170
Broadly, historically,
movies would be considered

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.320
entertainment and escape.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.790
Speeches are about
visions, common rhetoric,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.620
inspiring people to take
action at a certain time.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.660
And ads are about us
selling you stuff.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.260
So it seems like we're the
poor cousin on all this.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.290
But what I want to talk
to you about is, given

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.110
the proliferation
of advertising,

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.870
the amount of
money that's spent,

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.730
the ubiquity of advertising,
and the global sharing

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.560
of advertising, it has a
power that we're just starting

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.370
to realize and tap into.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.040
Finally, one of the things
that I think advertising can do

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.150
is make it normal.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.570
Let me explain that a bit.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.520
For 100 years, we've been
thinking about advertising

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.450
as helping you buy
products and services.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.510
The original example
is Sunkist Oranges.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.440
There was a surplus of
fruit, perishable product.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.522
California marketers
said, can you help us?

00:12:13.522 --> 00:12:14.980
We don't know what
to do with this.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.520
We're going to lose a fortune.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.240
Ad team came together and
said, let's talk about orange

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.350
juice for breakfast.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.750
Fast forward 100 years,
orange juice for breakfast

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.060
is a very common thing.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.700
Little did you know
that that was an ad

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.180
guy that got you into that.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:28.860
Same for bacon.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.970
Same for coffee.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.310
A lot of the habits
that we currently enjoy

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.390
came from an
advertising guy's idea.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.870
This might be appropriate.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.250
Now nobody made you do that.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.290
It obviously fit the
context of what people

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.860
were interested in at the time.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.110
But we had a role
in help shaping it.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.600
So 100 years later, we've
come to realize, hey,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.570
if we can help people understand
why it's important to drink

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.370
orange juice or why it's
important to save their money

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.300
or why it's important to have
insurance or brush their teeth,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.712
why can't we help people
understand how to view women,

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:02.170
how to view men, how to treat
each other more respectfully?

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:02.880
Why can't we?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.720
It's a very powerful medium.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.620
So let's look at
way back in the day.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.520
This was before I
got into advertising.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.940
and this is in the 70s
when cigarette advertising,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.390
just as an example, early
days targeted by gender.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.700
It was very clear.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.450
Men were in car ads.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.380
Women were in soap ads.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.754
And one of the first
examples of, well, here's

00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:27.670
a category where actually,
hey, wait a minute,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.137
both men and women use
it the same amount.

00:13:31.137 --> 00:13:32.470
Let's figure out how to do this.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.450
So Marlboro Man is one of
the most iconic cigarette

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.260
advertising campaigns
in the world.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.630
I'm not condoning
smoking cigarettes,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.410
just looking at this as an ad.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.900
Here is steely gazed, rugged
jaw, rough guy, very cool.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.670
He smokes cigarettes.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.330
Let's do one for women.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.740
So they make the
cigarette slimmer.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.830
And they have her semi-clothed.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.920
And they have her
in a sassy position.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.930
Fast forward, whether
or not this appealed

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.310
to women who smoked
or not, Marlboro's

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.850
the only one that's
still in existence.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.170
And most women I know
who smoked at the time

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.190
liked Marlboro because
they thought it was cool.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.270
And it's too easy to say it was
because men did the advertising

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.530
or because clients wanted
it that way-- there

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.450
were very strict ways
in terms of, well,

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.590
we're going to do
a women's version,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.182
this is what it
should look like.

00:14:23.182 --> 00:14:24.640
So that's a theme
I'm going to talk

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.390
to you about as we go through.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.060
Role ricochet.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.850
What I mean by that is
throughout these categories--

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.370
as I show you some examples
of advertising that

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.850
are done for women or for men
or have women saying things

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.380
that men used to say or men
saying things that you used

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.790
to say, I call that a ricochet.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.309
It was made up for
this conference.

00:14:46.309 --> 00:14:48.600
So you can be proud to say,
if it gets in to be a meme,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.150
you can say you
heard it here first.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.070
It's a ricochet.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.550
And it influences each other.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.680
And when we do that,
an effect happens.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.890
And it makes it better
going back the other side.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.080
This is all, in a way,
building the story of how

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.230
we'll get to gender fluidity.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.870
So here are some categories
of food advertising.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.500
Probably the most conservative
to the least conservative

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.910
in terms of the categories
we're going to talk about.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.780
Let's look at food.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.920
Special K is a resolutions ad.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.439
That was in Canada in 2008.

00:15:17.439 --> 00:15:18.980
Some of the ads I'm
going to show you

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.590
are a little bit dated,
but they broke through

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.060
and did an extraordinary thing.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.770
Watch this.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.237
-This year I will not--

00:15:25.237 --> 00:15:26.704
-Freak out if I gain two pounds.

00:15:26.704 --> 00:15:28.171
-I will stop asking--

00:15:28.171 --> 00:15:29.149
-Do I look fat in this?

00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:30.616
-Do I look fat?

00:15:30.616 --> 00:15:34.050
-I will learn to
appreciate my body.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.369
-I will not let my dress size--

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:36.410
-Determine my self-worth.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.240
-That's not that long ago,
but that broke through.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.130
That was the first time we put
in very burly, rugged men's

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.630
mouths things that
women say all the time.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.590
We were used to women talking
about their bodies that way.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.190
When we showed women
that men saying it,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.180
they kind of went,
oh, yeah, sort of,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.770
yeah, let's not do that so much.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.670
Very successful.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.650
It helped shape us stop
saying stuff like that.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.910
Stop saying "I have
my mother's thighs.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.160
I just have to live with it."

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.300
Men don't talk that way.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.342
Why should we?

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.080
I'm going to show
you two chocolate

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.940
commercials-- one designed for
women and one designed for men.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.630
I don't know why
women have me time

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.320
and men don't seem to
use that expression.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.490
I don't know if it's a
good thing or a bad thing.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.920
But this was an ad designed
around that for Dove Chocolate.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:38.671 --> 00:16:42.440
-Dove Pure Silk Chocolate, now
with the tantalizing crunch

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.692
of almond.

00:16:43.692 --> 00:16:47.410
My moment, my Dove.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.370
-My time.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.260
Very passive.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.900
Our data guys will tell you
that somewhere along the line

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.030
someone did a study that
said women would prefer

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.240
to have chocolate than sex.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.810
So some bright one
said, well, this

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.090
is how they see chocolate then.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.020
It's all terribly sexy
and terribly sensual

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.520
and terribly lovely.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.869
Some women liked
it, but not all.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:08.440
Look at this.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.810
And by contrast, this was
done by our office in the UK.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.869
Do you know this one?

[MUSIC - PHIL COLLINS, "IN THE
 AIR TONIGHT"]

00:17:35.932 --> 00:17:38.520
With all due respect
to our data people,

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.380
there is no amount of
data that ever would

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.610
have got you to that idea.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.060
Advertising has a
distinct role in some

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.180
of our creative enterprises
that it can transform,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.650
the creative process
can transform the world.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.340
I truly believe that.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.210
What happened here?

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.640
Huge success for Cadbury.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.986
I actually got it back
in the books big time.

00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:02.610
You know, health food, we didn't
want to eat chocolate so much,

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.110
whatever.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.550
Just a huge spike.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.230
But the more interesting
things is women

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.940
liked it just as much as men.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.290
The problem we have is
when we think in gender,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.620
we get into trouble.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.809
And when we listen to
the superficial stories

00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:16.850
that we hear, well, they
like it better than sex,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.225
so that's where
it's going to be.

00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:21.720
That's way sexier,

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.340
Nothing was ever said.

it's absolutely magnificent.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.430
Please look at it.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.720
But it was hugely successful.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.930
And women loved it.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.410
We need to learn to understand
better what we share,

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.940
not what makes us different.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.954
Oh, parenting.

00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:42.370
This is a very personal thing
for me because I'm a parent.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.230
And some of the things
that we do to ads to moms

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.110
make me cringe.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.990
We just finished a global study
of 8,000 moms around the world.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.890
And over half of them-- so
let's say between the ages of 15

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.900
and up, 70% of those
women are moms.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.700
That's 2 billion
moms in the world

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.020
think that we have an
outdated view of them.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.810
So do the math.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.976
Not only is it offensive,
but look at how much money

00:19:08.976 --> 00:19:10.120
we're wasting.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.835
How dumb is that?

00:19:10.835 --> 00:19:12.460
Next year, we're
going to be doing men,

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.270
and I swear we're going
to get the same result.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.120
So there's something
very wrong with the way

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.620
that we're speaking
to moms in particular.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.290
Women have some ways of being
different and fun and exciting.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.600
You become a mom,
you're one-dimensional.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.510
You're a caregiver.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.140
And the problem is every
ad that we've put out

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.050
has talked about mom is
when busy moms, targets are

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.990
busy moms caring for your kids.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.980
It's too one-dimensional.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.730
And younger moms, in particular,
saying, that's not me.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.190
You're talking to my mom.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.790
You don't get me.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.120
Here's how they gave us a clue
of how we could talk to them.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.620
So on the far, there's carer.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.120
And the green bar is how much
I'd like to do that role more.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.070
And the white bar is how
much I'd like to do it less.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.620
So when we reflect
moms in ads, they say,

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.300
could you reflect a little less
on the care and a little more

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.700
on all the other
roles that they would

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.120
love to play-- a safe house,
a coach, a fan, a playmate,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.050
a rule breaker, a hero.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.320
Can't mom have some of
the fun some of the time?

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.260
This is an example of the kind
of work that they object to.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.310
Look what mom does.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.910
Look what the man--
the dad and the kid do.

Can't she be eating candy
before dinner sometimes?

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.730
Of course she can.

-Hi.

Men object to advertising
as well, as I said.

00:21:51.967 --> 00:21:53.550
And the biggest
objection they have is

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.642
stop making us look so stupid.

00:21:55.642 --> 00:21:57.850
Any time we're trying to do
something like parenting,

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:58.850
we look stupid.

He might have looked
a little awkward,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.600
but it was because he
was a first-time parent,

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.120
not because he was a man.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.650
And the second time, nailed it.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.605
Yeah, done.

litany on hemorrhoid cream

after that that I cut
for the interest of time.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.910
But that's a much better example
of how we can show parents

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.490
in our work.

women like to drink their beer?

This is Canadian too.

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:29.070
I'm so embarrassed.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.120
Note the shade of pink.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.540
We have pink beer, and
we have chartreuse beer.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.820
That's not that long ago.

What's the matter with you guys?

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.990
If you ever sat down and had
a conversation with a woman

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.064
when she was drinking beer, you
would know how silly that was.

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:47.480
But again, Ben
mentioned something

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.630
earlier about focus groups.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.810
If you're in a situation
and you ask them a question,

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.768
they'll tell you the
answer you're looking for.

00:22:52.768 --> 00:22:55.410
You have to be really careful
how you ask the question

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.080
and how you do it if
you want the truth.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.940
This is just silly.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.440
I mean, that lasted
about two weeks,

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.990
and that's gone, thankfully.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.280
Oh.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.840
Again, I just take
this so personally

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.299
because I like scotch.

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:09.590
And I was very proud of Diageo.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.220
We do that.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.420
I was very proud of Diageo.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.110
They said we have a
women's initiative.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.396
We've realized that women
drink a lot of alcohol.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.556
More lately, huh, Kathleen?

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:26.950
And here we are.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.310
So they've expanded the
repertoire to include women.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.840
So we have Jude Law
having a scotch moment,

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.260
enjoying a moment of success,
perhaps just finishing a film.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.470
And then we women
playing superhero.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.282
I mean, why?

00:23:41.282 --> 00:23:43.360
Why can't we have
a successful moment

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.430
that looks more appropriate
and more relaxed and more

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.610
like a scotch moment?

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.850
Understand when I
drink scotch, it's

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.120
not when I put my cape
on and do Wonder Woman.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.170
The redeeming
feature for Diageo,

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.510
and I will give them this,
this is important to me

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.730
because-- you can't see that.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:01.896
It may be in the small type.

00:24:01.896 --> 00:24:04.790
But when Diageo first began
the unisex brand project,

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.480
there were no
women on the board.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.100
Now five of its 11
directors are women.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.140
I'm happy about that.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.570
It's not easy, this game
that we're in, advertising.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.010
We don't always get it right.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.900
That's right.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.954
That's a good outcome.

00:24:16.954 --> 00:24:17.870
They'll get it better.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.590
I trust they will.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.222
Technology.

00:24:20.222 --> 00:24:22.430
You would think these
leading-edge guys, particularly

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.430
Apple, would be we're so
forefront, we're so young,

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.620
we'll know all this.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.560
Just last year they could have
had a really wonderful moment

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.870
for women, but
instead they launched

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.631
a new phone that's pink.

00:24:34.631 --> 00:24:35.380
It's a nice phone.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.990
I can forgive them for that.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.280
The worst was their
new app, though,

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.890
that can adjust photography.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.070
And they demonstrated
it on a woman.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.280
And they said, look what this
does for resting bitch face.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.100
And they did the
app that went up.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.770
Stop laughing so hard.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.350
So they showed this app
that made her smile.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.600
So see, you can correct even
a woman who doesn't smile.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.760
Stop telling us to smile
and just let us be.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.670
I was disappointed in Apple.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.380
Fitness.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.470
More progressive,
much more progressive.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.740
I have to introduce this
idea here now because it's

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.950
the adoption curve.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.180
If you talk in advertising
about an idea that's

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.000
before its time, innovators and
early adopters, it will fail.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.540
It will not get
into the mainstream.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.950
You will get a tipping point.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.590
So movies can do this.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.766
Movies can be in the
innovators and early adopters

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:26.140
and get infiltrated
into culture.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.740
We can't.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.940
We got to cross the chasm
and get into early adopters.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.600
I want to show you an example
of an ad from the early days

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.850
that I think is really
a shame it was too soon.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.330
-If you let me play--

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.260
-If you let me play sports--

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.500
-I would like myself more.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.960
-I would have more
self-confidence.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.270
-If you let me play sports.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.110
-If you let me play.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.120
-If you let me play.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.430
-I will be 60% less likely
to get breast cancer.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:47.780
-I will suffer less depression.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.190
-If you let me play sports.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.137
-I will be more likely to
leave a man who beats me.

00:25:52.137 --> 00:25:52.970
-If you let me play.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.480
-I'll be less likely to get
pregnant before I want to.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.090
-I will learn.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.720
-I will learn what it
means to be strong.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.340
-To be strong.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.090
-If you let me play.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.650
-Play sports.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.424
-If you let me play sports.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.070
-That ad changed the
trajectory of my career.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.245
When I saw that, I knew what
I wanted to do in advertising.

00:26:12.245 --> 00:26:14.840
It wasn't just to sell
toothpaste and life insurance

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.900
and alcoholic beverages.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.550
I wanted to change the world.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.450
I loved it.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:20.370
And I was so excited.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.530
And it was 1995.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.570
And it just, mmm.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.630
I mean, there were facts,
medical, scientific facts

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.020
that proved why it's better
to let women play sports.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.600
It was too soon.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.840
It was just too soon.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.280
So happily, Nike
picked up the pace

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.694
and now they're doing
work for Under Armour

00:26:37.694 --> 00:26:39.610
and there are a number
of other fitness brands

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.220
are doing magnificent work.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.870
But it was just too soon.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.080
So that's why the timing
for us is very important.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.100
Always, "Like a girl."

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.310
I think you're
familiar with this.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.101
A very simple idea.

00:26:48.101 --> 00:26:51.330
-Show me what it looks
like to run like a girl.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.326
-Oh, my hair.

00:26:52.326 --> 00:26:53.820
Oh my god.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.712
-Show me what it looks
like to fight like a girl.

00:26:56.712 --> 00:26:57.945
-Throw like a girl.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.640
-Show me what it looks
like to run like a girl.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.490
-Throw like a girl.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.387
What does it mean to you
when I say "run like a girl"?

00:27:12.387 --> 00:27:14.610
-It means run fast as you can.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.420
-Such a simple idea and such a
wonderful, wonderful campaign.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.090
And you'll notice that
there's no product in there,

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.750
but it did extraordinary
things for P&amp;G and for Always

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.010
because people are wanting to
know what do you stand for?

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.204
Why are you on this planet?

00:27:31.204 --> 00:27:33.120
It's not just to sell
me stuff, but you better

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.240
stand for something
that's important to me.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.290
Brilliant job.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.180
Absolutely brilliant
job for them.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.720
UK-- "This Girl Can."

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.070
Some wonderful images.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.730
"I don't swim because
I hate my body.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.330
It's because I love my body."

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.530
Really wonderful work
around the world.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.140
Fashion.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.840
Last but not least,
fashion you can

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.295
expect to be at the
forefront because they really

00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:52.170
are the leading edge.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.312
They don't have to appeal
to the mainstream--

00:27:54.312 --> 00:27:56.770
that grid that I showed you--
like the rest of our products

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.300
do.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.150
They can be a
little leading edge,

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.652
and then it trickles through.

00:28:00.652 --> 00:28:01.860
Look at this wonderful thing.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.360
I'm on it.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.660
Thank you.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.040
That's Jaden Smith
on the other side.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.390
I just love this ad.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.270
It's just delightful.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.630
He's wearing a skirt.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.320
Happy as a clam.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.220
He looks fabulous.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.210
He looks really cool.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:17.060
He's not saying anything other
than I love wearing this.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.524
Whether gender is identity
or gender is performance,

00:28:19.524 --> 00:28:21.940
this is an absolutely delightful
way of looking at things,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.450
and going, cool.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.050
And last but not least,
this is an example to me

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.800
of gender fluidity
in advertising.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.070
It's from Asia.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.708
Sorry, Old Spice.

00:28:32.708 --> 00:28:34.700
I forgot about this one.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.660
This is from another
planet altogether.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.960
Old Spice did some work
where they objectified

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.300
men the way women used to be
objectified in Budweiser ads,

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.320
but they made it funny.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.660
They took the sting out of it.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.970
I still have some questions.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:51.194
If you had a woman put in the
same position where they said,

00:28:51.194 --> 00:28:52.860
look at your girlfriend,
now look at me.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.310
Look at your girlfriend,
now look at me,

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.380
we would be very upset.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.727
But they did it with
guys, and it was funny.

00:28:57.727 --> 00:28:59.060
And it took the sting out of it.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.337
The jury's still
out on that one.

00:29:01.337 --> 00:29:03.170
Last but not least,
look at this from Japan.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:31:24.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.730
So many extraordinary
metaphors in that.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.450
The tag line in the
end there, given

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.550
I think is a very
powerful story line

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.366
is, makeup can make
anybody look cute.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.250
Male, female, who cares?

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.200
Just an absolutely
delightful piece of work.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.160
What we want-- listen.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.860
Ask the right
questions, but listen.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.110
I mean, really listen.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.974
Get to know people.

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.640
The way we do better
work is to actually

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.730
talk to them one on one.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.170
We call it exploring.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.380
We live with them.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.030
What's important to them,
what do they care about.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.190
It's absolutely critical for us.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.440
We get on to the data at one
point, but we've got to listen.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.250
And that means
close up one on one.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.100
Be authentic.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.510
Understand the experience.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.470
What is the scotch
drinking experience?

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.140
What is the beer
drinking experience?

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.679
Don't just put a woman
slapped on it and think,

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:17.720
well, she might like this
because she likes pink.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.690
I mean, that's so old.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.850
And finally, target the
experience, not the gender.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.600
We are so over targeting gender.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.014
It's just not even appropriate.

00:32:27.014 --> 00:32:27.680
It doesn't work.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.210
And happily, the younger
guys coming up-- god

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.180
bless our millennials--
they want far more equality

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.280
between men and women.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.020
So I think the future is bright.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.743
Thank you.

00:32:36.743 --> 00:32:38.555
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.540
-Thank you, Mary.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.840
We're now going to transition
to Christine Matthews.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.760
And again, I want you to take a
look at the title-- President.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.920
The reason I'm featuring
titles is 30 years ago

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.570
you would not have been able to
find many women who could carry

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.320
these kinds of
titles and who then

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.270
did work commensurate with the
title to help change the way

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.810
in which we view the world.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.720
It's my pleasure to introduce
Christine Matthews, President

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.355
of Bellwether Research.

00:33:11.355 --> 00:33:13.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.190
-Thank you.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.870
This has been an amazing event.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.390
I've learned so much.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.530
Last night, I was at the
wonderful comedy event.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:28.930
Laughed so loud.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:32.310
LOL, or lots of love.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.240
And I was mostly just
happy that I knew the hip

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.230
words that Aparna put up there,
especially Netflix and chill.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.940
Because I have a high
school daughter and it's

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.070
good to know the code.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.230
So anyway, last
night, I got back

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.730
to my hotel room
a little bit late.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.780
I tuned into the
Republican debate.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.280
So I had missed the
discussion about the size

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.700
of Donald Trump's man parts.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.330
For the most part, when except
for probably when John Kasich

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.630
was talking, I had to put it
on mute and just follow along

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.530
on Twitter because
I just couldn't.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.110
I just couldn't.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:12.540
But I find that it's pretty
rich that Donald Trump, when

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.053
asked about Hillary Clinton
being late to the debate stage

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:17.469
because she had
to take a bathroom

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.860
break-- he found that so
disgusting that he couldn't

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:26.480
even talk about it, yet he was
gifting us with the sharing

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.280
details about his endowments.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.219
So if Donald Trump hadn't
brought the ridiculous train

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:38.620
wreck that he has brought to
the Republican primary election,

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.260
I think we'd be talking about
the role language and gender

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.840
and politics as something
that has become a little bit

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.790
less overt but is still
persistent and pernicious.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.960
But nothing about Donald Trump
and what he says is subtle.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.260
So I will include some
of his charming comments

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.190
as I look at the language
surrounding women candidates,

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.490
women office holders.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.990
First, let's just take a
look at the lay of the land.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.570
This is something I know
intuitively but not everybody

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.760
in the room may know, which
is women are obviously

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.940
very under-represented.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:18.210
They're 19% of Congress, roughly
25% statewide office holders

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:23.820
or in the state legislature,
yet they are 53% of all voters.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.420
There are particularly few
Republican women in Congress.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.280
So you can see-- and this
data comes from the Center

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.620
for American Women in
Politics out of Rutgers,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.150
which is a wonderful, valuable
source of information on all

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.360
this kind of information.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.570
So we've got 62 Democratic
women in the House,

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.390
22 Republican women, 14
Democratic women US senators

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.910
and six Republican women.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.220
So there's lots of
reasons-- including

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.710
the pipeline, funding-- for
the lack of Republican Women.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.450
One of the other
reasons is they just

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.420
have a really difficult time
getting out of primaries.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.050
And they're about 20 points
less likely to get out

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.230
of their primary than
a Democratic woman is

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.790
to get out of her primary.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.630
One thing is true, Republican
primary electorates

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.020
are majority male.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.350
Democratic primary electorates
tend to be majority female.

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.310
That may have one
thing to do with it.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.800
But in 2012, for example,
57% of Republican women

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.410
lost their primaries compared
to 38% of Democratic women.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.640
In 2014, it was slightly better,
but Republican women, again,

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.550
were 20 points less likely to
come out of their primaries.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:38.240
So we're getting
clogged up there.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.700
There are many reasons for
this lack of political parity.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.200
One thing that we're
obviously examining today

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.390
is how language
plays a role in it.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.600
So one thing I want to talk
about is what's in a name.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:56.290
And thinking back to 2008,
both Hillary Clinton and Barack

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.270
Obama were US senators when
they ran for president.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:05.680
But a study found that Senator
Clinton was four times as

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.490
likely to be called by her first
name than was Senator Obama.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:13.220
So her title was dropped
and she was just referred to

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.120
as Hillary or Hillary Clinton.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.170
Male anchors, male
reporters were

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.170
more likely than female
anchors or female broadcasters

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.470
to drop her title.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:25.070
So I really like that
Kathleen emphasized the title.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:30.140
Because what happens
is titles infer status.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.430
They infer power.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.820
And for women candidates,
that title gets dropped.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.320
I've done a lot of focus
groups, a lot of research.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.780
One thing that I learned from
doing focus group with swing

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.600
women-- we were imagining
a different scenario,

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.110
but a debate where
you had Hillary

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.210
Clinton as a Democratic nominee
and a Republican nominee.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.130
And we asked, what
would be the best way

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.480
to refer to Hillary Clinton?

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.350
What if somebody
called her Hillary?

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.260
And the women didn't
like it at all.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.000
They felt absolutely
she should be referred

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.090
to as Secretary Clinton.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.800
I haven't watched the
Democratic debates.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.530
I've seen clips.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.640
I think that's how
Bernie Sanders refers

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.760
to her, as Secretary Clinton.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.700
So either that's
second nature or he's

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.000
also seen some data
that says this is really

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.930
what you need to do.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:28.550
Back in 2014, we were involved
in pretty much every US Senate

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.440
race where there was
a woman candidate

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.080
either on the Republican
side or the Democratic side.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.540
So in North Carolina,
speaker of the house

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.530
Thom Tillis was running against
the incumbent US Senator Kay

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:40.520
Hagan.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.480
And in a debate, she referred
to him as Speaker Tillis.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.360
He called her Kay.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.300
And there was a big backlash.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:55.310
And his point was I would
prefer that you call me Thom.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.930
If you were Bob Hagan, I
would've called you Bob.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.600
But it was just unseemly.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.690
And there was a backlash
and seen as disrespectful

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.450
that he called her Kay.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.440
And you can see, again,
candidates may brand themselves

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.610
using their first name.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:10.900
Carly for President.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.130
Jeb!

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.350
2016.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.150
But that's something
you have to do.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.440
Particularly, if you're a
man running against a woman,

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.210
you should never refer
to her by her first name.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:24.560
You should always
include the title.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.130
This is a really
interesting study.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.162
Speaking of titles
and associations,

00:39:30.162 --> 00:39:34.300
a new study out of Vanderbilt
done by an assistant professor

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.910
of political science there.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.410
And this was done in Florida.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.920
They had a random
sample of respondents.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.020
And they showed these
images of men and women

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.910
in professional attire.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:51.910
And what happened was the words
most associated with the men

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.650
were president and
executive and for the women

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:59.010
it was assistant or aide.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:02.680
And she found that
regardless of some--

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.220
she had done some prescreening
questions about likelihood

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.850
to vote for a woman candidate.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.550
Even among those who said,
yeah, I'm very open, absolutely

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:15.530
ready and likely to vote
for a woman candidate--

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.370
if they were more likely to
associate words like assistant

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.000
or aide to the woman
rather than the man,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.210
it had an impact on
their vote behavior.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.300
So this is a form
of hidden bias.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.770
I've had women
members of Congress

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.380
tell me they've
had instances where

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.240
they've gotten into
the member elevator

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.190
and they've been told to get
out because they're staff.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:37.410
Or they've been on
the floor of Congress

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:39.160
and have been
instructed to leave

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.910
because staff's not allowed.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:45.160
So there's a lot of hidden bias.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.660
And I think it's important
to recognize that.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.670
So of course we have to
have some Donald Trump-isms.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.490
This is actually rather mild
compared to many of the things

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.510
Donald Trump says.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:03.190
But clearly he really
cannot handle smart women.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.000
And so this was a tweet.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.280
He loves to be on the Twitter.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.900
And he said, "I just
realized that if you listen

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.540
to Carly Fiorina for more
than 10 minutes straight,

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.220
you develop a massive headache.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.230
She has zero chance!"

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:20.050
So what he's saying is her voice
is irritating, it's grating.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.430
He said the exact same thing
about Hillary Clinton's voice,

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.700
that it gave him a headache.
"She's so theatrical.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.020
And her voice just
gives me a headache."

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.570
So the one thing Donald
Trump did tell The New York

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.860
Times that he wouldn't
say about Carly Fiorina

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.490
is he did say he would
not call her honey.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.757
So you got that.

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:43.510
This is one of
those things where

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.630
women's voices are discussed.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.320
They become something
that is other.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.880
And the journalist Bob
Woodward, for example,

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.000
criticized Hillary Clinton
for shouting too much.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.560
He said there's something
very unrelaxed about the way

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.840
she communicates, and that
she's not doing better

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.270
because she shouts too much.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.559
And again, Kathleen, I
think you addressed that.

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:07.100
In fact, I'll have
a couple of points

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.670
that you addressed,
that a woman has

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.810
a very narrow bandwidth
in which you're

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.790
able to talk and project.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.260
And if you think about it,
you're at a gigantic rally.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.990
You're going to have to
raise your voice, right?

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:25.740
As opposed to speaking to
a small group of people.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.980
Again, so women are
criticized for their voices.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.620
They give people headaches
or they're too screechy

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.940
or they're too loud.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.560
And this was the iconic moment.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.600
This really was.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.580
And Kathleen, again,
referred to it.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.410
I think this was Carly Fiorina's
best moment of the campaign.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.160
So she was asked about Donald
Trump in Rolling Stone who

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.550
said, "Look at that face.

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:48.870
Would anybody vote for that?

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:52.050
Can you imagine that, the
face of our next president?"

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:57.180
And so he tried to pretend that
he was meaning-- I don't even

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.230
know what you could
possibly mean by that--

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.730
but he was trying to
pretend it was her persona.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:08.116
So Jake Tapper
asked Ms. Fiorina,

00:43:08.116 --> 00:43:09.240
how do you feel about that?

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.050
And she said, I think women all
over this country heard very

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.370
clearly what Mr. Trump said.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:18.840
And then she dropped the
mic, because it was great.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.680
And it was really the
only time I have ever

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.530
seen shame or embarrassment
on Donald Trump's face.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.690
Really, he did blush a little.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.230
And then he
stammered, oh, I think

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.040
she has a beautiful face,
because he doesn't even

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.410
know what to say.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.200
So that gets to the
attractiveness predicament.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.580
And I think Kathleen has
obviously written books.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.920
It's the double bind.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.105
But the attractiveness
predicament

00:43:43.105 --> 00:43:44.830
is a really big issue.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.750
So we did a ton of focus
groups, a ton of research

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.770
around the US Senate
races in 2014.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.060
And as I said, we were
involved in almost every one

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.930
that had a woman candidate
on either side of the aisle.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:00.470
So in this case, this
was really unfortunate,

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:03.810
and we were kind of horrified.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:07.840
Party spokesperson called
the US Senate candidate

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.790
from Kentucky "an empty dress
who babbles incoherently."

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.780
So can you ever imagine
it being said about a man

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.070
that he babbles incoherently?

00:44:20.096 --> 00:44:21.810
No.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.680
What's interesting,
though, is appearance

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.220
is not only a point of
discussion, observation,

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.930
criticism for men
of women candidates,

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:33.340
women also criticize other
women based on appearance.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.180
It has to do with relatability.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.570
In Georgia, for example,
I did focus groups.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:40.720
And you may recall
that Michelle Nunn

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.750
was a candidate for US Senate.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:48.750
She's smart, accomplished,
seems like a wonderful person.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.830
Some of the comments
in the focus groups,

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.740
though, were-- she looks
like-- and you guys will

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.000
find this ironic--
a liberal college

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.540
professor from the Northeast.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.590
So what they were saying
is she's not ratable to us

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:06.430
here in Georgia.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.050
I can't relate to her.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:09.140
She's other.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.120
She's different.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.950
I don't know.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:16.780
In Louisiana, we were
doing focus groups.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.830
And one of the participants--
who I did not enjoy at all--

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.950
said about the incoming
US senator, wow,

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.880
she's really gotten old and fat.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.010
And he, of course, was old
and fat, but never mind.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.270
And he just said it like it was
some kind of great indictment

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:37.010
and great insight on his part.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.717
So that was just
really annoying.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.940
So there's how we look,
there's how we talk, oh,

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.020
and how we laugh.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.530
So we are supposed to smile,
but we're not supposed

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.247
to laugh too big or too loud.

00:45:52.247 --> 00:45:53.705
This was a comment
on social media.

00:45:53.705 --> 00:45:56.190
"Hillary's cackle alone
is enough to keep her

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.160
off the world stage."

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:03.690
So cackle is something
a witch does, right?

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.950
And a witch rhymes with-- right?

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:10.180
And can you imagine a US
president who cackles?

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.150
No, I think that is actually
one of the most damaging words--

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:15.680
cackle.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.260
I did a little Google search.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.820
Lots of YouTube videos, mix-ups
of Hillary Clinton's cackle.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.970
And I think that's
actually very damaging.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:29.150
So then, of course,
women have to be smart,

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.250
but they also have
to be likable.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:35.257
So they have to be smart.

00:46:35.257 --> 00:46:36.340
They have to be competent.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.950
They have to be not
too this, not too that.

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:42.960
And this as important to
women as it is to men.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.690
So this is a quote
from a big donor

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.720
who had given to Barack Obama.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.230
"It's not that I don't
think she's competent."

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.230
This is about Hillary
Clinton. "She's competent.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.370
She's just hard to like."

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.450
So this is somebody
who's saying why

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:00.900
he's withholding making
a donation to Hillary

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.930
Clinton when he supported
Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:08.092
"She's just not likable."

00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:09.800
And this is about
Carly Fiorina, and this

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.430
is a woman saying it actually.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.540
And the thing
about Carly Fiorina

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.360
is I really think she
overperformed in the debates.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.380
Her command of facts and her
ability to talk policy, I think

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.830
was really impressive.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:24.960
So then she was criticized
for not smiling enough.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.170
So she had to really
work on relatability.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.500
And this was a woman saying
there's a hardness in how

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.030
she speaks and carries herself.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.390
Social media can be brutal.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.170
The words are OK, but look at
this image of Carly Fiorina

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.630
as a little girl in
pink running a company.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.710
And the Democratic National
Committee did this.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.910
On social media, it
can be very brutal.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:48.576
Hashtag,
#wordsthatdon'tdescribeHillary.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:54.400
An analysis of 12,000 tweets
was done by two PhD students.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.980
1 in 12 comments was
about her appearance.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.350
For men, in a sexual
way, and for women,

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.940
about likability
and relatability.

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.330
Traditional media
isn't perfect either.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.940
A reporter told me that
the original headline

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.500
read "Gloria Steinem and
Madeline Albright Scold Young

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.715
Women Backing Bernie Sanders."

00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:13.840
They got a little backlash.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.760
They changed it to "rebuke."

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.950
Now scold is a word-- you may be
familiar with the Women's Media

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.450
Center.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:20.908
They have something
called Name It.

00:48:20.908 --> 00:48:21.560
Change It.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.030
And they had a glossary
of words that they

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.580
recommended the media not
use because they were sexist.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.204
Scold was one of them.

00:48:29.204 --> 00:48:31.620
I don't know if you've heard
of the Hillary Rodham Clinton

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:32.800
super-volunteers.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.960
These are words that
they have decided

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.730
are sexist surrounding
Hillary Clinton.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:40.640
I think this goes
a little too far.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.480
I think it's a good
point of discussion.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.330
I think out of-- well,
it says "our of touch"--

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:48.130
but out of touch,
represents the past,

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:52.480
I don't see that as overly
sexist, but they do.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.930
And they say they're watching.

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.970
Finally, just to wrap
up, I have done some work

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.330
with this great project.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:04.195
It's a collaboration,
a nonpartisan project

00:49:04.195 --> 00:49:06.820
of the Center for American Women
in Politics in the Barbara Lee

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.030
Family Foundation to
track, analyze, eliminate

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.660
gender dynamics in the
2016 presidential election.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.600
So not that they'll
have anything to do,

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.100
but you can find them on
Facebook and on Twitter

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.720
under Gender Watch 2016.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.770
And I highly recommend them.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.507
They've written some
interesting things.

00:49:24.507 --> 00:49:25.840
I've done some things with them.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.841
And they're calling it
out, which is fascinating.

00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:30.340
-Thank you.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.268
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.420
Mary, they've spent
billions of dollars.

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.950
These are incredibly
talented people.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:47.810
They have all the
research in the world.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:50.790
They charge their clients
a whole lot of money.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:54.430
Why did it take them so long
to get any of this right?

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:55.690
-It's hard.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.430
First and foremost,
it's too easy

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:03.020
to either blame our clients or
blame that most of the writers

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.140
and the actors in the
early days were men.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.650
It comes back to the
point of listening.

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:13.680
I am not the woman that we
target more often than not.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.240
All my assumptions and
biases when I walk into work

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.190
and I write a brief or I
train a group or I teach them,

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.380
I have to put them in check.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.769
It's really hard to do.

00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:24.060
Most clients look at the work
that we do, and go, yeah,

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.220
my wife would love that.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.100
That's a great ad.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.580
Stop that behavior.

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.400
It's such ingrained
human behavior.

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.470
But if we listen, if we
ask the right questions,

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.840
and truly, truly engage the
audience with whom we'd like

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.790
to communicate, magic happens.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:40.804
It's just obviously we
don't do it often enough.

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:41.345
It's too bad.

00:50:41.345 --> 00:50:43.190
Actually, North America,
we're not great at it.

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:44.510
We're better at it in the UK.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.700
We're better at it in Asia.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.880
Intuitively, they seem
to understand-- I mean,

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.890
those are the guys
that did the gorilla.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.300
They understand guys.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.820
They didn't have to do
focus groups for it.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.995
We're getting better,
but yeah, it's shocking.

00:50:56.995 --> 00:50:59.620
I think now that we have data to
show how much money is wasted,

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.091
they may pay attention to that.

00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:05.041
-Please tell us who you are
and frame your question.

00:51:05.041 --> 00:51:05.540
-Hi.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.960
My name is Globiana.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.050
I'm a writer.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.750
It's interesting to
me now that you're

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:14.940
talking about what's not said.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.950
I wrote down a
whole list of words

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:23.470
that I heard in
conjunction with images

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:27.420
that I see in news, either in
print or with the voiceover.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.850
It doesn't really matter.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:31.470
And so I see pictures of
large groups of people,

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:35.480
insurrectionists they're called,
peacekeepers, demonstrators,

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.680
sunis, climate change experts,
rebels, world leaders, pirates,

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:45.740
Iraqis, and it goes on.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.470
When I look at the picture,
phenotypically what I see

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:49.970
is men.

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:54.700
That's the one word that I never
hear is they're not called men.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:59.730
When women are involved-- oh,
yes, remember Arab Spring?

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.760
There were women, and boy,
did they make a point of that.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.986
Of course, the Democratic
primaries, we had the LPGA.

00:52:08.986 --> 00:52:11.110
-And to whom would you like
to phrase the question?

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.890
-The question is-- I don't care.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:14.090
It's just that it scares me.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:16.280
And I want to know
if you people have

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.885
any sense of what's going on.

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:24.500
Why is this happening, I guess?

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.670
It scares me.

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:29.020
-Do you see it as happening?

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.750
And if so, why?

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.460
-Good question.

00:52:34.045 --> 00:52:35.420
-Just on the whole
pronoun thing,

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:39.092
what is the "it" that is said
to be happening, perhaps,

00:52:39.092 --> 00:52:39.800
may be happening?

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.070
-I'm not sure I understand.

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:41.910
-Leaving out the word men.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.300
Refusing to say the word
men when what we see is men.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.540
-I don't know if this really
addresses your question,

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.670
but as a person who
does a job who is also

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:54.941
a woman, every time I am
in public, people say,

00:52:54.941 --> 00:52:56.690
oh, what's it like to
be a woman director?

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.167
And I often think what
it would be like-- I even

00:52:59.167 --> 00:53:01.250
have a plan that I would
like to do this with some

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:04.230
of my male colleagues some
time that we can all do press

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:06.380
together so that they
can ask those guys like,

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.720
so how is it being
a man director?

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.160
And I do think that the
legion of the unmarked terms

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.150
of masculinity is
systematically present because

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:19.870
of the patriarchy.

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:24.240
And I think that is
true and that we just

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:30.330
have to continue working
against that by both marking

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.680
all these invisible
terms of dominance,

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.440
like masculinity and whiteness,
whenever we can and just do

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:42.520
that together as collectively
and systematically as possible.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.100
-Thank you.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.346
Next question.

00:53:45.346 --> 00:53:47.470
Please tell us who you are
and frame your question.

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:48.050
-Hi.

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.446
My name is Sally.

00:53:49.446 --> 00:53:52.580
I'm a student at Bridgewater
State University.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.080
And I'm doing a project
on discrimination

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.180
against female producers.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.320
And my question is
to Liza Johnson.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.260
What are your thoughts
on discrimination

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.750
against female directors
in major film industries?

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:13.265
And what advice would you give
to upcoming female producers

00:54:13.265 --> 00:54:18.300
or aspiring female producers?

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.325
-And can I ask
you, are you asking

00:54:20.325 --> 00:54:22.700
me to make a distinction
between directors and producers?

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.670
Are you speaking
more collectively

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:30.530
about women who do executive
upper level jobs in filmmaking?

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:34.781
-I'm going to say females
who are in the film studios.

00:54:34.781 --> 00:54:35.280
-OK.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.970
Yeah.

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:41.980
Well, I think there's
interesting new data that I

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:43.230
would like to know more about.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:45.590
Other people here might
know more than I do.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:48.560
But I think the data
has been very clear

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.450
that hiring practices in
film companies, studios,

00:54:54.450 --> 00:55:01.470
and independent projects are
systematically not weighted

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:04.180
in favor of women
or people of color.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.150
And I think that's kind of
just proven by the data.

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:12.320
So my opinion about it
is not that important.

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:17.050
When it is encountered, I think
it is mostly unconscious, which

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.302
doesn't make it unsystematic.

00:55:19.302 --> 00:55:21.760
But I've never had an experience
where there's a Lex Luthor

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.634
figure being like, I
don't know, little lady,

00:55:23.634 --> 00:55:27.110
I don't think you can do this.

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:31.230
So in the absence of an
evil villain character

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:34.930
implementing racist
and sexist practices,

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:36.660
it doesn't mean that
they don't exist.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:37.630
They clearly do.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:40.280
And I think that I
don't really know

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.900
what to do about it
besides all of us

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.670
just keep working
as hard as we can

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:47.040
and maybe take an interest
in the work that's being done

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.954
by the EEOC and by the ACLU.

00:55:50.954 --> 00:55:53.370
-Same question for Christine
and Mary in their own fields.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.870
-So what would be the corollary
in my field, a discrimination

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.510
against women
candidates or women

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:05.830
-Women consultants who manage
campaigns and do polling.

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:06.700
-Yeah.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.410
-Run firms.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:10.300
-We've talked about this.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.510
It's still an old boys' network.

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:15.530
And one of my companies
is called Burning Glass

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:16.640
Consulting.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.160
I have two female partners.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.730
We have only female employees.

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:25.770
And the idea is that
in an all-female firm

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:29.110
different things are seen,
different perspectives

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:29.900
are given.

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.820
And too often there's
not a woman at the table.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:39.849
And what men think
is-- for example,

00:56:39.849 --> 00:56:41.390
this happens not
only in advertising,

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:42.680
but in political campaigns.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:46.140
So if you got a bunch of male
consultants around the table

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.760
and they're imagining, how
do we reach women voters?

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.510
So they put them in the kitchen.

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:55.310
And this happens on
both sides of the aisle.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:57:00.380
This was something we tested in
some panel research that I did.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.922
So the idea from the men is the
women are going to sit around

00:57:02.922 --> 00:57:04.421
the table in the
kitchen and they're

00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:06.570
going to talk about the
political candidate.

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:10.050
And every woman just
really reacted strongly.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:12.860
Like, really, that's how
they're imagining us?

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:13.896
In the kitchen?

00:57:13.896 --> 00:57:15.270
And that's the
kind of thing that

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.345
happens when there aren't
women at the table.

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:23.430
It's still kind of tough.

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:25.230
I don't know that
I can say, oh, I've

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:27.120
seen so much overt
discrimination.

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.570
I think it's maybe we're
just not thought of

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:34.915
to be included or
brought to the table.

00:57:34.915 --> 00:57:36.290
And the other
thing that happens,

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:41.520
honestly, is when you have
a family and you have kids,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.780
it becomes difficult with all
the demands that are made.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:49.100
And so a lot of women I think
opt out at a certain point

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.500
and singularly focus
not very balanced.

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.666
Men continue.

00:57:53.666 --> 00:57:54.166
-Mary?

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:59.150
-I guess the advice I would
give you-- is it there?

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.160
Yes, it is.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.380
You need to be resilient.

00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.250
You need to be thick-skinned.

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:07.450
And yes, we do work harder
than our male counterparts.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.947
And that's still there.

00:58:08.947 --> 00:58:09.780
I wouldn't trade it.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.410
I still love the
career that I've had.

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:12.493
And I'm still enjoying it.

00:58:12.493 --> 00:58:13.950
I'm surprised I'm still there.

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:16.620
I've been there 30 plus years.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.720
Yeah, you can do it,
but it's not easy.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.940
Find a mentor, someone who
knows what they're doing.

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:22.940
They'll put you through.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:24.650
There are a lot more
female mentors now

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:25.608
than there were before.

00:58:25.608 --> 00:58:27.510
I had a male mentor.

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:28.100
Don't give up.

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:31.500
-Next question.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.750
Please frame it to a specific
individual on the panel.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:34.520
-Sure.

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.260
Good afternoon.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.550
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:40.250
I actually come from the
world of social justice

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.060
practitioners.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.210
I had Transition House, which
is Cambridge's domestic violence

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:45.950
agency.

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.090
I come here actually
to figure out

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:53.880
where my work sits between
research and social justice

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:58.720
and other kinds of
corporate information

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.980
and popular culture.

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.430
And my question is
informed by something

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:06.080
that Mary said in
her discussion, which

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:10.400
was informing her colleagues
to talk at the experience

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.430
not the gender.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:14.585
But what about when the
experience is gender?

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:18.060
-Interesting.

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.710
I have to say I wouldn't
have experienced--

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:23.060
because we market stuff.

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.180
We market products.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:29.700
So I haven't had experience with
marketing gender on its own.

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:32.360
There's always a link to a
product, a service, an idea.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.510
I guess the closest thing
I would have is maybe

00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:37.290
our campaign for violence
against women, when

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:38.630
we had to speak out about that.

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:43.650
And it still was, what's the
experience of the victim?

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:45.565
And we've had male
victims who were

00:59:45.565 --> 00:59:48.330
a subject of domestic
violence, as well as women.

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:50.580
Understand the experience
from their point of view.

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.860
How do they want to
be portrayed in this?

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:56.710
Never mind if we had an idea
that would make more money

00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:57.920
or get more people aware.

00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.850
If it disrespects
them or if it makes

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.990
them feel ashamed or
humiliated, it's not worth it.

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:06.180
So it'd still go back to
understand that core story

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.710
of the individual
that we're trying

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:11.110
to either talk about or
portray what the experience is

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:12.130
of being a victim.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.300
So whether it's a scotch
drinker, et cetera,

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.622
the process is the same.

01:00:15.622 --> 01:00:17.580
But I haven't had that
much experience with it,

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.260
unfortunately.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.780
Not yet.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.490
-And with apologies to those who
will have unanswered questions,

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:24.115
this will have to be
the last question.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:26.560
-Hi.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.226
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:27.226 --> 01:00:30.100
Coincidentally, I also worked at
another local domestic violence

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.150
services agency,
[INAUDIBLE], which

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.550
works with Transition House.

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.944
And I'm actually in
development and communications,

01:00:36.944 --> 01:00:38.610
but my question's not
really about that.

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:42.407
It's a much more general
question for Christine,

01:00:42.407 --> 01:00:43.990
specifically, but I
think anyone might

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:47.180
be able to speak to it, which
is, as a young woman, one

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.290
of my big pet peeves is hearing
a lot about these terrible ways

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:54.019
that young women talk, like
upspeak or vocal fry and so on.

01:00:54.019 --> 01:00:56.560
And the interesting thing about
that is that I'm getting that

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.040
not only from people who are
clearly speaking in bad faith,

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.050
but also older female relatives
who very much would describe

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.670
themselves as feminists and
think that women my age need

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.110
to change the way we present
ourselves or talk in order

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:10.651
to be taken seriously and that
we're disadvantaging ourselves

01:01:10.651 --> 01:01:11.260
if we don't.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:15.034
So my question is about, how
do you navigate the sense

01:01:15.034 --> 01:01:16.700
that you should be
listened to no matter

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.070
what because what you
have to say is important

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:20.760
and you shouldn't
be looked down upon

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.442
for being a woman with
the pragmatic need

01:01:23.442 --> 01:01:24.900
to present yourself
in certain ways

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.200
in order to be more effective?

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.616
And this is both
something that we

01:01:27.616 --> 01:01:30.930
face as women in professional
life, as normal people,

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:33.100
and also candidates
face, I'm sure.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:33.600
-Mm-hm.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.100
Thank you.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.420
Christine?

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.230
-Let me just ask a question.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:41.890
As a young woman, has
anybody ever said--

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:44.130
and I'm not detecting
this with you

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:49.444
at all-- that you have
an upspeak or vocal fry

01:01:49.444 --> 01:01:50.360
or anything like that?

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.460
Has that been said
to you personally?

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:52.970
-Yes.

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:55.154
Yeah.

01:01:55.154 --> 01:01:56.320
-What was your view of that?

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.840
For example, did it feel like
something constructive and it's

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.559
good to know?

01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:02.600
Or did it feel like
criticism and there's nothing

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.830
you could do about it?

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.210
I'm asking this for a reason
because I have noticed

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.350
with younger women the upspeak.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.630
I haven't noticed vocal fry.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:12.910
This is something new to me
that I've heard just here.

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:15.000
But I have definitely
noticed the upspeak.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.540
And I have actually wondered
about saying something

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:23.360
as a mentor or a colleague,
because I feel like not only

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.170
do older women notice it and
maybe don't take it seriously,

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:30.772
but particularly men,
particularly upspeak.

01:02:30.772 --> 01:02:32.230
And I'm just curious
to know what's

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:37.040
the most constructive
way if somebody like me,

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.590
for example, should notice that?

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:40.030
What do you think?

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.250
-So I think this
is hard to answer

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:45.080
because the context in which
it was said to me, actually,

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.270
was by my mother, having
casual conversations with her.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.940
And of course we all
code switch in the way

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.410
we talk in different
circumstances.

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:53.993
And at work, I talk
differently than I

01:02:53.993 --> 01:02:56.511
talk to my mom or my friends.

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:58.510
And I'll probably use
more upspeak and vocal fry

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:00.990
in more casual contexts.

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:03.380
Not on purpose, but
that's just what happens.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.530
So I think that if you're asked
to give feedback on the way

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:09.120
someone talks or presents
themselves, it's always useful.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.560
And also if it's couched
in terms of there's nothing

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.460
inherently wrong with
this way of speaking,

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:18.576
but people are jerks and
they're going to judge you.

01:03:18.576 --> 01:03:20.200
And this is the way
you navigate within

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.781
those oppressive systems.

01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:22.280
-Nice.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.039
Good for you.

01:03:23.039 --> 01:03:24.580
-I don't know if
that's overly harsh,

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.060
but I always found it's
really frustrating when people

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.991
are judged for the
style of their speech

01:03:28.991 --> 01:03:29.990
rather than the content.

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:31.656
And it happens more
to oppressed people.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.676
-I think of so
many comments that

01:03:35.676 --> 01:03:37.050
were made to me
as a young woman,

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:39.540
both from men and
women, particularly men.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.970
And I remember, for example,
going to one meeting

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:43.500
with my male boss.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.020
And I had a title.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.510
I was a research person.

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:52.494
And I had just a pad of paper
ready to-- he was like, don't

01:03:52.494 --> 01:03:53.660
come in with a pad of paper.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.490
You're going to look
like a secretary.

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:58.170
And I was like, what
am I supposed to do?

01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:59.854
I need to write stuff down.

01:03:59.854 --> 01:04:01.180
Hm.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.220
And it was like it
never occurred to me

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.624
that coming in with
a pad of paper,

01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:08.290
people would perceive me as, the
quote unquote, the "secretary."

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:09.614
So he told me that.

01:04:09.614 --> 01:04:11.280
And then I started
to think, well, maybe

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.070
I should go out and buy one
of those leather binder things

01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:16.760
and put my paper in it so I
look like I have a portfolio.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.382
Would that be helpful?

01:04:19.382 --> 01:04:20.840
I mean, I've been
in that situation

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.280
where older people had said
things to me as a young woman,

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:24.780
too.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.790
And on some level it
was nice to go, oh,

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:29.120
this is how this is perceived.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.000
Weird.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.670
But OK, either I'm going
to play along or I'm not.

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:37.390
And now that I'm on the other
end and an "older person,"

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:41.690
it's helpful to know what are
constructive ways, if any,

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.128
to point that out.

01:04:44.128 --> 01:04:46.294
-Please join me in thanking
our distinguished panel.

01:04:46.294 --> 01:04:49.752
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.300
-OK.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.266
Well, thank you so much.

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:09.000
Wow.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.320
This was like a dream for me.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.980
I mean, all these panels
of knowledgeable people.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.840
Basically I was given license to
want to learn about this topic.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.460
And we were able to pick these
very thoughtful panelists.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:28.250
And I can't begin to express
my gratitude towards them.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.460
We're just lucky.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.290
Thank you.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:31.810
Let's see.

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:35.310
I should let you know that we
have online viewers in the US

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:39.350
from Boston to Seattle, from
New York to Austin, Texas.

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:41.550
Internationally, we
have people viewing

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:45.500
online from [INAUDIBLE],
Colombia, Ankara, Turkey,

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.950
Toronto, Canada, Poland,
Bulgaria, France, and the UK.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:52.150
So that's rather phenomenal.

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:57.100
And I'd like to thank
the people that put

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.790
their shoulders to the wheel.

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.870
I think that's the
right metaphor.

01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:08.040
So Alison Franklin,
Jessica [INAUDIBLE],

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.510
Maura Madden, Paul Baron, and
in particular, Becky Wasserman,

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:17.010
who I just can't believe how
much she did to make this

01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:17.570
happen.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:20.810
And I am incredibly
grateful to her.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.850
So to summarize, I
don't think I can really

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:25.730
put it all into thought.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.200
So what I'm going
to do is just use

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.350
some of the quotes that were
memorable that I wrote down,

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:32.410
and hopefully it won't
take up too much time.

01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:35.110
But these were quotes that
came out of people's mouths,

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:38.994
both in the comedy
session and today.

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.660
And they were just
things that I flagged

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:44.080
that seemed to, in a sense,
encapsulate the conference.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.560
So from last night--
"women are fed

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.920
so many contradictory
messages that all you can do

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:55.820
is be a robot." "Tragedy
plus time equals comedy."

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.200
"Language reifies binary.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.150
This is sufficient
grounds for change."

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.260
"Reality is constructed
with language."

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:08.020
"Women have natural
power." "Matrilineal tribes

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.980
are more accepting of
third and fourth genders

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.290
than patriarchal tribes."

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:17.430
"There is no trans equivalent
of the Academie Francaise

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.610
in regard to language change.

01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:24.000
It's too important to
rush." "Be shamelessly

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.320
flexible with your
language." "If I am passing,

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:33.970
someone else is failing." "When
we center the marginalized,

01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:36.630
we become liberated."
"Get closer

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:40.160
to a multi-layered self."

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.470
Echoing another
thought-- "Women are

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:46.730
faced with impossible
images in media."

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:50.010
"Allow yourself to
embrace uncertainty."

01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:52.620
"An opinion is the short
skirt of the internet."

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:55.040
I like that one.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.050
"The rise of the word
misandry in social media."

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:05.830
"Communication is
incredibly contextual."

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:08.440
From a questioner-- "If
I get policed by men,

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.550
I get policed by men, but
secretly supported by women."

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:16.660
"Women, no matter what they
do, it's the wrong choice."

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.910
"If your uterus is
functioning, your brain can't."

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:22.399
Ironically.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.490
The term "role ricochet"
which was made up

01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:25.779
for this conference.

01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:26.336
Thanks, Mary.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:32.680
"That is way sexier, a
gorilla playing on drums."

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.079
Again, context is everything.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.319
"A dad man, this
makes me insane.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:43.359
So when I go to work, does
this make me a mom dad?"

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:47.640
And the one that Mary had
to tell me to shut up.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.229
"Look at what this does
for resting bitch face."

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:54.859
In terms of run like a girl--
"It means run as fast as you

01:08:54.859 --> 01:09:00.370
can." "She's not doing better
because she shouts too much."

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:03.670
"We're not allowed to
laugh too big or too loud."

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:05.850
And I guess I'll
end with this one.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.279
"Are we capable of saying
what we really mean?"

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.170
That sounds like a
good one to end it on.

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:12.880
So thank you so
much for attending.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.560
You've been a great audience.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.686
And I think it's been
a great set of panels.

01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:19.274
And I've learned
an amazing amount.

01:09:19.274 --> 01:09:20.820
So I'm just grateful for all.

01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:24.170
