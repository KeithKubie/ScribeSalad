MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for
coming out to today's talk

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.400
with authors at Google.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.310
I stumbled across a documentary
called "Crime After Crime"

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.160
on Netflix one night,
and I was really

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.690
quickly sucked into this movie.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.540
I was really surprised by it,
and it's a heart wrenching

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.770
story about a
woman named Debbie.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.070
And without getting
into the gory details--

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.210
because I'm not
a lawyer-- Debbie

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.970
was convicted of the murder
of her abusive boyfriend

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.352
and sentenced to 25
years to life in prison.

00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:33.810
But under a new
law that was passed

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.600
in the state of California
that allows cases involving

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.270
battered women to
be reconsidered,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.730
two lawyers took on the task of
getting Debbie out of prison.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.490
Joshua and his colleague Nadia
got to work setting her free,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.930
and they hit basically
every conceivable obstacle

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.210
you can imagine.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.140
And what was supposed to
be-- from what I understand--

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.350
a relatively short case,
which I think means somewhere

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.160
in the six month
range, ended up taking

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.580
eight years of pro bono work.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.080
And they could've
quit at any point.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.420
They have families, and
wives, and all of these things

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.050
that make you not
to do pro bono work.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.460
But their unwavering dedication
and commitment for justice

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.532
drove them through the better
part of a decade of this work,

00:01:20.532 --> 00:01:21.990
and it's exactly
the qualities that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.120
made me reach out to Joshua in a
complete shot in the dark email

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.190
and that-- to my
surprise-- worked out.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.220
So "Crime After Crime" screened
on the Oprah Winfrey Network

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.900
and in theaters nationwide.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.400
The film was an official
selection of the 2011 Sundance

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.300
Film Festival, has won 25
awards, and more recently,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.810
he's authored his memoir "Free
Spirit: Growing Up On The Road

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.690
And Off The Grid".

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.300
Hitchhiking for years
around the American West

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.950
with a WIC and welfare
mother in the '80s,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.540
Safran didn't attend
school until sixth grade,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.250
living in buses, Utopian
communes, on a tree stump,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.270
and even in an ice cream truck.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.210
Eventually, his mother
married an abusive alcoholic

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.370
ex-American
guerrilla fighter who

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.020
made Safran's life unbearable.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.910
So Joshua shared his story
with NPR, BBC, CBS, and Fox,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.860
and he's been around the
Bay Area quite a bit.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.020
And he's here to share
his story with us today.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.959
So without further ado,
here's Joshua Safran.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.000
JOSHUA SAFRAN: Thank you.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.135
Thank you to Brian.

00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:30.321
Can you hear me in
the back all right?

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:30.820
Okay.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.060
So thank you Brian.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.220
I think it's a
testament strangely

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.310
of the power of the internet
that I was at home one evening,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.270
and somewhere out in
the ether, this movie

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.860
was living in the
land of Netflix.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.690
And suddenly I got this
email, and here we are today.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.930
And I want to thank
Brian for reaching out.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.780
One of the big questions that
came up as part of my advocacy

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.280
work on behalf of Deborah--
this battered woman who

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.500
was serving life in
prison-- is why you?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.080
Why this large, white, hairy
man representing this African

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.530
American woman from
South Central LA

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.530
who had been convicted
of killing her batterer?

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.260
And why did you stick
with the case for so long?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.250
And I used to give a
lot of false reasons--

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.040
which made me seem better and
cooler than I really was--

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.630
like because in the pursuit
of justice we cannot pause

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.320
for anything, we
have to move forward,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.630
and because I'm dedicated.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.360
And some of the reasons
were truer than others,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.430
including the fact
the Debbie is and was

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.840
an incredibly charismatic
person and really

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.010
made you want to advocate
for her when you met her.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.540
But there was a deeper
reason, and it was one

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.174
that I wasn't really
willing to talk about.

00:03:46.174 --> 00:03:47.590
But Debbie's case
and representing

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.110
her was an important
transformative

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.520
experience for me, and I'll step
back for a moment and just say,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.350
I'm happy to be back
on the west coast.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.910
I've been travelling
on a book tour.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.368
I've been on the
east coast and was

00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:00.520
surprised to find that
people still keep up

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.980
with the Joneses, 1950s style.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.870
So it's like everyone
has to have the latest

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.640
car, and the bigger house,
and move to the fancier

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.130
neighborhood, and in Miami, get
the latest cosmetic surgery,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.406
which is very strange for me.

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:15.530
And I was trying to explain
to someone at the Miami

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.850
book fair-- one
of my hosts-- how

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.490
it's different out
in the Bay Area,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.566
and she said, well,
how do you keep up

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:23.940
with the Joneses
in the Bay Area?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.620
And I said, well, if you
had been the first one

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.230
to sell pot to the
Symbionese Liberation Army,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.130
or if you learned
how to brew tea

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.650
from a forgotten
tribe in Myanmar, that

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.920
would give you street cred.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.420
That would give you
bragging rights.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.490
That's really what we value.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.410
And I say that because
my wife Leah who's

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.770
here-- for many years really
had a lot of street cred

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.760
in Berkeley, because
she grew up in and out

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.600
of a hot tub in Big
Sur, California.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.780
Her yard at her
home was littered

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.460
with clay sculptures
of female genitalia.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.210
In fact, the first
time I went to her home

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.400
and met her parents, I
tripped over something.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.860
And I looked down and said,
is that a giant clitoris?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.010
And Leah's mother
said, oh, good for you.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.990
Great.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.960
So Leah knew though that she
had met the right person when

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.654
she met me, because
she said, you're

00:05:11.654 --> 00:05:13.070
the first person
I've ever met who

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.390
has a better
childhood than I did.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.859
You've really got the street
cred for all of the reasons

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.400
that Brian mentioned, including
living in an ice cream truck.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.734
And Leah for years said,
you've got to write your story.

00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:25.025
Who else had these experiences?

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:25.810
It's so strange.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.250
We all know about
the 1960s and all

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.500
these counter-cultural rainbow
warriors who went off and lived

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.110
in these communes,
but we don't hear

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.690
about the aftermath of
all that, the dark side

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.847
of the Age of Aquarius.

00:05:36.847 --> 00:05:38.180
What happened to their children?

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.540
And I was interested
in telling this story

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.390
and writing about
it, but I couldn't

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.550
for a number of reasons,
including the fact

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.460
that the second
half of my childhood

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.190
were a series of incredibly
embarrassing and humiliating

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.880
experiences that I had
that I didn't want anyone

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.750
to know about.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.210
So with that, I decided
not to become a writer,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.410
but to become a lawyer.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.820
It was my attainment
of the American dream.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.190
When I was 25 years
old, I graduated

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.540
from UC Berkeley School of Law,
and I got an unbelievable offer

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.440
to work at a large
corporate law firm

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.320
where I met my friend
Renee who's here today.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.360
We had offices from
London to Tokyo,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.700
and I felt like I
was really someone.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.460
I'd arrived.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.690
We had these beautiful
white carpets,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.560
and if you spilled
something on the carpet,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.040
a guy would literally
run out of a closet,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.390
and clean it up in front of
you, and disappear again.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.090
I had my own corner office
with a name plaque on it

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.870
with my name.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.460
And on the first day, my
secretary came, and said,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.400
I don't mind.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.830
I'm happy to do your dry
cleaning for you if you'd like.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.590
And I nodded.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.190
In my mind, I was like I know
dry cleaning has something

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.574
to do with laundry,
and I don't think

00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:44.740
I own anything drycleanable.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.200
But I was like, thank you.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.230
Thank you very much.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.950
And as I listened to the resumes
and biographies of the people

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.590
around me, I felt
very out of place.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.560
My previous work
experience had been

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.640
as a janitor to work
my way through college,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.110
and then before that
driving large combines,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.920
harvesting peas in rural
Washington state, where

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.880
I had ended up.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.040
So I was trying to
fit in and trying

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.630
to do well, and
about six months in,

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.267
I began to feel a
certain hollowness,

00:07:09.267 --> 00:07:10.850
a certain emptiness
in the work that I

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.190
was doing as I was fighting one
Fortune 500 company on behalf

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.050
of another over $20 million that
neither of them really needed.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.744
And when an opportunity
to represent

00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:23.410
a battered women serving life in
prison for killing her batterer

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.920
came, I leap at the
opportunity without consciously

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.520
knowing why.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.200
I just, yeah that's a project
that I want to be involved in.

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:35.990
One of the strange things
about prisons in California,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.531
they're almost as hard to get
into as they are to get out of,

00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:40.810
so it took me five months
to get security clearance

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.600
to get into the prison to
finally meet this client.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.360
And I was a little
naive, a young lawyer.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.837
And I sat down with
her, and I was like OK,

00:07:48.837 --> 00:07:51.045
your job is to talk, and
I'm going to tell your story

00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:53.120
and get you out of here,
and together we'll do this.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.328
And you got to be really
candid with me and trust me.

00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:56.450
I'm your lawyer.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.620
And this woman looked at me.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.240
Debbie looked at me.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.780
And she said, so
you basically want

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.260
me to tell you all of the most
humiliating horrible things

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.650
that have ever happened
to me in my entire life

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.700
so that you can make
them a public document.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.750
And I was like, yeah,
that's the plan.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.340
And not surprisingly, she had
a hard time disclosing to me

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.670
and telling me about the
experiences that she had had,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.780
until almost a year
went by, and I still

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.700
felt like she wasn't
really being truthful.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.980
She wasn't remembering
a lot of things

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.210
that I assumed that she
really did remember.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.169
And finally she said
look, you're a man,

00:08:26.169 --> 00:08:27.710
and a lot of the
things that happened

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.876
to me, all these horrible
things that happened to me

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.360
happened at that hands of a man.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.030
And it's hard for me to
just tell you these things.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.620
And I said, well,
can you tell me

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.100
something that was maybe
funny, or ironic, or strange,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.080
something that's not
as humiliating to you?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.420
And the memory that she
chose was an important one.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.600
She said, when he
was done whipping me,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.160
he would get raw
steaks, and put them

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.810
on my welts to bring
down the swelling.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.435
And it was funny, because
it was dead flesh.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:59.030
It was dead meat, but it
was giving me new life.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.050
And also he was the batterer,
but he was also the healer,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.490
and it was strange that way.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:09.140
And the memory of the raw meat
was a real trigger for me,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.120
and I broke right through the
attorney client relationship.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.750
And I said, oh, I
forgot about the meat.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.150
And for me, it was funny,
because we were vegetarians.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.340
To kill and eat an
animal was murder.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.580
You would never
ever eat an animal,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.250
but it was somehow OK for my
stepfather to beat the hell out

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.359
of my mother, and
we had meat on hand

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:34.650
to bring down the swelling
on her cheekbone on her face

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.660
so she could be presentable.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.670
And Debbie, my client, looked
at me like you're not my lawyer.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.196
You're like me.

00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:43.070
What's going on here?

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.370
And she began asking
me all these questions.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.070
And the next thing
I knew she was

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.220
taking my statement,
if you will.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.720
And I had this
strange realization

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.950
that I'd never talked about the
experiences I'd had as a kid,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.210
not even with my mother--
with whom I experienced them

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.580
all-- and my first
therapy moment

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.250
was in a maximum
security prison for women

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.200
where my therapist
was a convicted

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.730
killer in the shadow of the
sniper tower through the razor

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.230
wire.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.200
And that was my first moment of
talking about the experiences

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.730
that I'd had in the second
half of my childhood.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.620
And Debbie after that
said, I felt in that day

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.750
that we were like a
couple of war veterans

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.130
and that we were rolling
up our sleeves to compare

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.060
our scars-- both
figurative and literal--

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.300
and that's when I trusted you.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.900
So I stumbled into
doing the right thing.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.370
Subsequently, I talked to
seasoned criminal defense

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.059
attorneys who were
like, huge mistake.

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:37.350
You never befriend your client.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.683
That was totally unprofessional.

00:10:38.683 --> 00:10:40.460
What were you thinking?

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.530
But it turned out to be
an important mistake,

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.810
because at that point, Debbie
was willing to disclose to me.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.170
And we really talked
with one another.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.760
And at that point,
once I had the courage

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.990
to talk about this story,
I began to feel like, well,

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.800
maybe I could write
about these things

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.790
and tie that into my advocacy.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.930
And I came to this
realization that the reason

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.990
in one way that I was
really doing this case

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.790
was to prove to my
10-year-old self

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.100
that I was finally strong
enough and courageous enough

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.570
to stand up for someone
who is being battered,

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.200
even though it was
many years later.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.994
And shortly thereafter, we
began to have media inquiries.

00:11:17.994 --> 00:11:20.160
We had raised a lot of
attention with Debbie's case.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.190
We ended up disqualifying
all 1,000 attorneys

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.980
of the Los Angeles District
Attorney's office for conflicts

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.450
of interest, which was
a really big story.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.690
And we got a call from the
San Francisco Chronicle

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.260
who said, well, we want to do
a profile on the lawyers, you

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.790
and your partner.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.860
And I said, no, I
don't want to do that,

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.610
because I knew that
the question was going

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.710
to be, well, what motivated
you to take this case?

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.830
And I didn't want
to go into that.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.372
And a couple weeks later,
I told that to Debbie

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.330
as we were doing an
update, and she said, well,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.020
why don't you want
to do the story?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.027
You should do the story.

00:11:51.027 --> 00:11:51.610
It'd be great.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.110
And I was like, no,
it should really

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.690
be about the client,
not the lawyer.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.840
And she was like, are you
afraid to talk about your life

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.139
and what happened in your life?

00:11:59.139 --> 00:11:59.930
And I said, no, no.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.030
I'm not afraid.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.830
And Deb is a very
perceptive person.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.644
She said, all the things you
told me, it wasn't my fault,

00:12:06.644 --> 00:12:09.060
I had nothing to be ashamed
of, and more importantly we're

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.490
breaking these taboos
and the wall of silence

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.410
and talking about
domestic violence,

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.950
and you're here
the perfect case.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:19.060
Because your mother was this
militant feminist, someone

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.090
who was on the avant-garde of
the women's movement, and yet

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.500
she became a victim
of domestic violence.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.310
So you have to tell your story.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.300
And I still wasn't quite
ready, and then she

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.360
did the truly nuclear
option in the Bay Area.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.920
And she said, a lot of people
think that domestic violence

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.420
only happens to poor black
women in South Central LA.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.520
And at that point, I was
like, okay, I'll do it.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.802
And I did this interview.

00:12:42.802 --> 00:12:44.760
And the night before the
Chronicle article ran,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.310
I was in this law firm.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.440
I was looking at these
beautiful white carpets

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.560
and thinking, tomorrow
morning I'm basically

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.900
just going to smear
mud on all of them,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.467
because here I am this
lawyer, this professional,

00:12:55.467 --> 00:12:57.300
and I'm going to be
talking, telling stories

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.420
about being a 10-year-old
crying at my own powerlessness,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.020
at not defending my mother,
and her head being swollen up

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.820
to the size of a
melon, and how am I

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.980
going to face these people.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.370
And I came in the next morning,
and there was some awkwardness.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.940
One of the male partners who
I worked with for years looked

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.180
at me like, this
guy's damaged goods.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.420
I thought I knew you,
and now I don't know you.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.890
But the overwhelming response
that I got from the people

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.476
that I worked with was good
for you, you're courageous,

00:13:22.476 --> 00:13:23.850
thank you for
telling your story.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.270
And even some of
the women attorneys

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.020
who I worked with who
came and spoke to me

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.080
and said, something similar
happened in my case,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.020
in my life.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.230
And so that was a very
empowering experience.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.420
And then this movie
"Crime After Crime"

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.780
showed-- as Brian said-- at
the Sundance Film Festival.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.400
And it has me talking a little
bit about my experiences,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.874
and all these offers came.

00:13:41.874 --> 00:13:43.790
Oh, come speak to our
domestic violence group.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.081
Come speak to this high school.

00:13:45.081 --> 00:13:45.850
Come speak here.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.510
So I began speaking about
it, but again as an attorney,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.720
not as a survivor myself.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.350
And then I ended up doing
a spoken word piece talking

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.900
about this raw meat interaction
that Debbie and I had,

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.420
and this overwhelming sense
of shame and humiliation

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.440
at not stepping in
to defend my mother

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.680
and for the worst reason.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.190
The reason being that I was
too afraid for my own safety

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.450
that I was going to be
killed, which intellectually

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.160
I can look back and
say, I was only 10.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.170
What was I really going to do?

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.211
But when you're 10, you're
not thinking that way,

00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:20.570
and your brain develops around
the idea that you're a coward

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.970
and that you're not
doing the right thing.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.807
And so I did a spoken
word piece about that,

00:14:24.807 --> 00:14:26.640
and this guy came up
to me in LA afterwards.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.340
He's about 45 years old,
totally ripped, tattooed.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.490
And he comes up and he's
like, hearing you speak,

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.760
I know that I'm in an
abusive relationship.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.090
And I'm looking at this guy
like, who is abusing this man?

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.380
He looks like a cage fighter.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.466
How can it be?

00:14:41.466 --> 00:14:42.840
And as he's telling
me his story,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.964
I begin to understand more.

00:14:43.964 --> 00:14:46.700
He says, I never hit the kids.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.897
And I have a son,
and I didn't even

00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:50.480
think that he knew
what was happening.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.280
But she gets me so jealous.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.540
She gets me so angry I
can't control myself,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.760
and I don't want my
son to have to end up

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.930
like you talking
about this someday.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.970
So I'm going to go back
to my 12 step program,

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.410
and I know I can't really
control it anymore.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.940
So I know that now.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.960
And I had this
moment of OK, well

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.780
somehow I just affected
this guy's life.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.690
So I'm going to start
to talk about my story.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:17.740
So my story begins I was born
into a convene of witches

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.190
in a commune in the
Haight-Ashbury in 1975.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.040
And when I say the convene of
witches line on the East coast,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.638
people are usually like,
what are you talking about?

00:15:26.638 --> 00:15:27.570
Witches?

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.920
In San Francisco, people
are like, do you know Dave,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.890
because I know that he grew up
in a-- so I'll throw that out

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.390
there.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.589
Witch is not the Halloween
variety of witches,

00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:41.630
but rather my mother was
part of a group of women

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.710
who were reclaiming religion
from the patriarchy.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.730
They felt that men
and male domination

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.070
had derailed religion over
the course of many millennia,

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.600
and they were taking it back.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.530
So my first memory as a little
boy was some day I'll grow up,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.757
and I'll have a womb,
and I'll bear a child,

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.590
and that'll be the best
thing that I can do.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.160
And they finally broke the
news like, look little man.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.109
You'll never be
able to have a baby.

00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:09.650
And then my mother
at a certain point

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.200
felt witchcraft is too
organized of a religion.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.460
And she said, I can be
tripping my brains out,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.940
but it still feels like church.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.100
This is too organized.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.857
In 1980, I was coming
of age to go to school,

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:25.690
and my mother felt very
strongly that school

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.799
was no place for children.

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:28.590
That was literally
something that she said.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.660
School is no place for kids.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.980
It teaches capitalism, and
competition, and violence.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.900
And this isn't the future that
I want for my young warlock.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.850
She was going to train
me to be a warlock

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.090
and a revolutionary leader.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.310
She felt for sure that
the Vietnam War was

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.910
going to cause an overthrow
of the US government,

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.080
and she was going to be a
leader in that movement.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.680
And when that didn't
happen, she knew

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.490
that it was only
a matter of time

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.630
until I would be drafted--
because I was a boy--

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.530
and sent off to die
for the next lie

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.050
that the Man was going to
force upon the American people.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.920
So she wanted to
take to the hills

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.060
and raise me to use
my third eye-- the one

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.280
that society didn't
want me to know about--

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.280
to use my clairvoyance
and psychic powers.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.140
And when the revolution
happened again,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.560
we would descend from the
hills, and I would be a leader.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.099
And so I like to
analogize us to being-- I

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.140
don't know if you've seen
the movie-- "Terminator 2"

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.980
with Sarah Connor
knowing that there

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.800
are these robots
from the future.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.950
Except in our version
of it, there actually

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.630
were no robots from the future.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.320
Sarah Connor really was
just off a little bit.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.260
And that was the
way that we grew up,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.840
that I grew up, wandering
from place to place,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.390
different communes, the
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh people

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.190
in Oregon, back to the
land White Native Americans

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.781
in Idaho, made their
own buck skin clothing,

00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:48.280
all the while without
running water,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.867
without electricity,
toilets, refrigeration.

00:17:50.867 --> 00:17:52.450
And the one commonality
that I noticed

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.630
with all these various
intentional communities

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.720
was whatever their purported
philosophy was, there always

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.400
was a strong man who
rose up to be the leader

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.280
and eventually took
on a concubine.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.159
And it was right about
the concubine time

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:07.450
that it got weird, and we left.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.350
And we seemed to hit
all these communes right

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.200
at concubine time.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.650
So we're moving
from place to place,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.420
and throughout it I
was brought up to never

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.230
to call my mother mom or mother.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.280
I called her Claudia.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.994
It would have been sexist and
reductionist to call her mom,

00:18:22.994 --> 00:18:24.660
because she was much
more than a mother.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.750
She was a full human being
with a full range of identity

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.890
and human expression,
and to just bootstrap her

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.150
into that one little identity
would have been wrong.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.608
So I called her
Claudia throughout.

00:18:35.608 --> 00:18:38.120
I grew up learning about
herstory not history--

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.300
because history,
again, is sexist--

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:47.272
and really spotting all of the
sexism, and racism, and all

00:18:47.272 --> 00:18:49.230
of the things that my
mother trained me to see.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.030
And when we would be in these
small towns in rural Oregon,

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.090
or Washington, or
Idaho, someone would

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.880
be like, what team
are you rooting for.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.700
And my mother's stock
answer was whatever team

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.490
has the larger
population of urban poor,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.760
because domestic
violence rates go down

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.610
when the home team wins.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.870
That was her philosophy
about-- so she

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.230
was very attuned to
all these issues.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.750
However, when I
was nine, she began

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.200
doing Central
American amnesty work.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.690
And she believed that the
US backed death squads

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.500
in Central America.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.409
US foreign policy in Central
America was the new Vietnam.

00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:27.950
It was only a matter
of time until it

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.960
was going to escalate
into a full war,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.190
and she was doing this
asylum work getting refugees

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.800
from Central America fleeing
these foreign wars that we'd

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.789
caused and getting them health
care, and a place to stay,

00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:41.580
and that kind of thing
while we were living

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.200
on a cabin on a mountain,
a half built cabin

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.600
on the side of a mountain.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.315
And she met a man who was 10
years younger than she was,

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.500
who was her ideal man.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.110
He was a Che Guevara
figure, a fighter,

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.990
a guerrilla commander
from El Salvador,

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.610
but also an intellectual,
a poet, a shaman, a healer.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.090
And when she met
him, the spirits

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.950
actually said to her, husband.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.100
And he was somebody
pretty special.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.554
And she met this guy.

00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:11.595
He told her his is story.

00:20:11.595 --> 00:20:14.800
He was crying as he told her
his son had been shot down

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.584
in a crossfire in San Salvador.

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:19.000
That turns out to
have been a lie.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.850
But at the time,
it was very real.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.660
And my mother was
captivated by his story,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.290
because he had been tortured
by these death squads

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.630
and had survived and escaped,
and he had given up, lost

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.654
his family in defending the poor
and helpless in El Salvador.

00:20:33.654 --> 00:20:35.070
So she was really
taken in by him.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.300
He was also very muscular,
physically powerfully built guy

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.870
who would tell her things
like, sometimes when

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.250
I'm talking to you I feel
like all of the suffering

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.680
that I went through in my
life was to get me to you,

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.110
so I can meet you, this
most beautiful woman

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.390
that I've ever met.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.730
And of course, she ended
up taking him to her bed.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.400
And he was a very sensitive
guy, and he cried a lot.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.490
But over time, because he
had PTSD and various trauma

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.386
that he'd experienced, he had
nightmares and flashbacks,

00:21:04.386 --> 00:21:06.010
and he would sometimes
lash out at her,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.960
slapping her, a black eye
here and there, shoving her,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.060
strange rages.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.656
But this was all part of the
trauma that he'd experienced,

00:21:13.656 --> 00:21:15.030
and after all, we
were Americans.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.390
And as Americans, weren't
we somewhat responsible

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.130
for US foreign policy?

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.579
And we are in some way
responsible for the things

00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:23.620
that had happened to him.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.400
So my mother was trying to
do chakra readings on him,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.150
and healing with him,
and counseling with him

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.180
to make him better.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.670
And he, of course,
turned to drink,

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.560
because alcohol was a way of
masking some of the trauma

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.460
that he'd experienced.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.460
And one of his favorite things
to do besides lashing out

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.080
at my mother, at that point,
was to fight with cops.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.170
He would go into town, and
he would get in these fights

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.310
when he was drunk
with police officers,

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.780
in part, because
he always wanted

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.440
to know who the real man was.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.426
And with a cop, no one got
to prove one way or another,

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.300
because the cops would
cheat-- in his words--

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.260
by pulling out a gun
and arresting him

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.560
instead of being real
men and fighting him.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.880
So one of these occasions
he was arrested,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.760
and they let him
out when we made

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.090
bail, thanks to a generous
gift from my grandmother.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.390
And they revealed to us-- his
public defender reveals to us

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.010
that they're going to initiate
deportation proceedings

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.540
and send him back
to El Salvador.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.370
He was in the country illegally.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.390
And he reveals to us
that the second his foot

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.366
hits that tarmac at Cuscatlan
Airport in San Salvador,

00:22:25.366 --> 00:22:27.240
he'll be drilled through
the back of the head

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.090
by the death squads
and die right there.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.440
So my mother is faced
with the decision.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.410
Does she want the
man that she loves

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.170
to have a death
sentence passed on him--

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:37.800
which is what
deportation would be--

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.050
or does she want
to try to help him?

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.690
So, of course, she wants to help
him, and the only way that she

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.010
can think of to help him is to
marry him, because by marrying

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.620
him, that's a path
to citizenship.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.670
So the night before the wedding,
my soon to be stepfather

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.050
gets into the box of wine
that we have and just

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.900
beats the hell out of my mother
with closed fists in front

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.790
of me.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.950
And the next morning there's no
question the wedding will not

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.060
be canceled, but it
will be postponed

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.370
to allow my mother's face time
to become more recognizable.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.000
So 10 days later,
they're married.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.220
My mother who had never
worn makeup in her life--

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.790
because it's sexist for
women to wear make up--

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.880
is coated in make up to cover up
her black eye and the swellings

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.290
that she still has.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.790
And this man-- Leopoldo is his
name-- becomes my stepfather.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.620
And I talk more about
this in "Free Spirit",

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.510
but the next four
years of our lives

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.140
are spent surviving and
ultimately overcoming Leopoldo.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.820
As part of this, I decide
I got to go to school.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.806
School is a place
for kids, and perhaps

00:23:38.806 --> 00:23:40.180
more importantly,
school is a way

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.510
of getting away from this guy,
at least for part of the day.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.109
So at that point, we are finding
ourselves physically more

00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:48.650
isolated than we've
ever been before.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.150
We're living on one of the
San Juan islands on the floor,

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.050
sleeping on the forest floor
of a temperate rain forest.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.620
And my mother and
stepfather have

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.670
salvaged old wooden pallets
from behind a dumpster

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.830
at Thrift Foods.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.390
And we're sleeping on the
forest floor on these pallets.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.150
I emerged for my first day
of sixth grade very excited

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.570
to go to school covered in
tree sap and pine needles,

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.950
wearing old thrift store
clothing that my mother has

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.880
patched with blue paisley
fabric here and there.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.600
And as you can imagine, I
get on to the bus like, whoo,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.530
I'm going to school.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.640
And the kids are like, we're
going to kick this guy's ass.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.960
So I'm this total freak.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.670
I get that.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.220
I walk out of the
wall of forest.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.590
So I'm being brutalized by the
kids, having a terrible time.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.990
And there must have been a
riot in the teacher's lounge

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.760
when I show up, because
I don't understand

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.510
the dynamics of a
classroom, that you have

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.290
to raise your hand
to be called upon,

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.390
that you can't blurt out
answers, or talk about

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.910
feminist theory, critiquing
what the teacher has to say.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.910
And at the same time, while
I have an adult reading

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.780
abilities-- I can talk about
Russian literature and world

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.447
history-- I don't have any
knowledge of mathematics.

00:24:56.447 --> 00:24:57.780
I don't know what a fraction is.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.470
I don't know how to
do multiplication.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.010
I can't read or write in
cursive or longhand, which

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.779
was a really big deal to him.

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:05.320
So they didn't know
whether to put me

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.909
in remedial classes
or gifted classes.

00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:11.450
And one of the teachers finally
steps up, and she says, look,

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.065
I will tutor you after school.

00:25:13.065 --> 00:25:14.190
You just stay after school.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.580
I'll tutor you.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.940
I can see that you're bright.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.159
I'll help you catch up.

00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:18.950
And I say, well, I
can't stay after school.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.366
I got to get back
on that bus that

00:25:20.366 --> 00:25:22.810
goes over the bridge
to the island and let's

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.650
me off in front of the
forest where we're staying.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.617
And she says, well, your mom
can come and pick you up late.

00:25:28.617 --> 00:25:29.700
And I said, well, I can't.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.444
We had a car, but my stepfather
crashed the car into a stump,

00:25:32.444 --> 00:25:33.610
and now we don't have a car.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.500
And she said, well,
we'll call your mom.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.495
We'll figure this out.

00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:40.600
Well, we don't have a phone, or
any water, electricity, house,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.402
et cetera.

00:25:41.402 --> 00:25:43.110
And she says, well,
where are you living?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.401
And I said, well, my stepfather
is chopping down trees.

00:25:45.401 --> 00:25:46.930
He's trying to build a pyramid.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.050
He believes in the ancient
occult magic of Egypt,

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.830
and he's building us
a wooden pyramid that

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.288
will channel this
energy, and it'll

00:25:54.288 --> 00:25:56.880
be like a healing
place for us to live.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.990
Needless to say, the
pyramid doesn't happen.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.430
In fact, we are squatting on
some land supposedly owned

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.090
by the family of a man named
Crazy John who--as his name

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.580
would imply-- is pretty crazy.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.660
My stepfather, in
a drunken rage,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.550
threatens to kill Crazy John
and his pregnant girlfriend.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.156
We're forced to flee the land
that we lived for a short time

00:26:17.156 --> 00:26:19.280
in town, which is the first
time with running water

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.820
and electricity in a long time.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.360
And in town, not only do
I get to go after school

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.570
and be tutored, because
it's walking distance,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.390
but I have access
to public library.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.340
And so, the library
becomes my home.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.590
I'm the biggest champion
of public libraries,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.140
and the little
kindnesses along the way,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:39.100
and that started me on the
path that led me to you today.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.510
And I think we'll
have some time.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.980
I want to show
you a short video.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.020
It's about three
minutes long that is

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.230
a trailer for the
book and my story.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.210
And I also have
some time for Q&amp;A.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.980
But the one takeaway
that I want to say

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.040
is one of the things
that got me through that

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.260
kept my faith in
human decency were all

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.930
those little
kindnesses-- the teachers

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.346
and the other
people along the way

00:27:00.346 --> 00:27:04.880
who gave me a smile
sometimes or offered to help.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.250
And also one of the
takeaways that I

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.340
gained from Debbie, my client.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.850
When I was first
representing her,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.370
she would ask me a lot of
questions about criminal law,

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.490
and I would say I don't
know the answers to any

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.656
of these questions, because
I don't do criminal law.

00:27:17.656 --> 00:27:19.390
I'm a corporate lawyer.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:20.980
And she finally
said, well, it's OK.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.910
I can't fire you.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.370
There's no one else.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.260
And I laughed, because
that was funny.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.860
There was no one else.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.370
But over time it began
to be a real motivator,

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:31.650
because there was no one else.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.221
If we abandoned Debbie, if we
didn't keep up with her case,

00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:37.720
there was no one who was going
to step forward and help her.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.110
And even though I wasn't an
expert in this area of law,

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.427
nor was my partner.

00:27:41.427 --> 00:27:43.010
The one thing is,
as Brian can attest,

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.290
is we just persevered
and stuck with it.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.386
So I want to give that
blessing to all of you,

00:27:47.386 --> 00:27:49.010
and say that whatever
it is that you're

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.910
passionate about in your lives,
whether it's the work that you

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.007
do here, or things
that you do outside,

00:27:54.007 --> 00:27:56.340
whether it has to do with
domestic violence or something

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.480
else entirely, that
if you just take

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.140
that realization that
if you're waiting

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.300
for some expert or some
industry guru to come in

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.517
and help you in that
issue, they'll never come.

00:28:06.517 --> 00:28:07.600
You'll be waiting forever.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.635
There's just you.

00:28:08.635 --> 00:28:09.720
There's no one else.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.149
So just engage and persevere.

00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:15.690
And if you stick
with it long enough,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.410
you'll be successful
in the way that we

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.000
were in getting Debbie out.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.060
So I'll show you this
three minute movie,

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.519
and we'll do a Q&amp;A.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:44.940
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.244
-Are you the chosen one?

00:28:47.244 --> 00:28:49.730
-No, I'm the hungry one.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.100
-The hungry one?

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.120
What you want to eat boy?

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.004
-A donut.

00:28:54.004 --> 00:28:56.660
-A donut?

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.200
-I was only six years
old, but I already

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.410
wanted more than a donut.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.890
I wanted to be normal, to
live the American dream.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.990
Instead, I got
whatever this is, all

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:11.464
because my mother wanted to
find some place called Utopia.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.315
-Can I go to bed now?

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.680
-We hit the open road in 1980.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.850
-When are we going
to get somewhere?

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.630
-Utopia could be right
around the corner, Joshie.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:33.050
Use your third eye, and
we'll get there faster.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.170
-We hitchhiked for five years.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.338
My mother was looking
for a place to call home.

00:29:44.338 --> 00:29:45.314
-Here.

00:29:45.314 --> 00:29:49.000
This could be our home.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.940
Oh, my god.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.880
This is our home.

00:29:56.482 --> 00:30:00.060
-And I was looking for a father.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:05.040
-Hey, a donut.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.378
-Sir.

00:30:07.378 --> 00:30:09.460
-Why is he calling your sir?

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.205
-Because he respects me.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.270
-It is perfectly good.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.800
-One of these men
actually cared about me.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.040
-Good move, Josh.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.571
-But my mother chose this guy.

00:30:26.571 --> 00:30:28.536
-He's a freedom fighter.

00:30:28.536 --> 00:30:32.190
He's going to make an amazing
father to you, Joshie.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.082
-He was the worst
decision she ever made.

00:30:37.398 --> 00:30:38.877
-You want to be a man, right?

00:30:38.877 --> 00:30:40.280
Like me?

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.200
Higher.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.040
Don't lie to me.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:43.960
-I'm not lying.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.810
-You're lying to me.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.970
What you going to do, huh?

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.470
-Jake, take me with you.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.950
-Sir, are you his father
or legal guardian?

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:52.639
-No, but I was--

00:30:52.639 --> 00:30:54.430
-Sir, you're going to
have to come with me.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.918
-Josh!

00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:57.406
-[INAUDIBLE]!

00:30:57.406 --> 00:31:00.878
-Huh, you scared?

00:31:00.878 --> 00:31:04.842
-Guns are supposed
to protect you.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:05.342
-Stop!

00:31:10.302 --> 00:31:12.286
-That's all you got?

00:31:16.254 --> 00:31:38.590
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.450
JOSHUA SAFRAN: So
we made that movie

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.660
with the producer and director
of "Crime After Crime".

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.100
We got together to
make this three minute

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.070
trailer with mostly
volunteer cast and crew

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.590
of about 100 over six
days, in the Bay Area.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.590
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.410
One, why did the
trial take so long?

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.730
And two, is the book both about
your journey and the trial,

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.280
or more about your upbringing?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.594
JOSHUA SAFRAN: So the first
question on the trial,

00:32:05.594 --> 00:32:07.010
as Brian said, we
thought it would

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.350
be relatively straightforward.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.370
There was a new
law passed in 2002

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.540
that allowed women who'd been
convicted before California

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.082
recognized what was then called
the battered woman's defense.

00:32:16.082 --> 00:32:18.581
There were all these women that
we're serving life in prison

00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:20.446
and never got to
present that defense.

00:32:20.446 --> 00:32:22.320
So I was like, well, if
you can get a lawyer,

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.220
the lawyer can present it.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:29.030
So it took us a couple years
to just establish the evidence

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.100
that we needed to show that she
had been battered conclusively.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.710
And we knew at that time
that the LA DA was really

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.710
aggressively opposing the
release of all these women,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.050
unlike basically every
other county in California.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.580
Steve was his name.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.410
The LA DA had a real
opposition to these releases.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:52.120
So we ended up getting 12
percipient witness statements

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.066
declarations from all kinds of
people, including neighbors,

00:32:55.066 --> 00:32:56.690
and friends of the
batterer, et cetera,

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.620
so we felt like we had
a pretty solid case.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.110
That was about two years in.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.000
We went to LA.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.290
We actually met with Steve
Cooley-- the LA DA himself--

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.110
and got a plea deal that she
would get out for time served,

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.950
because of all
this new evidence.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.200
And not only do we
have it on a handshake,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.240
we had it in writing.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.880
And we unfortunately
ran into what could only

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.470
be described as office
politics, believe it or not.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.460
So the woman who was the head
of the Appellate division--

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.100
who was nominally in charge
of these kinds of cases--

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.680
had never been consulted,
because we accidentally

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.250
went to the top
guy, the elected DA.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.300
And she apparently
threw what was

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.330
called a political firestorm
and was yelling, and screaming,

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.340
and throwing things in the DA's
office, and they got back to us

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.680
and said, well, we're
not honoring that.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.970
We are hereby
withdrawing the offer

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.640
that you've already accepted,
and we will oppose you.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.800
And at that point, we said,
well, that's unlawful,

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.549
and we'll sue you.

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:52.520
And they said, OK, do your best.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.290
So it ended up dragging on and
on, because we had to sue them.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:01.249
And, of course, the judicial
process is very slow,

00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:03.790
and then there were a number of
twists and turns in the case,

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:08.106
including revelations that
not only was Debbie legally

00:34:08.106 --> 00:34:10.230
innocent and she had this
battered woman's defense,

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.690
but she was actually factually
innocent, didn't do the killing

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.719
herself, didn't
engineer the killing.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.980
In fact, the DA's
only witness that

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.810
established that was a
paid police informant who

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:22.060
perjured himself on the stand.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.310
The DA's office knew about it.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.570
So it snowballed into this
bigger and bigger case,

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.190
until finally a judge held
that they were circling

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.750
the wagons to protect their
professional reputations.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.380
So the case really
for them became

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.530
about covering up misdeeds,
because their own people

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.170
were going to be
fired, or worse,

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.850
if the truth came
out in this case.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.949
So that was why the case
ended up taking so long.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:52.040
And it was a lead case in
this battered women's law

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.719
in California and looked
to in various other states

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.470
as to the entire
criminal justice system,

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.950
how can this happen, how is
this going to work, et cetera.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.280
So that was that answer.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.830
The book is really more just
my childhood story, basically

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.300
from 0 to 12.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.335
And then I have a
chapter where I tie it

00:35:10.335 --> 00:35:11.654
into that work on that case.

00:35:11.654 --> 00:35:14.070
And I think it wasn't really
until I wrote the book that I

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:18.800
really realized much
of my motivation

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.560
really, at least
in taking the case,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.460
but also in sticking
with it is that,

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.290
again, the strange
feeling of powerlessness.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.220
And somehow this case
in a very real way

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.110
allowed me to prove to myself
at least that, oh, yeah, I

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:32.830
can do something.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.746
I can do what's right.

00:35:33.746 --> 00:35:35.350
And as I thought
about it, I thought

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.360
what I really wanted when
I graduated from law school

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.399
and as I was becoming a
man was a time machine.

00:35:42.399 --> 00:35:43.940
I just wanted for
whatever-- you have

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.450
these experiences in your life,
you want to go back in time,

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:50.337
and help yourself
or help someone.

00:35:50.337 --> 00:35:52.420
And since I didn't have
time traveling capability,

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.860
maybe Google will develop that.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.790
But at the time, that
wasn't available to me.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.456
So I thought well, the next best
thing is I can become a lawyer,

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:00.690
and find people who
are similarly situated,

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.670
and help them, and that
will metaphorically

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.460
fix what I went through.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.820
AUDIENCE: So what part does
religion play in your life?

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.170
JOSHUA SAFRAN: That's
a great question.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.600
Religion played a very
important role for me.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.730
As you heard, I was brought
up with star gazers,

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:21.170
and constellation
worshipers, and pagans.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.170
But more than anything, I
was brought up with nothing.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.970
Even at the most remote
areas of the counterculture,

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.670
beyond on the perimeter, people
still celebrated Christmas.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.860
I mean, you could be an Indian
guru somewhere up in Oregon,

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.270
but you would still have a
Christmas tree, and an Easter

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.514
egg hunt, and all that.

00:36:38.514 --> 00:36:39.930
My mother didn't
have any of that.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.980
So we had absolutely nothing.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.530
And unlike everyone else
who was from somewhere,

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.540
my mother didn't know
where we were from.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.040
And I, at one point, talked to
my grandmother-- her mother--

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.370
and said, where are we from?

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.070
My grandmother said, who knew?

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.260
And I was like,
surely you must know

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.550
where the family came from.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:57.050
Who knew?

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.530
They kept changing the borders.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.360
So it was this sense
of we're from nowhere.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.990
We don't believe in anything.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:05.260
And I had a very
innate spiritual sense.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.790
I went through a lot of
life or death experiences

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.840
and really did feel at times
that I was being shepherded

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.430
by some otherworldly force,
but I had no vocabulary for it.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.130
So when I was nine,
my mother and I

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.910
were living on the
side of this mountain,

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.960
and we passed a
cabin down the trail.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.260
And this guy who was-- I
don't know exactly what

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.550
he did-- but he lived in
Seattle, his vacation home,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.175
When he wanted to
get away from it all,

00:37:27.175 --> 00:37:29.837
he came and lived by our
main house where we lived.

00:37:29.837 --> 00:37:31.920
And my mother started
talking to him and, he said,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.870
where are you from?

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.020
And my mother said, oh,
we're from San Francisco.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.200
And he goes, ain't no
landsman from the Bay Area,

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.527
no Jews from San Francisco.

00:37:40.527 --> 00:37:43.110
And my mother laughs, and said,
how'd you know we were Jewish.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:43.830
And he said, look at your kid.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.150
He's got a rabbi's nose.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.840
And they started
talking and laughing.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.620
And finally he ended
his little soliloquy,

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.110
and he said, so I must have
been the only Italian kid

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.380
in Brooklyn with not one,
but two bar mitzvahs.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.064
And my mother thought this
was hilarious, and we left.

00:37:58.064 --> 00:38:00.480
And it was this strange moment
for me, where all of sudden

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.600
there was some history.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.440
This guy new things about
us, and strange places,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.110
and things beyond east
of the Mississippi.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.210
So when we got out into
the darkening mist,

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.420
I asked my mother,
what are we again?

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.410
That guy knew about us,
and my nose, and something.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.040
Aw yeah, we're Jews.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.480
What does that mean?

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.540
Well like Freud,
Einstein, Marks, Jews.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.400
So I thought about that.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.830
I was like, we're
related to them?

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.010
Sort of.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.610
Then she gave me a
good Jewish answer.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.840
She said, we should go to
the library and look it up.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.090
So when I finally got into
town and I went to the library,

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:42.050
I really went in with no sense
of what I was looking for

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.950
and came away with this
Encyclopedia Britannica

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.080
introduction, which was so we're
descended from this ancient

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.400
tribe that wrote the Bible and
introduced the world to God

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.860
and is supposed to shine like
a beacon of righteousness.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.660
But the thing that
really touched me

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.420
about the Jewish story
that I read in this library

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.850
was that it mimicked my own
life, this nomadic wandering

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:09.010
from place to place,
perpetually demeaned,

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.250
and discriminated against
by various people,

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.860
yet still thriving and
living by your wits.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.400
And that really
resonated with me.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.080
So I think that was
my introduction.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.916
And then as part of
that, I went and talked

00:39:20.916 --> 00:39:22.540
to my mother, who
then told me that she

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.330
had given up a
child for adoption.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.840
When she was a
teenager, she briefly

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.730
dated a Colombian
Marxist revolutionary

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.400
and had given up this
baby for adoption,

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.930
and somewhere in New Jersey
I had a half brother.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.870
And somehow in my mind that
was that he was probably living

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:38.181
a Jewish life, because it
was New Jersey after all.

00:39:38.181 --> 00:39:39.930
And everyone in New
Jersey must be Jewish.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.870
And so I had this sense
that somewhere out there

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.161
were my people-- I didn't
know who or where they were--

00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:46.187
and someday he would
clasp me by the arm,

00:39:46.187 --> 00:39:48.270
and pull me up out of this
smashing and screaming,

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.770
and take me home.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.960
So that became part
of my own mythology.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.570
And then spiritually, a
couple years later, my mother

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.350
had dated a Rastafarian
Mennonite-- which

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.360
to give the picture--
no mustache,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.860
but chin beard and dreadlocks.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.020
And he made this mixtape
of reggae music for me.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.880
And so, my mother was obsessed
with Coltrane, and Miles Davis,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.600
and this amazing jazz, which
was very traumatic for me

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.386
to listen to.

00:40:17.386 --> 00:40:18.760
But reggae really
appealed to me.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.380
It had this melodic
spiritual sound to it.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.235
And we're around
the campfire, and I

00:40:23.235 --> 00:40:25.840
was singing this Bob
Marley song, "the stone

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.140
that the builder refuse shall
be the head cornerstone".

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.110
And I didn't know what
a head cornerstone was,

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.750
but I knew that I had been the
stone that the builder refused,

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.910
and that spoke to me.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.160
And so I'm singing that
song, and my mother says,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.810
oh, that's from Psalms.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:41.170
And I was like, this isn't
some weird bible thing.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.820
This is Bob Marley,
roots, truth.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.640
And my Mom, no, no.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.350
She had this book, which
I called the Tonach, which

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.120
was the Tondach--
the Hebrew Bible.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.290
So she gave me this book,
and I'm looking through.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.540
And I find the book
of Psalms and end up

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.686
reading the whole thing
to just disprove her,

00:40:56.686 --> 00:40:58.060
because at that
point in my life,

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.851
I'd rejected everything
that she was about.

00:40:59.851 --> 00:41:02.830
I thought, yes, you can hug
a child with nuclear arms.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.260
Like everything that she
believed in was wrong.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.510
So I started working my way
through the book of Psalms

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.280
to disprove her.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.620
I found out that she was right.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.880
That was a line from Psalms.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.510
But I also read
Psalms is the poetry

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.640
of King David, a young man
in the wilderness crying out

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.650
for help.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.390
And as I read that
book, I was like, this

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.657
is like my experience.

00:41:22.657 --> 00:41:23.990
I'm really resonating with this.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.520
So that really became a
spiritual path for me, as well.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.077
And it provided the vocabulary
for the things that I

00:41:30.077 --> 00:41:31.660
was feeling, and a
sense of belonging,

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.280
and a sense of identity.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.090
And at a certain
point, my mother said,

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:36.910
you're basically going
to be subscribing

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.055
to a rule based
patriarchal religion.

00:41:39.055 --> 00:41:40.090
And I thought about it.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:42.650
I was like, well, I had
no rules and no father,

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.110
so that sounds about right.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:49.210
So that was that part
of my path began there.

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.870
AUDIENCE: I have read the first
two chapters of your book.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:53.340
You're an amazing writer.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:53.940
JOSHUA SAFRAN: Thank you.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.440
Thank you.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.150
AUDIENCE: So do you have other
plan to write more books?

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.040
JOSHUA SAFRAN: Yeah, I do.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.570
I am working on a book proposal
for the sequel right now.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:04.790
So you'll see when you get
to the end of the book,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.730
it ends at 12 with us
running into this commune

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.010
by the Canadian border
in a school bus.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:15.840
And so it connects that kid
to being arrested a few times

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.910
and being unsure
whether I was going

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.650
to make it out to making it out.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:21.580
And thank you.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.750
I appreciate that.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.900
AUDIENCE: You talk a little bit
about why you became a lawyer,

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.440
and it seems very disconnected
with what you ended up

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.100
doing as your primary source
of income as a lawyer.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:38.410
I am also a corporate lawyer, so
take that with a grain of salt.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:41.820
But how did you become
a corporate lawyer?

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:46.100
And were you ever able to
find more fulfillment in that

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.470
than the Fortune 500
battle of 20 million?

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:54.922
JOSHUA SAFRAN: Yeah, so
I had twin aspirations

00:42:54.922 --> 00:42:55.880
in going to law school.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.510
Part of it was I
still to this day

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.862
am actually offended
by lawyer jokes,

00:42:59.862 --> 00:43:02.070
because I still at least
have a perception in my mind

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.620
most lawyers are these guardians
of justice doing great work.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.090
How can you make that joke?

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.620
And I'm sad that that's
probably not true.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.484
So I did have this sense,
both in my own personal life

00:43:12.484 --> 00:43:14.150
as far as criminal
defense attorneys who

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.250
played an important role in my
life to keeping me out of jail,

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:18.280
for example.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.810
I had a great
respect for lawyers,

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.240
and I really saw them as
these uniquely capable people,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.040
because they had the
monopoly of knowledge

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.940
on how to navigate
the system, and yet

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.130
were down dealing with
people like us who

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.440
are outside of that system.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.370
So they were these
warriors, really.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:35.740
So that was on the one side.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.640
And the other side
is when you grow up

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.750
with no running water,
electricity, and everything

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:43.646
else, or sugar, or television,
that's all you want.

00:43:43.646 --> 00:43:45.520
You can guarantee that
your child will rebel.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.980
So for me, as I
was looking around,

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.960
I was like, OK, who
are successful people?

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.850
And I had this lawyer thing,
and oh, yeah, lawyers do well.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:55.640
Lawyers can-- that's a big deal.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.310
That's a respectable thing.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.394
So that was my motivation.

00:43:58.394 --> 00:43:59.810
And then when I
got to law school,

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.500
I had this amazing awful moment,
which you may have experienced.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.875
Or you may have
experienced where

00:44:03.875 --> 00:44:06.710
you're like, I'm going to do
justice, and you're like, wow,

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.270
you have to live in a
trailer and eat canned beans

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.840
to do the nonprofit work.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.540
But these people will
pay you over six figures

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.100
to just do whatever.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.620
That's awesome.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.440
And for me I was truly excited
about that opportunity.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.070
And to be totally
clear, I loved it.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.300
I mean, I still to this day take
10 minute showers, and I mean,

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.717
I just love having everything.

00:44:30.717 --> 00:44:33.050
I gained a ton of weight,
because I could eat doughnuts,

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.230
and it was great.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:38.860
See, I blame everything
on my childhood.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.270
But no, so I mean, I was
enjoying all of that.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.680
And I loved all that that
got me, but at the same time

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.050
I think the hours expectations
in these big corporate firms

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.390
are such that they don't
want you to do anything

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.700
but be a corporate lawyer.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.200
And so I think that
was really the--

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.750
I still have great
respect for people

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.060
who can integrate pro bono work
into their corporate practice.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.250
I mean, it's righteous.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.209
For me, I ended up--
sadly when people

00:45:01.209 --> 00:45:03.500
say this movie must have been
so great for your career.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.230
I'm like, it destroyed
my partnership prospects,

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.580
and I got fired.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.240
But that's what happened.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.906
I was at the firm, I
was up for partner,

00:45:10.906 --> 00:45:13.270
and they said, look dude,
you do way too much pro bono.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.664
You need to be
kicking up your hours.

00:45:15.664 --> 00:45:17.580
And it's great you're
representing this woman,

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.371
but enough already.

00:45:18.371 --> 00:45:20.370
It's been eight years.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:24.131
So at that point, I left and
still was working on her case

00:45:24.131 --> 00:45:24.630
actually.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.845
And then I was lucky enough that
my current day job-- the Port

00:45:27.845 --> 00:45:29.970
of Oakland called, and I
had been representing them

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.880
as outside counsel.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.270
And they said, come in-house.

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:33.575
And I was, well, I'll
need all these days off

00:45:33.575 --> 00:45:34.533
for my parole hearings.

00:45:34.533 --> 00:45:36.660
And they're like, what
are you talking about?

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.390
You're like the
aviation, land use,

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.050
all of these areas of
expertise I had cultivated.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:43.320
And I explained it
to the person who

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.480
was I thought about
not to give me a job.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.617
And much credit to my boss who
then said, that sounds really

00:45:50.617 --> 00:45:52.450
righteous, this case
that you're working on.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.420
I'll make a deal with you.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.461
And I was like, OK, what's
this deal going to be?

00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:58.120
He's like, when you get her
out, you bring her up here,

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.411
and we'll have a lunch for her.

00:46:00.411 --> 00:46:01.750
And I was like, all right.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.690
Good deal.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:07.534
I'm a government lawyer,
so it has worked out.

00:46:07.534 --> 00:46:08.950
Well the one other
thing that I'll

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:12.960
say just because I know that
maybe my mother-- this very

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.110
interesting character but also
a very interesting person-- we

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:18.730
grew up together.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:20.920
When I went to college,
my mother went to college.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.610
When I got a job, she got a job.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.930
I had years of
resentment and anger

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.080
to her for what I
began to perceive

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.430
as the unnecessary deprivation
that we had to go through.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:35.730
In a way, I could almost forgive
her for the domestic violence

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.990
years, because I understood
the dynamic of how

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.950
we'd gotten in there
and how we got out.

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.574
But all the other
stuff, the deprivation.

00:46:42.574 --> 00:46:43.990
And then I got to
college, and I'm

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.100
meeting all these kids who grew
up in cul-de-sacs and suburbs,

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.720
eating sugar, watching
television, having hot showers,

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.120
all the rest of it,
and I get to college,

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.625
and they're like this sucks.

00:46:53.625 --> 00:46:54.890
I don't want to be here.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.680
This is lame, and my
mother never loved me,

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.344
and my father likes
my brother more.

00:46:59.344 --> 00:47:01.760
And they never had any domestic
violence or anything else,

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.370
but they were
totally bummed out.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:05.230
And I'm in college
thinking, this

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.500
is the greatest
experience of my life.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.161
I can just go to
the dining hall,

00:47:09.161 --> 00:47:10.910
and there's just as
much food as you want.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:12.300
It's like Google.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.780
You can take these showers.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:14.997
You watch television.

00:47:14.997 --> 00:47:15.830
You can do anything.

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.204
I was just like,
this is amazing.

00:47:17.204 --> 00:47:17.896
I was loving it.

00:47:17.896 --> 00:47:19.270
And so part of me
was like, well,

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.200
there's different ways
of judging a parent,

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.330
but I always felt like
my mother loved me.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.430
I always felt like
she was like, you

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.620
can do anything you want to do.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.090
You can be anyone
you want to be.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.970
She may not have supervised me.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:32.350
But she loved me.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.070
And so I began to
recalibrate my own feelings

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:36.630
toward my mother at that point.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:41.350
And she, around that
time, said, I turned on,

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:44.950
tuned in, dropped out, but
I'm finally crawling back.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.510
And that was her
sense, that she was

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.970
going to rejoin-- she was
going to wave the white flag.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.370
The revolution was
not coming tomorrow,

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.730
and she was going to
rejoin American society.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.230
Now that said, when the whole
Occupy Movement was happening,

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.480
my mother was like,
oh, this could be it.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.770
Get ready.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:04.500
So she's still looking
forward to the revolution,

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.580
but she also has a mortgage.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.030
So it's been an
interesting relationship.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.320
And my wife and I, we
actually trust her.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.350
She comes and babysits.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.154
We have three daughters.

00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:17.320
But it's like, we come back.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.952
It's 10:00 at night.

00:48:18.952 --> 00:48:20.410
All the lights in
the house are on.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:21.782
None of the girls are in bed.

00:48:21.782 --> 00:48:22.740
One of them is missing.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.455
One's watching something
on the computer.

00:48:24.455 --> 00:48:25.460
Who knows what?

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.830
And she's playing the
maracas with the youngest.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:33.370
So she's still pretty spirited,
but has really come a long way.

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.840
And we still have a
very close relationship.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.770
Yeah, so I mean, I think one
of the things that surprised me

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:43.250
when I began part
of my strange arc.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.100
We all have our weird arcs,
but my weird arc was the thing

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.680
that you're most
ashamed of is going

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.470
to be your defining
characteristic, which

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.847
is-- if you think about what
that is in your life, that's

00:48:51.847 --> 00:48:53.430
a really weird thing
to have happened.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.670
So it happened to me.

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.670
I didn't want to ever
talk about this issue that

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.540
had happened to me.

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.320
And there was just
this thirst to have

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.590
me come speak
about these issues.

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:06.130
And a big part of that has
been the fact that I'm a man,

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.170
and I didn't realize
this until I got into it.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.170
But the perception out there
is that domestic violence

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.150
is a women's issue.

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:14.020
It's women get in
these relationships,

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.100
and women get battered, and
women do leave or don't leave,

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.830
and whatever.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.590
But there's this whole missing
equation of for every victim,

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.270
there's a perpetrator.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.750
And this identity of, wait a
second, why isn't it a man's

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:27.250
issue?

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:29.249
So a lot of the work that
I've been trying to do

00:49:29.249 --> 00:49:32.000
is to talk about--
especially with young guys--

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.620
what it means to
be a man, and what

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.930
it means to stand up for someone
who's weaker than you are,

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.040
and not to bully them.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.770
And I think that one of the
strange realizations that I've

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.090
had-- that the science
shows, of course--

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.720
is that the
perpetrators, the men who

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.520
are in these abusive
relationships, the batterers

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.510
were themselves victims, or
at least children in homes

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:54.645
where this was happening.

00:49:54.645 --> 00:49:56.020
So there's this
strange arc where

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.064
these boys, like me, who you
can be very sympathetic to,

00:49:59.064 --> 00:50:00.730
and say, OK, well,
it's not their fault.

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:01.396
They're a child.

00:50:01.396 --> 00:50:02.320
It's not their fault.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.300
They're a child.

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.200
Now it's their fault.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.390
They're now 17 and in an
abusive relationship themselves.

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:10.865
And the way that the human
mind works with these boys who

00:50:10.865 --> 00:50:13.690
are seeing what
happens, part of what's

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.350
going on in their head is
they're thinking, well,

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.870
what's wrong in this
equation is not necessarily

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.500
that he's beating
my mother or running

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.570
the house like a tyrant.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.490
What's wrong is that
I'm not the alpha.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:27.490
I'm not the king, but
someday I will be.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:30.670
And then it will be OK,
because I'll be in control.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:33.110
And it's about breaking
that whole cycle,

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.190
and it really is this
a generational notion.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.856
And the last thing I
will say about that

00:50:36.856 --> 00:50:41.045
is if you think the statistics
are that somewhere between one

00:50:41.045 --> 00:50:43.170
in four and one in three
women will experience this

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:46.460
in their lifetimes, which means
roughly the same number of men

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.820
will be involved.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.420
And if you think
about it hard enough,

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.920
you can probably think either
an experience that you've had,

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.900
obviously, but a neighbor,
a friend, a colleague who

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.480
you suspect, oh, yeah, this may
be happening in their lives.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.890
I think the greatest
mistake is to be like, well,

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:01.890
that's a private matter.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.120
I'm not going to pry.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.000
I think we all have a
sense of how far you

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.889
can pry before you're committing
a crime, some kind of stalking

00:51:08.889 --> 00:51:09.430
or something.

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:10.340
I don't want you to do that.

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.620
But at the same time, that you
really do need to speak up.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.870
You do need to get involved,
and you will be surprised

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:18.132
that when you do, people, I
think, will react in such a way

00:51:18.132 --> 00:51:20.540
that you're really glad
and happy that you did.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.130
And when you
intervene, it does help

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:24.511
to break that cycle of violence.

00:51:24.511 --> 00:51:25.010
Thank you.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.640
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much, Joshua.
