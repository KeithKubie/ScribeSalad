RICH FILCHER: Good morning.

00:00:01.414 --> 00:00:03.250
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.250
RICH FILCHER: Thank you.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.300
Welcome to Learn
to speak Designer.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.480
My name is Rich Fulcher, I am a
design manager on the material

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.655
design systems team.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.280
ROB GIAMPIETRO: And
I'm Rob Giampietro.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.560
I'm a visual designer on
the material design team.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.050
RICH FILCHER: Thanks
for coming this morning.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.610
When you talk to
designers, it may often

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.900
feel like they're speaking a
completely different language.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.970
And even when you can kind
of follow along in context,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.590
and get some of the
meaning, the precise kind

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.900
of vocabulary that
they use may elude you.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.810
So we're here today to help kind
of translate some of the things

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.886
designers say.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.510
And to do that, we're
going to give you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.420
a little bit of a view
of the design process.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.250
And how several different
forms of designers

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.850
approach their work.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.630
So the language of
design is wide ranging.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.460
There are terms that
literally go back

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.520
centuries in their usage.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.190
And there are newer formulations
from this modern digital age.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.750
And there are things that
are just outright slang.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.830
Both Rob and I are part
of the material UX team.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.000
So much of our work involves
building and evolving

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.700
the material design system that
was first revealed up there

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.760
two years ago.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.580
But more broadly, our
mission is to empower

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.420
designers and developers
to do their best work.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.900
And that's why we have tools
like the material design

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.786
guidelines themselves, other
tools like the icon library,

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:33.160
and even discussions
like the one

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.686
we're having today all
try to pursue that goal.

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:38.310
ROB GIAMPIETRO: So
it's natural to ask,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.310
why is learning design
terms important?

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.460
And there's a lot
more collaboration

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.800
happening between
designers, engineers,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.944
developers in team
based environments.

00:01:47.944 --> 00:01:50.110
So it's important to have
a shared vocabulary there.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.470
And there's also more
individual engineers

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200
that are wearing designer hats.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.370
And so being able to
think like a designer

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.470
is really useful in order to
toggle between those roles.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.440
And yet designers
and developers often

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.101
come from different backgrounds.

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:05.600
They have different education,
they have different training,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000
they have different
jobs, and even workflows.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.949
Our goals with this
talk is to just

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.290
have simpler, better
understanding between designers

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.880
and developers, and
improve collaboration.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.260
So to start, we want to sort of
dive into the design process.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.650
And that means by learning
about this process,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.544
we can have a little bit more
context for what's to come.

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:27.960
And a little bit
later in the talk

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.310
we'll look at some more
technological terms

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.050
and advanced concepts
and principles.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.410
So much of the design process
is a little bit invisible

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.660
when you see the final output.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.290
When you see this
brand launched--

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.930
this is an example from our
own practice, the logo for GV,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.870
or Google Ventures--
you don't have

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.460
a lot of context about
what went into making this.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.730
Few people see all the
different variations.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.920
Iteration after iteration.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.010
And there are lots of dead
ends and false starts.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.814
And files that are
saved over and over.

00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:06.850
You may know final,
and final final.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.090
The design process often expands
to the time that you have

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.690
and the resources
that are available.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.975
So it's very scaled and
it's never really done.

00:03:15.975 --> 00:03:17.350
So that's what
the design process

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.710
looks like from an asset
point of view, for the logo.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.110
But let's take
another look at how

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.350
it looks if we visualize it.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.580
If we visualize the process,
the final grooming of the logo

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.270
might start to get
linear, and really

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.616
drive towards a conclusion.

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:35.150
But if we go back
in time, we might

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.610
see some more twists and
turns and waves along the way.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.150
And ultimately we kind of
realized that, well, design

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.070
is really not a linear process.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.241
You might even think we have
no idea what we're doing.

00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:48.740
RICH FILCHER:
Fortunately, designers

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.960
do have a term for this
hairball of confusion

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.376
that's happening over
here, and that's ideation.

00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:56.750
You might think
of this as really

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.110
similar to brainstorming.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.710
You're trying to generate
as many ideas as possible

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.750
and the emphasis is
quantity not quality.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.960
But I think what happens
is people here brainstorm,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.402
and they think of something
that's a lot more contained.

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:10.860
They think, OK we're going to
go in a room for a half hour,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.100
we're going to brainstorm
and we're going to be done.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.350
But for designers, this process
happens over a much longer time

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.769
scale.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.079
You're not just kind of putting
a thought onto a sticky note

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.029
and being done.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.220
You're taking that idea and
you're starting to express it.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.460
You're starting to sketch it.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.740
Maybe do one sketch,
or multiple sketches.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.011
You might do a study.

00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:31.760
And you're just trying
to explore the idea

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.926
in a little bit more detail.

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:34.600
See if there's
something useful there.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.670
Make sure that there
isn't something.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.370
And generate new ideas.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.040
Kick you off into new directions
and kind of keep exploring.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.130
And as these ideas
develop, they're

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.600
going to take different forms.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.950
Early on they might
be diagrams, trying

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.540
to capture how the different
parts of the system

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.510
relate to each other.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.360
Or how different roles
within the system

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.190
might collaborate to
achieve a bigger goal.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.220
And they might eventually
take the form of wire frames.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.720
Starting to explore what
individual screens might look

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.020
like.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.040
And note, the sketchiness
of wire frames at this level

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.750
is a feature, not a bug.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.660
You're trying to focus on just
the most important elements.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.360
It's OK to be kind of hand-wavy
about secondary things

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.600
on this screen.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.160
And this is why
designers sometimes

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.200
gravitate toward tools,
like whiteboarding or using

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.290
big chunky markers to draw.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.580
By selecting a tool like
that-- that gives them

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.290
limited fidelity--
they're actually

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.030
kind of keeping that level of
unspecificity, which is desired

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.220
at this point in the process.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.870
Now eventually you
do get into kind

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.000
of higher and higher
fidelity versions of this.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.960
Especially as you gain
confidence in the idea

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.230
and you want to really
make sure it's working,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.860
and really connect
everything together.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.240
Now this isn't strictly
linear, even though we

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.610
did the line at the end.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.440
There's plenty of
room for revisiting

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.470
what's gone before, of going
back and ideating one more

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.030
time.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.660
And as a developer, you may
not see all of this work.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.890
You may just see some of the
tangible outputs of this.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.960
Things that we call artifacts,
we should define that one.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.460
Artifacts are just
design documents.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.940
It's a fancy way of saying it.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.180
It's maybe a little
philosophical,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.750
but it's important to note that
these aren't the design itself.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.950
These are the things
that are created

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.100
as a byproduct of
the design process.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.640
This is how designers try
to capture the thinking

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.290
that they're doing,
and putting it

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.080
into a tangible, shareable form.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.470
And no one artifact
captures everything.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.684
They're together.

00:06:41.684 --> 00:06:43.350
You can put a lot of
different artifacts

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.850
together and hopefully get
to a more and more complete

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.514
embodiment, or
specification, of the design.

00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:52.430
So just as there are
many styles of artifacts,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.982
there are many
styles of designer.

00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:55.440
We're going to look
at a few today.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.898
We're going to
focus on interaction

00:06:56.898 --> 00:07:00.690
design, visual design
and motion design.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.690
I'll start with interaction
design, that happens

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.560
to be my specialization.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.500
I still think back
to my first day

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.540
of my first class
about [INAUDIBLE] years

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.430
ago, when I started
learning about design.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.070
And back then, it
wasn't even UX,

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.881
it was called Human
Computer Interaction, HCI.

00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:21.820
But fortunately I'm
not quite old enough

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.810
that was called Man
Machine Interaction, which

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.860
is what happened before.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.630
In that first class, the
core definition of design

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.700
boiled down to just five words.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.620
Users.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.710
Context.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.370
Tools.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.460
Tasks.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.210
And goals.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.710
What we do in
experience design, is

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.870
that we study users who
have a certain context.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.540
We create tools for them
to perform tasks in order

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.790
to achieve higher level goals.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.110
Users.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.950
Context.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.830
Tools.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.510
Tasks.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.306
Goals.

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:01.430
And speaking of things you
learn on your first day,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.580
there is this artifact that
every new employee at Google

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.050
gets to read on their first day.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.560
It's called "The 10 Things
We Believe To Be True",

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.070
and this is Google's
way of trying

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.080
to capture some of their culture
of what makes something Googly.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.090
And number one on that
list is focus on the users,

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.710
and all else will follow.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.020
Now when we focus
on the users, we

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.190
work closely, as designers, with
user experience researchers,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.490
or user researchers.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.360
They help us to understand
the users, who are they, what

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.640
are they like, their context.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.390
And that's kind of broadly
their technical, physical,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.429
interpersonal
environment that might

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.860
inform the way that they act.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.950
And of course their goals.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.424
Why are they doing the things
that they're doing here?

00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:50.840
What is the kind
of bigger purpose

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.060
they're trying to achieve?

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.820
Now our research colleagues
have just as big a vocabulary.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.000
And we can't possibly do service
to all of that in this talk

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.070
today.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.080
But if you really wanted, clamor
for a sequel in your space

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.120
or in the YouTube comments.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.350
So coming back to design,
interaction design

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.190
focuses on the
tools and the tasks.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.790
We're building the tools to
help accomplish the tasks.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.640
So as an example, I'm going to
take one of our newest tools

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.132
to walk through how the
design process worked.

00:09:23.132 --> 00:09:25.340
There's another kind of
Google statement, our mission

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.620
statement, that I think most
people are quite familiar with.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.210
"To organize the
world's information

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.736
and make it universally
accessible and useful."

00:09:32.736 --> 00:09:34.610
I think a lot of times
when people read this,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.220
they focus on those
first five words.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.595
Oh, organize all the world's
information and kind of stop

00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:39.470
there.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.560
But making things
"universally accessible",

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.490
taking it and kind of
bringing it to all the users

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.680
is a very important
responsibility

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.210
for the designers in particular.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.280
To that end, we've
recently introduced a tool

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.790
for Android called,
Accessibility Scanner.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.070
You may have already used this.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.150
The goal of this
tool, or the types

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.650
of things we wanted
to support were,

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.130
we wanted to make
it easier for a team

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.120
to evaluate how their
app was performing

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.580
with regard to accessibility.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.300
It could flag some
common issues.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.780
A touch target that's too small.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.840
A case where text contrast,
relative to its background,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.280
was too low and a
bit hard to read.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.050
Or images that would be lacking
content descriptions for people

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.990
that are relying on screen
reading technologies.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.610
The goals of the project
when the designer started

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.025
work on this were
they wanted to do

00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:28.400
something that
would fit smoothly

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.800
into the user's workflow.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.300
You want to make it easy for
someone to use this tools,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.930
so that it doesn't
feel like a burden

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.840
to their existing process.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.010
You want it to reinforce
the types of guidance--

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.590
we already gave them the
material design guidelines.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.020
And we want to educate users
about why these issues are

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.110
actually important.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.370
So where does a designer get
started on an app like this?

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.300
Well in this case, she
started with the users.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.380
Who is this product for?

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.030
And user is a shorthand.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.250
It's not a single
user, there's not

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.160
some perfect hermetically
sealed individual we go to

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.230
and we can test.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.960
User is many, many
different types

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.670
of users with many
different characteristics.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.960
So this designer,
she goes and she

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.620
talks to some of those users.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.810
She talks to developers,
designers QA testers, product

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.810
managers.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.570
They may all have roles
to play in ensuring

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.700
that these apps get to
better and better levels

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.080
of accessibility.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.500
Now one way that she can
capture that information

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.910
is through something called,
The User Need Statement.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.060
This is just a way of
capturing the who, the what,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.360
and the why about a
user's relationship

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360
with this kind of
proposed design.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.980
So the who is actually
a name in these cases,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.120
that's surprisingly handy to
refer back to people later.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.080
The role they serve.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.980
The what is what do
they need to do, what is

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.255
their need in this situation?

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:48.130
And the why is why are
they doing that thing?

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.230
What are they valuing?

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.990
Why is this important for them?

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.010
When you have
these insights, you

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.470
can use them in a lot
of ways as a designer.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.190
Some of it's
subconscious, where you're

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.189
just kind of aware of
this work that you've done

00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:01.010
and it informs what
happens going forward.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.420
But you can also turn
it into tangible things,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.940
you can turn into
design principles.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.740
It can help you
prioritize the features

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.240
as you discuss with
the larger team what

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.330
this product is going to be.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.300
So once we have a
sense of the user,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.110
we can start to
structure the experience.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.070
The interface
designer sketches out

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.520
how the different functions
relate to each other.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.900
And again, this isn't just
one sketch, this is many,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.910
we're ideating through this.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.940
And you are trying
to understand how

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.430
all of these different users,
all of these different tasks

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.720
can interrelate.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.310
So the name for this
phase is traditionally

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.900
information architecture, or IA.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.380
And this name is
no accident, IA has

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.510
a lot in common with
traditional architecture.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.470
It is both an art and a science.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.520
It is creative and technical.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.340
Its focused on thinking
about spaces broadly,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.640
spaces like this space.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.340
How they're structured.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.480
What does a user do in
each of those spaces?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.270
How does the user move
between those spaces?

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.320
And it also takes advantage
of established principles,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.960
common patterns.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.880
So just like
software architecture

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.350
will define the
structure of a system,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:16.440
information architecture defines
the structure of an experience.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.000
So let's come back to
Accessibility Scanner.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.020
Even as we're refining the IA,
there's still more sketching

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.520
happening.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.610
There's more work being done.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.630
And you're starting to
get sketches that look

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.680
more and more like screens.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.590
So the designer, she's going
past the high level structure

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.310
of this, and indicating
how each room-- back

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.100
to the architecture-- will work.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.980
She's thinking about many
different users here.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.660
How does a first
time user enter?

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.290
What are some of the
high traffic areas

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.550
that all users are
going to go through?

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.560
For a frequent user,
how do they go back

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.430
and retrieve an older
archive report they

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.600
may have generated a while ago?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.450
Now over time these sketches
become more detailed.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.150
When you take one
particular designer, or one

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.080
particular user, and you
sketch out a sequence of steps

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.440
through the app-- In this
case, opening the app,

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.680
activating the checker,
going to the app they

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.430
want to run the checker on,
generating report, reviewing

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.220
a report.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.130
This specific presentation is
something we call a storyboard.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.070
And this practice isn't
unique to UX at all.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.360
This is long used as a
pre-visualization technique

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.560
for film and for
video production.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.000
The idea is you want to
get the sense, or the feel,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.970
of the experience
without actually

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:39.010
having to build it or pay for
it, and those types of things.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.940
So as you get to the
next level of detail,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.955
you start to focus on all of
the individual elements that

00:14:46.955 --> 00:14:47.580
shape the room.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.080
You're moving from
architecture to interior design

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.920
at this point.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.150
So the designer has
to be very specific

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.060
about the individual
controls that will appear.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.820
And which buttons, which icons,
what options are in the menu.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.400
And collectively we call all
of these different things

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.460
affordances.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.810
You want to be able to
readily perceive how something

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.719
works just by looking at it.

00:15:11.719 --> 00:15:14.260
And in the physical world, we
see plenty of examples of this.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.690
You're all sitting conveniently
on these affordances, called

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.130
chairs.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:17.930
You walk up to a chair.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.555
You look at it.

00:15:18.555 --> 00:15:21.330
You're like, I know what to do
with that, my butt goes there.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.660
That's a chair.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.060
Door handles are the same way.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.740
You look at it, OK
it opens, it closes.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.390
Buttons on the interface,
whether I'm going to click it,

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.980
or whether I'm
going to touch it.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.938
There should be something
about the object that

00:15:32.938 --> 00:15:36.480
indicates to any user how
it's meant to be used.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.350
Now affordance
isn't a guarantee.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.720
We've all walked up
to a door and pushed

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.292
when we should have pulled.

00:15:42.292 --> 00:15:43.750
But it should at
least be a signal,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.510
that idea of kind of perceived
interact ability of that object

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.950
is really important.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.760
So we're going to
shift our emphasis now

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.462
from interaction to visual.

00:15:53.462 --> 00:15:55.670
We're going to talk about
how the brand identity, how

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.410
the stylistic distinction
can develop and further

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.340
support that interaction.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.930
And further guide users.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.530
And of course as I pass the
mic, or the clicker here,

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.220
the process is actually a
lot more fluid and a lot more

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.160
interconnected than that.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.680
There's lots of
parallel thinking,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.390
lots of back and forth.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.890
And there are in
fact many designers

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.014
that are kind of comfortable
in both of these camps

00:16:18.014 --> 00:16:21.230
and can move very
fluidly between them.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.370
You never really just
stop thinking about one

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.650
and move to the other.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.540
ROB GIAMPIETRO: So thanks, Rich.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.770
So while Rich specializes
in interaction design,

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.478
my focus on the team
is a little bit more

00:16:32.478 --> 00:16:33.814
on the visual design side.

00:16:33.814 --> 00:16:35.730
And there are some
fundamentals and principles

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.600
that you can master
to better understand

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.930
this aspect of the
design process.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.740
Today we're going
to cover layout,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.550
art direction, and typography.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.390
And being more aware
of these steps,

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.260
will help you better communicate
with designers on your team.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.400
And maybe even think more
like a designer yourself.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.055
So with visual design,
there's not just one way

00:16:55.055 --> 00:16:55.680
to approach it.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.030
There's many methods,
there's many styles.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.580
And it really needs
to fit closely

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.990
to the content and
the problem at hand.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.770
There are now more than
a million material apps

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.720
in the Play Store, which
is an amazing number.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.040
Lots of variation
and richness there.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.010
And that's because
material is designed

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.260
to be a flexible system.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.770
And this richness
is created in part

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.050
by the application of a brand
to the interactive elements

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.160
that Rich described earlier.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.569
So we'll touch on
some of this today,

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.630
but there's also an article on
Google Design, our design blog,

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.300
called "Expressing
Brand in Material",

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.270
that also touches on
some of these things.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.236
And Google Design, in
general, is a great place

00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:35.110
to go if you're thinking
about going material

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.026
or if you just want to
learn a little bit more

00:17:37.026 --> 00:17:39.260
about how to think
like a designer.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.060
So one way we would
design material

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.770
to be flexible for
brands is that we

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.970
stress test it using fictional
brands in different contexts.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.290
And these are three of
our fictional brands.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.510
One is called Shrine,
and it's a shopping app.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.390
Another is called
The Fortnightly,

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.670
and it's a news app.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.990
And the third is called Pesto,
and it's a cooking and recipe

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.440
ideas app.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.460
So you can see already
on their logos,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.680
how visual design communicates
the nature of these apps.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.150
And we'll dive a little bit
more into Shrine to start.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.640
And talk a little bit
about layout hierarchy

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.420
and art direction.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.480
So any time you've got
an array of products,

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.740
it's helpful to have a
system to organize them.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.500
And that is where it's
useful to meet the grid.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.230
Grids might seem basic,
but they're actually

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.000
a foundational principle of
design with a rich history that

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.820
goes way back to some of the
most iconic and beautiful works

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.150
of modern design, more
than a century ago.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.920
Users know grids,
they understand grids,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.770
and grids allow them
greater speed and confidence

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.860
in browsing.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.180
And they allow designers
greater speed and confidence

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.210
in designing.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.120
So they're a really important
part of material design.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.810
You shouldn't dismiss the
terms you think you know.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.120
Let's dive in and
define grid a bit.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.080
It's really the tool that helps
you solve a visual problem,

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.700
and organize information.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.810
And as the definition
says, grids

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.250
communicate order,
economy, and consistency.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.930
And they provide a common
structure and some flexibility

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.700
to support different templates
and organize content.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.890
Grid systems include things like
margins, shown here in green.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.370
And margins are both
functional and aesthetic.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.770
They enhance the pleasure of
reading a page on the screen.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.012
They also provide an area
of safety for the content

00:19:26.012 --> 00:19:26.720
and the elements.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.400
So if you have a book and
the margins are too small,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.290
your thumbs might
obscure the text.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.020
If you have a screen
and the margins

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.800
are too small you might be
pushing interactive elements

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.040
out to the edges where
users can't easily

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.620
touch them and use them.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.050
Gutters are another
part of any grid system.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.830
And they're similar to margins,
but they denote the space

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.850
between the columns, instead
of outside the content area.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.490
The gutter, the
margins, and the grid,

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:58.540
help define how images and
text will align, or layout,

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.270
on the page.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.880
This is where we
get the term layout.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.380
And in Shrine's case, the
layout is clean, it's orderly,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.900
and it keeps with the sort of
polished look of this brand.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.040
The grid is not just
implied, in this case,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.740
it's emphasized with cards.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.750
And again, this
really helps Shrine

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:22.330
feel locked up, put together,
kind of buttoned up, clean--

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.440
It retains that clean look at
every resolution from phone

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.780
to tablet, regardless
of the number of items.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.600
So if you have a really
well-designed grid,

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.222
you can actually do this.

00:20:32.222 --> 00:20:34.660
This grid scales responsively.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.510
And in order to do this, we have
paid really careful attention

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.940
to the breakpoints, and also
the image aspect ratios.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.510
Hold on, what's an aspect ratio?

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.330
Let's define it.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.150
An image or graphic
has an aspect ratio

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.570
of 2:1, that means its width
is twice as long as its height.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.560
So this is what we
mean by aspect ratio.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.100
And we can see how as the
aspect ratios shift in Shrine,

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.990
some of the images get more or
less white space around them.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.930
Let's define white space
too, because that's

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.540
another one of those terms
that's easy to gloss over.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.960
It's deceptively simple.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.880
It's not blank space, it's
actually an important design

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.000
element.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.842
It helps to balance
between the positive

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:17.800
and the negative space.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.870
And really help a user move
through, or navigate around

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.750
all those elements with ease.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.662
And when the products in
Shrine have enough white space,

00:21:25.662 --> 00:21:28.120
it helps them feel uncluttered
and it really elevates them,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.680
and makes them feel special.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.940
And makes people want
to take a closer look.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.000
This is because white space
is playing the right role

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.520
within the hierarchy
of the layout.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.730
So when I talked earlier
about margins in gutters.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.230
Margins might be
bigger than gutters

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.810
because of the hierarchy
between those different spatial

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:48.830
elements.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.470
Hierarchy is a designer's
word for priority level.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.690
It includes text.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:54.970
It includes images.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.720
It even includes white space.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.790
And it basically helps us
to say, what's important?

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.160
What should someone see first?

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.180
What should someone see last?

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.460
And it ties back to
that user experience,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.260
that you want the user to have
all the way in the beginning

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.450
of the design process.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.790
So here are two layouts.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.840
And on the right, we've
tweaked the hierarchy

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.270
just a little bit.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.050
The headlines a little
bit more prominent,

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.040
a little bit more
design forward.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.950
The logo's not getting lost,
we know which app we're using.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.700
The product descriptions are
a little bit more present.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.320
And the price and everything
is a little bit easier to read.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.340
So things have gone from
feeling sort of bland,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.710
and even, and all the same size
to maybe a bit more considered,

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.520
like this app has
a point of view.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.670
And more engaging.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.530
When we were working on Shrine,
we often used the re-sizer.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.230
And this is a tool that helps
us to visualize and test

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.900
how this app, and many apps
respond to various break

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.630
points.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.440
On desktop, and on
mobile, and on tablet.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.360
And it's a great tool.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.944
We've shared it with everyone.

00:22:52.944 --> 00:22:54.610
So you can go ahead
and try it yourself,

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:59.285
on your apps, or your
websites at design.google.com.

00:22:59.285 --> 00:23:02.330
Let's shift now from
layout into art direction.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.510
So now we're talking about
the images, the illustrations,

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.270
or in this case, the photos, and
why they come to look that way.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.240
So let's look at the images
on screen from Shrine.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.870
They're shot in a studio,
they're silhouetted,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.640
you can see the
outlines of the shapes.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.050
They're not on models.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.010
They're not candid snapshots.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.070
And the shoes are styled to
be a little bit playful, even

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.520
kind of humorous.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.240
Each one of these things reveals
a decision that someone made,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.650
and that person is
called an art director.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.010
At Google we use art
direction all the time,

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.060
even in some places that
you wouldn't expect.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.190
These are actually photographs,
these iconic images

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.760
from material design
as our backgrounds.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.430
And there's a great article
on design.google.com

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.840
about how we did these Android
wallpapers, written by Rachel

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.170
Been, one of our art directors.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.711
And she walks you
through the process

00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:54.350
of collaborating with
photographer Carl Kleiner,

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:59.460
to commission these paperscapes
and how they came to be.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.440
So because art directors are
constantly giving feedback

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.520
to their team, and
to photographers,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.840
and other
collaborators, you might

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.517
say that they have their own
set of phrases and terminology.

00:24:09.517 --> 00:24:11.350
And they're a little
bit more just gestural.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.870
Make it bigger, zhoosh it up!

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.090
So these are some of the
terms you might hear art

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.730
directors using on the team.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.320
So we talked a
little about Shrine,

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.510
now let's shift our focus to
the news app, The Fortnightly,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.186
to talk a little bit
about typography.

00:24:25.186 --> 00:24:29.470
So typographers both
use type in a layout,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.310
and make typefaces for use.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.250
So there's a really
broad skill set, even

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.970
under the term typography.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.810
But whenever I look at a
typeface, I like to ask myself

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.930
three simple questions, sort
of going back to Rich's basics.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.890
What is a typeface is history?

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.170
How can I describe its forms?

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.800
And what is it used for?

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.460
So the history, the
forms, and the use.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.720
And this really helps you
kind of x-ray a typeface

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.900
and understand it more quickly.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.240
So let's start with forms.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.294
If you really want to
speak fluent designer,

00:24:59.294 --> 00:25:01.960
you definitely don't want to mix
up the difference between serif

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.640
and sans serif.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.350
The sans part is
easy, that's just

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.230
the French word for without.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.120
But serifs are
the little strokes

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.517
on the end of the letter.

00:25:11.517 --> 00:25:13.350
And they help make the
letters come together

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.520
into a word shape that
makes them more readable,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.380
and a little bit
easier on the eye.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.090
Sometimes typefaces
with the same name,

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.240
have slab or serif variations.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.200
And so in this case, we have
Roboto Sans and Roboto Slab.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.500
And the slab is just the type
of the serif in this case.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.320
It's not tapered, it has
blunt rectangular ends,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.850
which are called terminals.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.890
So serifs are an aspect
of typeface's form,

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.070
but serif typefaces also
vary along other aspects

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.730
that I mentioned earlier,
their history and their use.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.190
And different faces have
different visual impact.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.440
So here we've made a
grid of four faces,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.489
to have as a comparison.

00:25:52.489 --> 00:25:55.030
But I'm going to talk a little
bit about the lower right hand

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.907
corner, about Times New Roman.

00:25:57.907 --> 00:25:59.990
When you're picking a
typeface, it depends on how,

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.580
or where you're
going to be using it.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.955
If you're going
to be using it on

00:26:02.955 --> 00:26:04.870
print, on the screen, or both.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.240
And for The Fortnightly,
Times New Roman

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.630
is a great example, compared
to the other typefaces here.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.120
It has a great, rich
history of newspaper design.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.360
It was actually designed for
The Times of London in 1923.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.310
And therefore its
use was designed

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:24.480
to be used in situations like
low contrast newsprint, where

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.160
the ink and the paper-- it's
not a bright white paper,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.060
so you need a bolder typeface.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.360
And also that means
it translates really

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.600
well to screens, that are
coarser in their resolution.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:44.075
So its use in print has actually
extended its use on the screen.

00:26:44.075 --> 00:26:45.200
And it has another use too.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.360
It needs to get
lots of words in.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.800
So this means that the ascenders
and the descenders are short,

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.180
and the X height is high.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.550
So we can really set it
very closely together

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.841
and get lots of
words on the page.

00:26:56.841 --> 00:26:58.590
So I've used a bunch
of design terms here.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.160
I've talked about ascenders
like the K of quick,

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.160
I've talked about descenders
like the G of dog.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.270
And also about the X height.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.109
Let's zoom in to a few of these.

00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:11.650
I mentioned descenders
earlier, these

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.790
are letters that drop
below the baseline.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.280
Baselines are essential for
aligning text and images

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.860
across columns
pages, or websites.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.260
And well-designed baseline
grids help give a rhythm

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.940
and a sense of proportion,
and order to a design.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.740
The other two lines
you see on this slide

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.040
are the top line, where
the ascenders like the N L

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.580
hit and the mid line, and that
helps to define the X height.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.260
The X height is really just the
height of the lowercase letter

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.284
X. And it gives a
sense of proportion

00:27:44.284 --> 00:27:45.700
to the letter forms
of a typeface.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.502
So if I'm a really short person
and I wear a really long shirt,

00:27:48.502 --> 00:27:50.460
then that's going to make
my legs look shorter.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.890
You're viewing my entire body
in proportion to the elements

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:54.390
within it.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.780
A typeface is the same.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.782
So if it has a
very high X height

00:27:57.782 --> 00:28:00.510
and very short ascenders, that
will make the letter forms,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.450
the counter forms, the shapes
within the O's seem very big.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.020
And that can be very
helpful for readability.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.990
Leading measures the space
from baseline to baseline,

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.060
so between lines of text.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.070
And kerning measures the space
between the letters themselves.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.610
So if you have two sort
of irregular letter

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.647
forms like a capital
W and a lower case A,

00:28:21.647 --> 00:28:23.480
you might want to kern
them closer together,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.060
or scoot them closer together.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.780
Earlier I noted
that Times New Roman

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.900
was a really good
fit for Fortnightly,

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.900
and we see it here
in the headlines.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.732
And it really gives
it that newsy feel.

00:28:33.732 --> 00:28:35.440
But if we look a little
bit more closely,

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.290
there's actually another
typeface being used here too,

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.110
it's Roboto.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.890
And it looks great at all
sizes here below the headline.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.910
It could just as easily be
something like Helvetica,

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:47.720
or something else.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.410
You can use lots of
fonts in material design,

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.730
but using a contemporary
sans serif, like Roboto,

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.790
gives this historically
inflected design

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.950
a subtle and contemporary twist.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.570
So here we're using Roboto
in the deck and the body.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.350
And these are actually
editorial terms

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.467
that designers sometimes use.

00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:08.050
And they can refer
to multiple things.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.890
So they can refer
to the size, usually

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.390
the body is the smallest of the
head, the deck, and the body.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:17.360
They can refer to the hierarchy,
the body is usually read last.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.460
Or they can refer to
function, the deck

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.160
usually explains the headlines.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.700
So this is a situation
where those vocab

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.200
terms have multiple meanings.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.110
You might notice also
that the body copy

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.250
is in a different language.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.070
And it's intentional.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.910
Lorem ipsum is
placeholder copy or text,

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:40.090
and designers use it frequently
to see how a layout will look,

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.630
before the final
copy is in place.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.410
And lorem ipsum basically
says to everyone on the team,

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.160
don't read me, just look at me.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.330
It's the design of the
type, the typography here

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.220
that's important.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.062
So as you can see, visual design
is a really iterative process.

00:29:56.062 --> 00:29:58.020
If you think back to that
hairball of confusion

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.394
we talked about
at the beginning,

00:29:59.394 --> 00:30:01.950
you really have to go through
a lot of different things

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:02.890
and explore them.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.570
But there are a lot
of traditional terms

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.236
that we can fall back
on, and traditions

00:30:06.236 --> 00:30:08.560
that we can use to help
solve those problems.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.090
So there were lots
of timeless ideas

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.800
we use in material
design, but there

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.390
are new terms and techniques
coming all the time.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:18.439
And to talk about one
of them, here's Rich.

00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:19.480
RICH FILCHER: Thanks Rob.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.764
I want to close out with
talking about motion.

00:30:21.764 --> 00:30:23.930
Kind of the last of the
three big pillars of design.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.360
And we'll spend the least
amount of time on this.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.830
There is a great
other talk-- that

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.760
was last night--
from I/O this year,

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.600
you should try to
catch up on it later.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.970
Motion is where interaction
design and visual design

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:39.740
come together.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.950
This is where what
you're seeing and how

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.594
it behaves come
together in motion

00:30:43.594 --> 00:30:45.385
and kind of the animation
of the interface.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:50.920
We recently updated the
guidelines around motion

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.690
in the material design spec,
and the talk from last night

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.130
covers some of that.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.540
If you stay tuned to our
Twitter feed @GoogleDesign,

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.882
we'll let you know when that
YouTube video is available.

00:31:00.882 --> 00:31:02.340
So there's just
two concepts I want

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.965
to hit quickly when
it comes to motion.

00:31:03.965 --> 00:31:07.200
The first is
responsive interaction.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.880
How does an affordance
respond when

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.200
it's been triggered,
or touched, or tapped?

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.280
So in material, we try to
encourage the use of motion

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.410
to tell a little micro
story about what's happened.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.955
To answer that user
question of well,

00:31:20.955 --> 00:31:22.960
what happens when
I touch this thing?

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.250
And in this case,
the example here,

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.910
you're tapping on one of
two images in this grid.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.540
And a few things are happening.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.659
You're getting rid of
all the other images.

00:31:31.659 --> 00:31:33.950
But they're not just all
disappearing at the same time,

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.240
they're just kind of
washing away, directionally

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.820
emanating from the point
where the user touched.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.200
Now that's a story that
happens like in under a second,

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.140
it's a really short story.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.380
But it's also a way of
communicating to the user,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.422
OK, there is still
something important here.

00:31:50.422 --> 00:31:52.630
These things that are moving
away are less important.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.090
And maybe it's opening up
space to give more details

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.350
about that thing that
you've clicked on.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.600
We always want these types of
interactions to be thoughtful

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.110
and never distracting.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.840
Which leads to the
second concept,

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.220
which is that motion
should always feel natural.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.400
This is one of the big
things we emphasize

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.690
in the guidelines
for material design,

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.170
is that motion should
contribute to the feeling

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.490
that you're manipulating
pieces of paper.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.969
That you're kind of
physically dragging surfaces.

00:32:18.969 --> 00:32:20.760
And along those lines,
it means that things

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.400
should accelerate, and
decelerate, and change

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.830
direction in natural ways.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.400
When things don't
behave naturally

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.830
and you have an abrupt
stop, or an abrupt begin,

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.470
or a sudden change of
direction, the user notices it.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.807
It's distracting.

00:32:34.807 --> 00:32:36.640
And we wouldn't be doing
a service to motion

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.806
if we didn't give them at
least one vocabulary term,

00:32:38.806 --> 00:32:41.564
so we'll do the oft
used adjective, janky.

00:32:41.564 --> 00:32:44.540
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] This is
anything that's unnatural.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.680
This is motion that stands
out and gets its attention,

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.460
but not in a good way.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.180
It's when motion goes bad.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.810
As the Supreme Court would say,
you'll know it when you see it.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.870
Now motion is where
design becomes

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.130
most essentially code based.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.120
You will see very tight
overlap between designers

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.010
and developers here.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.840
And some of those designers
are very fluent and comfortable

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.390
on both sides of that.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.260
And it's this collaboration
between design and engineering

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.080
that brings this
experience to life.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.010
So we talked
process, we've talked

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.010
interaction visual
motion design.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.560
Let's pull it all together
in a quick example.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.420
We're going to do lightning
round design review,

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.680
showing three
stages of a product.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.180
And for this one we're going
to use Pesto, one of the brands

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.120
that Rob mentioned before.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.800
That's the cooking
app, where the goal

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.740
is to have this beautiful,
richly illustrated cookbook

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.030
style experience.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.000
All right Rob, take it.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.690
ROB GIAMPIETRO: OK, this
is an interesting start.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.880
It's pretty good, but I
feel like it's missing color

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.210
and the brand feels
a little bit weak.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.149
I also think that
grid is super dense.

00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:55.440
I mean this is a lot of
recipes, more than I could ever

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.260
cook in a week.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.080
And the pencil is
really important

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.630
there, let's bring that into
more of a primary action.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.479
RICH FILCHER: That sounds
good, so next version.

00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:06.020
Well we get a little
bit closer here.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.415
We're starting to bring the
identity more into play.

00:34:08.415 --> 00:34:09.790
You're starting
to see color take

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.710
its presence within the app.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.920
We pulled that Edit
icon out to put it

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.904
onto a floating
action button, so it's

00:34:15.904 --> 00:34:17.070
a little bit more prominent.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.429
I wish it saw a little bit
more color and felt connected,

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.554
I can't really tell if
that's enabled, or disabled.

00:34:21.554 --> 00:34:24.052
Or if it wants me
to click it, or not.

00:34:24.052 --> 00:34:25.510
And the grid's a
little bit closer,

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.090
but I'm not getting
it from the type.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.960
I feel the art direction
is a little soft here.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960
ROB GIAMPIETRO: Oh, wow!

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.550
This is really looking good now.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:38.090
We've got much better branding,
some really featured things.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.700
The typography is
all integrated,

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.840
we're using Futura everywhere.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.760
And that pencil button really
has a little bit of zing.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.659
I think now we're looking great.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.424
RICH FILCHER: So that was
obviously somewhat accelerated.

00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:52.840
But this is the
kind of engagement

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.618
the designers are
doing all day long.

00:34:54.618 --> 00:34:56.909
Whether they're having this
discussion with themselves,

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.050
whether they're
talking to a peer,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.258
they're doing it casually,
they're doing it formally,

00:35:00.258 --> 00:35:04.210
this process of review, of
critiquing, is core to the work

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.420
that designers do.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.277
OK, so we've given you
some foundational elements.

00:35:09.277 --> 00:35:10.610
We've given you some vocabulary.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.320
Hopefully you can
go out and you can

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.060
engage in more of these
design conversations.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.360
And maybe you'll also be aware
of the own coded language

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.110
that your discipline might bring
to bear, and just maybe help

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.660
define a little bit
of that for designers.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.930
If you're hungry for more--

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.263
ROB GIAMPIETRO: Yeah, please
start at Design.Google.com.

00:35:27.263 --> 00:35:29.920
We have the material
guidelines there, as well as

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.200
resources, tools,
articles, videos, and more.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.970
And you can follow us on
lots of social media as well.
