00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.583
In order to figure out how things
are moving in the image, okay.

00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:08.690
This is, this is how they
are moving in the world.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.408
In order to figure out how
they are moving in the image,

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:14.375
we have to go from world
coordinates to image coordinates.

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.500
Okay.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.748
Here's our simple equation for,
in a font that is to small to read, but

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:20.167
it will get bigger in a minute.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:21.210
It's okay.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.708
We're just going to use straight
perspective projection.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.389
We're going to assume
the origin is in the middle,

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:28.000
we're going to assume nothing is skewed,
etc.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.625
So the only thing is is that we
need to know the focal length.

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:36.458
So little x is the focal length times
big X over big Z, same thing with y.

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:37.460
Right?
That's our

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.958
usual perspective transformation.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.210
Okay.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.923
That's X and Y, but
what about how X and Y are changing,

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:49.042
given how how the points are moving?

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.792
Given the V in the world?

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:53.140
Well, it turns out that's pretty easy.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.792
We're going to call little u and
little v here.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:01:00.293
The velocity in x and the velocity in y.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:04.290
So these are just the derivatives in
time, so this is how things are changed.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.708
So u is the velocity in x,
dx, dt, y is v is dy, dt.

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:10.542
All right?

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:15.250
Well, so to take the derivative
of x with respect to something.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.240
In this case, time.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.792
Right?

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:17.940
How it's moving.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.459
Well, you remember, the,
the formula for the derivative of a,

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.000
of a quotient, right?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.375
Meg is saying, thank God.

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:26.840
No, I don't have to know these things.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.543
Well, it's just the derivative of
the top times the bottom minus

00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:32.750
the derivative of the bottom times the
top all divided by the bottom squared.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.250
Right?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.792
Right.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:34.490
Okay.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.458
That's what this is, right here, okay?

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:40.499
Vx, that's the, that's the change,
that's the velocity in x times Z minus

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.172
the top, X times the velocity in Z
divided by Z squared multiplied by f,

00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:45.960
that's just the constant.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.083
Same thing down below, okay?

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.377
Then we start to expand this stuff and

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:53.620
we get this nice little formula here,
okay?

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.556
So when you look at it, that's still
kind of ugly, because you don't actually

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:02.917
know what Vx, Vz and Vy, you,
you know that they're from back here.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:07.107
Well, it turns out, you can write
them pretty beautifully for

00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:12.170
some twisted definition of beauty
in this very simple formula here.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.025
1 over Z at some point x,
y times A times T plus B x,

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:21.904
y of omega and
let me show you exactly what that is.

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:23.084
Okay?

00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:25.020
So here, I've rewritten it.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.746
So this is the motion, so u is how much
it's moving at some point x, y, so

00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:32.083
we know the point x, y in the image.

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.900
The question is how much
motion are we seeing?

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.667
So we've got the u and the v, that's
the motion in x and the motion in y.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:39.630
All right?

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.746
And what it does is this formula
relates the translation and

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:47.792
rotational component of the point
out there in the world.

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:50.720
These are world T and world omega.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.208
Two, how it's moving in the image?

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:53.708
Okay?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.583
Thing to realize is that this quantity
A is just a function of things we know.

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:05.071
We know, we're assuming we know the
focal length of the lens and if we're at

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.360
some point x, y, we know what that
point, this is little x, little y.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.208
This is the location in the image.

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:13.220
Cap X, cap Y, cap Z, out in the world.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.250
Little x, little y in the image.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.090
All right?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.750
So you'll notice that
A is just this function.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.750
B is a little more complicated, but it
is still just a set of things we know.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.540
Okay?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.018
So, if you tell me some point and
you tell me the focal point,

00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:31.625
I can tell you this A matrix and
this B matrix.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:36.875
I might not know T and omega, I might
want to solve for T and omega, okay?

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:38.830
But A and B I know everything of.
