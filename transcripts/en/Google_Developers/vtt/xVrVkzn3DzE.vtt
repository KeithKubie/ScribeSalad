00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:03.270
SPEAKER: Still not working.

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:07.740
Yeah, we had some issues
with the clickers.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.910
Now it's fixed.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.470
It's amazing.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.160
Yeah.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.350
Thank you very much,
guys, for turning up.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.870
Just a small disclaimer
about this session.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.960
It's about gaming.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.470
I know in your pamphlets,
it says for general markets.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.900
So this is for gaming.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.310
You can stay if you want
to if you're not a gamer,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.180
but just to keep your
expectations right,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.210
just the translation went
off from English to Chinese.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.590
So just to set the
expectations right for there.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.310
OK.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:41.990
[SPEAKING CHINESE] And that's
my only Chinese that I know.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.800
So I'm not going to keep
this session in Chinese.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.280
So please put those
earpieces in and listen

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.020
in to the translation, please.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.070
Thank you.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.820
So today we're going to
talk about in this session

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.870
about the 2017 global markets,
where the opportunity is

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.444
in terms of gaming, and where
you should export in 2017.

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:08.860
And in this session, we're
going to talk specifically more

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.510
about the Middle East
and North Africa.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.460
It's not the only growth
region, but it's the one

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.668
that actually grows the most.

00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:18.160
So we're going to do a slight
deep dive into that region

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.230
and how you can localize and
be successful in the region.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.450
So we're going to talk
about three things today.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.180
First, the global
markets, as I said.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.370
We'll do the slight deep
dive into Middle East

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.770
and how you localize in that
region, as well as how to win

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.430
and how to go for
it in that region.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.200
So let's identify the
key markets in 2017

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.050
and look at the global
map in that first stage.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.510
So if we look at revenue--

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.450
sorry, let's ask ourselves
first a question.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.890
If you're not
exporting out, I'll

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.740
give you a reason why to do it.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.710
Google Play did a great
research the other year

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.040
about the growth
of installs that

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.009
comes from global apps,
which is app companies that

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.870
have penetration in more than
five markets versus single app

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.010
markets.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.650
And the ones that are
global have 2.4 times more

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.110
in-style growth than the markets
with apps with single market

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.130
installs.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.320
So it's a great incentive
to actually go abroad

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.420
because you can
find your audience.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.290
You can find audience also
that are more valuable to you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.565
than in your home markets.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.440
All right.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.160
So if we look at the
three stages of exporting

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.610
your app in the first place--

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.850
not just your game, but the
app in the first place--

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.650
so first, we identify
the opportunity.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.910
So how do we do that?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.480
First, we need to identify
our KPIs in the first place.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.240
What does matter in the
market that I'm going into?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.710
And which stage of me
launching the app am I into?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.840
Is it installs that I'm
actually focusing on?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.710
Or is it LTV, or
return on investment?

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.580
What is it?

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.380
Identify those key metrics.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.430
And then look into data.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.150
And there is plenty
of third party data,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.790
including Google, that can help
you identify those markets.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.260
The second part is actually
localizing the app itself.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.740
We're going to go through
a couple of stages.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.860
Earlier we had the
GO-Global with Google Play,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.260
explaining how you
can localize the app.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.530
But also Google can help
to localize the ads, which

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.640
is the front face.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.130
Often most the first interaction
that a potential gamer

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.710
or an installer would have
with you is through your ads.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.357
A good way to identify markets
is looking at your own data.

00:03:49.357 --> 00:03:51.190
Sometimes that could
give a great indication

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.840
of where the data is.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.060
So this is a snapshot from
our test account at Firebase

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.270
looking at where the data
is coming from in terms

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.770
of country and region first--

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.560
so the US in this instance
gives it a lot of traffic--

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.460
but also the smaller markets
like in Europe or the UK,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.320
as well as in Asia,
but also looking

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.840
at different demographics and
other sub-segments of your data

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.839
that gives you more
indication of where to head.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.450
So let's look at
the revenue that

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.250
are coming in through mobile
gaming in the first place.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.510
So this is Newzoo data.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.410
This is not ours.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.890
So this has unified,
both iOS and Android.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.660
So we look at the
most of the money that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.180
comes in through mobile
gaming is actually from APAC.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.070
No surprises there.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.510
About 45% of the global
revenue is actually

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.430
coming in from APAC.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.820
And a distant second is
from the North America,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:54.280
with Western Europe and Latin
America following slow after.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.990
Middle East is
still on a low par

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.360
in comparison to
the other region,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.850
but it actually grows the most.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.630
So 26.6% is estimated growth
between 2015 and 2016.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.520
And Latin America
is also showing

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.790
quite interesting
growth in that aspect,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.040
especially countries
like Mexico, Argentina,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.170
but also the smaller
South American markets

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.290
like Uruguay, Peru.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.620
But we're going to take a
closer look, as we said,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.830
at the Middle East region,
as well as the North African

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.240
region for 2017.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.920
So there's three reasons--

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.710
I like to talk about
things in threes,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.270
so you're going to notice that
in the coming presentation now.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.755
So the first one is scale.

00:05:44.755 --> 00:05:47.130
You can find markets in the
Middle East and North African

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.800
region that provides
you with a great scale.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.310
Countries like Morocco,
Egypt, have a lot of people.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.080
Although maybe not the
highest return of investment,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.760
but there's a lot of installs
coming in from there.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.610
And you can also find markets
with high lifetime value giving

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.820
great returns,
especially for games.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.060
Countries like UAE, or
Israel, or Saudi Arabia

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.780
has a great amount of volume
of people with deep pockets

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.920
putting into games.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.417
The third reason also,
which is quite rare wherever

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:21.250
you go, especially here
in APAC, is actually

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.230
low competition in the region.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.100
The competition can best
be described as fragmented.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.440
And there is quite a small
scene of really large players,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.770
local players, that are
still in the region,

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.080
and most of those players are
from Israel or from the UAE.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.490
In the other markets,
they're quite small

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.920
and haven't really penetrated
the market successfully.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.486
So there's a big opening
for you guys as developers,

00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:51.110
as gaming developers,
to actually enter

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.660
the region because
the competition is

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.187
quite low and fragmented.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.700
So what are the growth
drivers that drives

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.470
that growth in the Middle East?

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.800
Right now, we see a huge upswing
in carrier building, which

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.060
is very important for
developing nations

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.530
in the region, especially
when we have partnered up

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.290
with carriers in Egypt
and Saudi Arabia,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.960
where the credit card
penetration is actually

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.030
quite low.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.360
So now we can successfully
drive those revenue bits

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.940
from gamers in that region.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.340
But also, the mobile
penetration is on the up,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.836
and it's growing
a lot, especially

00:07:32.836 --> 00:07:34.210
coming in from
Egypt, if you look

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.110
at that as a country with
more than 60 million people.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.720
And people are actually
going mobile only, not just

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.030
mobile first, but mobile only.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.300
So the mobile penetration
is increasing a lot,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.000
and people are using it
for a variety of tasks.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.350
But also in terms of
barriers to entry,

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.570
there's low financial and
technical barrier to entry

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.270
there, especially
carrier billing

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.370
has solved the financial
issues over there as well.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.870
So let's look at
the top markets,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.010
first in terms of volume.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.420
So Saudi Arabia is largest
market in terms of volume.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.250
This is Google.com Queries.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.020
Not necessary
installs, but in terms

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.420
of interest on
Google.com, Saudi Arabia

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.010
shows its muscles with a lot of
queries in the gaming sector.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.460
And this is between Q1, Q3, '16.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.011
So this is not the full year.

00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:31.010
The picture might change
at the end of the year,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.090
but nonetheless, Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, as well as Israel,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.909
Morocco, UAE following after.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.090
What is most interesting is
that Egypt is growing the most,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.919
as we noticed before.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.930
It's a country
with a high volume,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.180
but it is also growing the most.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:53.226
Saudi Arabia is also showing a
lot of potential in the region.

00:08:53.226 --> 00:08:55.100
And one note to make is
actually that Morocco

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.270
is on the slight decline.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.760
There's no real explanation why.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.400
It's just generally,
the gaming interest

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.710
has gone down
slightly year on year.

00:09:07.494 --> 00:09:08.410
No, we should do this.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.990
Here we go.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.440
So which type of games
are the most interesting?

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.130
And what are the type of
games that people in MENA

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.040
are playing?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.920
So massive multiplayer online
games are very, very popular,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.510
as well as casual games.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.880
And I would say casual
games is more tailored

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.680
towards the female segment.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.810
So if we take in this
example Saudi Arabia,

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.970
the casual games
in that region is

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.580
very driven by the
female demographic.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.110
But also, I know there's a big
scene for role-playing games

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.430
here in China.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.370
There's quite an interest
overall also in role-playing

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.410
games, and that's
also the sector

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.850
that is growing the most.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.227
So I would like to
look first at the cost

00:09:58.227 --> 00:09:59.810
and then look at the
return investment

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.920
to see how attractive the
market is in terms of entry.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.774
In terms of CPI, this is
CPF and Google Play only.

00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:07.940
We don't have the iOS store.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.175
We can't really share that.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.550
But if we look at
the Google Play

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.340
CPI, and we share a range--

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.110
I don't want to give
you a specific number

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.610
because we can't really do that.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.030
But in terms of a range between
a low range and a high range,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.000
Saudi Arabia ranks
the highest right now.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.130
We've seen a sudden
influx, especially

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.800
during Q3 of a few Israeli game
players who've gone in there

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.500
and jacked up the CPI slightly.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.760
UAE, Israel is coming.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.690
They're in the mid-range.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.690
And Egypt and Morocco are
the cheapest countries

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.795
to target in terms
of cost per install.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.791
There we go.

00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:48.290
All right.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.470
We've seen that those countries
have high costs, like Saudi,

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.150
like UAE, and Israel.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.570
But also they have
quite a high return.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.950
This is the lifetime value.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.826
So over the last 90 days,
how many installs are driven

00:11:01.826 --> 00:11:03.200
in the country,
but also how much

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.960
revenue in terms of in-app
purchases are driven?

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.880
Then we divide it
between each other

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.680
and create an index over it.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.450
So UAE is driving
the most amount

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.790
of in-app purchases per install,
followed by Israel and Saudi

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.820
Arabia.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.840
Also no surprises there.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.410
Because of the low income
barrier in Morocco and Egypt,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.290
we end up in a slightly
lower tier over there.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.230
So this is a suggested
model for you to look at.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.830
If you want to tier
markets up and see, OK,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.320
which is the most interesting
market for me to enter in,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.945
rather than looking
[INAUDIBLE], should

00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:43.240
I go to a high LTV
market or low CPI market,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.740
mix them up and tier them up.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.490
That's the smart thing to do.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.080
So in this case, countries
in the tier one segment,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.640
which is the blue piece, has
a high LTV, but a low CPI,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.960
so the best of two worlds,
or a relatively high LTV

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.200
and low CPI.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.830
And following down to the
segments of two and three,

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.425
where you have high
LTV and a high CPI,

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:11.540
a low LTV and a low CPI, but
also basically the gray basket

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.150
here is countries
or markets maybe

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.900
to avoid or maybe look at an
alternative way of targeting

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.120
them.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.860
So in this instance, taking
the top five markets,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.920
Israel is the only country
to end up in the tier one.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.680
As we saw earlier, Israel
provided with moderate CPIs,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.800
but also quite good returns.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.230
So it's a good market
to actually target

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.915
because it provides
the best of two worlds.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.270
Saudi ends up somewhere
in the middle,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.950
but ends up slightly
on the high CPI stage.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.640
It had the high CPI,
but also provided

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.270
actually quite good
returns, together with UAE.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.110
So yeah, Egypt and
Morocco ends up

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.350
on a slight downturn
on low CPI as well as

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.258
low returns on investment.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.180
For the markets that
have low returns,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.640
like Egypt and Morocco,
it can be [AUDIO OUT],

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.120
but you can also,
through AdWords,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.890
also target high-end
Android devices,

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.790
like Samsung S7 Edge or those
really expensive devices.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.700
They tend to also
have similar returns.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.380
How do we localize in the
Middle East and North Africa?

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.620
So there's a couple
of things to consider.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.750
So first of all, why should you
localize in the first instance?

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.000
First of all, is
discoverability.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.680
People will find your
app much easier--

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.461
that's the most obvious reason.

00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:44.460
Having just localized
keywords, for instance, so

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.060
localized string in
the app description,

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.760
it just helps people to
find the app much easier.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.580
But also, local app team
stores like in Google Play,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.820
they're looking for apps
that have a good rating,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.790
but also a localized
feeling that they

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.420
want to feature on their page.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.970
So just translating
the front end

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.780
in terms of the Play
Store text just makes

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.080
you more discoverable and more
favorable in the Play Store

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.970
team's eyes.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.270
The second thing is
about the engagement.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.730
About 72% of users we've
been interviewing in the past

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.014
prefer a localized app,
especially in the Middle East,

00:14:27.014 --> 00:14:28.680
as well as we've seen
an upturn in terms

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.140
of both engagement and
returns on investment

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.460
for apps that have localized.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.404
And the third bit is
about the experience.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.260
Brands tend to also strengthen
their experience with the users

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.420
by localizing in
the local language.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.579
It just looks so much better
when you have, for instance,

00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:52.620
a game coming into China.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.640
You don't want to
have it in English.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.265
You want to have it
in Chinese, and you

00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:58.500
want to have it fully in
Chinese, both culturally

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.070
and on the translation piece.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.290
And in terms of if we
look at the Middle East

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.640
in terms of regions, there is a
lot of subregions in the Middle

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.140
East.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.450
There's not just one big region.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.800
And it's the easiest
way to look at it.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.650
It's in three subregions.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.190
The first one is the
GCC, which is the Gulf

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.100
Coast, as we call it.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.280
It's around Kuwait,
Bahrain, UAE, Oman, and also

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.350
Saudi Arabia.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.930
They encompass this
high-income region and very

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:38.180
oil-rich nations that
are quite culturally

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.670
similar to each
other, and they're

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.850
quite easy to
target in one bunch.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.694
But there is also
differences, obviously,

00:15:46.694 --> 00:15:48.110
between the
countries, but they're

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.220
quite similar in terms
of localization in terms

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.530
of culture and also language.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.020
The second region
we're talking about

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:02.300
is the Levant, which is Iraq,
Jordan, Lebanon, as well

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.460
as Syria.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.590
Those markets are also
quite similar to each other

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.760
in many different ways.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.260
Right now, politically,
they're very

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.140
similar to each other, but
also in terms of language

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.460
and how they speak.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.185
More specific, Syria
and Lebanon are

00:16:15.185 --> 00:16:17.420
quite similar to each
other, as well as Jordan.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.150
With Iraq, it would be a
slightly different type

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.160
of language used.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.220
And the third one would be
the Maghreb region, which

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.400
is the North African region.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.480
Talking about the language
itself, it's quite similar.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.240
You can use the same type of
expressions and idioms used

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.360
in that language in that region
with the exception of Egypt.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.110
That's its own
slight small region

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.360
because the language
is just so different

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.340
as well as the culture.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.730
There we go.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.400
So there's also a
difference, as I said before,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.920
in terms of language
preference, just looking at it.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.450
Although I strongly
recommend to localize fully

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:10.430
in Arabic, more than 50%,
more than 5 out of 10 users

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.000
would prefer to have a
localized map in Arabic.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.060
And it's one of the most widely
spoken languages in the world.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.230
However, if you want to enter
easily with an English speaking

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.230
app and don't have the means
to translate or localize,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.930
UAE probably would be the
easiest market to enter

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.740
because it's--

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.590
take an example
like Dubai, which

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:36.320
is one of the Emirates in
the United Emirates region.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.540
90% of them are ex-pats
who speak English,

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.140
so there will be less of a
problem going into that region.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:47.740
But the other countries do
localize not just the language,

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.506
but also the culture is
super important, especially,

00:17:50.506 --> 00:17:52.380
we're going to look at
it a little bit later,

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.160
for Saudi Arabia.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.950
And there's a couple of things
to consider when you translate.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.490
So, for instance, having
the right translations

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.190
in the right variety
of different languages

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.150
in the region is important.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.750
For instance, if we look at
the third bit over there,

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:19.190
when you translate directly from
a foreign language into Arabic,

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.990
the language can
look very weird,

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.610
like it does here right now.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.700
It might not see it from the
front, but this is actually--

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.900
we tend to put the
characters together,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.350
so it forms into a word.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.220
So here, they're all
disconnected from each other,

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.720
but the right way
to do it in Arabic

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.670
is actually write it
together like this

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.297
and connect the words together.

00:18:39.297 --> 00:18:40.380
So that's something to do.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.830
And the main point here is
hiring a local translator

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.540
to do all of these
things, and not

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.900
just machine translate
the whole into Arabic.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.940
It can be very, very
wrong and actually

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.300
have a negative impact
on the user experience.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.970
But also, the UI is important
to localize because most

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.560
of the UIs in Arabic, it's
not from left to right,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.150
it's actually from
right to left.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.340
The language is
written differently.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.380
So if you have menus
and all of these things,

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.570
it's important to
localize the whole look

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.610
and feel of it
into right to left.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.790
And we have a couple
of examples here

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.160
of companies that
have done very well.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.320
For instance, the
Castle Clash was

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.860
IGG.com has done it
very well in terms

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.880
of just looking at your
app store localization,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.840
completely in Arabic.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.172
But also the screenshots,
if you look at it here,

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.380
they're completely in Arabic.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.410
But also the icons
and the characters

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.230
have been modified
to the local culture.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.990
This is an example
from Saudi Arabia.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.350
So the female character
here has a small veil.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.030
I don't know how
you feel about that,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.820
but in terms of
how they actually

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.680
spoke to the local
population, they

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.950
added that because local
women cover up their faces.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.730
So that's what they did
with the local icon as well.

00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:04.900
There we go.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.370
And they saw a great uplift.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.220
So the whole localization effort
they took from there actually

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.390
saw a great uplift.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.405
In terms of active
installs in the region,

00:20:13.405 --> 00:20:16.410
they saw a 48% uplift,
and the revenue

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.740
took a 58% uplift
just four months

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.010
after they localized the game.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.260
So another company
that did it quite well

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.290
was ZeptoLab, who grew
quite nicely in the Middle

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.520
East in the last year or so.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.840
So they localized
also the same thing.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.090
They took the screenshots
and the whole description

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.490
as well as the in-game.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.360
And the actives and
installs on Google Play

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.790
rose by more than 74% over
the four-month period.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.340
So can someone-- it's
something that really viral

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.260
on the internet
a couple of years

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:04.070
ago is this painting from the
Spanish painter who forgot

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.540
this painting inside a church.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.780
And this old lady three
years ago took this painting

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.550
and tried to repair it because
it was slightly damaged.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.310
This is a painting of Jesus.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.900
So she tried to repair it.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.490
And it started looking
more like this.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.400
So what are we
trying to say here?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.140
You need to be more
on the native check.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.490
You have to localize correctly.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.200
It has to look
like the original.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.440
So if you look at local
games and how they succeed,

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.120
they look like they are local.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.830
So don't be that painting over
there and try to copy/paste.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.860
So do it more on the
native side and be

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.730
very local in your approach.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.460
And also avoid stereotypes.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.820
In the Arab region, there's a
lot of controversies in media,

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.600
and there's a lot of things
in tension politically and all

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.980
these things.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.280
As well as in movies and
other culture aspects,

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.900
they tend to have a
negative Arab stereotype.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.240
So avoid those things when
releasing new games, as well

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.860
as in the in-app characters.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.567
Don't have that
negative stereotype.

00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:09.900
This is a couple of examples
from American movies, where

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.420
they portrayed Arabs
quite negatively

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.989
and had an actually quite severe
impact on the movies being

00:22:16.989 --> 00:22:18.905
popular in the Middle
East in the first place.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.060
And also another
thing to consider

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.390
is that the Middle East
region is [? rife. ?]

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.940
It has a lot of
different seasonalities.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.890
We Celebrate a lot
of different things.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.560
More specifically, like
[? Eid ?] [? al-Adha, ?] which

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.120
is the pilgrimage to Mecca that
Muslims take to Saudi Arabia.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.700
And that's something that
is happening every year.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.550
But another thing that is more
specific for gaming that's

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.850
really important is Ramadan.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.000
It's a four-week period.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.810
It's a month somewhere
in June, July nowadays.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.570
It goes back 10 days every year.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:59.400
People tend to have an uprise
in terms of games, installs,

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.390
as well as revenue
spent during that time.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.820
So it's quite important to
be in those seasonalities

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.520
to boost your installs
and boost your revenues.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.850
But also another thing,
in the Gulf Coast region,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.400
August is so hot that
people stay inside.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.362
And we see a slight rise in
terms of gaming activities

00:23:18.362 --> 00:23:19.070
during that time.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.480
So as we see here, as
I said about Ramadan,

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.880
people tend to spend
more time inside.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.300
Because I don't know if you know
Ramadan, it's a fasting period.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.820
So people don't eat, and
they tend to stay inside.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.070
Don't go to work either.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.400
And that phenomenon is more
known in the Gulf Coast region

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.320
where people can afford to
stay at home and not work.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:49.300
So the gaming revenue tends
to go up for all ages.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.460
This is four weeks
prior to Ramadan.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.510
It just goes up during the
four weeks and during Ramadan.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.140
It just goes up in terms of
revenues spent in the games.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.740
And the region is
crazy about YouTube.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.010
If there's one way I would
tell you to reach users

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.189
in that region, it's YouTube.

00:24:20.189 --> 00:24:21.480
The watch time is off the hook.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.896
If you look at,
for instance, like

00:24:22.896 --> 00:24:26.220
Kuwait, which is the
neighboring country of Iraq,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.490
had twice the watch
time of users in the US,

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.920
who are already quite
savvy YouTube users.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.690
But look at UAE, Qatar,
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia--

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.090
they're all much
more than the US,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.510
and they're very engaged users,
and entertainment is just

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.890
a big subject in terms of
entertainment consumes.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.870
And that's something to keep in
mind when targeting the region,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.860
is that YouTube is probably the
one best way to actually enter

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.350
the region, is create
content for YouTube.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.540
So as I said before, the
region is quite diverse,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.400
and it's very different.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.410
One way to look
at it is how much

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:13.477
they've adopted some of
the religious aspects

00:25:13.477 --> 00:25:14.060
of the region.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.080
So Saudi Arabia, if we
look at one end, which is

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.749
they tend to be
more conservative.

00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:21.290
And that's something
to consider when

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.050
you target the country
through different creatives,

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.780
but also the in-game
aspect of it.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.550
So for instance,
female characters

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.990
should not be showing
too much skin,

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.920
and also avoid those regional
issues in that aspect,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.020
and don't offend the
religion in any way.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.230
Just have a closer
look of exactly what

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.150
that means for you guys.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.900
But on the other end,
you have countries

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.890
who are a little bit
more liberal, where

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.300
those things are not an issue.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.570
But countries like
Lebanon and Israel

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.190
tend to be quite rife
with political issues.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.120
Those are the things that
you should avoid, especially

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.880
in Israel with the
Israel-Palestine conflict.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.470
So that's something to
just really, really avoid.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.310
But as I said, the
region is very diverse,

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.500
and it's different--
like, targeting

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.120
has a different
implication wherever

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.638
you go in those countries.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.850
So in terms of localization,
you can do it in a smart way.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.760
You don't have to go
fully local and native.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.800
We can make it easy
and just divide them

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.040
by three in a bunch.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.370
So first of all, it's just like
unlocking that new opportunity,

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.600
testing the market.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.620
It can localize some of the
aspects of the Play Store

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.630
items, maybe have the
screenshots of the promotion,

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:50.900
use the automatic translation
that Google Play provides,

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.290
but also maybe doing APK
translation as well as

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.250
the screenshot of the promotions
maybe can be localized as well.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.280
The next step is just to ramp
up the advancement in terms

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.680
of localization, is letting
know that you actually

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.510
care about the users.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.490
So that can be going
a little bit further

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.970
by translating the app string,
for instance, or localizing

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.345
the app screenshots,
not just the promotions.

00:27:14.345 --> 00:27:16.160
But the absolute best
way is to actually

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.230
absolutely go local and team up
and partner up with local teams

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:26.390
to help you translate the whole
game, as well as co-partner

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.720
with marketing agencies to
actually get that local look

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.000
and feel.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.350
So that's the three different
ways where you can do it.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.950
But as we said
before, you can beta

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.960
test the market by having
limited localization

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.830
in that effort.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:46.190
You can just start looking
at the first bucket

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.176
of localization.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.740
There we go.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.090
So what are the key
takeaways in this segment?

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.030
The global markets
are all increasing

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:01.140
in terms of the opportunity
for gaming, for instance.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.870
But the Middle East is
showing the most progression

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.520
in terms of growth.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.340
And that's the key
region I want to tell you

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.640
about you guys today.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:16.950
It's a great opportunity
with low barriers, especially

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.910
countries like Saudi Arabia
and Israel showing the best

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.996
returns, as well as the
trade-off between cost

00:28:23.996 --> 00:28:24.495
and returns.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.810
Multiplayer games, as well as
casual games, are very popular.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.850
And another thing,
also, the third thing,

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.680
when we talk about localization,
is having that native check.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.090
The localization feel
is extremely important

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.120
when you go to that region.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.570
But also, having
the right targeting

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.360
in terms of seasonality
like Ramadan

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.050
is very important for
increasing that gaming

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.910
revenue during that
period, as well

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:06.080
as August in certain
regions of the Middle East.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.480
So I think that's it for me.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.870
If there is any questions?

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.800
Maybe not immediately, we
can take it afterwards.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.540
I'm here for about
30 minutes more.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.900
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:29:40.744 --> 00:29:41.410
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.340
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I have
a question about [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:50.790
because the question is
if the app [INAUDIBLE],

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.160
is it allowed to
publish in Google Play?

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.700
Because according
to my knowledge,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.690
it's not allowed in [? Latin ?]
[? America. ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:04.430
if it's OK in the
[? MENA. ?] I mean,

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:08.440
if the game [INAUDIBLE]
with carrier billing.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.350
Carrier billing is one of the
most important [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.357
in Middle East.

00:30:13.357 --> 00:30:14.690
SPEAKER: It's an up and coming--

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.690
I'm not aware of any legal
issues or policy issues

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:18.410
that we have.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.240
But we've recently
teamed up, for instance,

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.570
with the Saudi Telecom
players to have

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:27.060
carrier billing integrated
into our platform as well.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.701
I'm not aware of any
policy issues in any ways.

00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:32.450
But maybe we can double
check that for you

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.929
and maybe send out a
clearer answer for you.

00:30:34.929 --> 00:30:35.470
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.969
Thank you.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.230
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.754
AUDIENCE: It's a great speech.

00:30:55.754 --> 00:30:56.420
I learned a lot.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:56.590
SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.340
Thank you.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.710
AUDIENCE: And quick question.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:07.030
You mentioned that Arabic is
the language that covers MENA.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.030
But there are also
a lot of difference,

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.620
you mentioned like GCC,
and also the Maghreb area.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.320
What's the language difference
between those areas?

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.150
Or can we just localize the
game for Arabic and just

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.197
for one region, and it will
work automatically for the rest?

00:31:24.197 --> 00:31:24.780
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.920
It's more of the expressions
used in the language.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.700
So the written Arabic is
very similar wherever you go.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.250
It's the spoken Arabic
that is different.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:37.090
So certain dialects
can be so different

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.610
that people don't
understand each other.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.800
And also, the
expressions used are

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.460
different from
different regions.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.230
So in terms of, if you
want to go safe, as I said,

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:51.320
you have those three main
regions that I pointed out.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.020
They are quite similar in terms
of even lingual similarities

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.400
between each other.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.310
AUDIENCE: So pretty much spoken
language is much different,

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.810
but written language
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.060
SPEAKER: The written
language is pretty uniform.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:03.780
Thank you.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.500
Thanks a lot.

00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:10.130
SPEAKER: All right.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.213
Thank you very much, guys.

00:32:11.213 --> 00:32:13.170
And I hope you enjoy
the rest of the day.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.976
