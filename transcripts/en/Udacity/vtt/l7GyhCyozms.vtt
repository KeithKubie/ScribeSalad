00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.020
At the beginning of the lesson, we
promised that we would link up these two

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.470
chains and use the transitivity of
reductions to show that vertex cover and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.510
independent set are NP-complete.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.880
We now turn to the last
link in this chain, and

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.460
we'll reduce 3-CNF SAT
to independent set.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.090
As we've already argued these
problems are N and P so

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.350
that will complete the proof
that they are NP-complete.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.950
Here's the transformation, or
reduction, we need to accomplish.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.448
The input is a 3-CNF formula, with M
clauses and we need to output a graph

00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:38.145
that has an independent set of size m if
and only if the input is satisfiable.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.360
We'll illustrate on this example.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.460
For each literal in the formula
we create a vertex in a graph.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.520
Then, we add edges between all vertices
that came from the same clause.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.330
We'll refer to these as within clause
edges or simply the clause edges.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.010
Then we add edges between all literals
that are contradictory, b and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.090
b bar can't both be true for instance.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.760
We refer to these as the between clause
edges or the contradiction edges.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.320
The implementation of
this transformation

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.350
is simple enough to imagine, and I'll
leave it to you to convince yourself

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.910
that it can be done in polynomial time
