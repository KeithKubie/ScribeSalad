00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
I discovered that a light microscope can

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730
I discovered that a light microscope can
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.280
I discovered that a light microscope can
see sharper pictures that what people

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290
see sharper pictures that what people
 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.680
see sharper pictures that what people
believed in the 20th century more than

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690
believed in the 20th century more than
 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.310
believed in the 20th century more than
hundred years and this is important

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
hundred years and this is important
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.770
hundred years and this is important
because light microscopy is the only way

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
because light microscopy is the only way
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.600
because light microscopy is the only way
by which you can look into transparent

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
by which you can look into transparent
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.369
by which you can look into transparent
things important things such as cells

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
things important things such as cells
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.410
things important things such as cells
living cells or tissue and the presence

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
living cells or tissue and the presence
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.080
living cells or tissue and the presence
light microscope that I invented allows

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
light microscope that I invented allows
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269
light microscope that I invented allows
you to see details that you couldn't see

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
you to see details that you couldn't see
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.669
you to see details that you couldn't see
before but the basic discovery was that

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679
before but the basic discovery was that
 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.530
before but the basic discovery was that
in the 20th century so before I made my

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
in the 20th century so before I made my
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540
in the 20th century so before I made my
work people believed that you have two

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
work people believed that you have two
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340
work people believed that you have two
separate things if you look into the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
separate things if you look into the
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350
separate things if you look into the
microscope if you want to see them

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
microscope if you want to see them
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.000
microscope if you want to see them
separately these on the see the details

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
separately these on the see the details
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.510
separately these on the see the details
by focusing the light very sharply but I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
by focusing the light very sharply but I
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.350
by focusing the light very sharply but I
discovered is that you can overcome this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
discovered is that you can overcome this
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.510
discovered is that you can overcome this
barrier by making the molecules that we

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
barrier by making the molecules that we
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090
barrier by making the molecules that we
look at distinct difference if the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
look at distinct difference if the
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799
look at distinct difference if the
molecules are different you can see

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
molecules are different you can see
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.160
molecules are different you can see
things separately and you can tell them

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
things separately and you can tell them
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.979
things separately and you can tell them
apart and that that was the discovery

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
apart and that that was the discovery
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020
apart and that that was the discovery
that has led now to microscopes that are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
that has led now to microscopes that are
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960
that has led now to microscopes that are
not limited by the focusing of light

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
not limited by the focusing of light
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.929
not limited by the focusing of light
anymore but you can see things at much

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
anymore but you can see things at much
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090
anymore but you can see things at much
greater detail because the separation of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
greater detail because the separation of
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.530
greater detail because the separation of
things is done by the molecules
