00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
And then this one, I think it's hummus

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.340
Oh yeah, it's been way too long since I've had hummus

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.020
Hey everyone! It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com in Bangkok, Thailand

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.160
When you're about to take a trip, especially if you're travelling

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
somewhere that you've never been before

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.780
You get this overwhelming feeling of excitement

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.300
and that excitement I think it can come from many different things

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.260
maybe kind of going into the unknown,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.400
or maybe it's the excitement you get from

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.180
wanting to do and see and experience and eat as much as you can when you're there

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.520
In a couple of hours from now, actually later tonight

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.740
Ying and I are flying from Bangkok to the Kingdom of Jordan

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.000
And I think Jordan is maybe as different or opposite as you can get from Thailand,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.320
in terms of climate and culture and food and maybe just about everything

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.600
And I am extremely excited to be going to Jordan

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.120
It's now 9 PM, we are fully packed and we're gonna go catch a taxi to the airport,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.200
And it's gonna be pretty cold, not too cold in Jordan, but definitely a lot colder than in Bangkok

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.860
So we're bringing the jackets and we're all packed up

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.940
We're in a taxi on our way to Suvarnabhumi Airport,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.720
which is the main international biggest airport in Bangkok

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.100
Traffic was light, but at the airport it's really busy tonight

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.660
Suvarnabhumi Airport is just packed all the time,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300
full of people

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.580
It's about 10 PM now and our flight is at 12:30 AM,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.320
we're actually leaving tommorow which makes it a little bit confusing,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.540
so you have to like think the day before, but we're actually leaving tommorow

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.240
We made it through customs and immigration and then walked to our gate

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.040
Ying and I were invited by the Jordan tourism board to visit Jordan

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.360
so we're gonna be going there, we're gonna focus our trip mainly on food,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.220
but at the same time we have a pretty full schedule while we're in Jordan,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.840
we're gonna be travelling around seeing some of the famous sites and attractions,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.540
and eating lots of delicious food, I'm anticipating it already

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.160
It's gonna be a 9 hour flight to reach Amman,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.860
I'm getting really really sleepy though, I actually fell asleep right as we took off,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.160
so I'm gonna go eat dinner and then probably sleep for a couple hours,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.220
and I will keep you all updated

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.760
Cold breeze just hit me as we exited the plane, it's 5 AM,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.340
we just landed in Amman, I think I slept quite a bit on the plane

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.320
YIng welcome to Jordan, welcome to Jordan!

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.680
Okay

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.700
Oh! I've been feeling that cold there

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.120
It was a breeze to get through immigration and customs, and we picked up our bag

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.340
The airport was nice and quiet, and there was a representative from visit Jordan the tourism board,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.460
who got our visas for us, we just stepped outside and it is much colder than Bangkok

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.840
Hold on! Oh my jacket, it's here I think right?

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.500
Oh! There it is

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.160
It's about 8 degrees celcius, it's not too cold, but it is cold enough to wear a jacket,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.060
that's for sure!

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.120
Oh!

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.780
All right!

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.080
And we just met up with Fadhi, who is gonna be our guide for the trip,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.880
we're gonna take a car I think to our hotel here in Amman now

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.400
-We're looking forward to this trip very much!
-Wonderful!

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.460
Okay, is it your first time to this part of the world, Mark?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.200
-I have been to Egypt
-Ah Okay!
-About 4 years ago

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.600
-This mosque has one of the biggest of 3 standing domes in the world,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.220
-Wow!

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.860
and look at what's on the other side of the road, opposite to the mosque,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.000
is a Catholic Church
-Oh Okay!
-And that's how it is in Jordan,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.500
we're next to each other, across from each other and we live in harmony

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.860
-La Locanda
-If you've been to Egypt, locanda means motel

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.060
That was about a 30 minute drive, we just arrived to our hotel,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.720
we're gonna be staying at a hotel called La Locanda

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.740
And this is a very old area of Amman and Fadhi was explaining to me that

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.500
it's coming back though, many people are investing here now,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.100
and it's kind of an art and heritage center of Amman

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.400
-Look at the size of that door Ying!
-Haha!

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.120
-Okay so the magnet, just put the magnet it goes downwards to the right
-Downwards to the right

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.080
-Right in here
-All right, oh yeah

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.960
-There was a click
-Good

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.460
We are just stepping into our room very nice little place, this is a boutique hotel

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:55.700
and all of the rooms have different names that are all different Arabic artists

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.200
-Oh Wow! Nice room!
-Nice

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.760
Nice and bright and white

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.040
-Is that the bathroom over there?
-Yeah
-I don't know how to use this thing?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.700
-What is what thing?
-This thing

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.780
-Oh, that is the bidet

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.760
shower over here, have the toilet and the bidet, sink over here

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.160
I like the style is very minimal, but everything you need,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.680
but not overly fancy or not overly decorative just really nice and clean

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.780
Trying to open this window, is this a window or a door?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.480
And this is our view

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.680
Very nice!

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.780
Oh that is some really cool fresh air coming from that window

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.680
Oh check out that orange tree!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.240
One of the nicknames for Amman is the White City because all of the buildings and

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.720
all of the houses are white because of the limestone that is used for the construction

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.400
And I've only been in Amman now for 30 minutes,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.780
but I can already see just from looking out our window that

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.460
all of the buildings are so white and what I really loved is the contrast between

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.940
the white buildings and the really blue sky

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.860
I just took a shower, that felt incredible! And I was wondering why I was so hungry,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.980
I'm so hungry right now and then I looked at the time back in Bangkok

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.800
it's right at noon and so it's lunch time in Bangkok

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.620
The good news is breakfast, we're gonna down to breakfast in about 15 minutes

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.620
And the breakfast is buffet style so you just walk through and

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.140
get whatever you want, they had a number of different vegetables, raw vegetables

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.040
plus some different dips some hummus and some different types of bread

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.060
Oh also got some hard baked egg and there is some rice on the bottom

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.440
I think so that it doesn't stick, I'm not sure there is some rice on the bottom of the egg in the pan

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.960
Let me crack that

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.360
I'm gonna chop this in half

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.880
and I think it could use a little bit of pepper

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.580
Some pepper, all right, all right

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:15.960
and then some like pita bread, I think I'm gonna add some of the egg and maybe

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.080
Oh! That just fell out, add the egg to this bread

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.540
and then there is this sauce over here which is I think this one is hummus

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.300
and then this one it's like a creamy very creamy sauce maybe I don't know

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320
I'll dip it in that and see what it is

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.500
It tastes like a sour cream, very very creamy

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.680
And then this one I think is hummus

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.260
Oh yeah!

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.220
It's been way too long since I've had hummus and

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:06.700
that is like it's a little bit sour maybe with lemon juice and then very very smooth and a little bit starchy

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.280
That is an extremely like very creamy and very smooth hummus

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.080
As I was eating my first plate of breakfast they brought out some ful and

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.100
so I had to get another plate of food

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.100
I'm just gonna take a bite of these beans

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.160
Oh yeah!

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:44.620
That is soft and like refried beans, but with kind of chewy skins to the beans

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.060
Oh it's so good! And with olive oil I put a little bit of olive oil over them too,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.480
makes it even better

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.160
That was good, I like the mix of vegetables and then I'm glad they brought out some ful at the end

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.020
That was really good!

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.160
And I just stepped outside, I had no idea, I wasn't expecting it to rain

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.240
It's not raining right now, but it just drizzled a little bit

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.880
I'm getting really sleepy so I think we're gonna go take a nap in the room for a few hours

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.060
Stay tuned lots more videos from Jordan to come

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.860
Thank you for watching this video please remember to give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.040
And I will see you tomorrow for our first full day in Amman
