okay now now down to cognitive ability

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
okay now now down to cognitive ability
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.540
okay now now down to cognitive ability
well how can you conceptualize

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
well how can you conceptualize
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.759
well how can you conceptualize
intelligence well this is a major

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
intelligence well this is a major
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.020
intelligence well this is a major
problem because your initial

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030
problem because your initial
 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.660
problem because your initial
conceptualization determines in part the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
conceptualization determines in part the
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.820
conceptualization determines in part the
strategies that you're going to use to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
strategies that you're going to use to
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.820
strategies that you're going to use to
investigate intelligence and when you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
investigate intelligence and when you
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.980
investigate intelligence and when you
say when you when you pair a sentence

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
say when you when you pair a sentence
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.349
say when you when you pair a sentence
down to what is intelligence the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
down to what is intelligence the
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540
down to what is intelligence the
sentence is problematic because part of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
sentence is problematic because part of
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.220
sentence is problematic because part of
it is a question about if and how such a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
it is a question about if and how such a
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049
it is a question about if and how such a
thing might manifest itself in the world

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
thing might manifest itself in the world
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.220
thing might manifest itself in the world
so there's a fact out there or set of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
so there's a fact out there or set of
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810
so there's a fact out there or set of
facts that corresponds to intelligence

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
facts that corresponds to intelligence
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.190
facts that corresponds to intelligence
but the other problem is well what do

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
but the other problem is well what do
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.529
but the other problem is well what do
you mean when you say intelligence and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
you mean when you say intelligence and
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.660
you mean when you say intelligence and
you kind of have to nail that down if

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
you kind of have to nail that down if
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760
you kind of have to nail that down if
you're going to have a conversation

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
you're going to have a conversation
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590
you're going to have a conversation
about intelligence that doesn't go

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
about intelligence that doesn't go
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990
about intelligence that doesn't go
entirely astray and so you've got it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
entirely astray and so you've got it
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549
entirely astray and so you've got it
you've got a definitional problem as

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
you've got a definitional problem as
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.810
you've got a definitional problem as
well as an empirical problem and so

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820
well as an empirical problem and so
 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.040
well as an empirical problem and so
there have been and this was especially

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
there have been and this was especially
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.789
there have been and this was especially
true in the 1990s people have been

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
true in the 1990s people have been
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920
true in the 1990s people have been
studying intelligence IQ intelligence

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
studying intelligence IQ intelligence
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.740
studying intelligence IQ intelligence
since the 1920s and it is a very

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
since the 1920s and it is a very
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.390
since the 1920s and it is a very
well-established branch of psychology

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
well-established branch of psychology
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370
well-established branch of psychology
one of the things I have to tell you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
one of the things I have to tell you
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.920
one of the things I have to tell you
about it IQ Research is that if you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
about it IQ Research is that if you
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.429
about it IQ Research is that if you
don't buy IQ research you might as well

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
don't buy IQ research you might as well
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440
don't buy IQ research you might as well
throw away all the rest of psychology

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
throw away all the rest of psychology
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.620
throw away all the rest of psychology
and the reason for that is that the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
and the reason for that is that the
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810
and the reason for that is that the
psychologists first of all who developed

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
psychologists first of all who developed
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609
psychologists first of all who developed
intelligence testing were among the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
intelligence testing were among the
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.980
intelligence testing were among the
early psychologists who instantiated the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
early psychologists who instantiated the
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.569
early psychologists who instantiated the
statistical techniques that all

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
statistical techniques that all
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.630
statistical techniques that all
psychologists use to verify and test all

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
psychologists use to verify and test all
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640
psychologists use to verify and test all
of their hypotheses so you end up

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
of their hypotheses so you end up
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.020
of their hypotheses so you end up
throwing the baby out with the bathwater

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
throwing the baby out with the bathwater
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.550
throwing the baby out with the bathwater
and the IQ people have defined

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
and the IQ people have defined
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.920
and the IQ people have defined
intelligence in a more stringent

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930
intelligence in a more stringent
 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.960
intelligence in a more stringent
stringent and accurate way than we've

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
stringent and accurate way than we've
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120
stringent and accurate way than we've
been able to define almost any other

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
been able to define almost any other
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730
been able to define almost any other
psychological construct and so if you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
psychological construct and so if you
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410
psychological construct and so if you
toss out the one that's most well

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
toss out the one that's most well
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.819
toss out the one that's most well
defined then you're kind of stuck with

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
defined then you're kind of stuck with
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.080
defined then you're kind of stuck with
the problem of what are you going to do

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
the problem of what are you going to do
 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.249
the problem of what are you going to do
with all the ones that you have left

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
with all the ones that you have left
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.080
with all the ones that you have left
over that are nowhere near as well

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
over that are nowhere near as well
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.709
over that are nowhere near as well
defined

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.780

whose predictive validity is much less

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
whose predictive validity is much less
 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589
whose predictive validity is much less

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.680
vigor and clarity
anyways despite all that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
anyways despite all that
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.510
anyways despite all that
people have posited a number of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520
people have posited a number of
 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.580
people have posited a number of
different intelligences and reasonably

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
different intelligences and reasonably
 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.860
different intelligences and reasonably
so because there's a if you think of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
so because there's a if you think of
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.160
so because there's a if you think of
intelligence as that which might move

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
intelligence as that which might move
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.170
intelligence as that which might move
you forward successfully in the world

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180
you forward successfully in the world
 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.360
you forward successfully in the world
obviously there's a fair number of

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
obviously there's a fair number of
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.340
obviously there's a fair number of
phenomena that are associated with

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350
phenomena that are associated with
 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.780
phenomena that are associated with
individuals that might fit into that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
individuals that might fit into that
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.380
individuals that might fit into that
category so we have people have made

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390
category so we have people have made
 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.610
category so we have people have made
these distinctions Bob Sternberg for

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620
these distinctions Bob Sternberg for
 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.990
these distinctions Bob Sternberg for
example is distinguished between

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
example is distinguished between
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.960
example is distinguished between
practical versus analytical intelligence

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970
practical versus analytical intelligence
 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.640
practical versus analytical intelligence
and he kind of thinks of practical as

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650
and he kind of thinks of practical as
 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.340
and he kind of thinks of practical as
like street smarts and has attempted to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350
like street smarts and has attempted to
 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.720
like street smarts and has attempted to
dissociate that from the kind of

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730
dissociate that from the kind of
 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.230
dissociate that from the kind of
analytical intelligence that that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240
analytical intelligence that that
 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.240
analytical intelligence that that
characterizes more straight IQ research

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250
characterizes more straight IQ research
 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.040
characterizes more straight IQ research
I don't think he's done it successfully

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
I don't think he's done it successfully
 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.530
I don't think he's done it successfully
as well at all and since the 1990s

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
as well at all and since the 1990s
 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.050

interest in his practical intelligence

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
interest in his practical intelligence
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.230
interest in his practical intelligence
has declined precipitously because when

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240
has declined precipitously because when
 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.540
has declined precipitously because when
it is matched head-to-head with standard

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550
it is matched head-to-head with standard
 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.600
it is matched head-to-head with standard
IQ intelligence the IQ intelligence eats

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610
IQ intelligence the IQ intelligence eats
 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.520
IQ intelligence the IQ intelligence eats
up all the variability what's really

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
up all the variability what's really
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.740
up all the variability what's really
happened as far as I can tell so far is

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750
happened as far as I can tell so far is
 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.970
happened as far as I can tell so far is
that when we're trying to predict

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980
that when we're trying to predict
 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.930
that when we're trying to predict
people's course through life IQ does a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940
people's course through life IQ does a
 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.790
people's course through life IQ does a
very good job and then one of the traits

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800
very good job and then one of the traits
 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.820
very good job and then one of the traits
does a very good job as well which is

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830
does a very good job as well which is
 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.710
does a very good job as well which is
conscientiousness but it doesn't do as

conscientiousness but it doesn't do as
 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.260
conscientiousness but it doesn't do as
good a job as IQ now that partly might

good a job as IQ now that partly might
 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.130
good a job as IQ now that partly might
be because we can't measure

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140
be because we can't measure
 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.120
be because we can't measure
conscientiousness very well we're stuck

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130
conscientiousness very well we're stuck
 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.070
conscientiousness very well we're stuck
with self reports or maybe I could

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080
with self reports or maybe I could
 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.780
with self reports or maybe I could
gather peer reports about you or I could

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790
gather peer reports about you or I could
 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.550
gather peer reports about you or I could
gather your parents reports about your

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560
gather your parents reports about your
 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.070
gather your parents reports about your
teachers reports and each of those seems

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080
teachers reports and each of those seems
 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.009
teachers reports and each of those seems
to pick up a little bit more of the

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019
to pick up a little bit more of the
 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.900
to pick up a little bit more of the
pattern because you know yourself but

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910
pattern because you know yourself but
 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.120
pattern because you know yourself but
other people know you differently than

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130
other people know you differently than
 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.470
other people know you differently than
you know yourself and there's still some

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480
you know yourself and there's still some
 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.270
you know yourself and there's still some
accuracy in that you can get multiple

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280
accuracy in that you can get multiple
 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.220
accuracy in that you can get multiple
rater reports of something like

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230
rater reports of something like
 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.080
rater reports of something like
conscientiousness and that'll up it's

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090
conscientiousness and that'll up it's
 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.180
conscientiousness and that'll up it's
predictive validity but in the final

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190
predictive validity but in the final
 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.920
predictive validity but in the final
analysis the best you seem to be able to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930
analysis the best you seem to be able to
 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.420
analysis the best you seem to be able to
deal with conscientiousness is about a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430
deal with conscientiousness is about a
 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.610
deal with conscientiousness is about a
point for correlation with long term

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620
point for correlation with long term
 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.070
point for correlation with long term
performance whereas with IQ in complex

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080
performance whereas with IQ in complex
 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.410
performance whereas with IQ in complex
jobs you can probably get 0.5 and maybe

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420
jobs you can probably get 0.5 and maybe
 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.740
jobs you can probably get 0.5 and maybe
point six and so 0.5 is 25% of the

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750
point six and so 0.5 is 25% of the
 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.930
point six and so 0.5 is 25% of the
variance you got to square it point six

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940
variance you got to square it point six
 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.150
variance you got to square it point six
is thirty percent 36 percent of the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160
is thirty percent 36 percent of the
 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.130
is thirty percent 36 percent of the
variance and point four is sixteen

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140
variance and point four is sixteen
 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.170
variance and point four is sixteen
percent of the variance so even at the

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180
percent of the variance so even at the
 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.300
percent of the variance so even at the
low end let's say high end for

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310
low end let's say high end for
 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.740
low end let's say high end for
conscientiousness is 0.4 or 16 percent

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750
conscientiousness is 0.4 or 16 percent
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.640
conscientiousness is 0.4 or 16 percent
low-end for IQ is 0.5 or 25% low-end

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650
low-end for IQ is 0.5 or 25% low-end
 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.590
low-end for IQ is 0.5 or 25% low-end
estimates of IQ make it one and a half

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600
estimates of IQ make it one and a half
 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.480
estimates of IQ make it one and a half
times more powerful than the high-end

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490
times more powerful than the high-end
 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.640
times more powerful than the high-end
estimates of conscientiousness and I

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650
estimates of conscientiousness and I
 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.440
estimates of conscientiousness and I
think that's about right you'd think why

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450
think that's about right you'd think why
 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.060
think that's about right you'd think why
do we even have to debate this and

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070
do we even have to debate this and
 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.890
do we even have to debate this and
because it's so bloody obvious to me

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900
because it's so bloody obvious to me
 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.570
because it's so bloody obvious to me
that intelligence is a major predictor

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580
that intelligence is a major predictor
 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.820
that intelligence is a major predictor

well why well smart people go to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580
well why well smart people go to
 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.520
well why well smart people go to
university now is that actually a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530
university now is that actually a
 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.100
university now is that actually a
contentious statement what shouldn't be

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110
contentious statement what shouldn't be
 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.210
contentious statement what shouldn't be
a contentious statement it's

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220
a contentious statement it's
 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.890
a contentious statement it's
self-evident universities were actually

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900
self-evident universities were actually
 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.470
self-evident universities were actually
set up so that smart people could expand

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480
set up so that smart people could expand
 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.850
set up so that smart people could expand
their abilities that's why they were

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860
their abilities that's why they were
 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.130
their abilities that's why they were
there and you're selected on the basis

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140
there and you're selected on the basis
 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.540
there and you're selected on the basis
of assessments that are essentially

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550
of assessments that are essentially
 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.650
of assessments that are essentially
there to assess something like

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660
there to assess something like
 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:24.380
there to assess something like
intelligence yes but that will that's a

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390
intelligence yes but that will that's a
 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.290
intelligence yes but that will that's a
12 count Reversi is it reasonable and

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300
12 count Reversi is it reasonable and
 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.570
12 count Reversi is it reasonable and
this is a measurement issue and that's

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580
this is a measurement issue and that's
 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.800
this is a measurement issue and that's
why we're that's why I've been

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810
why we're that's why I've been
 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.270
why we're that's why I've been
instructing you to some degree in

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
instructing you to some degree in
 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.070
instructing you to some degree in
psychometrics because we actually know

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080
psychometrics because we actually know
 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.750
psychometrics because we actually know
how to do this we know how to answer

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760
how to do this we know how to answer
 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.909
how to do this we know how to answer
that question so let's take a look at

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919
that question so let's take a look at
 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.760
that question so let's take a look at
how at how intelligence has been

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770
how at how intelligence has been
 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.130
how at how intelligence has been
assessed and why and then you can make

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140
assessed and why and then you can make
 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.780
assessed and why and then you can make
up your own mind anyways here's some of

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790
up your own mind anyways here's some of
 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.690
up your own mind anyways here's some of
the examples of other forms of

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700
the examples of other forms of
 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.240
the examples of other forms of
intelligence and so then the question is

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
intelligence and so then the question is
 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.070
intelligence and so then the question is
well what does it mean to have a

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080
well what does it mean to have a
 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.870
well what does it mean to have a
different form of intelligence would

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880
different form of intelligence would
 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.240
different form of intelligence would
would form a inform B be completely

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250
would form a inform B be completely
 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.420
would form a inform B be completely
uncorrelated like extraversion say in

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430
uncorrelated like extraversion say in
 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.860
uncorrelated like extraversion say in
neuroticism or would they be slightly

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870
neuroticism or would they be slightly
 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.240
neuroticism or would they be slightly
correlated or would they be highly

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250
correlated or would they be highly
 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.860
correlated or would they be highly
correlated and then you might ask well

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870
correlated and then you might ask well
 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.870
correlated and then you might ask well
how highly correlated did they have to

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880
how highly correlated did they have to
 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.330
how highly correlated did they have to
be before they're the same thing

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340
be before they're the same thing
 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.640
be before they're the same thing
or how uncorrelated do they have to be

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
or how uncorrelated do they have to be
 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.200
or how uncorrelated do they have to be
before they're different things and

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210
before they're different things and
 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.210
before they're different things and
actually the answer to that comes down

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220
actually the answer to that comes down
 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.490
actually the answer to that comes down
to something like practical utility it's

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500
to something like practical utility it's
 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.469
to something like practical utility it's
like imagine I'm trying to figure out

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479
like imagine I'm trying to figure out
 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.630
like imagine I'm trying to figure out
how well you'll do in University and I

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640
how well you'll do in University and I
 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.880
how well you'll do in University and I
measure one thing and it's correlated at

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890
measure one thing and it's correlated at
 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.890
measure one thing and it's correlated at
0.7 with another thing I measure about

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900
0.7 with another thing I measure about
 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.750
0.7 with another thing I measure about
you then I might say well are those two

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760
you then I might say well are those two
 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.040
you then I might say well are those two
things the same or different they're

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050
things the same or different they're
 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.510
things the same or different they're
pretty highly correlated you're high in

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520
pretty highly correlated you're high in
 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.440
pretty highly correlated you're high in
one it means you're going to be high in

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450
one it means you're going to be high in
 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.590
one it means you're going to be high in
the other well so what is there any

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600
the other well so what is there any
 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.020
the other well so what is there any
utility in measuring both things and the

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030
utility in measuring both things and the
 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.820
utility in measuring both things and the
way you figure that out actually is you

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830
way you figure that out actually is you
 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.920
way you figure that out actually is you
do it statistically so we take the

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930
do it statistically so we take the
 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.570
do it statistically so we take the
target which might be

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580
target which might be
 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.879
target which might be
your performance across university and

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889
your performance across university and
 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.679
your performance across university and
then we say well can we predict your

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689
then we say well can we predict your
 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:47.929
then we say well can we predict your
performance across university better by

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:47.939
performance across university better by
 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.290
performance across university better by
using one variable or two variables so

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300
using one variable or two variables so
 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.580
using one variable or two variables so
we would enter them both into a

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590
we would enter them both into a
 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.260
we would enter them both into a
regression equation all a regression

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270
regression equation all a regression
 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.869
regression equation all a regression
equation does it's quite simple so

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879
equation does it's quite simple so
 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.760
equation does it's quite simple so
you're trying to predict the target and

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770
you're trying to predict the target and
 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.830
you're trying to predict the target and
the regression age the regression

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840
the regression age the regression
 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.140
the regression age the regression
equation tells you how well you can

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150
equation tells you how well you can
 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.890
equation tells you how well you can
predict that target if you know another

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900
predict that target if you know another
 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.929
predict that target if you know another
fact now then it gets a little

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939
fact now then it gets a little
 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:10.700
fact now then it gets a little
complicated because that's a correlation

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710
complicated because that's a correlation
 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.149

regression will say how much you can

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:16.409
regression will say how much you can
 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:20.719

predict C if you know a and B or a and B

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729
predict C if you know a and B or a and B
 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.309
predict C if you know a and B or a and B
and C and D and E because you can use

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319
and C and D and E because you can use
 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.559
and C and D and E because you can use
multiple predictors and you can weight

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:24.569
multiple predictors and you can weight
 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.020
multiple predictors and you can weight
them so it might be 2 times a plus 1

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030
them so it might be 2 times a plus 1
 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.300
them so it might be 2 times a plus 1
times B equals C and that's all a

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310
times B equals C and that's all a
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.649

straightforward and so two variables are

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460
straightforward and so two variables are
 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.610

you can use both of them simultaneously

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419
you can use both of them simultaneously
 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.200
you can use both of them simultaneously
to predict something of interest so

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210
to predict something of interest so
 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.300

across all the measures of these

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580
across all the measures of these
 

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.240
across all the measures of these
intelligences it's it's a proposition

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.250
intelligences it's it's a proposition
 

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.250
intelligences it's it's a proposition
it's not a fact you have to decide if

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260
it's not a fact you have to decide if
 

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.420
it's not a fact you have to decide if
you're going to agree with it but that

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:32.430
you're going to agree with it but that
 

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.280
you're going to agree with it but that
if you were going to do that you'd use a

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:34.290
if you were going to do that you'd use a
 

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.800
if you were going to do that you'd use a
factor analysis and you'd say well if

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:36.810
factor analysis and you'd say well if
 

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.960
factor analysis and you'd say well if
someone was more likely to be musical if

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:38.970
someone was more likely to be musical if
 

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.610
someone was more likely to be musical if
they were also high in linguistic

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620
they were also high in linguistic
 

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.860
they were also high in linguistic
ability and more likely to be logical

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:42.870
ability and more likely to be logical
 

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.480
ability and more likely to be logical
and mathematically inclined if they had

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:44.490
and mathematically inclined if they had
 

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.760
and mathematically inclined if they had
a high spatial ability etc then you'd be

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:46.770
a high spatial ability etc then you'd be
 

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.160
a high spatial ability etc then you'd be
hypothesizing that there was one factor

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.170
hypothesizing that there was one factor
 

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.440
hypothesizing that there was one factor
behind all of those manifestations that

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:51.450
behind all of those manifestations that
 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.780
behind all of those manifestations that
somehow similar and maybe there wouldn't

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:53.790
somehow similar and maybe there wouldn't
 

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.940
somehow similar and maybe there wouldn't
be and then you take all your measures

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:55.950
be and then you take all your measures
 

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.110
be and then you take all your measures
and you put them in something like a

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120
and you put them in something like a
 

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.000
and you put them in something like a
multiple regression analysis and you'd

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.010
multiple regression analysis and you'd
 

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.980
multiple regression analysis and you'd
predict your target University

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:00.990
predict your target University
 

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.020
predict your target University
performance and then maybe you'd say

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.030
performance and then maybe you'd say
 

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.790
performance and then maybe you'd say
well wait a minute let's not just use

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800
well wait a minute let's not just use
 

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.270
well wait a minute let's not just use
university performance let's use junior

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:08.280
university performance let's use junior
 

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.230
university performance let's use junior
high performance

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240
high performance
 

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.239
high performance
high school performance university

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:11.249
high school performance university
 

00:11:11.249 --> 00:11:13.759
high school performance university
performance and job success and then

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:13.769
performance and job success and then
 

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:15.799
performance and job success and then
let's say that the only things that

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:15.809
let's say that the only things that
 

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:17.480
let's say that the only things that
predict success across all of those

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:17.490
predict success across all of those
 

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.879
predict success across all of those
categories and that are the same we're

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:19.889
categories and that are the same we're
 

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:21.679
categories and that are the same we're
going to define as intelligence well

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:21.689
going to define as intelligence well
 

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:26.230
going to define as intelligence well
that's basically how you end up with IQ

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.790
you could say that IQ is what's common

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800
you could say that IQ is what's common
 

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.519
you could say that IQ is what's common
across all possible sets of intelligence

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:31.529
across all possible sets of intelligence
 

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:34.549
across all possible sets of intelligence
tests now people are going to debate

00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:34.559
tests now people are going to debate
 

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:38.210
tests now people are going to debate
that because you still have to define

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220
that because you still have to define
 

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.639
that because you still have to define
what constitutes a test but the way the

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:40.649
what constitutes a test but the way the
 

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:42.319
what constitutes a test but the way the
psychometricians have managed it and

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:42.329
psychometricians have managed it and
 

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:44.179
psychometricians have managed it and
have taken care of this at least to some

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:44.189
have taken care of this at least to some
 

00:11:44.189 --> 00:11:47.299
have taken care of this at least to some
degree is to say well we're going to

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:47.309
degree is to say well we're going to
 

00:11:47.309 --> 00:11:48.829
degree is to say well we're going to
we're not going to define everything

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839
we're not going to define everything
 

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:50.960
we're not going to define everything
that we measure as intelligence so

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:50.970
that we measure as intelligence so
 

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.759
that we measure as intelligence so
extroverted people are more socially

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:52.769
extroverted people are more socially
 

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:53.809
extroverted people are more socially
fluent are we gonna call that

00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:53.819
fluent are we gonna call that
 

00:11:53.819 --> 00:11:56.119
fluent are we gonna call that
intelligence no we're gonna call that

00:11:56.119 --> 00:11:56.129
intelligence no we're gonna call that
 

00:11:56.129 --> 00:11:57.350
intelligence no we're gonna call that
personality we're going to call that

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360
personality we're going to call that
 

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.269
personality we're going to call that
extraversion and we're gonna call stress

00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279
extraversion and we're gonna call stress
 

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:02.179
extraversion and we're gonna call stress
tolerance you could say well if you can

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:02.189
tolerance you could say well if you can
 

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:03.379
tolerance you could say well if you can
tolerate more stress you're more

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:03.389
tolerate more stress you're more
 

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.179
tolerate more stress you're more
intelligent it's like well no that isn't

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:05.189
intelligent it's like well no that isn't
 

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:07.100
intelligent it's like well no that isn't
how we've defined it we're gonna define

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.110
how we've defined it we're gonna define
 

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.619
how we've defined it we're gonna define
that as being lower in neuroticism if

00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:09.629
that as being lower in neuroticism if
 

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:10.939
that as being lower in neuroticism if
your cooperative you're more intelligent

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:10.949
your cooperative you're more intelligent
 

00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:13.460
your cooperative you're more intelligent
that's emotional intelligence well what

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:13.470
that's emotional intelligence well what
 

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.960
that's emotional intelligence well what
you're less intelligent if you're

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:14.970
you're less intelligent if you're
 

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.660
you're less intelligent if you're
competitive well no so we've parsed that

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:17.670
competitive well no so we've parsed that
 

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.249
competitive well no so we've parsed that
off to agreeableness so then the

00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:19.259
off to agreeableness so then the
 

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:21.230
off to agreeableness so then the
question might be is there anything left

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240
question might be is there anything left
 

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.019
question might be is there anything left
of these so-called intelligences once

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:24.029
of these so-called intelligences once
 

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.720
of these so-called intelligences once
you control for personality and IQ and

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:26.730
you control for personality and IQ and
 

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:31.249
you control for personality and IQ and
the answer is no nothing nothing left of

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:31.259
the answer is no nothing nothing left of
 

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:33.199
the answer is no nothing nothing left of
them and the people who keep pushing

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:33.209
them and the people who keep pushing
 

00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:34.970
them and the people who keep pushing
these ideas keep trying to push them

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:34.980
these ideas keep trying to push them
 

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.710
these ideas keep trying to push them
because they don't like the idea of real

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720
because they don't like the idea of real
 

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.720
because they don't like the idea of real
individual differences and to me that's

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:38.730
individual differences and to me that's
 

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.189
individual differences and to me that's
just a matter of sticking your damn head

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199
just a matter of sticking your damn head
 

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:43.220
just a matter of sticking your damn head
in the sand because it's obvious here

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.230
in the sand because it's obvious here
 

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.470
in the sand because it's obvious here
you're gonna have a child you want the

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480
you're gonna have a child you want the
 

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.160
you're gonna have a child you want the
child to have an IQ of 65 or 145 decide

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.170
child to have an IQ of 65 or 145 decide
 

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.530
child to have an IQ of 65 or 145 decide
okay so you're all gonna vote okay you

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540
okay so you're all gonna vote okay you
 

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.910
okay so you're all gonna vote okay you
think any one of you is gonna vote to

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920
think any one of you is gonna vote to
 

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.889
think any one of you is gonna vote to
have a child with an IQ of 65 that

00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899
have a child with an IQ of 65 that
 

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.169
have a child with an IQ of 65 that
child's gonna have a hard time

00:12:56.169 --> 00:12:56.179
child's gonna have a hard time
 

00:12:56.179 --> 00:12:58.579
child's gonna have a hard time
developing even linguistic ability

00:12:58.579 --> 00:12:58.589
developing even linguistic ability
 

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:00.280
developing even linguistic ability
they're never going to learn to read

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:00.290
they're never going to learn to read
 

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.139
they're never going to learn to read
right they're never gonna leave home in

00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:03.149
right they're never gonna leave home in
 

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:03.949
right they're never gonna leave home in
all likelihood

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959
all likelihood
 

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:05.199
all likelihood
so which child are you going to pick

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:05.209
so which child are you going to pick
 

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:07.400
so which child are you going to pick
well so do you believe in intelligence

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:07.410
well so do you believe in intelligence
 

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.499
well so do you believe in intelligence
or not well obviously if you have any

00:13:09.499 --> 00:13:09.509
or not well obviously if you have any
 

00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:11.749
or not well obviously if you have any
sense
