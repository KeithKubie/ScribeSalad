00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.420
The general idea is that if we have observations

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.430
over time, we can facet by the primary unit, case,

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.540
or individual in the data set. For our yogurt data

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.750
it was the households we were faceting over. This faceted

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.350
time series plot is something we can't generate with

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.070
our pseudo Facebook data set. Since we don't have data

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.780
on our sample of users over time. Let's get back

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.310
to that plot to see that limitation. The Facebook data

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.140
isn't great for examining the process of friending over time.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.750
The data set is just a cross section, it's just

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.390
one snapshot at a fixed point that tells us the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.810
characteristics of individuals. Not the individuals over, say, a year.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.700
But if we had a dataset like the yogurt one,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.810
we would be able to track friendships initiated over time

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.520
and compare that with tenure. This would give us better

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.630
evidence to explain the difference or the drop in friendships

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.840
initiated over time as tenure increases.
