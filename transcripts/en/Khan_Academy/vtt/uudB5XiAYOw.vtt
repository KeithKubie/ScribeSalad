00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:01.636
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.636 --> 00:00:04.396
is continue our journey
trying to understand

00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:06.923
what the expected value
and what the variance

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:10.199
of a binomial variable is going to be

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.692
or what the expected value or the variance

00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:14.476
of a binominal distribution is going to be

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:18.171
which is just the distribution
of a binomial variable.

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:19.810
And so, like in the last video

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.025
I have this binomial variable X

00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:23.653
that's defined in a very general sense.

00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:26.405
It's the number of
successes from N trials,

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:27.919
so it's a finite number of trials

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.662
where the probability of
success is equal to P,

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:33.334
so the probability is
constant across the trials

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:36.341
for each of these independent trials,

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:38.266
so the probability of success in one trial

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.262
is not dependent on what
happened in the other rials.

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:44.371
And we also talked in that previous video

00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:46.311
where we talked about the expected value

00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:48.739
of this binomial variable

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.859
we said hey, it could be viewed

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.452
that this binomial variable

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.857
can be viewed as the sum

00:00:53.857 --> 00:00:56.426
of N of what you could really consider

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:58.246
to be a Bernoulli variable here.

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.675
So, this variable, this random variable Y,

00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:02.299
the probability that's equal to one,

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.006
you could do that as a
success is equal to P.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:06.249
The probability that it's a failure

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:09.655
that Y is equal to zero is one minus P,

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:13.410
so you could view Y, the outcome of Y

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.027
or whether Y is one or zero

00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:17.016
is really whether we had a success or not

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:18.402
in each of these trials,

00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:19.890
so if you add up N Ys,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.601
then you are going to get X

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.373
and we use that information to figure out

00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:27.245
what the expected value
of X is going to be

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:28.804
because the expected value of Y

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:31.956
is pretty straightforward
to directly compute.

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:33.529
Expected value of Y

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:35.607
is just the probability weighted outcomes.

00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:37.274
So, it's P times one

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.583
plus one minus P,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.090
one minus P, times zero, times zero.

00:01:48.306 --> 00:01:50.433
This whole term's gonna be zero

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:53.380
and so, the expected value
of Y is really just P

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.550
and so, if you said the
expected value of X,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.038
well, that's just going to be,

00:01:57.038 --> 00:01:58.158
let me just write it over here,

00:01:58.158 --> 00:01:59.064
this is all review,

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:02.481
we could say that the expected value of X

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:06.595
is just going to be equal to,

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:08.392
we know from our expected value properties

00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:11.084
that it's going to be equal to the sum

00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:13.394
of the expected values of these N Ys,

00:02:13.394 --> 00:02:15.394
or you could say it is N

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.010
times the expected value,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.264
times the expected value of Y,

00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:23.345
the expected value of Y is P,

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:26.845
so this is going to be equal to N times P.

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:30.917
Now, we're gonna do the same idea

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.005
to figure out what the variance of X

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:34.833
is going to be equal to

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.771
because we could see, we know
from our variance properties,

00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:38.979
you can't do this with standard deviation

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:40.604
but you could do it with variance

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:41.964
and then once you figure out the variance,

00:02:41.964 --> 00:02:42.797
you just take the square root

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:44.420
for the standard deviation,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.394
the variance of X is similarly

00:02:47.394 --> 00:02:51.352
going to be the sum of the
variances of these N Ys.

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:54.310
So, it's gonna be similarly N

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.143
times the variance, N
times the variance of Y.

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:04.722
So, this all boils down to
what is the variance of Y

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:06.083
going to be equal be?

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:07.770
So, let me scroll over a little bit,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.417
get a little bit of more real estate

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:13.000
and I will figure that
out right over here.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:19.350
Alright, so we wanna figure
out the variance of Y,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.683
so variance of Y

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.074
is going to be equal to what?

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:26.247
Well, here it's going
to be the probability

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:30.405
squared distances from the expected value.

00:03:30.405 --> 00:03:32.905
So, we have a probability of P

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:38.236
where what is going to
be our squared distance

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:40.116
from the expected value?

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:43.295
Well, we're going to get a
one with a probability of P,

00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:45.383
so in that case our distance from the mean

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:48.148
or from the expected value, we're at one,

00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:49.603
the expected value we already know

00:03:49.603 --> 00:03:50.770
is equal to P,

00:03:52.672 --> 00:03:55.124
so that's that for that possible outcome,

00:03:55.124 --> 00:03:57.868
the squared distance times
its probability weight

00:03:57.868 --> 00:03:59.356
and then we have,

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:00.867
actually let me scroll over,

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:01.989
well, I'll just do it right over here,

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.489
plus we have a probability of one minus P,

00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:10.908
one minus P for the
other possible outcome,

00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:11.741
so in that outcome

00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:12.908
we are at zero

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.877
and the difference between
zero and our expected value?

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:19.383
Well, that's just going to be zero minus P

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:23.550
and once again we are going
to square that quantity

00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:27.921
and so, this is the expression
for the variance of Y

00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:29.540
and we can simplify it a little bit.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.496
So, this is all going to be equal to,

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:35.079
so, P times one minus P squared

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.657
and then is just going to be P squared

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:40.138
times one minus P

00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:42.805
plus P squared times one minus P

00:04:44.264 --> 00:04:48.933
and let's see, we can factor
out a P times one minus P,

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:50.352
so what is that going to be left with?

00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:52.686
So, if we factor out a P
times one minus P here,

00:04:52.686 --> 00:04:55.569
we're just going to be
left with a one minus P

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.586
and if we factor out a P
times one minus P here,

00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:02.686
we're just going to have a plus P.

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:04.453
These two cancel out.

00:05:04.453 --> 00:05:06.480
This is just this whole
thing is just a one.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.815
So, you're left with P times one minus P

00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:12.140
which is indeed the variance
for a binomial variable.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.346
We actually proved that in other videos.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.144
I guess it doesn't hurt to see it again

00:05:15.144 --> 00:05:15.977
but there you have.

00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:18.580
We know what the variance of Y is.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.993
It is P times one minus P

00:05:20.993 --> 00:05:24.494
and the variance of X is just
N times the variance of Y,

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:27.213
so there we go, we deserve
a little bit of a drum roll,

00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:30.616
the variance of X is equal to N

00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:32.783
times P times one minus P.

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:36.661
So, if we were to take
the concrete example

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.209
of the last video

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:40.831
where if I were to take 10 free throws,

00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:44.068
so each trial is a shot, is a free throw,

00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:45.796
so if I were to take 10 free throws

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:49.676
and my probability of success is 0.3,

00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:52.107
I have a 30% free throw percentage,

00:05:52.107 --> 00:05:54.536
the variance that I would expect to see,

00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:56.869
so in that case the variance

00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:00.425
if X is the number of free throws

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:03.177
I make after these 10 shots,

00:06:03.177 --> 00:06:05.010
my variance will be 10

00:06:06.818 --> 00:06:07.651
times 0.3,

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.909
0.3 times one minus 0.3,

00:06:14.422 --> 00:06:15.589
so 0.7 and so,

00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:19.676
that would be what?

00:06:19.676 --> 00:06:23.982
This right over, so this
would be equal to 10

00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:26.399
times .3 times .7 times 0.21,

00:06:29.434 --> 00:06:32.711
so my variance in this situation

00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:35.044
is going to be equal to 2.1.

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:37.962
Is equal to 2.1

00:06:39.637 --> 00:06:42.122
and if I wanted to figure
out the standard deviation

00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:43.349
of this right over here,

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.152
I would just take the square root of this,

00:06:45.152 --> 00:06:46.273
so if we want the standard deviation,

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:47.331
just take the square root

00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:49.898
of this expression right over here.
