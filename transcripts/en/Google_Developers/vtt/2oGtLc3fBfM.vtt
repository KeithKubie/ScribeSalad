LAURENCE MORONEY: Smart
Lock for Passwords

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.590
is a great technology
that lets you

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.510
sign in only once across
all of your devices.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.040
Today I'm meeting with Steven
Soneff of the Google Identity

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.090
Platform to learn more about it.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.900
And Stephen, you're the product
manager for the Google Identity

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.820
Platform, right?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.070
Sounds like you work on some
pretty cool technologies.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.720
STEVEN SONEFF:
Yeah that's right.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.530
So I'm product manager for
all of our APIs and services

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.690
that we provide to third
parties around security

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.520
and authentication, basically
knowing who their users are

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.520
and helping them get
signed in and signed up

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.570
as easily as possible.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.903
LAURENCE MORONEY: Important job.

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:35.200
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah, exactly.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: So I know you
wrote this blog post recently

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.061
about Smart Lock for Passwords.

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.600
Could you tell us a little bit
about that, and what it is,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.145
and what's so great about it?

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:43.430
STEVEN SONEFF: Sure.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.263
So Smart Lock is one
of our recent additions

00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:46.600
to the set of APIs we offer.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.990
It came out last
year at Google I/O,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.660
basically functionality
to save and retrieve

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.380
information about how people
sign in to a third-party app.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.190
So if you use an
app like Netflix,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.051
you can save your log in
information either from Chrome,

00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:00.550
if you've saved
your password there,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.224
or next time you
sign into the app.

00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:03.640
And then retrieve
it when you come

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.170
back so that if you
have a new phone,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.860
you don't have to remember that
username or password anywhere.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, cool.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.180
And so if I've
signed in in Chrome,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.270
it will remember it when
I sign in on my phone?

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.030
STEVEN SONEFF: Exactly.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.654
So any information
you save with Google

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:15.575
can help you sign in
as easily as possible.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:15.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.520
Now I see you have a
demo lined up there.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.780
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah, so let's
actually see how it works.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.370
So typically, when
you're trying to log

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.740
into an app like Netflix, you'll
see a username and password

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.410
field like that.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.711
You have to enter your
username, your password.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.210
You have to remember
what those are,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.430
which can be pretty tricky
if you signed up a year ago.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.846
But now the idea
is that if you're

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:36.040
using one of the Smart Lock
APIs, you can restart the app.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.990
Pretend this is a
brand-new install now.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.100
And instead of having to
reenter that information,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.790
you see this screen,
which is basically

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.200
explaining to the user their
saved information has been used

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.917
to help log them in,
even automatically,

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.000
without ever having to
remember what that username

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.666
and password is.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.390
And with that, you're in.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.137
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really neat.

00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:55.470
Like you can see kids out there.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.930
So if I'm sharing an
account with my kids,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.900
I can do that also?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.400
STEVEN SONEFF: Exactly.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.000
So yeah, it will work
for anyone who has

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.250
access to that Google account.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.041
So that if you've got
even a shared device,

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:04.952
it will be a completely
seamless experience.

00:02:04.952 --> 00:02:05.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.220
And now I heard you're also
working on tokenizing this

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.990
so that it's your actual Google
Account on the devices used.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.470
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah, so
you mentioned the blog post

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.360
that we had recently.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.060
And so the blog post talks about
not just saving and retrieving

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.720
things like passwords, but
actually going beyond passwords

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.290
and going over to
token-based authentication.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.020
That if you basically use
something like the Gmail

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.530
address on your
device as the account

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.060
for your third-party
apps or your sites,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.330
that we can retrieve
information about that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.800
when you're signed in on this
device with that account.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.210
And if you're already
signed in, then there's

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.010
no need to enter
passwords manually

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.130
to your third-party apps.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.090
They can check that
it's actually you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.840
and save the password entry,
and maybe even sign you up

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.030
with just one tap.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.760
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really cool.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.330
Now if I'm a developer, if I'm
building an app like this one

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.700
that you just showed
me, what kind of things

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.110
do I need to do to take
advantage of the Smart Lock

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.694
for Passwords?

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:55.901
STEVEN SONEFF: So starting
point is just checking out

00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:58.690
developers.google.com/identity
and going into the Smart Lock

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.592
section there.

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:02.050
And what you'll see is that
it's a pretty simple interface.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.910
You can save information and
you can retrieve information.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.450
There's an additional
API method to show

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.320
a picker, like an email picker
that can help fill a sign up

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.180
form really easily.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.040
With one tap you'll get
name and picture and email

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.570
address all filled in.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.490
And then if you can
save that information,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.660
even use the token to skip
things like email verification

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.690
or password entry.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.220
It could make it a very
smooth experience in your app.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
not just smooth, right?

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.850
It can also help
make it more secure?

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.400
Because I know when I've
gone on to various sites

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.705
or various apps and I need
to sign up, and sometimes

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:34.830
there's a lot of information
that I need to put in.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.900
But if they were implementing
something like this,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.430
they can get the best
of knowing that I

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.450
am who I say that I
am when I sign up,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.420
but I'm also more secure
and not giving out

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.530
personal information
to a third-party when

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.200
I don't need to.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.930
Is that right?

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.138
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:51.580
So we're really moving toward
this model of basically only

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.080
providing the essential
information at the time

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.210
that someone is
signing up, and trying

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.830
to ask for more information
later, kind of in context

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.120
when it's most relevant,
so the user has the most

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.910
control over what
they're providing

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.300
to the third-party apps.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.751
When it is provided,
we're hoping

00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:07.750
to provide it in the form
of these tokens, which

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.020
can be verified
and authenticated,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.860
and ensuring that it's only that
person and not just somebody

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.852
who knows the password who's
trying to access the account.

00:04:15.852 --> 00:04:18.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: And then
also if the particular app

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.663
needs to do things that require
incremental authorization,

00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:22.204
like I don't know,
accessing my Drive

00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:24.541
or Calendar, that's something
that the API also offers,

00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:25.040
right?

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.665
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah,
so that's actually

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.630
offered as part of a
broader set of APIs

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.870
around logging in
with Google Services.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.010
In the same place,
developers.google.com/identity,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.440
check out how you can integrate
all the Google APIs that are

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.980
out there into your
app or services.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we
found-- I don't remember

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.480
the exact figures right now.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.190
Maybe you do.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.470
But we found that when
people implement auth

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.760
like this instead of
rolling their own auth,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.227
that the actual user retention
is much greater, right?

00:04:51.227 --> 00:04:52.060
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.101
So typically what we found
in some of the studies

00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.970
we've done is that if someone
sees a sign in screen,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.610
in the order of half of people
will not complete it or not

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.470
complete it correctly, anything
from a forgotten password

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.740
to creating a duplicate account.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.290
And by saving this information
so that when they come back,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.770
you can really
reduce those errors

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.020
and make it much more impactful,
that all the downloads that you

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.851
get on your app can
be made to good use.

00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:14.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.650
So by implementing this
properly, for users

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.460
it's more secure and
it's more convenient.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.001
And then for developers
it also helps

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:22.210
you retain your users, right?

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.417
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:25.480
The Netflix example,
we did a case study

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.510
with them recently
saying that in the order

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.000
of 20% of their cost for
support about password

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.884
recoveries and account
recoveries has been--

00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:33.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.490
Just wiped out.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.760
STEVEN SONEFF: Yeah, exactly,
reduced by using these APIs.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.302
And looks promising
for the future,

00:05:39.302 --> 00:05:41.510
that it could be even better
with things like tokens.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: Pretty cool.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.245
So to get started,
developers.google.com/identity.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.036
STEVEN SONEFF: Yep.

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:47.500
That's right.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.223
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, awesome.

00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:49.130
Well, thank you, Steven.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.900
STEVEN SONEFF: Well,
thank you, Lawrence.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.650
And I have something for you.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, swag.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.880
I always love swag.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.171
STEVEN SONEFF: You've been
doing all of this great work

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:58.000
recently with the Identity team,
we have here a hoodie for you

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.042
from the Google Authentication
and Security team.

00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:01.958
LAURENCE MORONEY: Google
Authentication, nice.

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.064
Well, thank you, Steven.

00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:05.480
I'll be sure to wear this at
my next Google [? Hangout. ?]

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.700
So thanks a lot, Steven.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.520
I really appreciate the
time that you spent with us.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.200
