00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.560
Most of what we do early on
when we first learn about

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.720
calculus is to use limits.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.440
We use limits to figure out
derivatives of functions.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.800
In fact, the definition
of a derivative uses

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.120
the notion of a limit.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.030
It's a slope around the point
as we take the limit of

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.390
points closer and closer
to the point in question.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.110
And you've seen that many,
many, many times over.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.790
In this video I guess we're
going to do it in the

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.630
opposite direction.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.130
We're going to use derivatives
to figure out limits.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.360
And in particular, limits that
end up in indeterminate form.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.550
And when I say by indeterminate
form I mean that when we just

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.550
take the limit as it is, we end
up with something like 0/0, or

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.450
infinity over infinity, or
negative infinity over

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.870
infinity, or maybe negative
infinity over negative

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.330
infinity, or positive infinity
over negative infinity.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.190
All of these are indeterminate,
undefined forms.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.290
And to do that we're going
to use l'Hopital's rule.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.490
And in this video I'm just
going to show you what

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.010
l'Hoptial's rule says and how
to apply it because it's fairly

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.480
straightforward, and it's
actually a very useful tool

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.510
sometimes if you're in some
type of a math competition and

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.270
they ask you to find a
difficult limit that when you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.310
just plug the numbers in you
get something like this.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.270
L'Hopital's rule is normally
what they are testing you for.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.290
And in a future video I might
prove it, but that gets a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.975
little bit more involved.

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:44.870
The application is actually
reasonably straightforward.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.780
So what l'Hopital's rule tells
us that if we have-- and I'll

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.940
do it in abstract form first,
but I think when I show you

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.080
the example it will
all be made clear.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:11.050
That if the limit as x roaches
c of f of x is equal to 0, and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:20.100
the limit as x approaches c of
g of x is equal to 0, and-- and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:30.620
this is another and-- and the
limit as x approaches c of f

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.160
prime of x over g prime of
x exists and it equals L.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.600
then-- so all of these
conditions have to be met.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.050
This is the indeterminate
form of 0/0, so this

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.560
is the first case.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:55.380
Then we can say that the
limit as x approaches c of

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.070
f of x over g of x is also
going to be equal to L.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.810
So this might seem a little bit
bizarre to you right now, and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.220
I'm actually going to write the
other case, and then

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.750
I'll do an example.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.710
We'll do multiple examples
and the examples are going

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.580
to make it all clear.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.040
So this is the first case and
the example we're going to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.650
do is actually going to be
an example of this case.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.390
Now the other case is if the
limit as x approaches c of f of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.960
x is equal to positive or
negative infinity, and the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.470
limit as x approaches c of g of
x is equal to positive or

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.280
negative infinity, and the
limit of I guess you could say

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.220
the quotient of the derivatives
exists, and the limit as x

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.200
approaches c of f prime of x
over g prime of x

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.410
is equal to L.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.860
Then we can make this
same statement again.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.070
Let me just copy that out.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.220
Edit, copy, and then
let me paste it.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.450
So in either of these two
situations just to kind of make

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.520
sure you understand what you're
looking at, this is the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.300
situation where if you just
tried to evaluate this limit

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.880
right here you're going to
get f of c, which is 0.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.990
Or the limit as x approaches c
of f of x over the limit as

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.480
x approaches c of g of x.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.550
That's going to give you 0/0.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.440
And so you say, hey, I don't
know what that limit is?

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.600
But this says, well, look.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.440
If this limit exists, I could
take the derivative of each

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.020
of these functions and then
try to evaluate that limit.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.220
And if I get a number, if that
exists, then they're going

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.980
to be the same limit.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.710
This is a situation where when
we take the limit we get

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.060
infinity over infinity, or
negative infinity or positive

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.070
infinity over positive
or negative infinity.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.030
So these are the two
indeterminate forms.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.410
And to make it all clear let
me just show you an example

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.610
because I think this will make
things a lot more clear.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.910
So let's say we are trying
to find the limit-- I'll

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.610
do this in a new color.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.830
Let me do it in this
purplish color.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.420
Let's say we wanted to find
the limit as x approaches

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.160
0 of sine of x over x.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.430
Now if we just view this, if we
just try to evaluate it at 0 or

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.410
take the limit as we approach 0
in each of these functions,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.180
we're going to get something
that looks like 0/0.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.370
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.620
Or the limit as x approaches
0 of sine of x is 0.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.120
And obviously, as x approaches
0 of x, that's also

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.140
going to be 0.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.100
So this is our
indeterminate form.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.180
And if you want to think about
it, this is our f of x, that

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.240
f of x right there
is the sine of x.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.510
And our g of x, this g of
x right there for this

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.070
first case, is the x.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:07.170
g of x is equal to x and f
of x is equal to sine of x.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.130
And notice, well, we definitely
know that this meets the

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.520
first two constraints.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.970
The limit as x, and in
this case, c is 0.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.540
The limit as x approaches 0 of
sine of sine of x is 0, and

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.030
the limit as x approaches
0 of x is also equal to 0.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.180
So we get our
indeterminate form.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.340
So let's see, at least, whether
this limit even exists.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.100
If we take the derivative of f
of x and we put that over the

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.900
derivative of g of x, and take
the limit as x approaches 0

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.400
in this case, that's our c.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.530
Let's see if this limit exists.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.600
So I'll do that in the blue.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.160
So let me write the derivatives
of the two functions.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.720
So f prime of x.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.590
If f of x is sine of x,
what's f prime of x?

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.480
Well, it's just cosine of x.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.390
You've learned that many times.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.215
And if g of x is x,
what is g prime of x?

00:07:01.215 --> 00:07:02.150
That's super easy.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.280
The derivative of x is just 1.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.690
Let's try to take the limit as
x approaches 0 of f prime of x

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.000
over g prime of x-- over
their derivatives.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.390
So that's going to be the
limit as x approaches 0

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:25.620
of cosine of x over 1.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.650
I wrote that 1 a
little strange.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.170
And this is pretty
straightforward.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.990
What is this going to be?

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.610
Well, as x approaches 0
of cosine of x, that's

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.290
going to be equal to 1.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.320
And obviously, the limit as
x approaches 0 of 1, that's

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.900
also going to be equal to 1.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.470
So in this situation we just
saw that the limit as x

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.820
approaches-- our c
in this case is 0.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.590
As x approaches 0 of f
prime of x over g prime

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.240
of x is equal to 1.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.060
This limit exists and it
equals 1, so we've met

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.580
all of the conditions.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.500
This is the case
we're dealing with.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.700
Limit as x approaches 0 of
sine of x is equal to 0.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.650
Limit as z approaches 0
of x is also equal to 0.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.500
The limit of the derivative of
sine of x over the derivative

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.490
of x, which is cosine of x over
1-- we found this

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.000
to be equal to 1.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.610
All of these top conditions
are met, so then we know

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.480
this must be the case.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.500
That the limit as x approaches
0 of sine of x over x

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.690
must be equal to 1.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:42.510
It must be the same limit as
this value right here where we

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.120
take the derivative of the
f of x and of the g of x.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.430
I'll do more examples in the
next few videos and I think

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.760
it'll make it a lot
more concrete.
