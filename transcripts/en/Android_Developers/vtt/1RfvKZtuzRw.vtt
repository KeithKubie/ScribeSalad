HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I'm Yoshi.

00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm head of the Japan's
Business Development.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.039
And also, I'm leading the
Go Global project as well.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:15.790
So today, as we talk about the
Google Play is a great place

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.470
to distribute your
applications, then you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.630
can choose whatever you want.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.630
Like, publish your
application to everywhere.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.620
But today, I would like to
discuss about the framework

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.430
of the Go Global.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.440
It's more like I make the
framework on this slide.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.735
Then I would like to
explain about each section,

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:46.560
about what we need to
think about to go global.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.350
Then, after I explain the
Go Global framework, then

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.970
today, we invited the
gorgeous panelists today.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.180
Then let's ask them about
their Go Global strategies.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.540
All right, let's move on.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.340
So first of all, select
the right market.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.060
This is the most important
work for your strategy.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.870
So we define the market,
established market,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.610
like, we call matured market.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.410
Also the Rising Stars
Market, which we call,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.000
like, emerging market.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.150
So for instance, the
established market

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.890
is US, Japan, Korea, Taiwan.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.210
So they have many
the specific stuff.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.900
But it's one thing, is there's
the high ARPPU users in there.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.846
Then Rising Stars market
is monetize is through ads,

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:50.320
compared with the US and
Japan, their monetizing

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.350
is not that much.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.140
But the user base
is going grow fast.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.940
And also, the install base
is pretty growing fast.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.110
So we separated two categories.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.240
And also, each market
is different phase.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.450
For instance, US has a different
face, like, different users,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.330
preference, in Japan, also.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.150
Korea has also the difference.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.110
So segmented, it's different.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.570
Also, each country, also,
they are different faces.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.360
So let's see it at each market.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.890
For instance,
like, Japan market.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.960
So this is a top
ranking of Japan.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.600
Then it looks like all
most Japanese [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.010
are in the top ranking.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.420
Then Super [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.040
Then it seems like cute icon
is popular in the Japan market.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.660
Then probably you put the
cute icons or cute characters

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.380
on the UI icons.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.470
That would be good for
the Japanese users.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.780
Then go to the Korea market.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.070
Then seems like more
western developers

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.220
doing good on the top ranking.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.990
Also, some cute characters.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.960
But also, some serious
guys in top ranking.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.480
That's the Korea market.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.090
Then let's move on
to emerging market.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.200
So this is Brazil.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.530
So it seems like it's more
like western developers

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.750
doing very well in
the Brazil market.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.920
And seems like "Clash
of Clans" and also

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.480
"Clash of Kings" and "Summoners"
as well, is doing well.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.530
So that was kind
of like PvP stuff.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.780
And also the import
market seems like.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.510
So this is the Brazil market.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.350
Then this is Indonesia.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.030
It seems like similar
with the Brazil market.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.920
But we can see more cute
characters, cute icons on here.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.716
So it's more mixed
market, we can say.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.805
I understand that those
markets stuff, then,

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:16.275
are decided where should
we go to the market.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.040
So that's the select
the right market.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.230
Then, next move on the
plan your approach.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.240
So once you decided to go to
specific market like Japan,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.810
or Korea, then you
need to figure out

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.730
how to fit that market.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.500
So you should go with original
titles, original graphics,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.800
go to that market.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.570
Or change your graphics
to go to that market.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.960
So that's the decisions
make you need.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.920
But this is Asian taste
and Western taste.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.970
So Asian taste is more
cute and a complicated UI,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.350
but more efficient.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.820
And then [INAUDIBLE] more.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.160
And then western taste is
more like a landscape and more

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.480
simple UI's.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.350
This is on a game.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.590
Also, with the material
design, also, there

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.410
are group feed in everywhere.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:23.020
So you need to localize
on your services.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.710
But design wise, you don't
need to figure out that much.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.950
Use the material design.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.210
That's more efficient.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.720
Then move on the next,
localize your applications.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.970
Then don't just translate.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.340
So this is most
important part as well.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:51.110
So we defined a level one, two,
three, on the localizations.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.280
So level one is just simple.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.980
Just go to the marker.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.010
Just quick, check
your application

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.360
to publish to those market.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.720
Then see how does it work?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.470
Then level two is
more go more local.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.690
So for instance, like,
change your descriptions

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.410
in the local languages.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.600
Change your screenshot.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.570
Or change the icons
to the market.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.750
Then change your
applications [? text ?]

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.810
in the local languages.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.030
So that's at level two.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.260
Then level three is go native.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.400
They are more like
local relevant contents.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.790
So for instance, put their
local relevant contents

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.970
in the UI application.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.852
Like with Japanese
characters or Koreans

00:06:38.852 --> 00:06:41.940
or event in that level three.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.210
Then get more thinking
about their local users.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.820
Then so that level is
level one, two, three.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.880
So you can step up to level
one, to level two, level three.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.162
Or you can go through level
three direct from nothing.

00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:11.050
But we're inclined to check
your localized description.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.920
Where is the native-check?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.000
So if you don't
have a native-check,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.580
from the local users, then
looks like this kind of stuff.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.480
So graphics, OK.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.210
Sounds like great.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.950
But localizations, it
seems like question mark.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.900
So that's from the
local user's point.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.230
So we recommend to use the
native-check on that side.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.430
Then make more graphic,
sounds, and localalisation.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.090
It's great.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.645
So that's a metaphor.

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:52.100
But that's looks like
from the local users.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.490
Then this is my
recommendations to the stores.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.970
So I supply the store listing.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.400
Also, they're in-app games.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.810
And this is Japan's,
Korea's, Taiwan, Hong Kong,

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.250
Brazil, Indonesia.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.740
So we recommended the
language is what we need

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.040
to localize in for the users.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.570
So this is one opinion from me.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.240
But this is too obvious.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.975
But make sure you are
going to that market.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:35.559
Then localize the success
[? store ?] is the Musicmatch.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.980
So they localized.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.740
We discuss a lot, in Japan
market, about a Japan market.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.460
Then they changed the
video trailer titles, then

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.670
icon, description.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.600
Also the key images
on the screen shot.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.800
They put the local talent
and then local contents.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.440
Then put the local languages
in their screen shot.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.780
Then they got a
ranking number one

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.820
in the music category
in Japan from 50.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.886
Also, it's not only
for localization.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:16.880
Also, I recommend to think
about the connectivity

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.050
in each market.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.590
If you want to go
to emerging market,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.800
then you need to figure out
the connection speed as well.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.580
So for instance, APK
size might be smaller.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.880
It's more good for
those emerging market.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.800
Then after the download
and contents file size,

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.320
or data friendly, and then
also, the local pricing.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.490
As Tim [INAUDIBLE] mention that.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:48.110
So those kind of KPI
we need to figure out

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.650
If you want to go to
the emerging market.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.910
So support local users.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.630
So it's more easy.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.110
But support local users
in the local languages.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:06.400
That's an important
fact to go local market.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.500
So this is the Korean developers
replying to users in Japanese.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:17.180
This is important
for going global.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.360
Then launch, test and iterate.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:27.130
So as we talk about like,
experiments, A/B testing,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.040
then acquisition channel
and also localizations.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.690
This is like, keep
continue to doing.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.320
So keep continue to improving.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.020
So this loop is important
for the Go Global as well.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.130
So this is a good
example for the arts.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.920
So they did their experiments
on our Play Developer console.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.610
Then we need an icon as the more
simple ones than 41% increase

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.420
of the download.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.040
And also, this is
the game screenshot.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.880
Then before they tried a simple
type of their screenshot.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.756
Then they got good
numbers of the improved.

00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:18.090
So that's the experiments is
important things for checking

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.590
on their localizations or
localized of the US screenshot

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.050
in the Go Global strategies.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.930
So this is before,
after, finally.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:34.820
So they put all good improved
the numbers of the result.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.670
Then they changed their
screenshot in the after.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.630
So leverage our
local market experts.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.620
We have several
peoples in this venue.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.830
So please reach out those guys.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.180
Then ask your strategy stuff.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.170
Right.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.770
So that's my presentations.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.880
Then

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]
