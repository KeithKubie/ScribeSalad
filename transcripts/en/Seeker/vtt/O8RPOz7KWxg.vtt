00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.909
You'd think you walk around remembering all
the hotties, but in fact?

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.359
What you really remember are the uggos.

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.040
[[MUSIC]]

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.690
Hey peeps, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.299
When your brain sees a face, what does it
do?

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.980
It first has to notice it's looking at a face,
using the bits of a face and putting them

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.900
together it attempts to recognize it and gauge
its level of attractiveness.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.810
From there we decide if we want to remember
that face or not -- all in a split second.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.829
Most people would agree, Angelina Jolie has
an attractive face.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.829
She has evenly spaced, large eyes; full lips
and her features are properly sized and placed

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.430
on her face in a generally symmetrical way.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.050
Obviously, attractive faces are great // *smile*
// but science has unexpectedly revealed our

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.670
brains remember imperfect faces BETTER than
the beautiful ones.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.309
The average symmetrical, attractive, face
is just ... boring to our brain.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.350
Whereas one we might consider an "ugly" face
-- which really means asymmetrical with imperfections

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.089
-- is easily remembered!

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.780
Something about it is novel and interesting!

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.940
There's something called the Von Restorff
Effect, which basically says our brains are

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.580
better at recalling unusual things, rather
than ordinary things.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.680
A study in the American Journal of Psychology
from 1997 found distinctive faces tend to

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.590
be more easily recognized.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.880
If your friend has a scar or a mole or a misshapen
eye, like poor Sloth from the Goonies -- then

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.750
you'll immediately recall who he is -- more
so than your twin friends -- who could be

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.790
hard to tell apart.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.060
Another part of this, is task switching.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.190
We've talked before about the brain's inability
to multitask.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.470
When you're in conversation and someone you
recognize, but just can't QUITE place walks

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.660
by, what happens?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660
You stop talking.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.660
Your brain can't search its face library and
talk at the same time.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.230
A study in PlosONE from 2003, found attractive
faces tend to mess up this task-switching

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.230
too.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.770
When you try to sneak a look at an attractive
guy in class, the brain turns off active listening

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.480
in order to process the attractive face.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.180
A new study published in the journal Neuropsychologia
found similar results to the first, but measured

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.410
both recognition AND attractiveness.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.569
The researchers showed attractive faces to
participants and asked them to memorize them.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.969
Later they were asked to identify which faces
they'd seen before.

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.640
Like in the first study, recognition got all
wonky when both faces were similar regardless

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.709
if they were attractive.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.670
But, these new results reveal our brains are
finding uniqueness more memorable!

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.109
An imperfect face is more likely to contain
a misshapen or out of line part.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.269
A certain kind of nose, eye or mouth will
set off something in our brain that serves

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.739
as a cue to help remember that face later.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.170
Though, perhaps if you're pretty and have
a beauty mark like Cindy Crawford, or a piercing

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.200
or a tattoo you now are more novel and easier
to remember.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.450
Science needs to look into that next.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.650
Funnily enough, there were a lot of false
positives in the study.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.109
When people saw attractive people, they were
more likely to say they'd seen that face before.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.249
Simply put, we want to roll with the hotties.

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.709
Do you think you remember ugly faces or attractive
ones more?

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.549
There's a comment box down below the video
for a reason.
