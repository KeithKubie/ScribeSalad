00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.895
The solution is that we need to call

00:00:01.895 --> 00:00:05.760
Fragment.setHasOptionsMenu(true). That way, we'll

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.910
get appropriate options menu callback

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.850
methods in the fragment, so that we can

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.120
inflate the menu and for when a menu item

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.190
is selected. And this is where the fragment

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.760
inflates the menu. Remember from before that in the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.310
ForecastFragment class, we have a public empty constructor, and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.650
we also override onCreateView? We also define fetchWeatherTask here.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.020
Now, we're going to overide an additional fragment life

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.340
cycle method called onCreate. This is where the fragment

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.691
is created, and this happens before the onCreate view

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:37.790
method, which is where the UI gets initialized. So, in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.570
onCreate, we're going to call setHasOptionsMenu to be true to

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.430
indicate that we want call backs for these methods.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.560
When onCreateOptionsMenu is called, we're going to inflate the menu

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.510
layout that we defined earlier called forecast fragment. We'll also

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.090
get notified when a menu item is selected. When a menu item with

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.350
ID action refresh is called, we're going to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.030
return true for now. We're going to go

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.140
over the activity and fragment life cycle methods in more detail in later

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.110
lessons, but if you want, you can read the documentation linked below for now.
