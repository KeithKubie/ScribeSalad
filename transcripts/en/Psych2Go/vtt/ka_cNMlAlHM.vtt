What's up Psych2Go viewers my name is Donna
and our first story comes from the Video Gaming

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.920
World.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.830
Remember when we had some researchers saying
that violent video games creates violent kids

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.640
and then we had another group of researchers
saying no no no no.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.280
Then they started to argue and there was this
whole clash.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.640
Well we've got some new research on the situation,
but before we jump right into the news I'd

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.360
like to thank our sponsor Best Fiends.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.920
Best Fiends is a puzzle adventure game where
you collect a team of fiends to defeat slugs

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.480
by matching same colored objects.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.850
It's pretty addicting.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.989
I'm already on level 42.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.630
If you play or want to play, let me know what
level you're on.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.750
This month they're doing an Easter Egg challenge
where you can win amazing and rare rewards.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.710
If you beat all 16 challenges, you win a new
bunny character and who doesn't like bunnies?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.320
you can download the game free.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.220
I'll link it down in the description and as
a bonus you'll get five dollars worth of gold

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.160
and diamonds for free...in the game of course.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.360
Back to the news.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.150
Ever since the emergence of violent TV shows,
movies, and now video games the topic of those

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.970
things causing aggression has been hotly debated.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.670
A majority of studies have found violent video
games to be linked to increased aggression

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.610
and decreased empathy.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.370
There's just one problem, a majority of those
studies were focused on short term results.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.370
This means past studies typically had someone
play a violent video game and right after

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.980
the game's done researchers would test aggression
and empathy levels.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.159
What do you know?

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.220
Aggression levels were up and empathy levels
were lower.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.049
But here's the thing those same results can
be found after any competitive or frustrating

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.080
task, whether that be not being able to solve
a math problem or not being able to pass level

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.580
40 of Best Fiends.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.509
Because of this researchers in Germany decided
to test for long term effects.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.650
Instead of requiring participants to play
games like in past studies scientists recruited

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.540
people who already regular played violent
video games and people who don't play video

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.540
games.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.880
Gamers and non-gamers were then shown a series
of images that would evoke some sort of emotional

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880
response.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.140
For example, according to past studies this
image would not move a gamer as much as a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140
non-gamer.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.770
Once shown the images neural responses were
examined via Fmri results show both groups

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.320
having the same level of empathy contrary
to previous studies.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.200
Our last study comes from the Massachusetts
institute of technology where scientists have

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.790
developed an AI system that can detect a conversation's
tone.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.450
So how this works is that users wear this
watch like device.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.299
The device analyzes audio, text transcriptions,
and physiological signs.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.620
For example, more sad and negative conversations
are usually associated with more pauses, monotonous

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.470
vocal tones, and increased cardio vascular
activities.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.949
The device takes record of this and is able
to classify the emotional tone of a conversation

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.729
with 83% accuracy.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.750
Now they researchers of this system claim
its most use for those who need some sort

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.250
of social coach.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.040
People with Aspergers or anxiety but imagine
how conversations would be if everyone had

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.620
a watch like this.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.010
That's all the news we have for you today.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.450
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.019
We at Psych2Go would like to know your opinions
and what you learned today.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.650
Do you think violent video games causes increased
aggression?

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.019
What do you think about this new device?

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:46.969
I'll see you guys next time.
