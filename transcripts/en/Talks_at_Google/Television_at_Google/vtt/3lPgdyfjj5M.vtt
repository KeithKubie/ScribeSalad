00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
MALE SPEAKER: So we're very
pleased to have the "Robot

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.370
Chicken" show leads from Stoopid
Buddy Stoodios here

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.070
today with us.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.392
We have show creators Seth
Green and Matt Senreich.

00:00:10.392 --> 00:00:16.063
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.063 --> 00:00:18.870
MALE SPEAKER: And we've also
got director Zeb Wells.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.752
And--

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.037
MALE SPEAKER:--head
writer Tom Root.

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:25.468
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:28.330
MALE SPEAKER: And executive
producer.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.100
So quick introduction.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.340
In its six seasons on air,
"Robot Chicken" has racked up

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.180
a number of really impressive
accomplishments.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.480
They've shown us that through
fart jokes and montages of

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.680
shots to the crotch
you can win Emmys.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.370
Not just one, but four Emmys.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.260
They've also clearly cornered
the market on stop motion

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.050
animation sketch comedy.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.180
So name an '80s cartoon or a pop
culture icon, and they've

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.460
spoofed it.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.850
And most importantly, they've
made it cool to be a nerd,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.010
validating many childhoods in
this room spent on the floor

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.090
lying in front of the TV
on Saturday mornings.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.750
Let's give a big round of
applause for the "Robot

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.340
Chicken" guys.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:18.850
MATT SENREICH: Normally
we kind of open this

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.010
stuff up for questions.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.730
We're awkward people.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.200
SETH GREEN: We're not much for
keynote speaking, but we are

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.190
really good at in-context
conversation, so maybe--

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.990
MATT SENREICH: If you guys
have questions--

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.760
SETH GREEN: --if anybody wants
to come up to that microphone

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.010
and ask us something, it will
start us off on a 45-minute

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.380
rant about nothing.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.400
MATT SENREICH: We're
good at those.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.190
AUDIENCE: How did you guys
start with this stuff?

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.950
MATT SENREICH: How did we
start with this stuff?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.960
AUDIENCE: Where did it begin?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.810
MATT SENREICH: Tom and I used
to work at a magazine called

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.740
"Wizard" and "ToyFare" magazine
back in the day.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.480
SETH GREEN: For those who don't
know, "Wizard" was the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.450
premiere genre media pre the
internet when all you could do

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.320
was wait for a magazine to
be published to give you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.190
information about pop culture
and current events.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.260
MATT SENREICH: So we were over
there, and one day, being an

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.729
idiot, I'd read in another
magazine that Seth was a big

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.480
toy geek and that he customized
toys of his "Buffy"

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.200
cast members as a Christmas
present.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.760
And I was like, that would
make a great article.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.640
SETH GREEN: I didn't think there
was any way I was going

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.676
to be on that show for several
years, and I thought I might

00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:22.220
as well blow it out on a great
Christmas gift this year and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.470
then never see any of these
people ever again.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.052
I'm just kidding, obviously.

00:02:27.052 --> 00:02:30.180
MATT SENREICH: So I ended up
reaching out to his publicist,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170
and we ended up just talking.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.360
SETH GREEN: I was a huge fan
of the magazine and had

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.950
actually bought every episode
of "ToyFare" from the time

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.700
that it was invented.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.970
So when I heard that the editor
of "ToyFare" wanted to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.576
talk to me I was like, do you
think they'll give me a

00:02:44.576 --> 00:02:44.812
subscription?

00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:47.950
TOM ROOT: Is it true that
you almost didn't

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.270
get to talk to Seth?

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.050
SETH GREEN: My publicist is
an excellent gateway.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.900
I think she asked what your
distribution was.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.365
MATT SENREICH: Yes, she did.

00:02:56.365 --> 00:02:57.670
SETH GREEN: And she was
unimpressed by the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.100
circulation.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.000
MATT SENREICH: Yeah,
we weren't "Vanity

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.435
"Fair" at the time.

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:03.260
SETH GREEN: Well, and
also, at the time--

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.230
I don't remember what
I was working on.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.910
That was like '98, right?

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.670
MATT SENREICH: It was like
"Austin Powers" and "Buffy"

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.930
were happening.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.300
SETH GREEN: It was that whole
chunk of time where lots of

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.750
good things were happening, and
she was really keeping the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.230
gate closed.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.950
MATT SENREICH: But you called
me back within 5 minutes.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.260
We ended up becoming friends.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.120
And then as that stuff
was happening--

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.790
when I was out in LA
we would hang out.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.790
Every time he was in New
York, we'd hang out.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.400
SETH GREEN: In advance of
Comic-Con becoming this

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.080
massive commercial event, it
was just a place that nerds

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.140
got together and talked
nerdy to each other.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.460
So Matt and I met at Comic-Con
for several years, too.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.530
MATT SENREICH: And it just
spiraled into just the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.156
friendship, where one day he was
like, hey, I've got to go

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:40.550
on "Conan O'Brien." I have
nothing to talk about.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.130
I was thinking maybe we'd make
a little animated short of my

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.620
action figure and maybe--

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.630
Conan O'Brien has an action
figure, I think, from just his

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.890
show, just being silly.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.720
SETH GREEN: I'd always been
really interested in both toys

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.730
and stop motion.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.570
And I'd heard that as a
publicity thing, Hasbro had

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.650
produced a 12-inch GI Joe-sized
Conan O'Brien toy

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.200
they'd featured on the
show and whatnot.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.920
And I was getting a toy from
"Austin" "Powers" and thought

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.650
it would be funny if our two
dolls fought or something.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.130
MATT SENREICH: So I enlisted
Tom, and we

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.430
put something together.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.710
And literally, it was one of
these things where we had no

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.250
idea what we were doing.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.850
But as we were trying to figure
out how to shoot this

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.610
little short, Sony Digital
approached us.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.080
Before the internet was the
internet, it was all dial-up.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.970
And said, hey, we hear you're
looking to create content.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.250
We're looking for content for
the internet and maybe do like

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.270
4-minute shorts, maybe order
like 6 to 12 of these things.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.510
SETH GREEN: Sony was trying to
develop a portal destination

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.270
pre-YouTube.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.170
They wanted linear content
in an a la carte--

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.290
who could imagine that that
would work, right?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.090
But it was pre-broadband.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.160
MATT SENREICH: Yeah,
this was 2000.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.680
SETH GREEN: So you're trying to
watch like 720-comparable

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.240
content over a phone line.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.760
It was just insane.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.380
TOM ROOT: It's also wasn't
Mac compatible.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.830
So we turned in 12 of these
episodes, and then none of us

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.095
at work could watch
them online.

00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:01.260
SETH GREEN: No one
on the planet

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.140
could watch them, really.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.240
But what we wound
up with was 45

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.330
minutes of produced content.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.900
So after the Sony platform
failed, we made a deal with

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.010
Sony Digital to shop that
content around.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.155
You just have to remember
the time when this was.

00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:19.330
It was between 2002 and
2004, and Adult

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.280
Swim was just forming.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.890
They didn't really have
any original content.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.400
"Aqua Teen," I think, was on.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.520
And it was right when "Family
Guy" had gone off the air.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.680
MATT SENREICH: It
was cancelled.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.810
They just started re-airing
the stuff on Adult Swim.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.140
Fox hadn't picked it up yet.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.000
And Seth MacFarlane--

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.290
SETH GREEN: They hadn't put
out the DVDs or anything.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.020
Adult Swim had just gotten the
right to re-air the old

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.140
episodes of "Family Guy." And
they got such high ratings

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.710
that it prompted Fox to
release it on DVD.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.820
But before that even happened,
MacFarlane said you should

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.920
meet these guys at Adult Swim.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.820
MATT SENREICH: And at the same
time, we'd already pitched

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.060
Cartoon Network, who said
it was too old.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.840
And a guy named Sam Register
there passed it along to Adult

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.940
Swim at the same time.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.310
So I think those two
intersecting moments happening

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.390
kind of made Adult Swim
take a look at us.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.270
And next thing we know,
we had a show.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.472
SETH GREEN: It really what
that matter of fact.

00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:14.960
Matt and I had--

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.120
we all had been producing
these web shorts.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.160
But we had five animators,
and our crew was

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.690
about 12 people total.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.350
And then they were
like, all right.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.240
So we want you to produce 20
quarter-hour episodes.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.526
And Matt and I were like,
I don't know how

00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:32.540
the hell we do that.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.816
So we had to figure that
out in a hurry.

00:06:36.816 --> 00:06:39.980
TOM ROOT: I'm just struck by how
many years it took to get

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.540
this show on the air.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.850
And then the second show we did
for Adult Swim, we drew

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.530
some pictures on a dry erase
board and said we think this

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.070
could be show.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.740
Do you want this?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.342
And they're, like, sure,
we'll order 12 of them.

00:06:51.342 --> 00:06:52.780
SETH GREEN: They learned
from that.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.006
They'll never do that again.

00:06:54.006 --> 00:06:56.440
TOM ROOT: No, that was
their mistake.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.795
But man, when you're on the
outside of those castle walls,

00:06:58.795 --> 00:06:59.850
it is hard.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.970
It's hard to get in there.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.750
SETH GREEN: We shopped
it everywhere.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.700
Matt and I took it to everywhere
from "Comedy

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.920
Central" to "Saturday Night
Live" to "MADtv" to--

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.760
where else did we go?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.640
We literally went--

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.040
MATT SENREICH: Went
everywhere.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.820
SETH GREEN: We had so many names
and so many people over

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.590
those four years.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:13.930
MATT SENREICH: It's
all a blur.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.900
SETH GREEN: And just waited
for the industry itself to

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.900
change, just waited for the
outlets to become available.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.625
Right place, right time.

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:25.590
MATT SENREICH: I like that
people have to get up to go to

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.020
the microphone.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.680
We're not used to that.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.650
AUDIENCE: But you have to sit
there with microphones.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.060
SETH GREEN: The Tony
Robbins format.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.000
AUDIENCE: So you have a
15-minute show in a world

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.810
where we don't have 15-minute
shows on the

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.200
internet, which is great.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.150
Well, I mean, on the internet
you do, but on television

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.160
that's great.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.200
Has there ever been talk
about going more?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.970
Is it hard to fill that
15 minutes sometimes?

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.310
MATT SENREICH: It is.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.180
TOM ROOT: I'll say in the
beginning, we were like, man,

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.660
if we do a really good job,
maybe someday this will be

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.670
half an hour.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.680
And now our fear is that
it goes to 30 minutes.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.540
We exhaust ourselves and the
audience, I think, in that

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.230
quarter hour.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.390
SETH GREEN: We've had some
success producing isolated

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.920
specials that are 22-minute,
30-minute format.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.990
But for the regular show,
there's a pace to it.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.500
There's a way that over these
several seasons we've found it

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.190
works best.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:13.530
MATT SENREICH: Yeah.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.810
Very early on, the head of Adult
Swim, Mike Lazzo, our

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.290
long sketches, as he said,
played long, and our short

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.430
sketches played too short.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.810
He said, so take your
minute sketches

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.800
and make them shorter.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.060
Take your 3-second sketches
and make them longer and

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.220
you'll find your sweet spot.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.730
So now we find like the
30-second to 2-minute stuff

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.770
works the best.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.530
And if you lump them all
together, it's really just

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.380
sketch comedy.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.830
It's "SNL" instead of
an hour, hour and a

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.380
half into 11 minutes.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.830
SETH GREEN: But we take extra
care every episode.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.159
I mean, the whole thing is
written sketch by sketch.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.110
And then those sketches are
organized, and rough timings

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.750
are estimated.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.620
And then we put all those on
cards and put a big jigsaw

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.180
puzzle together of what each
episode will consist of.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.630
And then within each episode,
we rearrange those cards to

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.640
figure out what the shape
of each individual

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.600
episode will be.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.840
And then once you shoot it or
cut it, all that changes once

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.680
you get the dialogue tracks.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.820
We wind up cutting half the
sketches from every animatic

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.310
just because it's too much time,
not as funny, doesn't

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.770
play, complication
of production,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:12.920
any number of things.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.240
So wait, just to finish that,
no, we don't want to make the

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.418
regular show a half an hour.

00:09:16.418 --> 00:09:17.780
It's exhausting.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.280
Every episode takes several
weeks to accomplish.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.430
And it's so much manpower.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.975
It's-- no.

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:28.950
AUDIENCE: So my question is how
many writers do you guys

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.120
have and how your writing
process looks like?

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.810
MATT SENREICH: As far as
writing goes, Tom could

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.920
probably talk about it more.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.195
We structure it--

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:39.020
Tom's one of our head writers.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.082
I'll let you--

00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:42.810
TOM ROOT: We've got a pair of
head writers and then some

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.200
recurring writers, like two or
three recurring writers.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.490
MATT SENREICH: Zeb.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.830
TOM ROOT: And then--

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.430
Zeb is one.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.650
And then we bring in like
a rotating crew

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.380
that come in and out.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.390
SETH GREEN: But it's broken
down into sections.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.020
We had 20 episodes
to accomplish.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.920
We'll break it down into
either four-week

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.080
or five-week cycles.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.130
And then we'll have our stable
writers that are on the whole

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.160
time throughout the year.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.640
And then we'll have other people
come in for each of

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.840
those four and five weeks.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.900
TOM ROOT: We do 20 episodes
in 20 weeks.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.330
And it's three weeks
of brainstorming,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.500
then a week of scripting.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.480
And in the scripting week, we
also start culling the herd

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.448
and murdering our children.

00:10:26.448 --> 00:10:28.160
ZEB WELLS: And each
other's children.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.510
TOM ROOT: Yes, well, especially

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.245
each other's children.

00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:34.230
SETH GREEN: It's so much easier
to drown your baby.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.815
TOM ROOT: And it's
pretty frenetic.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.040
A lot of what makes it to
the air is pretty dumb.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.670
And as an outsider, I would
say, oh, that looks pretty

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.390
easy to write.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.550
But it's the quantity of dumb
stuff that we have to write.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.020
ZEB WELLS: Finding that
right kind of dumb.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.150
TOM ROOT: There's a specific
brand of dumb.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.640
SETH GREEN: And it also-- it
has to come to a vote.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.510
Like we all have to agree, or
at least have a majority

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.850
agree, that a particular sketch
or particular idea is

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.450
good enough to go
into the show.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.190
MATT SENREICH: I think that's
the biggest thing.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.400
The one thing that's remained
consistent is we don't write

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.460
it for other people, as
weird as that sounds.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.850
SETH GREEN: As arrogant
as that sounds.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.410
MATT SENREICH: We write it
to make each other laugh.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.950
We're a group of friends that
started this show, if you

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.590
count 2013 plus years ago.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.880
And it's just to make that
same group of people just

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.990
laugh amongst ourselves.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.115
And if that's the case, we're
just hoping people are

00:11:24.115 --> 00:11:27.940
laughing with us, which is our
success or failure with that.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.090
SETH GREEN: That was the most
comforting thing about our

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.530
first season, is that we wrote
this show, this idea based on

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.570
all the things that we love
desperately and deeply that

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.610
are almost too nerdy
to say out loud.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.480
And within our first year,
we were met with a really

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.560
encouraging response from the
collective saying, hey, I feel

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.370
the same way.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.648
That commercial totally
fucked me up.

00:11:48.648 --> 00:11:51.325
So there was a nice realization
that we were at

00:11:51.325 --> 00:11:55.970
least sharing a sense of humor
culturally, and that

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.948
encouraged us to go forward.

00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:00.850
AUDIENCE: I really
enjoy the show.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.840
SETH GREEN: Oh, thanks.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.420
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit about what goes too

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.820
far that you just
can't put it in?

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.310
What sketches you're like, OK,
we've got to hold this one.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.340
MATT SENREICH: We've only had
a few of those, actually.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.300
Not as many as you'd think.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.910
SETH GREEN: And not for the
reasons that you'd expect.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:21.220
MATT SENREICH: Yeah, we had one
this last season that was

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.160
a street fighter, no "Mortal
Kombat" sketch.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.176
And it was a--

00:12:26.176 --> 00:12:28.436
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:30.080
SETH GREEN: Right.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.500
MATT SENREICH: It was Johnny
Cage fighting Kano.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.580
That was that, right?

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.680
SETH GREEN: No, no, no.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.580
It's the PTS.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.020
It's the guy coming
home from--

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.220
he's sitting with the therapist,
and he's like, the

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.810
voice in your head isn't real.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.270
And he's like, I just--

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.630
I just don't want it to tell
me to kill anymore.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.935
MATT SENREICH: Because he
kept hearing, kill him.

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.920
SETH GREEN: He finally goes
home to his wife and his

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.230
family, and they're so
happy to see him.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.485
And they're like, thank
God, you're cured.

00:12:54.485 --> 00:12:56.100
And he's like, oh, my family.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.147
And then he hears in his
head [DEEP VOICE]

00:12:58.147 --> 00:12:59.061
finish her.

00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:00.311
And he's like, ah!

00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:06.060
MATT SENREICH: It was one of
those things where no one

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:06.885
caught it on the page--

00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:08.780
SETH GREEN: But when you really
think about it, the

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.305
child cowering in the corner
saying, "Daddy no." And him

00:13:11.305 --> 00:13:13.190
going, [YELLING].

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.630
[DEEP VOICE]

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.730
Finish them.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.420
And then we made a silly.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.785
Like there's a piece of pizza,
a pizza box, and after he's

00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:21.370
punched his wife through
the chest.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.180
And then you see the pizza box
and he goes, [DEEP VOICE]

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:24.350
finish it.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.384
And he flips the box
and eats the pizza.

00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:27.940
Ahh!

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.115
But when it went through--

00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:31.730
MATT SENREICH: When you saw it
in animation and when SNP saw

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.672
it they, were like,
you can't do this.

00:13:34.672 --> 00:13:37.710
SETH GREEN: We don't like this
image of a mentally disturbed

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.300
person murdering their family
and themselves.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:44.300
And we were like, I guess I
hadn't thought about that.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.080
But you see in the video game,
he's got this voice in his

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.436
head, and so--

00:13:49.436 --> 00:13:51.290
yeah, that got cut.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.910
TOM ROOT: It's rare, though.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.260
They give us pretty--

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.995
a long leash.

00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:56.740
ZEB WELLS: We cut stuff
in the room.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.930
Sometimes it just goes farther
than we want to go.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.438
MATT SENREICH: Such as?

00:14:00.438 --> 00:14:02.174
ZEB WELLS: Uh--

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:02.610
MATT SENREICH: Yeah.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.986
I'm trying to like
of a specific.

00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:05.680
It's tough.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.640
Yeah, it's not as often
as you'd think.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.630
SETH GREEN: What was the one?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.340
It's always like personal.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.820
And I guess as we've all become
parents and things like

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.050
that, it changes the perspective
a little bit

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.080
because there was that-- what
was the first person shooter

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.905
in the Lamaze class?

00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:19.650
MATT SENREICH: Oh yeah.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.610
ZEB WELLS: That aired.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.210
TOM ROOT: Which "Call
of Duty" was that?

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:24.830
ZEB WELLS: 4.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.650
SETH GREEN: What was the game?

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.645
MATT SENREICH: "Modern
Warfare."

00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:30.750
SETH GREEN: So we have this
very silly sketch.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.305
TOM ROOT: Well, it's not
completely random.

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:34.810
SETH GREEN: No, it was based
on an actual thing.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.975
TOM ROOT: On the airport scene
from "Modern Warfare 2."

00:14:37.975 --> 00:14:40.290
SETH GREEN: First person
shooter game, horrific.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.015
You play an undercover officer
that has to go into an airport

00:14:44.015 --> 00:14:47.230
and participate in a
random murder plot

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.800
with a bunch of civilians.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.895
And to not blow your cover, you
have to kill civilians.

00:14:51.895 --> 00:14:54.050
That's weird in a video
game, right?

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.610
TOM ROOT: And we were
like, what's next?

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.380
How are we going to top that?

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.570
SETH GREEN: What could
the next version be?

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.065
So we had a guy kicking down
the door of a Lamaze class

00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:05.582
and, like, murdering a bunch of
expectant mothers, and then

00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:08.870
saying, it's OK,
I'm undercover.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.686
[MACHINE GUN SOUND]

00:15:10.686 --> 00:15:12.760
TOM ROOT: And that wasn't
even a network thing.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.860
That was sort of us in the room
sort of feeling a chill

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.490
in the air.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.640
TOM ROOT: One of the
rare instances we

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.606
showed a little restraint.

00:15:24.606 --> 00:15:25.730
SETH GREEN: What was
the other time?

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.285
We never animated the stillborn
baby puppet.

00:15:29.285 --> 00:15:30.985
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:30.985 --> 00:15:32.140
TOM ROOT: It's always babies.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.160
SETH GREEN: It's
always babies.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.325
We were doing a sketch,
America's

00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:41.630
Most Tragic Home Videos.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.110
TOM ROOT: It's in the
delivery room.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.450
SETH GREEN: The baby is like--

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.650
they're like one more push.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.130
And the mother's like
[SCREAMING].

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.120
And the doctor's
like, it's a--

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.010
uh.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.172
Uh.

00:15:54.172 --> 00:15:58.240
[BABY CRYING]

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.865
Horrible, horrible.

00:15:58.865 --> 00:16:00.415
MATT SENREICH: Awful.

00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:02.720
SETH GREEN: You know it's a
very tragic home video.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.410
TOM ROOT: I prefer we don't
share that one anymore.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.066
It never gets a big rousing--

00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:12.770
SETH GREEN: No one's ever like,
ah, that should have

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.340
been in the show.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.220
They don't even applaud our
ethics for cutting it.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.335
TOM ROOT: It just makes
them think less of us.

00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:26.168
ZEB WELLS: Let's cleanse
our palette here.

00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:28.760
AUDIENCE: I know you guys get
a lot of big names to do the

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.610
voices for the show.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.340
So do you usually write with
like getting people to voice

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.650
certain characters?

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.160
Or do they say, like, oh, we
want to be on the show, and

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.325
then you kind of make
a sketch around it?

00:16:38.325 --> 00:16:39.826
SETH GREEN: We just write.

00:16:39.826 --> 00:16:42.010
MATT SENREICH: It's one of those
things where our first

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.530
season, we called out a lot of
favors, people that Seth has

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.340
known, and we got really
lucky really early on.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.580
I really go back to--

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.790
I think it was like--

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.350
it was Burt Reynolds
and Don DeLuise,

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.520
Ryan Seacrest, actually--

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.050
SETH GREEN: It was, like,
going into the second--

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.350
MATT SENREICH: In like our first
five or six episodes.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.860
SETH GREEN: season of "Idol,"
we got Seacrest to come on.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.640
MATT SENREICH: Charlize
Theron.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.970
It was like we had a few
big names at the

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.790
time who just like--

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.599
then when we went out to other
people, they were like, oh,

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.220
they did the show?

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.630
Well, then these people
will do it.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.380
SETH GREEN: Once the show
existed and we didn't have to

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.510
clumsily explain the concept of
an animated sketch comedy

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.119
show starring action figures
to A-list agents, it was a

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.099
little bit better.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.380
We could send it, and be like,
oh, Charlize Theron did this.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.050
I'm just saying.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.700
MATT SENREICH: And now it's got
to a place where people

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.970
come to us.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.200
And ultimately, when we hear
someone wants to do the show,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.210
they go on this big sheet that
we have of people who want to

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.620
do the show.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.997
And then once we have the
scripts written--

00:17:36.997 --> 00:17:37.831
SETH GREEN: Sometimes
it happens quicker.

00:17:37.831 --> 00:17:39.290
Sometimes it's like, oh,
that's a perfect

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.080
part for that person.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.950
Sometimes it's like, oh, we
can cast that person.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.210
Or we had an idea that--

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.920
there will always be that random
like, oh, we wrote a

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.170
sketch about 50 Cent.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.220
Let's see if he'll do it.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.480
That kind of thing.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.940
He did, by the way,
which was awesome.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.240
Coolest thing ever.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.950
MATT SENREICH: In the episode
you watched, it was like Jon

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.760
Stewart had mentioned he wanted
to be on the show.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.545
So that was a perfect example
of we put him on the show in

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.230
that episode because
we had parts that

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.530
would fit his voice.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.772
SETH GREEN: He played
Matt Trakker and Sir

00:18:03.772 --> 00:18:06.520
Pentor, by the way.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.000
Very versatile, that
Jon Stewart.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.900
AUDIENCE: Actually,
one more question.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.760
What motivated you guys to do
the "Star Wars" specials?

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.990
Like you just had a
bunch of sketches

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.670
you just put together?

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.000
SETH GREEN: Deep, deep
love of "Star Wars."

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.670
TOM ROOT: We went through
this long--

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.420
I don't know if you guys
remember, there was a time

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.900
when Lucasfilm would just
sue people over and over

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.750
and over and over.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.370
SETH GREEN: In all fairness,
that's brand protection.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.220
And Google can understand how
important it is with a global

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.580
brand with globally recognize
iconography that's almost more

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.030
recognizable than
the crucifix.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.370
You have to preserve
your copyright.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.380
TOM ROOT: That's why people are
always using the Goggle

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.110
search engine--

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.430
SETH GREEN: RIght.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.350
TOM ROOT: --on TV and movies.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.440
And so for our first few
seasons, we were like, we

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.470
can't go near "Star Wars."
they'll just sue us.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.740
And we don't want to
go down that road.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.520
SETH GREEN: But then
we got ballsy.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.770
TOM ROOT: We got a little
full of ourselves.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.260
And we did a "Star
Wars" sketch.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.410
SETH GREEN: First was
the spoiler sketch.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.870
So it was buried inside a much
larger sketch, and it was just

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.300
a moment that was "Star Wars."
We had a lot of arguable legal

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.550
framework to make a
case for what was

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.660
very justifiable parody.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.040
MATT SENREICH: Plus Mark
Hamill did it,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.065
which helped us.

00:19:08.065 --> 00:19:11.810
SETH GREEN: But it was right--
it was like in the very--

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.015
MATT SENREICH: That
was first season.

00:19:13.015 --> 00:19:13.930
SETH GREEN: Yeah, very
first season.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.320
MATT SENREICH: And the second
season, ultimately we ended up

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.490
doing our emperor phone
call sketch.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.150
MATT SENREICH: It was one of
those-- that's really what--

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.720
TOM ROOT: Better response
than that baby.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.118
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:25.118 --> 00:19:27.490
SETH GREEN: They're less
conflicted emotionally.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.890
MATT SENREICH: I always laugh.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.910
It really was one of those
moments when we aired and it

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.950
was right after it aired that
week, where the phone rang.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.180
Caller ID had Lucasfilm on it.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.340
SETH GREEN: And I don't
even think--

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.224
I mean, had "Attack of
the Clones" come out?

00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:43.920
MATT SENREICH: Um, yes.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.810
"Attack of the Clones" had.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.930
"Revenge of the Sith" hadn't.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.450
No, it did. "Revenge of the
Sith" had come out.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.112
This was 2006, so it was
right after that.

00:19:52.112 --> 00:19:55.350
Yeah, but it was one of those
moments where it was that

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.070
freeze frame.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.895
SETH GREEN: We freeze.

00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:58.770
MATT SENREICH: So I pick up the
phone, and we didn't have

00:19:58.770 --> 00:19:59.500
an assistant.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.460
And I was just like, Hi, Matt
Senreich and Seth Green's

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.390
office, trying to pretend
like just in case.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.910
And the woman was like, Hi,
my name is Tracy Cannobio.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.620
And I was like--

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.060
all right, someone's
fucking with us.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.330
SETH GREEN: Someone clearly
tapped into the phone line and

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.675
created this Lucasfilm avatar.

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:18.505
This has to be a joke.

00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:19.150
MATT SENREICH: No joke.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.030
That's her name.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.930
And she is in PR up
at Lucasfilm.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.190
And she said that George
has seen the sketch.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.760
He thought it very funny, showed
it at a board meeting,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.066
and invited us up to Lucasfilm
to get a tour.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.790
SETH GREEN: Visit the studio,
go see LucasArts, and go see

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.800
all the cool stuff up there.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.430
MATT SENREICH: And we were
there within two weeks.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.700
SETH GREEN: We had a big meeting
with all their people,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.720
and they showed us around,
and we had lunch.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.310
And then they wanted to have a
meeting to talk about what was

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.660
the future.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.690
And at that time, Lucasfilm,
far from decision--

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.765
I don't even think they'd
done "Clone Wars" yet.

00:20:52.765 --> 00:20:56.330
MATT SENREICH: "Clone Wars"
was just starting to--

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.940
it hadn't aired yet.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.850
SETH GREEN: It was still
really early.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.690
And Lucasfilm was all effort
towards those films and still

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.170
not sure what they
were going to do.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.600
They were trying to
find a strong

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.400
presence for the fan relations.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.060
They were starting to
put more emphasis

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.290
on all of this content.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.180
And they said, well, maybe
we're going to do a show

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.640
that's an amalgam of all the fan
content, and you guys can

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.460
build wraparounds or
something for us.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.740
And Matt goes, I've got an idea,
and under the table sort

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.640
of subtlety taps me, like
not to say anything.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.110
MATT SENREICH: I kicked him.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.810
SETH GREEN: And I look at him,
and he goes, why don't we do a

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.720
half hour of "Robot
Chicken" solely

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.240
dedicated to "Star Wars"?

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.042
And I just sat there like--

00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:36.910
MATT SENREICH: Only one shot.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.540
SETH GREEN: And I watched all
the people in the room go--

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.920
huh.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.540
And I shit you not, three weeks
later, we were off and

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.660
running on that first special.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.820
MATT SENREICH: It
was really fast.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.380
And then even better was in that
special, George was like,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.040
Oh, I'll do a voice.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.060
SETH GREEN: Well, no, that's
not how it happened.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.690
We wrote a sketch where our nerd
character goes to see a

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.260
"Star Wars" Con and
winds up in an

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.780
elevator with George Lucas.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.320
And it was just so silly,
and it was just

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.570
loving and really funny.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.820
And he has such a strange
reputation because no one

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.270
really understands him at all
unless you spend any time with

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.340
him, and we just wanted to
show him being silly.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.280
And so we asked everybody in the
company if he would do it.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.720
And they were like,
absolutely not.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.260
Don't even ask.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.930
And they were like,
just keep asking.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.530
And we finally got it in
front of him, and he

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.230
was like, all right.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.390
It's like four cues.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.750
It's not a lot of
time commitment.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.900
We would come to him.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.260
And we got him to agree to be in
our show, which was insane.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.270
And even more, we got him to
agree to do a promo about

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.190
agreeing to do the show, where
he's sitting on a therapist's

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:44.400
couch being interviewed, and he
says, I can't believe I let

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.930
the "Robot Chicken" guys make
a half hour special.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.910
This is the holiday special
all over again!

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.380
I hate it!

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:49.850
I hate it!

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.100
I hate it!

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.826
MATT SENREICH: First take
without the mic.

00:22:56.826 --> 00:22:59.750
SETH GREEN: We were like, voice
down just a little bit.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:04.530
He's like, sorry, getting
into it there.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:05.510
It was really awesome.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.610
And that was when we knew.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.988
We were like, this guy
is the coolest.

00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:11.000
AUDIENCE: So it's obvious
that you guys grew up

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.420
playing with toys.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.002
SETH GREEN: What
tipped you off?

00:23:14.002 --> 00:23:15.400
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.980
And that even the show now is
the toys doing everything

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.350
without you playing with
them as a kid.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.240
So with the great respect that
you have for toys, being at

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.265
"ToyFare," et cetera, what's the
chop shop like where you

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:31.340
actually have to get
your favorite

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.210
things that you've hunted?

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.370
There's so many classics
in the show.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.060
SETH GREEN: Everything is
sacrificed to the cause, yes.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.340
AUDIENCE: Is there a time
that you just can't--

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.530
you have to go somewhere else?

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.780
Let somebody attack it?

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.790
SETH GREEN: You have no idea how
many things have just been

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.660
completely destroyed, blown
up, victimized.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.330
TOM ROOT: Even the action
figures that look like we're

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.780
just using off-the-shelf action

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.205
figures have to be modified.

00:23:50.205 --> 00:23:54.120
SETH GREEN: Raped on the inside
and then fused together

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.840
to be able to withstand the
horrible pressures.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.480
MATT SENREICH: Our toy wrangler,
Hugh Sterbakov at

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.580
the time, had to get
it a classic

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.040
vintage Mego Batmobile.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.840
SETH GREEN: First season.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.750
MATT SENREICH: And ended up
buying it from this nice old

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.110
woman who said it was part
of a collection.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.670
Please take good care of it.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.180
TOM ROOT: This was my son's.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.660
SETH GREEN: He never
opened it.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.140
Still has the sticker sheet.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.620
MATT SENREICH: And he
tells us the story.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.200
We get it.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.904
And then within 5 seconds the
shop's like, you know we're

00:24:20.904 --> 00:24:22.170
going to have to smash
that with a hammer.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.620
SETH GREEN: Because the gag is
it blows up and catches fire.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.415
And I get a call.

00:24:26.415 --> 00:24:28.620
I think I was in Hungary
when you called me.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.270
And they're like, we're
going to-- there's no

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.350
way to save it, dude.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.355
We're going to hit it with a
heat gun, and then we're going

00:24:34.355 --> 00:24:36.080
to smash it with a mallet.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.665
And it's not going to survive.

00:24:37.665 --> 00:24:38.170
MATT SENREICH: This thing
cost a fortune.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.950
I mean, you can look it up on
how much this thing cost and

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.570
literally it was in
perfect condition.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.220
SETH GREEN: It was pretty.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.320
MATT SENREICH: And destroyed.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.565
SETH GREEN: We got over
it quick, though.

00:24:46.565 --> 00:24:49.210
AUDIENCE: There still has to
be a little bit of that in

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.310
each one of you.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.880
So what went home?

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.150
What even after it was in the
show had to make into or that

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.230
display case that you don't ever
want to touch it again.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.300
That it's just your--

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.860
SETH GREEN: We've all taken
souvenirs from the show.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.870
TOM ROOT: I've got the Britney
Spears monster in our first

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.950
season, actually dating back
to the "Sweet J," right?

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.370
SETH GREEN: We rebuilt her
for the first season.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.650
TOM ROOT: It's Britney Spears
grows to Godzilla size, and

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.610
each of our hands and feet are
other female pop stars.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.860
TOM ROOT: And it was built out
of-- you guys ever been on the

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.020
Mummy ride at--

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.270
is it Universal Studios?

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.860
They sell these giant
rubber mummy dolls.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.290
And so I bought one, and
then I donated it.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.700
SETH GREEN: And tore it apart.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.970
Used its basic elements.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.590
TOM ROOT: So that's in
a place of honor

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.360
ZEB WELLS: As a newer employee,
I have stolen

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.915
nothing from the workplace.

00:25:40.915 --> 00:25:43.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:45.040
ZEB WELLS: Next question.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.510
SETH GREEN: Anything that would
ever get reused in the

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.380
show is stored somewhere
around the shop.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.550
And anything that gets displayed
is displayed but

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.240
would also get put back
in if we needed it.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.340
AUDIENCE: So Humping Robot.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.000
What happened between him and
the Jukebox, and will he ever

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.945
find love again?

00:26:03.945 --> 00:26:07.580
MATT SENREICH: Well, they did
fly off together in a "Grease"

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.460
sketch that we did.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.175
SETH GREEN: The song said we
will always be together.

00:26:10.175 --> 00:26:10.440
MATT SENREICH:Yeah.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.920
So I think they're living
happily ever after.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.510
AUDIENCE: Wasn't there
humping afterwards?

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.980
MATT SENREICH: Oh, I'm
sure he cheats on her

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.726
all the time, yeah.

00:26:17.726 --> 00:26:18.415
That's a given.

00:26:18.415 --> 00:26:20.395
SETH GREEN: He's not
a one-woman robot.

00:26:20.395 --> 00:26:20.790
MATT SENREICH: Yeah.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.020
That's a character that--

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.380
that's one of those that I
always write off as who the

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.920
fuck knew that one?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.300
SETH GREEN: It was a single
sketch, and it was in the

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.770
early days of our
channel flips.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.570
MATT SENREICH: We thought it was
a throwaway silly sketch

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.020
that would never, and
it turned into--

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.500
TOM ROOT: Well, it's the face.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.610
It's that glazed expression
that he's got.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.240
SETH GREEN: Just
dumbly humping.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.750
But it was in the early episodes
of the first season,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.860
we were still figuring out what
the channel flips were,

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.920
and they were more strange
cutaways than they were

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.140
standalone jokes.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.500
And so we thought the idea of a
robot just happily humping a

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.340
washing machine would be
funny, which it was.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.850
And then we just kept writing
other scenarios for him.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.240
In the last season, they just
invaded the planet.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.750
MATT SENREICH: We had a
"Battleship" sketch where it

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.270
was Battle Hump.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.170
SETH GREEN: And it
was up to Officer

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.981
Rihanna to save the ocean.

00:27:10.981 --> 00:27:13.100
Have you guys not seen
"Battleship"?

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.220
TOM ROOT: You guys have got
to see "Battleship." Treat

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.092
yourselves to the Blu-ray.

00:27:19.092 --> 00:27:24.760
SETH GREEN: More action per
capita than "The Core."

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.190
TOM ROOT: True statement.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:31.440
AUDIENCE: Slightly unrelated,
can you comment on the rumors

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.380
that Seth Green will be in
the "Entourage" movie?

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.000
MATT SENREICH: In the
"Entourage" movie?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.960
SETH GREEN: I haven't heard
anything about that.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.320
TOM ROOT: Are they really
making that?

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.290
MATT SENREICH: Is there a
kickstarter for that?

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.942
SETH GREEN: No, I think they're
actually making it.

00:27:42.942 --> 00:27:44.010
MATT SENREICH: I hadn't heard.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.570
TOM ROOT: They wrapped it up
so tightly with a bow.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.590
SETH GREEN: I don't know.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.160
It's one of those
things that--

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.501
MATT SENREICH: That might happen
on "Robot Chicken" this

00:27:50.501 --> 00:27:51.908
season, though.

00:27:51.908 --> 00:27:55.130
SETH GREEN: That's one of
those things that's so--

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.890
for me as an actor was so
strange because when I first

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.700
did it I thought I was doing one
thing, and then over time,

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.870
it evolved into something
completely different.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:06.060
I made "The Italian Job" with
Mark Wahlberg, and then he

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.700
started "Entourage"
the year after.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.970
And so he asked me to
come do something.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.015
I wasn't available.

00:28:11.015 --> 00:28:13.905
But Kevin Connolly who places
E, he and I have known each

00:28:13.905 --> 00:28:15.280
other since we were
seven years old.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.020
We both started in New York
doing commercials.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.950
If you want to see something
very funny, go to YouTube and

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.885
look up "Matchbox Car Wash" with
both of our names, and

00:28:24.885 --> 00:28:27.730
you will see a hilarious
commercial of seven or

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.790
eight-year-old Seth and Kevin
playing with cars.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:34.790
So we're actually like
old, old friends.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.575
I don't know if anybody saw
this, but I play a hyper super

00:28:38.575 --> 00:28:41.920
douche version of myself,
but on "Entourage."

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.960
It's hard to explain.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.130
It's very not--

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.420
MATT SENREICH: Ultimately
he plays the

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.560
asshole version of himself.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.180
And what's crazy is all the
people out in the world are

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.650
like, I can't believe he's
really like that, not

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:52.840
realizing that it's
television.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.760
SETH GREEN: There was a moment
where "Entourage" became such

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.340
effective propaganda that no one
believed it wasn't reality

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.320
television.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.750
And anybody that appeared on it
was immediately assumed to

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.430
be exactly that persona, which
I thought was hilarious.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.960
So I kind of leaned into it and
just became like as dick a

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.640
version of myself as I could.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.070
Every single scene sunglasses,
texting, like

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.830
whatever, brah, whatever.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.010
I thought that was
really funny.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.790
But because I wasn't doing films
as much, because I was

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.950
really concentrating on
producing and everything else,

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.135
there was an entire generation
gap of kids who didn't know me

00:29:28.135 --> 00:29:30.930
from interviews or from
other performances.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.810
They only knew we from
"Entourage." And I noticed

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.850
people who were at the
time between 10 and

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.055
17 for the next five years were
certain that I was just a

00:29:43.055 --> 00:29:45.450
motherfucker.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.330
I had like strangers picking
fights with me in bars.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.380
I was like, what?

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.360
And they were like, Turtle
should have knocked you out.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.820
And I was like, you know that's
television, right?

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.320
But because everyone had really
become consumed with

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.180
"The OC" and whatever,
"Vanderpump "Rules," people

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.425
have just become--

00:30:04.425 --> 00:30:06.436
MATT SENREICH: Wait,
it wasn't real?

00:30:06.436 --> 00:30:08.760
SETH GREEN: No, Vinnie Chase
is a huge movie star.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.560
I loved the "Aquaman" movie.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.160
MATT SENREICH: That
was awesome.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.270
It made $100 million.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.110
SETH GREEN: Cameron
crushed that.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.310
SETH GREEN: So I don't know.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.770
The thing that Doug Ellin, who
is the creator of the show,

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.390
said to me was, we love this
one-off gag, and we didn't

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.630
want it to become like a
mustache-twirling villain.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.720
I sort of defeats the purpose
of the reality

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.350
implication of the show.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:32.790
And since we'd made it so
theatrical with me and Bow Wow

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.070
fighting each other in
the NBC offices.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.770
It just seemed like there's
not too far to go.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.900
AUDIENCE: I think one of my
favorite scenes in "Family

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.410
Guy" is when Chris and Peter
are making fun of "Robot

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.890
Chicken," like going
back and forth.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:47.155
SETH GREEN: Me, to.

00:30:47.155 --> 00:30:49.800
AUDIENCE: Is there any truth
to how you and MacFarlane

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.550
really are with your shows?

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:50.976
Is there a rivalry there?

00:30:50.976 --> 00:30:52.680
SETH GREEN: No.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.010
Seth MacFarlane and I,
we love each other.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.710
MATT SENREICH: You know that he
hired Seth to be on "Family

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.680
Guy" and still pays him
to do that show.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.520
SETH GREEN: Oh yeah, he's
EPing that show that

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.640
I'm doing for Fox.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.460
No, but it's just
a playful thing.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:12.620
Like MacFarlane, we've been
friends since '98, and the

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.290
"Star Wars" things just happened
at the same time.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.750
So we even laughed at one point
at Comic-Con like, holy

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.390
shit, dude, I cannot believe two
of the biggest "Star Wars"

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.110
fans in the world are getting
to make comedy "Star Wars"

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.280
projects at the same time.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.730
And we were in production at the
same time, but ours beat

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.460
theirs to air.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.850
And the whole time that we were
developing it, we were on

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.980
the phone with the other writers
like, hey, are you

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.630
guys doing a Wampa joke?

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.080
Hey, are you going to do
this Tatooine joke?

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.640
Hey' you're not doing this
Death Star joke?

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.510
Just to stay off of each
other's territory.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.490
And in places where we were
crisscrossing, we made sure

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.300
our actual jokes were
totally different.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.330
So by the time "Family Guy" was
coming out, it was like

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.930
several months after
our show had aired.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.030
So they rewrote this
whole last bit.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.115
And I come in to record
after I've

00:31:54.115 --> 00:31:55.990
recorded the entire thing.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.995
And it's this scene of Peter
shit-talking Seth

00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:00.740
Green and I was like--

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.215
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:03.215 --> 00:32:04.370
SETH GREEN: And he was like--

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.890
SETH GREEN: And I go,
is this cool?

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:10.570
Is this funny?

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.070
He's like, yeah, I think
it's hilarious.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.110
And I was like, I think
it's funny, too.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.210
So that was it.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.020
It was like an inside
ha-ha-ha thing.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.060
But people, I think people
really love drama.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.956
MATT SENREICH: Just to know
history, Seth and Seth used to

00:32:24.956 --> 00:32:27.410
live four houses down
from each other.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.280
SETH GREEN: There was
a point where we

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.590
lived on the same block.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.102
MATT SENREICH: It's all
in the family, is the

00:32:32.102 --> 00:32:32.590
way we look at it.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.790
SETH GREEN: You know we rode
skateboards together in the

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.190
neighborhood.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.586
Whatever.

00:32:37.586 --> 00:32:40.020
AUDIENCE: Also off topic for
Seth, is there going to be an

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.380
"Austin Powers 4"?

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.620
SETH GREEN: I have no evidence
to support the yes or no

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.945
answer, to tell you the truth.

00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:48.530
AUDIENCE: Can you either
confirm or deny?

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.440
SETH GREEN: I'm just probably
the last person

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.410
to know about that.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.550
I'm probably like number seven
on that call sheet so--

00:32:56.568 --> 00:32:59.922
TOM ROOT: Have you
ever asked Mike?

00:32:59.922 --> 00:33:04.060
SETH GREEN: The last time I
saw Mike was right before

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.180
"Love Guru." He was hosting the
MTV awards, and we did a

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.110
bunch of promos for it.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:11.410
And he was in the greatest
place I'd ever seen him,

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:12.490
literally radiating.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.660
And then that movie
didn't make money.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.130
And people were mad at him.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.030
And he was like, maybe
I'll just sit

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:19.900
this out for a minute.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.770
AUDIENCE: I've got
two, actually.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.780
Will I be able to buy
Apocalypse Pony?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.530
And what happened with
"Star Wars" Detours?

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.182
SETH GREEN: I can probably
take that.

00:33:29.182 --> 00:33:31.740
Apocalypse Pony is no, but
for a very good reason.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.225
We spent--

00:33:32.225 --> 00:33:33.930
MATT SENREICH: We tried.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.900
SETH GREEN: --at least 17 months
credibly pursuing that

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.210
with Hasbro and Hasbro
Industries.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:43.130
And they, to their credit,
were really, really--

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.780
they really tried.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.510
MATT SENREICH: They very simply
said, the 10,000 or

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.870
20,000 units that it would
ultimately sell for the geeks

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.780
of the world like ourselves,
you have to

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.560
remember there are--

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.530
SETH GREEN: It can't possibly
be justified.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.140
MATT SENREICH: The millions of
people who like the brand of

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.990
My Little Pony, think of all
the parents of those

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.250
seven-year-old kids who go, what
the hell are you doing to

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.965
this pure brand?

00:34:01.965 --> 00:34:03.490
SETH GREEN: It was bigger
and simpler than that.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.650
They were like, hey, look,
the four horsemen of the

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.679
apocalypse are the harbinger
of the end of the world for

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.030
the Biblical community.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.239
So the 10,000 units we could
possibly sell for this

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:21.085
one-time promotional thing at
Comic-Con does not match the--

00:34:21.085 --> 00:34:21.620
MATT SENREICH: Business model.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.230
SETH GREEN: --potential 10 years
of protesting we could

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.000
have outside our offices
for people that

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.790
don't get the joke.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.190
And we were like, I
totally get that.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.850
I totally get that.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.050
And then "Detours," it's even
more simple than that.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.716
When George created the show,
there was no plan to do these

00:34:37.716 --> 00:34:38.480
other movies.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:46.350
And a comedy version of the
"Star Wars" universe isn't the

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.030
right first message in these
next three years ramping

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.179
up to Episode 7.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:54.239
So we've produced almost 40
complete episodes of the show.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.250
And at some point, it's going to
be seen, especially in this

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.460
world of new media where we have
no idea what the network

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.560
model is going to look like in
two years, three years, or

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.430
five years.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:07.720
You look at the Netflix model
of "House of Cards" and how

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.550
well that worked, people
buying entire

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.550
seasons at a time.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:15.370
I just expect that "Detours"
lifespan is going to start

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.460
after Episode 7, at
the very least.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.360
TOM ROOT: And we've never been
told, look, this is never

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.020
coming out.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.082
We've been told this is
going to be delayed.

00:35:24.082 --> 00:35:25.910
SETH GREEN: Its strategic
timing.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.340
With a brand that's as globally
as expansive as "Star

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.090
Wars." they have to be very
strategic in the way they

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.502
release specific information.

00:35:35.502 --> 00:35:36.610
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.670
Well, we really want to thank
the "Robot Chicken" guys for

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.610
coming to Google LA.
