[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:12.230
What are you doing there, RJ?

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.170
&gt;&gt; I'm geocaching.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.930
It's like a treasure hunt, except that
we use lat longs instead of an x.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.140
&gt;&gt; Wow, that sounds awesome.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.810
Sounds like you're using
lots of geoconcepts.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.940
Let's take the time to
talk about geocoding and

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.190
other location web services instead.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.940
&gt;&gt; GeoGreat.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.200
Geocoding is one of the many
location services available via

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.930
the Google Maps APIs.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.620
For the next few lessons,
we'll demonstrate using these services.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.453
It's important to note that, most of
these services can be used either on

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:44.280
the service side, for example, as part
of a process you run in a script, or

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
client side as part of
a user facing code.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.120
The functionality is likely
the same in each service, but

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.000
obviously the syntax
is a little different.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.970
And there are different
reasons to use them.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.720
&gt;&gt; The server side option is ideal,
when you already have

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.460
data that you need to do a bunch of
stuff with, with no user input needed.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.280
Like a list of 100 points for
which you need to get information,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.320
such as the address, the coordinate,
the time zone, or nearby schools.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.380
When you make a web service
request in this way,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.230
results can be returned in
either JSON or XML format.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.850
&gt;&gt; But sometimes you may
not have data in advance.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.890
The addresses, user location, or

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.420
other requests come in dynamically
as part of the user input.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.600
Maybe a user clicks on a map to
indicate his or her current location.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.298
And wants to find movie theaters nearby.

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:33.910
These type of situations are ideal for
client side services.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.810
&gt;&gt; As we go into this in more detail,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.540
keep in mind that we structure all the
web services requests in the same way.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.720
We put in their required parameters and
we get back a textual response.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.210
Let's start out by explaining
the Geocoding Service via an http

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.340
request in our browser.
