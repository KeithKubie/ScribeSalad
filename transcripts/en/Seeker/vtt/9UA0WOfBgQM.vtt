00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.370
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY TERRIBLE BLOWN CALLS
IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS?

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:12.400
IT'S NOT YOUR IMAGINATION, AND THE REASONS
WHY MIGHT SURPRISE YOU..

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.210
HEY GUYS THIS IS ANNIE FOR DNEWS.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.950
IN THEORY, SPORTS OFFICIALS ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE OBJECTIVE ENFORCERS OF THE GAME RULES.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.060
BUT IN REALITY, THEY SCREW UP - A LOT. AND
IT'S MORE THAN JUST SIMPLE HUMAN ERROR - THERE

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.640
ARE PERCEPTUAL BIASES HAVING TO DO WITH EVERYTHING
FROM JERSEY COLOR TO HEIGHT TO PLAYER REPUTATIONS.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640
LETS START WITH BASEBALL.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.569
UMPIRES IN THE STRIKE ZONE ARE WRONG ABOUT
14% OF THE TIME, ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.420
THAT LOOKED AT 700,000 PITCHES.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.480
BUT EVEN WORSE, THEY WERE MORE WRONG TOWARDS
THE END OF THE GAME - AND THAT THOSE WRONG

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.670
CALLS FAVORED STAR PITCHERS WITH REPUTATIONS
FOR GOOD CONTROL, ACTUALLY EXPANDING THEIR

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.409
STRIKE ZONES BY 16% ON AVERAGE.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.640
SO, REPUTATION MATTERS.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.890
NO HUGE SHOCK THERE.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.460
BUT SOMETHING AS ARBITRARY AS JERSEY COLOR
CAN AFFECT CALLS TOO.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.510
LOOKING AT NHL GAMES, ANOTHER PIECE OF RESEARCH
FOUND THAT TEAMS WEARING BLACK JERSEYS WERE

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.739
CALLED FOR MORE PENALTIES THAN TEAMS IN LIGHTER
COLORS.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.780
THE STUDY COULDN'T PINPOINT WHY FOR SURE - WHETHER
WEARING BLACK ACTUALLY MAKES PLAYERS MORE

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.439
AGGRESSIVE, WHETHER IT'S A CULTURAL BIAS AGAINST
THE COLOR BLACK, OR IF THEY'RE SIMPLY MORE

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.670
VISIBLE ON THE ICE.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.369
BUT EITHER WAY, IT AMOUNTED TO ABOUT 2 MIN
OF ADDITIONAL PENALTY TIME.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.300
INTERESTINGLY THOUGH, THIS IS NOT UNIVERSAL
- A SIMILAR STUDY DONE IN A TURKISH SOCCER

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.659
LEAGUE FOUND NO DIFFERENCE IN PENALTIES BETWEEN
BLACK AND LIGHT COLORED JERSEYS

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.649
ALSO IN SOCCER, REFS ARE SHOWN TO CALL MORE
FOULS WHEN THE PLAY HAPPENS IN A RIGHT-TO-LEFT

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.229
MOTION THAN IN THE REVERSE.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.789
THIS DIRECTIONAL BIAS HAS BEEN LINKED TO HOW
WE READ.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.600
ENGLISH READERS, FOR EXAMPLE, PERCEIVE THINGS
THAT HAPPEN IN A LEFT TO RIGHT MOTION AS MORE

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.990
PLEASING BECAUSE IT'S WHAT MAKES SENSE TO
US.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.420
THE REVERSE IS TRUE FOR READERS OF RIGHT TO
LEFT LANGUAGES LIKE ARABIC OR HEBREW.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.959
ANOTHER STUDY FOUND THAT IN AMBIGUOUS FOUL
CALL SITUATIONS IN SOCCER, HEIGHT IS A FACTOR

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.679
- THE TALLER PLAYER WAS MORE OFTEN ASSUMED
TO BE AT FAULT.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.240
IN BASKETBALL, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT REFEREES
tend to favor home teams, teams trailing in

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.590
a game and teams trailing in a playoff series.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.119
SO EVEN WHEN THE STAKES ARE REALLY HIGH - IT'S
CLEAR THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAN

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.910
CAN SCREW UP OFFICIATING IN MEASURABLE WAYS.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.840
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT MORE FAIR THOUGH?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.100
WELL, MANY LEAGUES - LIKE MLB THIS SEASON
- MAKE INTRODUCED INSTANT REPLAY RULES THAT

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.759
ALLOW FOR REVIEWING OF FOOTAGE ON TAPE.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.250
BUT IT'S A CONTROVERSIAL MOVE BECAUSE IT INTERRUPTS
THE GAME AND AFFECT STRATEGY.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.880
BUT WHAT'S WORSE - BLOWN CALLS OR ANNOYING
INTERRUPTIONS?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.100
IS IT JUST PART OF THE GAME?

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.100
OR SHOULD WE JUST SWITCH TO ROBOTIC REFEREES?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.570
