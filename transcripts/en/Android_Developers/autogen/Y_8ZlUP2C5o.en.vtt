00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.210
 

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.970
okay so in this demo I'm using switches

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:39.980
okay so in this demo I'm using switches
 

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.310

needing to have an external switch so

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:49.730
needing to have an external switch so
 

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.490
needing to have an external switch so
using the volume keys I'm going to go

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:51.500
using the volume keys I'm going to go
 

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.769

which highlights this word peaches here
 

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.970
which highlights this word peaches here
then I can cut the word with the menu

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:12.980
then I can cut the word with the menu
 

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.149
then I can cut the word with the menu
and then now I want to paste the word

00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159
and then now I want to paste the word
 

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:19.149
and then now I want to paste the word
somewhere else so to do this I first

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159
somewhere else so to do this I first
 

00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:22.180
somewhere else so to do this I first
need to move the cursor so I can go to

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:22.190
need to move the cursor so I can go to
 

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.840
need to move the cursor so I can go to
previous and then I'll do previous lines

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:25.850
previous and then I'll do previous lines
 

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.820
previous and then I'll do previous lines
to move to the beginning of this text

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:27.830
to move to the beginning of this text
 

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:32.970

field and then I can paste the word
 

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.310
field and then I can paste the word
there but what if I made a mistake

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320
there but what if I made a mistake
 

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.370
there but what if I made a mistake
we have undo and redo actions added to

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:39.380
we have undo and redo actions added to
 

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.250
we have undo and redo actions added to
these many years text editing mistakes

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:42.260
these many years text editing mistakes
 

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.320
these many years text editing mistakes
can be very costly for switch users so

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:44.330
can be very costly for switch users so
 

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.200
can be very costly for switch users so
these actions allow our users to go more

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.210
these actions allow our users to go more
 

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.269
these actions allow our users to go more
quickly back to text editing and then

00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279
quickly back to text editing and then
 

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:55.480
quickly back to text editing and then
now I'll go back to the slides

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:55.490
 

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.000
so switching gears let's talk a little

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.010
so switching gears let's talk a little
 

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.899
so switching gears let's talk a little
bit about what's new for vision to start
