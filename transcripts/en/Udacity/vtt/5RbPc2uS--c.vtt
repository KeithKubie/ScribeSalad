00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So with this effect but I haven given a name to yet but we're going to call time dilation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You'll see why in a minute and we have these equations relating

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the rates at which different clocks tick.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And actually this number v/c--I'm going to stop writing v/c.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Instead I'm going to use this number or variable β to represent the ratio of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a frame's speed to the speed of light and the variance are polishing things up,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
let's go one step further and instead of writing t‘ like this, lets put the t out

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and give this quantity in parenthesis its own name and the name I'm going to give--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
well, we've seen the α and β, it's time for the next Greek letter, is γ.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So now, our complicated equation becomes t'=γt.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So actually we want to understand what's going on here. We need to understand γ a little better.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So first let me tell you without giving you much proof and I'm sorry for doing it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that v the speed that we can move or about a frame of reference can move--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
well it has an upper bound--it can't go any faster than c, can't go faster than the speed of light.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So we can go with the slowest 0 stop or up to the speed of light

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which means that β is between 0 and 1.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That can't be equal to the speed of light.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I want you to tell me what's the minimum and maximum value for γ.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So for γ min, it's the lowest possible value of γ as it is low as we want.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Can it go to a negative or billion--it's the lowest possible value 0 or is the lowest possible value 1.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Likewise, for γ max, it's the highest possible value that γ can be.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Is it 1, 2 or can γ max grow as large as we want.

00:01:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that's two questions. Select the best answer for each.
