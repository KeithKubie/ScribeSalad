00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:06.590
experience we had nine percent growth
 

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.640
experience we had nine percent growth
last year or not eight points seven I

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:09.650
last year or not eight points seven I
 

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.529
last year or not eight points seven I
think this year we are expecting ten

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:11.539
think this year we are expecting ten
 

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:13.330
think this year we are expecting ten
percent growth but the main thing that

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:13.340
percent growth but the main thing that
 

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.650
percent growth but the main thing that
happened that the income but

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:14.660
happened that the income but
 

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.960
happened that the income but
redistributed and people there is the

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:16.970
redistributed and people there is the
 

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.029
redistributed and people there is the
middle class emerged and that's my main

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039
middle class emerged and that's my main
 

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:21.460
middle class emerged and that's my main
result i would say because I mean it's

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:21.470
result i would say because I mean it's
 

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.469
result i would say because I mean it's
not so much the increase of gdp per

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479
not so much the increase of gdp per
 

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:26.620
not so much the increase of gdp per
capita as the increase of people who can

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:26.630
capita as the increase of people who can
 

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.740
capita as the increase of people who can
already be well off I mean forty-five

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:29.750
already be well off I mean forty-five
 

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.079
already be well off I mean forty-five
percent of our population described in

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:32.089
percent of our population described in

percent of our population described in
the polls themselves identify their

00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:34.099
the polls themselves identify their
 

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:38.380
the polls themselves identify their
condition as fair economically ten

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:38.390
condition as fair economically ten
 

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.120
condition as fair economically ten
percent said that they are doing very

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:40.130
percent said that they are doing very
 

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.909
percent said that they are doing very
well now two years ago it was only five

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919
well now two years ago it was only five
 

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.030
well now two years ago it was only five
percent and this is self in the

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040
percent and this is self in the
 

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.950
percent and this is self in the
identification I am NOT saying that they

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:47.960
identification I am NOT saying that they
 

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.750
identification I am NOT saying that they
are saying this which means that people

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760
are saying this which means that people
 

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.610
are saying this which means that people
have got some economic optimism and

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:51.620
have got some economic optimism and
 

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.680
have got some economic optimism and
middle class is emerging and I think

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:53.690
middle class is emerging and I think
 

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.170
middle class is emerging and I think
middle-class Indian longer run is the

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:56.180
middle-class Indian longer run is the
 

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.570
middle-class Indian longer run is the
main stability force for democracy and

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:58.580
main stability force for democracy and
 

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.250
main stability force for democracy and
for sustainable democratic free

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:00.260
for sustainable democratic free
 

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.230
for sustainable democratic free
development for every society where it

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240
development for every society where it
 

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.699
development for every society where it
emerges and I think this is another

00:09:03.699 --> 00:09:03.709
emerges and I think this is another
 

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.130
emerges and I think this is another
thing that's coming in the world in

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:06.140
thing that's coming in the world in
 

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.680
thing that's coming in the world in
general middle class is getting larger

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:08.690
general middle class is getting larger
 

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.760
general middle class is getting larger
and larger I mean you can see it you can

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:12.770
and larger I mean you can see it you can
 

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.329
and larger I mean you can see it you can
see by consumers panic you can see by

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:15.339
see by consumers panic you can see by
 

00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:18.280
see by consumers panic you can see by
also and the higher classes be shrinking

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.290
also and the higher classes be shrinking
 

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.680
also and the higher classes be shrinking
I mean they really the wealthiest ones

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:20.690
I mean they really the wealthiest ones
 

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.440
I mean they really the wealthiest ones
their number is not growing anymore and

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:23.450
their number is not growing anymore and
 

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.270
their number is not growing anymore and
it's even shrinking and this is a very

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:25.280
it's even shrinking and this is a very
 

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.010
it's even shrinking and this is a very
important process process that's what

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.020
important process process that's what
 

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.170
important process process that's what
makes the whole thing irreversible I

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:32.180
makes the whole thing irreversible I
 

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.530
makes the whole thing irreversible I
must say this is a fascinating lesson in

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:35.540
must say this is a fascinating lesson in
 

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.230
must say this is a fascinating lesson in
how one constructs a democracy and not

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240
how one constructs a democracy and not

democracy promoters often argue because

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000
democracy promoters often argue because
 

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.079
democracy promoters often argue because
you are insistence on actually building

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:50.089
you are insistence on actually building

government capacity and then saying that

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:52.850
government capacity and then saying that
 

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.250
government capacity and then saying that
there is a distinction between the

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.260
there is a distinction between the
 

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.920
there is a distinction between the
government and the private sector is a

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:55.930
government and the private sector is a
 

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.900
government and the private sector is a
fairly sophisticated way of approaching

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:58.910
fairly sophisticated way of approaching
 

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.980
fairly sophisticated way of approaching
this and clearly reasonably successful

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:01.990
this and clearly reasonably successful

this and clearly reasonably successful
would you say in a way you're you're

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:07.280
would you say in a way you're you're
 

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.090
would you say in a way you're you're
playing two roles right now on the one

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.100
playing two roles right now on the one

you want to sort of institutionalize
 

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.470
you want to sort of institutionalize
this and become merely a democratic

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480
this and become merely a democratic
 

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.310
this and become merely a democratic
leader is that a difficult tension yes

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320
leader is that a difficult tension yes
 

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.340

yes it is because what we am saying is

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.350
yes it is because what we am saying is
 

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.910
yes it is because what we am saying is
that on the one hand we revolution

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920
that on the one hand we revolution
 

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.860
that on the one hand we revolution
itself was just initial stage I mean

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:32.870
itself was just initial stage I mean
 

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.870
itself was just initial stage I mean
what followed was cultural revolution

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880
what followed was cultural revolution
 

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.550
what followed was cultural revolution
and cultural revolution is to continue

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560
and cultural revolution is to continue
 

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.400
and cultural revolution is to continue
changing perceptions and for that we

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.410
changing perceptions and for that we
 

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.340
changing perceptions and for that we
need to create constantly be creating

you're framing something you also want
to be part of that system and of course

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.250
to be part of that system and of course
 

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.220
to be part of that system and of course
this is a always a tough challenge

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:00.230
this is a always a tough challenge

this is a always a tough challenge
because

00:11:02.489 --> 00:11:02.499
because
 

00:11:02.499 --> 00:11:04.439
