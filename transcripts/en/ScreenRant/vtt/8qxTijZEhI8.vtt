00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.920
Over the past 15 years, reality television
has transformed from a relatively non-existent

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.790
category into a well-oiled machine.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.700
Tons of networks were quick to capitalize
on the trend and quickly reality TV shows

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.030
became high-rated primetime juggernauts.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.720
Audiences love to tune in and watch everyday
people put in extraordinary situations.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.820
But while these programs may be marketed as
reality, there are often people behind the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.370
scenes who are pulling strings in ways you
might not realize.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.829
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Biggest Lies You
Believe About Reality TV Shows.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.969
Keeping Up With The Kardashians
The Kardashians aren’t known for being authentic,

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.190
so it should come as no surprise that their
show isn’t either.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.690
Camera crews follow the family as they spend
their days being famous on E! network’s

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.989
Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.390
And if that sounds boring to you, you’re
not alone.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.070
The producers tend to agree, and will occasionally
mess with the show’s timeline to create

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.070
drama.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.170
They’ve also been accused of using their
powers for other evils; to make some characters

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.680
more sympathetic than others.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.251
Apparently Kim choreographed her entire engagement
to Kris Humphries, even demanding that it

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.251
be filmed over again.

00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:10.251
Why?

00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.370
She “didn’t like” the face she was making
in the original.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.130
It seems that the real stars of this show
are editing, and reshoots.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.580
Judge Judy
There’s a common saying amongst lawyers:

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.270
“always read the fine print.”

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.520
And if you can catch the fine print at the
end of an episode of Judge Judy, here’s

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.520
what you’ll learn.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.750
The complainants in each case found their
way to Judge Judith Sheindlin’s courtroom

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.850
by way of a producer.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.509
And that producer found them by lurking around
small-claims courts, listening for wacky cases.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.550
At no cost to them, the participants are flown
to Los Angeles where they’re paid an appearance

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.550
fee.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.550
Even the losers are winners.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.439
The production company pays whatever fine
the Judge assigns at the end of each trial.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.840
So if you’ve ever wondered what would possess
someone to appear on a show like this one,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.170
now you know.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.189
Cash Cab
How many times have you found yourself in

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.409
the back of a taxi, wishing for something
to make the time pass faster?

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.729
If only the driver would quiz you on your
general knowledge!

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.180
Then you’d BOTH be having fun!

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.399
Well, thanks to Cash Cab, there are a handful
of lucky commuters who made it to their destination

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.610
with fully stimulated brains, and a pocket
full of cash.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.659
Except that they don’t actually keep the
cash.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.630
They give it back and wait for their winnings
in the mail.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.840
Oh, and the contestants?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.040
Most of them are not random citizens on their
way to drinks with friends, or a night on

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.040
the down.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040
Nope.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.420
They’re people who have been pre-screened
by producers.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.340
And it’s disappointing when you realize
that not everyone has an equal shot at being

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.040
picked up by the Cash Cab.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.930
COPS
Emerging during the middle of a writers strike

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.730
in 1988, the show COPS was born of necessity.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.000
People were hungry for entertainment, and
in 1989, executives figured that nothing was

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.950
better than a story that told itself.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.190
As if being arrested wasn’t bad enough,
suddenly there was the possibility that it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.020
could happen in front of millions of people.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.230
Plus, just because the crew was often in the
presence of law enforcement, it doesn’t

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.230
men they were safe.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.520
And one staffer was accidentally killed during
filming.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.970
Crews need special permission in order to
film with the police, and almost nobody says

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.970
yes.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.790
They argue that their work isn’t for the
amusement of others.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.750
If the cops don’t even want to be on COPS,
maybe it’s time shut it down.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.250
Storage Wars
Look twice before you throw out that pile

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.950
of junk in the garage, because it might be
full of rare antique collectibles worth a

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.950
million dollars.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.700
If tenants skip payments long enough, eventually
the contents of their locker are auctioned

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.020
off, which is the entire premise of Storage
Wars.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.120
The catch is that the people bidding don’t
know what treasures lie within each unit.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.920
They’re not allowed to touch anything until
the buyer is confirmed, and there’s something

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.260
crazy in every locker.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.540
So after finding his share of outlandish stuff
in the abandoned lockers of Storage Wars,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.680
one of the show’s stars began making noise
about producers tampering with their contents.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.880
If something seems too good to be true, it
probably is.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.200
And bid-master Dave Hester sued the network
for interfering.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.090
He says he was fired in retaliation, but came
back to the series shortly after.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.770
Man vs. Wild
Bear Grylls, a.k.a the guy who drank his own

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.030
pee, is the star of Man vs. Wild.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.270
A show that finds him trying to survive the
most severe circumstances.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.960
He’s rolled around inside the corpse of
a camel, and eaten some extreme stuff.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.940
Audiences saw him devour snakes, spiders,
reindeer blood, and a moose heart to name

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.940
just a few.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.660
But reports began to surface about the adventurer
routinely abandoning his rickety outdoor accommodations

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.130
as soon as the cameras quit.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.510
Some suggest that while it may look like Grylls
spends the night shivering under a makeshift

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.490
lean-to in the middle of the Siberian wilderness,
he’s really snuggled up in a freshly-made

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.490
hotel bed.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.420
Apparently that’s not the show’s only
trick either.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.280
They also staged a bear attack in which a
costumed crew member ran at the host, and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.190
the team played it off as a legitimate near-death
experience.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.070
The Biggest Loser
Despite its seemingly negative title, The

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.180
Biggest Loser claims to be a show about everyday
people taking control of their lives.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.820
Personal trainers work with overweight participants
to help them shed pounds through changing

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.340
their diets and exercise routines.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.590
And at the end of the day, whoever loses the
most weight is the winner.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.840
But since the series debuted in 2004, multiple
contestants have spoken out about the cruel

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.350
conditions behind the scenes.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.650
They allege that the workouts often lasted
around eight hours every day.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.180
And that, while the show talks about the importance
of cutting calories, the crew took this idea

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.350
to the extreme, leading to some people becoming
severely ill, even malnourished.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.400
Apparently, staffers said that anyone who
spoke up would be edited to look like a whiner.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.670
After failing to maintain the facade of empowerment,
it turns out that the biggest loser is everyone.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.890
The Bachelorette
We all want the storybook romance for ourselves,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.360
but there are big risks associated with falling
in love.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.500
Broken hearts, shattered egos, and nights
wasted waiting by the phone.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.090
It’s much safer to just sit back and watch
it happen to someone else.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.660
And thanks to the creators of The Bachelorette,
we can do that from the comfort of our living

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.660
rooms.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.640
One bachelorette looks for her soulmate amongst
a pool of about 25 hopefuls.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.690
They go on romantic group dates that usually
end in disaster, but there is the occasional

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.740
adorable moment.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.210
However, previous contestants have accused
the show of roadblocking the majority of the

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.210
romance.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.120
Creator Mike Fleiss has admitted that his
endgame is to create good television, not

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120
play matchmaker.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.900
Pimp My Ride
For a lot of people, their first vehicle is

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.900
a rite of passage.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.490
And more often than not, it’s a clunker
that barely gets the driver from point a to

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.490
point b.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.800
Auto maintenance doesn't come cheap, so it’s
often more practical to accept its quirks

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.800
instead.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.890
But, for a brief period of time between 2004
and 2007, there was a small chance that Xzibit

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.170
would show up at your house and whisk your
car away to his friends at West Coast Customs.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.890
Winners of Pimp My Ride had the pleasure of
having their cars “pimped”.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.870
After a brief personality analysis, a team
of mechanics come up with crazy ideas for

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.390
add-ons and enhancements.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.780
Then reveal the finished work to the owner.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.950
The show boasts about a one week turnaround
time for each car, but some winners have said

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.430
the upgrades actually took months.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.360
Plus, most people had to remove the mods because
they made the vehicles unsafe to drive.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.380
Also, the team doesn’t even touch the engine.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.780
Survivor
Charlie Parsons took the old “stranded on

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.650
a desert island” conversation and turned
it into an empire called Survivor.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.610
Since the year 2000, viewers have been tuning
in to watch as the tribes battle hunger, and

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.350
each other, in a series of tests.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.430
Alternating between physical and mental, whatever
tribe loses the challenge votes on which teammate

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.430
they want to send home.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.010
In the show’s inaugural season, contestant
Stacey Stillman was the third person to be

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.010
cut from the team.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.450
She then sued on the grounds that producers
were tampering with the voting process, arguing

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.710
that if they hadn’t interfered she might
have won.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.830
That case was decided privately, but producer
Mark Burnett admits that some things were

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.830
fake.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.820
The aerial and establishing shots were done
using stand-ins, that’s why we never see

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.670
any pesky cameramen in the background.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.800
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.120
Did we miss any other reality TV lies?
