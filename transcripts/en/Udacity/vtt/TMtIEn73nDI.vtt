00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.370
Here's an illustration of
the workflow of intrusion detection

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.620
as well as the main components of
an intrusion detection system.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.010
The input on an IDS is
data that describes

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.630
activities on systems and network.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.370
The data is processed by the data
processor to extract activity records.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.440
They are important for
security analysis this activity data

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.730
needs to be analyzed by
the detection engine.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.790
The detection engine uses detection
models that have been already

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.260
constructed for the ideas that is
these models are stored with ideas.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.072
If a detection rule determines
that there is an intrusion.

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:45.140
The IDS produces an alert.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.210
The decision engine then
decides the appropriate action

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.625
according to decision table.

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:54.812
For example, this can be a response
that automatically blocks

00:00:54.812 --> 00:01:00.000
a network connection or report that
is sent to the security admin.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.550
Again, for the IDS to work properly,
we'll assume that system

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.940
activities are observable and are
captured in the input data to the ideas.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.000
And when detection models are applied
to the activity data, normal and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.500
intrusive activities
have distinct evidence.
