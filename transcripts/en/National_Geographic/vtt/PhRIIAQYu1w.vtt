00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.300
The wolf is the
world's largest dog--

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.900
a top predator and
an iconic animal that

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.567
roamed freely across North
America for tens of thousands

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:10.700
of years.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.600
But in the early 20th
century, a ruthless war

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.433
was waged against these
cunning carnivores in an effort

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.533
to stop them preying
on livestock.

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.900
This resulted in the gray wolf
being almost completely wiped

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.367
out in the continental US.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.500
But then, in 1995,
a controversial wolf

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.100
recovery program
began in Yellowstone

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.000
with surprising results.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.734
Here's my journey in search
of America's elusive canine.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:40.066
[music playing]

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.500
[eagle screeching]

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:54.467
This is the most remote area in
the contiguous United States.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.934
The world's first
national park--

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:57.867
Yellowstone.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.100
I'm landing at Lone
Mountain Ranch.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.834
It's a National
Geographic Unique Lodge.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.734
I'm just a short drive
away from Yellowstone

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:12.800
National Park, where there
is an abundance of wildlife.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.300
5,000 bison.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.600
And then they've got grizzly
bears, and also wolves.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.800
And that is the animal that
I'm going in search of.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:31.000
Wolves were effectively
wiped out in Yellowstone,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.533
eradicated for
more than 70 years

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.700
after a bounty was
put on their head.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
Without this apex
predator, the balance

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.133
of Yellowstone's ecosystem was
thrown completely out of whack.

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.467
Animals overgrazed.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.900
Trees and grasses vanished.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.867
Vast tracts of the once-great
wilderness were stripped bare.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:56.734
Today, there are about 100
wolves roaming Yellowstone

00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.400
National Park, a sprawling
territory more than three

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.300
times the size of Rhode Island.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.266
The wolves are out there,
but they're hard to find,

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:07.934
which is why we're hooking
up with Doug Smith.

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:12.700
Doug is the lead wolf
biologist in Yellowstone.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.400
How you doing?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.300
Welcome to Yellowstone.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.133
Oh, thanks very much.

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:16.000
Yeah.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.834
We got a good day.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:18.000
Fresh snowfall.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.300
This is wolf weather.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.233
I got a crew on that
butte right there right

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.266
at this moment tracking wolves.

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:24.367
PHIL KEOGHAN: What
are the chances

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.767
of us seeing a wolf near?

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.500
DOUG SMITH: Well, it's
really hard to find them.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.467
I'm just going to do a
listen, this plateau here.

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.333
PHIL KEOGHAN: You can actually
work out where they are.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:35.667
That's kind of cool.
DOUG SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:37.433
Well, with these wolves,
we collared in December.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:42.000
And they've been
hanging around here.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.400
I'm not getting a signal here.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.633
Yeah, Jack.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.233
Do you have any
visuals up there?

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:55.467
PHIL KEOGHAN: So
they're all around us,

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.300
but trying to pick them out
of the wilderness is tough.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.200
But we'll go out and
see what we can find.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.333
All right, sounds good.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.767
[atmospheric music]

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:09.700
Yeah, there's some
bison tracks here.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.567
Some elk as well.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.667
That's mostly what
the wolves are after.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.233
They don't like prey
on the bison so much,

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:18.700
I think for obvious reasons.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.734
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:20.367
Size matters.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.266
DOUG SMITH: It does.

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:22.900
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.633
Doug.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.667
Off in the distance
there, bison.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.000
Wow, man.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.333
[tense music]

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.900
They may look docile, but
bison are one of Yellowstone's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.300
most dangerous inhabitants.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.100
With adults weighing over
a ton, they're the largest

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.266
land mammal in North America.

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:47.633
Despite their size,
they're incredibly agile

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.734
and can reach speeds
up to 35 miles an hour,

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:56.266
and have a history of charging
humans if they feel threatened.

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.934
DOUG SMITH: We're going to
have to belly around them.

00:03:58.934 --> 00:03:59.834
Skirt around them.

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:00.667
Yeah.

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:01.533
I like that idea.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.266
Yeah.

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:11.767
PHIL KEOGHAN: So it's
a 2-million-acre park.

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:14.433
And how many wolves in all
of Yellowstone, do you think?

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:15.834
DOUG SMITH: About 100.

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:17.367
PHIL KEOGHAN: So that's
a pretty tough challenge.

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:18.367
DOUG SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:19.834
Well, we radio collar them.

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:22.834
All our studies are based
upon having marked wolves.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.467
PHIL KEOGHAN (VOICEOVER):
Doug and his team

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:32.367
can only keep
track of the wolves

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:33.633
if they catch and collar them--

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:35.900
PHIL KEOGHAN
(VOICEOVER): --which

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.266
they do once a year midwinter.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:41.100
PHIL KEOGHAN: You got it?

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.800
DOUG SMITH: This is a
standard VHF collar.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.133
The pups, we can't put
the collar on too tight.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:49.066
It will still grow.

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:51.533
We do a full physical
exam, and these

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:55.633
are fully-developed adult teeth,
and there's not much wear here.

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:57.867
This is a wolf probably
in the prime of its life.

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:00.200
PHIL KEOGHAN (VOICEOVER):
Monitoring the wolves' growth--

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.700
DOUG SMITH: 122.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.433
PHIL KEOGHAN (VOICEOVER): --as
well as taking blood samples

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.433
provides important
data of the pack's

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:09.467
overall health, genetic makeup,
and exposure to disease.

00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:11.400
DOUG SMITH: A little
bit of mange here.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.700
This pack's been
suffering from that.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.700
This is a two-year-old.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.934
She bred this year--

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.500
we think from field
observations--

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.900
so its teats are
larger than normal.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.467
PHIL KEOGHAN (VOICEOVER): With
the birth of each new cub,

00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:26.867
or the death of an elder,
the pack's numbers fluctuate,

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:30.266
so Doug's team has to track
down these collared wolves again

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.500
in late winter.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.667
That's what we're doing now.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.734
But as I'm experiencing
firsthand, finding them

00:05:36.734 --> 00:05:39.033
is no simple task.

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:39.867
No signal.

00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:41.467
No signal, OK.

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:43.367
But I'm hearing the plane, so
that's probably our best bet.

00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:44.867
Wait and see what they get.

00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:46.567
Plane always gets them.

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:49.800
He's got an antenna strapped
to the strut of the wing

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.133
to track the wolves.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.700
So when he gets them,
he's going to call us.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.834
That's right here.

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.433
So that big white slope
is where another pack is.

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:12.633
That's Upper Hill Roaring.

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:21.500
So we've got two packs
stacked up right here.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.867
So we're surrounded by
wolves, but can't see any.

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.166
Welcome to wildlife biology.

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:27.700
[chuckles]

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.967
All right, let's see if we
can help the crew find them.

00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:31.066
Yeah.

00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:33.500
[atmospheric music]

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:38.166
DOUG SMITH: See if you see
a bone or something exposed.

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:40.734
That's what we're looking for.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.000
And you know what?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.100
That's ribs.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.300
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.333
DOUG SMITH: A dead elk.

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:47.500
PHIL KEOGHAN: He got eagle-ized.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.033
DOUG SMITH: You
want to pull it up?

00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:50.000
PHIL KEOGHAN: [grunts]

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.667
DOUG SMITH: There you go.

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:53.367
Yeah.

00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:54.900
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, wow.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.000
The way these rib bones are
bitten right off, that would

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.333
be the work of a wolf?

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:01.333
DOUG SMITH: Or coyote.

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:03.734
So this would
have been, how big?

00:07:03.734 --> 00:07:07.300
Oh, Jesus, this is
a full-grown bull elk.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.767
So we're talking--

00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:10.467
750 pounds.

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:11.800
And this is all that's
left, pretty much?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.000
Well, there's going to
be other bones in here.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.600
I don't know if we'll find more.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.834
PHIL KEOGHAN: Ah, there's a
lot of blood in there, look.

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:22.533
This is proof positive
that these wolves killed it,

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:23.834
and it bled.

00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:26.500
And it goes into the snow,
and that is something we use

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.500
as a tip that it was killed.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.333
I guess we're a
little late to dinner.

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:32.333
DOUG SMITH: We are.

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:34.300
We're going to keep working.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.467
PHIL KEOGHAN
(VOICEOVER): Just when

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:37.467
it seems we may
never encounter any

00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:39.266
of these reclusive predators--

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:41.233
DOUG SMITH: Wait a second, Phil.

00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:42.433
PHIL KEOGHAN
(VOICEOVER): --Doug gets

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:44.800
a tip from a fellow ranger.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.867
And so what was her tip?

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:47.033
It was just down the road here?

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.433
DOUG SMITH: Yes.

00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:50.367
In the middle of Lamar
Valley, the pack of wolves

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:52.133
is visible on a kill.

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:53.500
But we'll see if we can find it.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.500
PHIL KEOGHAN: Sounds good.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.467
Maybe on top of that mound.

00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:01.333
DOUG SMITH: I'm
trying to get set up.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:03.667
[foreboding music]

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.166
There's only three wolves.

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:12.433
And I'm just trying to
see if I can get glimpses.

00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:14.433
PHIL KEOGHAN: So we're
looking a mile and a half

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:18.100
away to try to pick
out a wolf that is

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.700
pretty camouflaged out there.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.333
Yeah.

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:23.867
[foreboding music]

00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:25.633
Damn, I'm not finding him.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.400
PHIL KEOGHAN: So
Doug, this could

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.266
be our last shot at this, huh?

00:08:31.266 --> 00:08:32.834
DOUG SMITH: It might be.

00:08:32.834 --> 00:08:36.033
I mean, wait a second, Phil.

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:38.000
You should check this out.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.600
[uplifting music]

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.700
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh,
yeah, I got them.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.700
Oh, wow.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.233
Wow, that is amazing!

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.000
DOUG SMITH: They're
single file on a trail,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.066
classic wolf travel.

00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:55.433
Looks like a scent
trail around, maybe.

00:08:55.433 --> 00:08:56.400
A little bathroom break.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.533
PHIL KEOGHAN: [chuckles]

00:08:58.467 --> 00:09:00.934
Wow, that is spectacular stuff.

00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:02.467
They really are moving.

00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:04.367
Yeah.

00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:06.934
She's in deep snow now.

00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:08.300
Changing the lead here.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.834
I can't believe we
picked out two wolves

00:09:13.834 --> 00:09:15.300
maybe a mile and a half away.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.567
DOUG SMITH: Yeah.

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:20.834
Now, there should be a third.

00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:24.266
The third wolf in their
pack might be over there.

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:30.100
PHIL KEOGHAN: Whoa, hold on.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.834
Is that a wolf?

00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:34.667
On the ridge!

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:35.900
DOUG SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.800
She's momma of
that other female.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.400
[howling]

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.867
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh my god.

00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:42.533
You can hear it howling.

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:43.734
Amazing.

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:45.934
You know, there's three
ways to experience a wolf.

00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:47.800
You see it, you
see their tracks.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.600
But hearing them howl is by
far the best of the three.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.700
[howling]

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:57.500
PHIL KEOGHAN: Whoa,
there they go.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.100
DOUG SMITH: They
picked her howl up.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.033
PHIL KEOGHAN: So they're headed
over towards their momma now?

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:01.934
Yeah.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.834
They're looking for her.

00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:07.934
Big part of wolf life
is their social nature.

00:10:07.934 --> 00:10:10.300
This is just extraordinary.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.700
This is what we came for.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.767
DOUG SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:15.533
I mean, I can't believe
how lucky you got.

00:10:15.533 --> 00:10:18.367
[howling]
