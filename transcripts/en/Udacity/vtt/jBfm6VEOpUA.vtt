We have our strawberry liquid. I have my alcohol. I'm going to uncap it. I want

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.390
you come in close, so you can see what I'm doing. Now, I've got my pink

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.930
liquid. I'm going to add about an equal volume

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.850
of the alcohol to the glass. And I

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.510
want to slowly pour it down the side. Really

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.520
carefully, so as not to disturb what's going on.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.090
Now if I do this right, I should have a nice layer of alcohol laying on top of

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.900
my strawberry liquid. And I don't know if you can see it clearly yet. But right

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.860
there in the liquid. In what we call

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.670
the interface. There's some cloudy material showing up. And

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.690
so I'm going to take my fork. You put

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.536
it inside. And I'm going to swirl. Now if you

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:56.491
come in over top of me here, what you'll notice. If you did this

00:00:56.491 --> 00:01:02.939
well, you see what's attached at the bottom of my fork? That's DNA right there.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.700
So I'm going to put it back in, spool it around a little bit more,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.480
and pull it right out, and there you have it. Now, it's time for you to take

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.530
a picture, that you can put on Facebook, of you and your DNA.
