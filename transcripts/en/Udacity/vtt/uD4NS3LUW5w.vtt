00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well first of all it's got to be tall. If it's not tall, the building will be hit before our object is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's got to be conducting, if it isn't conducting, well, no charge will flow through it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and will be pretty difficult to entice lighting to strike our object, and finally it's got to be grounded.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We got to disperse all of this electrical charging energy somehow, and the way

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we're going to do that is by dumping it into the earth to the ground, and so there you have it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We've basically solved the problem, so let's go to Professor Fregonese

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
one more time and see what he has to say.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Franklin Benjamin idea was to discharge clouds as there is an effect called the effect of points.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Points have the property of discharging electricity, so this was Franklin's idea.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It was put in practice, but it doesn't work this way. It catches the lightning, so to say.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The explanation is a bit complicated.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It produces modifications of the electrical field and then it is important

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that it conveys the electricity through a conductor avoiding the circuit through the building.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It conveys electricity to the earth so discharge it to the earth.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The earth receives the electricity of lighting because it is a very big body,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and so it can receive an extra amount of electricity.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
At the time of Benjamin Franklin, it was thought as a sort of general receiver of the electricity.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There you have it. We've invented the lighting rod. Good work!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And all the lighting rod is a large conducting pole

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
placed in your building or on top of your building with a wire running along the side,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and it must be properly grounded, and what happens is when a storm cloud comes over head,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it draws but we can think of this as drawing positive charge up.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Really what it's doing is forcing negative charge into the earth,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but it creates a really strong electric field in this region,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and the lighting instead of striking the house--it will strike our pole and life is good.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No more buildings get burn down.

00:02:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Amazing! Good work Benjamin Franklin and good work to you.
