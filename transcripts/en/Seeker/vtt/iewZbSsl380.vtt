00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.020
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Harry’s.[a]

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.530
Cleanliness is close to Godliness, or so those
Midwestern Mom's used to tell me, but does

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.330
that mean dirtiness is close to devilishness?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.389
Yep.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.459
It does.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.500
Thanks, science!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.449
My mother HATES it when people aren't clean
in movies.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.800
Seriously, during Lord of the Rings, she liked
it at the beginning, but as they went on was

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.919
all like, "Why can't they just take a bath?

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.119
They're all so dirty!"

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.670
It's a running joke at home, but science seems
to indicate she might have tapped into a little

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.250
piece of human nature.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.780
A new study published in Organizational Behavior
and Human Decision Processes found the simple

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.610
act of being clean promotes ethical behavior,
while being disgusted will make us lie and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.610
cheat.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.170
The emotion disgust is a complicated one,
its roots are in revulsion, unpleasantness,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.180
and can be tied to some phobias and anxiety
disorders.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.670
When people feel disgust, according to the
findings of this study, they'll try and protect

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.940
themselves and their logical brain doesn't
interfere -- it's a self-protection instinct.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.670
According to their findings, this instinct
lets normally ethical people lie to protect

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.360
themselves; or, in the case of their experiments,
for financial gain.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.390
They figured the best way to avoid revulsion,
would be to introduce them to cleaning products

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.490
and cleanliness -- and it worked.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.330
In people who were asked to evaluate cleaning
products, or just to think about cleanliness,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.440
the disgust was diminished and they didn't
lie as much.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.070
This isn't the first study into emotions affecting
decision-making.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.290
A 2009 study in Psychological Science found
people whose office smells cleaner will be

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.180
more ethical too!

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.690
Because the office workers feel more comfortable
and all they did in that study was spritz

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.080
the room with window cleaner.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.479
It even increased interest in charitable donation
with 22-percent of those in the "clean" room

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.630
expressing interest as opposed to six percent
in normal room.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.159
We'd love to see our decisions as independent
from outside influence, but that doesn't seem

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.510
to be the case at ALL.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.950
And it's not just smelling clean or thinking
about cleanliness.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.659
A study done at the University of Amsterdam
in 2009 found people who held heavy clipboards

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.370
took things more seriously than those holding
light ones.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.450
They literally gave more WEIGHT to things.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.819
Not even a metaphor!

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.120
// I mean, it is a metaphor… but…

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.659
Sitting in a dimly lit place, or wearing even
sunglasses, can ALSO affect our decision-making.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.090
Another study by the same researchers found
people in a dimly lit room would lie about

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.220
how many tasks they've completed in order
to get a larger monetary reward.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.950
Being shrouded makes people feel anonymous,
and that anonymity makes people less ethical

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.569
and more self-interested as well!

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.730
This all makes me think of dirty, dim bars
and how much debauchery goes on there.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.609
Maybe for reasons related to these studies?!

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.859
Opposed to that... those super-clean rooms
of the future make me feel a bit uneasy, like…

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.139
i'm too unethical for that!

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.329
Maybe mom had it right all along, in another,
related study, the same researchers determined

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.019
that people who had just done something unethical
felt physically dirty and cleansing themselves

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.739
made them feel better… so maybe I should
go shower.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.739
Thanks, Mom.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.019
Speaking of grooming, it is currently the
month of Movember.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.140
And if you’re keeping that nice big fat
moustache all neat and trim, Harry’s can

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.719
meet your shaving needs.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.610
A big shout out to Harry's.com for sponsoring
this episode.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.040
Harry's was started by two guys who thought
buying razors was crappy.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.249
They bought up a blade factory in Germany,
because German efficiency, and are selling

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.569
you their high-quality German blades on their
website!

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.450
They also have real nice face moisturizer
and shave gel, the ladies think it smells

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.469
nice.

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.159
Have you ever noticed these mental biases?

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.819
Are you going to find the darkest.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.969
dirtiest bar you can think of this weekend?
