00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:14.757
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:15.590
Thank you very much.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.690
And again, certainly a
diverse series of talks today.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.180
So we're going to look
at a bit of the universe

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.180
inside our own bodies,
opposite of what

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.620
we've been seeing before.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.410
And I want to just, before
we get into that, just

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.580
tell you a bit about how
I got into this myself.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.670
Basically, it was about--

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.000
at about 3,000 metres.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
I was doing something called
ski touring in Italy, which

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.625
is a strange, rather silly sport
where you walk up for six hours

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.830
and you ski down for an hour.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.600
And it's very tiring.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.260
And that last day, and I
was really not feeling well,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.250
and I started falling
all over the place.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.910
And I thought, oh, this is
just the end of a long week.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.750
Got to the bottom.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.520
And I had double vision.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
And this persisted.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.840
And being a medical doctor,
I realised this wasn't good

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.680
news--

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.830
that it was either MS, brain
tumour, or some form of stroke.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.840
None of them were
particularly great.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.680
And so after very stressful
few months of scans and things,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.970
it turned out I had a very
small occlusion, micro stroke,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.760
if you like, of
one of the vessels

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.380
supplying the eye nerves.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.900
Now, my blood pressure went up.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.590
And suddenly, I went from being
healthy to being, like most

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.830
people, slightly unhealthy
with some disease,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.270
taking tablets, and wanting
to improve my health.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.670
And I thought, I'm a doctor.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.290
I've been studying obesity,
genetics for 20 years.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.110
It should be fairly
straightforward to work out

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.050
the best way to lose weight
and exactly what to eat.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.190
And I was completely mistaken.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.810
Nothing could be harder.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.090
And when you went
to the internet,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.820
you were faced with masses
of quackery and obsessional

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.090
religious groups stating
that their way was the only

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.490
true path to salvation.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.260
And also even the government's
own advice, the Public Health

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.020
England advice about nutrition.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.850
Yes, it contains
some facts which

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.080
were accepted by everybody--
eat more plants and vegetables,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.760
eat a bit less of it, eat less
processed foods and less sugar.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.510
But at least half of it
was extremely contentious

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.270
and without any evidence
base, such as eat less salt,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.050
have more starchy
foods, eat regularly

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.380
small amounts and often
rather than in short periods.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.250
Have food supplements and use
artificial sweeteners rather

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.150
than sugar, and above
all, count calories.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.300
And all this is without
any real evidence base.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.010
Some of it has
actually been disproven

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.760
by other randomised trials.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.160
So the whole idea, really,
of the last 40 years

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.700
in nutrition and telling
people to count calories

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.530
has been totally flawed.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.040
Even the most hardened,
obsessional nutritionist cannot

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.380
possibly count
their own calories.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.360
Even if they read all
the labels and you only

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.400
shop from a place
that's counted it,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.920
even those have
huge errors in them.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.800
So if we've been
counting calories

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.970
and obesity rates have
been going up threefold

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.580
over the last 40 years,
something's very wrong.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.580
So this was all telling
me at the same time

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.477
as I was working on another
field from the twins

00:03:43.477 --> 00:03:45.310
that there might be
something else going on.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.410
And that's something
else that to explain

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.390
all these discrepancies.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.600
And what this was was for me
the understanding that there's

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.970
a new organ in our bodies--

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.070
a newly discovered organ that
we call the microbiome, which

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.910
is the community of microbes
that live in our bodies,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.930
on our bodies.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.660
We're surrounded by it
everywhere in this room.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.740
But in ourselves, 99% of them
live in our lower intestines.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.339
And this community which
includes bacteria, fungi,

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:24.330
viruses, and other organisms
called archaea and protists all

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.840
live together just like
they do in your yoghurt

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.550
in their nice, happy groups.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.840
And the best way to think
of them is as a new organ.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.690
And together they
have as many cells--

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.460
they have many
organisms as there

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.380
are cells in our own body.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.760
And they have maybe
1,000 times more genes.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.110
And each of those genes
is capable of being

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.330
a chemical factory
that can pump out

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.080
all kinds of chemicals,
proteins, hormones

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.830
that our body lacks.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.817
And so we can't
live without them.

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.400
And we've really
rediscovered recently

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.940
how important they are
to all facets of our life

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.030
and particularly how it
interacts with our diet.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.990
Now, no two people are the same.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.480
All of you would share
99.5% of your genes

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.940
with each other, your DNA.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.810
And in fact, you can turn
around to everybody in this room

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.370
and say, isn't it great,
we're all fifth cousins.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.480
Some of you might be third or
fourth cousins, really close.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.680
And so we realise that
actually as a group of people,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.510
we're very similar.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.050
But if I asked you to
compare your microbiomes,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.630
you wouldn't be anywhere
near fifth cousins.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.480
You'd probably like
tenth or twelfth cousins.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.170
Because you'd only share
about 25% of your microbes

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.970
with each other.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.030
And all of you are going to
have very individual microbes--

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.660
unique microbes only to you.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.030
And so for some reason,
they like only you.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.090
They don't like your neighbour.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.660
And you should be privileged
that they've decided to take

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.630
hold in your bodies,
not someone else's.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.390
Because generally,
these things are good.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.520
And this individuality
explains why there isn't really

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.910
one diet fits all.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:23.460
It explains why when you put
identical twins on diets,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.710
as they've done here, as well as
differences between the twins,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.590
you also see differences
in the population--

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.830
fourfold differences in how
people will gain or lose weight

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.180
on exactly the same food.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.180
And we've all seen that.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.520
We've all seen some people that
seem to do very differently.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.120
And they say, I
only eat lettuce.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.260
And the other one says, oh, I
eat masses of cake every day.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.550
And we've always said all that
must be genetic or metabolism

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.300
or something weak.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.690
But it turns out genes
don't explain much of it.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.480
And most of that can be
explained by the differences

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.460
in our microbes.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.553
Now, these microbes do
all kinds of things.

00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:02.970
I'm not going to
explain all this.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.130
But just to open the scope
of what these guys can do.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.018
They can alter whether
you're likely get an allergy.

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:14.060
And we're in an epidemic,
if you haven't noticed,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.770
of food allergy at the
moment in young people.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.200
Whereas, I didn't know
anyone when I went

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.490
to school who had food allergy.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.150
Now, everyone's got it.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.340
And these microbes are
the keys to allergy,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.470
about how our immune system
recognises threats and gets it

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.190
wrong or right.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.760
Also, they can change
chemicals in the brain making

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.220
you hungrier or thirstier
or choose certain foods.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.640
Certainly in
insects, they can do

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.220
that-- decide what
you want to eat.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.500
They can also alter your mood.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.450
They produce metabolites
like serotonin,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.550
which are responsible for
anxiety and depression.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.590
And many drugs
are based on that.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.410
Then they can do all kinds
of things about controlling

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.410
whether your gut
is leaking or not

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.280
or all kinds of other systems
of how you digest foods.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.500
So it's huge.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.220
And we're just at the
tip of the iceberg,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:17.250
really, about discovering all
the things that these guys do.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.680
Now, to summarise masses
of science into one picture

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.250
is tricky.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.200
But I'm at a stage in
life where I can do this

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.590
without people telling me off.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.072
Because people say, well,
what is this microbiome stuff?

00:08:34.072 --> 00:08:34.780
I've heard of it.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.600
But every study varies a bit.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.049
And is there really
one microbe that

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:41.760
is responsible for one disease?

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.559
And the reality is no.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.640
The studies do differ.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.320
They've been relatively small.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.850
But there are some
consistencies.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.470
What we find in
every single study

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.170
where we compare a group
of people with a disease--

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.850
say, it's diabetes
or it could be

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.710
colitis or a food allergy or
Parkinson's or depression,

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.010
whatever it is--

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.100
with another group
that's super healthy,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.830
we always find that the
group with the disease

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.430
have a less diverse
microbiome community.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.480
They have less species.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.350
If you count them up, there just
aren't those number of plants,

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.280
if you like.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.270
And so that's why I've used
the analogy here of the garden.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:27.150
The English country garden is
what you would like to have.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.170
So you guys are
all super healthy.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.520
You've got English country
garden type microbes.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.980
Lots of different species all
interacting with each other

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.530
in a fertile soil that
contains both fungi.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.900
It's got microbes.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.620
And everything's
feeding off each other.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.120
For any keen gardeners who will
know what I'm talking about,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.020
that all those
nutrients are used.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.600
It's all being recycled.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.700
And it's very hard for invaders
to come in and take over.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.390
Whereas, the sick
people, their guts

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.670
look like an Arizona backyard.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:04.440
A bit of toxic waste, a few
nasty bugs there taking over.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.230
It's very easy to
transform that.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.430
And you can just visualise
how a number of products,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.390
helpful products, produced
in an Arizona backyard

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.990
are much less than in your
English country garden.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.290
They're producing all kinds
of aromas and chemicals

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.780
and things for all the
insects and the roots.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.450
And everything is
far more productive.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.780
So the more you've got of
these guys, the better it is.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.890
That's the main key here.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.430
Now, we did something
called a citizen science

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.680
project for the last few years
with our American cousins.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.030
And this was people who
were interested in their gut

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.850
microbes, were donating--
they were paying

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.710
for their own research really.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.520
And you can still do this if you
join the British Gut Project.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.860
You pay a small donation.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.970
And then you give a small
donation of your poo.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.430
We call it poo in the Post.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.320
And you send it back to us.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.500
And we sequence it genetically.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.570
In the same way we would
look at your genes,

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.860
we look at the microbes.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.960
And that's how we discover
what all these species are.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.590
Then we put it all
together in big computers

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.380
and start looking
at these patterns.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.630
And this is of 11,000 people.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.150
And we can clearly
show some patterns.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.420
We can clearly show differences
between Americans and Brits

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.362
just based on their microbes.

00:11:28.362 --> 00:11:30.320
And we can tell differences
between Northerners

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.810
and Southerners and
of people living

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.510
in the country and
people in towns.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.755
Now, we can't go to the
individual differences

00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:38.630
in terms of microbes.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.550
We can see those patterns.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.460
And the good news is
we're not quite as

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.860
unhealthy as the Americans.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.630
But I think we do pretty
badly on the world scale.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.370
And the one thing that
determined this summary gut

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.370
health, if you like, which
I'm calling diversity.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.140
We want maximum diversity.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.270
The number one thing we found
was not whether you are vegan,

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.365
not whether you are a
vegetarian, not whether you

00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:10.240
eat gluten free or
lactose free or any

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.440
of these other religions.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.980
But actually, just the
number of different plants

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.700
you ate every week.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.600
And I'm talking-- not just
you don't have to have--

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.880
that doesn't mean having 20
portions of kale every day.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.380
It means having different
seeds, different herbs,

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.720
different spices.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.690
And it's mixtures of
fruits and berries and nuts

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.850
and all these kind
of things together.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.027
Because each of those are
fuel for your microbes.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:42.860
And that was more
important than whether you

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.870
self-said I'm a vegetarian.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.530
I'm a vegan.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.060
I'm healthy.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.490
I'm a paleo person.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.550
I'm whatever.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.318
So that's the key.

00:12:50.318 --> 00:12:51.860
So you can do all
those other things,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.510
call yourself what
you want, as long

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.250
as you've got lots of
variety on your plate.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.500
You don't get caught in a rut.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.810
Now, the government tells
us to cut down on sugar

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.340
and they also tell us
to cut down antibiotics.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.940
And we know that antibiotics
are really bad for your guts.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.420
And today, they're
given out like Smarties.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.600
But we know that children
given antibiotics do get fatter

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.235
and do have more allergies.

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:22.360
It's very hard to avoid it.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.750
Because a lot of antibiotics
are in our food, in our meat,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.940
particularly if it's
cheap or processed meat.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.210
Emulsifiers come in
all kinds of sources.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.170
And we know that emulsifiers
in processed foods

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.410
do also influence your microbes,
make them stick together a bit,

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.850
stop them working.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.470
Preservatives, we
know less about.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:43.910
But we're worried about them.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.070
But we do know that
artificial sweeteners--

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.520
I don't know how
many people here

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.340
take an artificial
sweetener on the basis

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.100
that it's supposed
to be healthy?

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.390
Anyone admit to taking any?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.050
One of you.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.950
Well, there must be more than
that, but OK So generally,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:01.690
they're supposed to be inert,
not supposed to do anything.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.550
I went into metabolic
chamber and took

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.830
some sucralose which
is the commonest one

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.290
in the UK at the moment.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.570
And that's my-- you can
see my glucose went up.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.560
I was wearing a 24
hour glucose monitor.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.190
And so just having
sucralose it peaked.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.880
And this was telling me
that these things are far

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.390
from inert.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.307
And there a number of
studies now showing they

00:14:24.307 --> 00:14:27.670
reduce diversity and
increase metabolic signals.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.690
So our whole idea of what
foods are safe and non-safe

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.520
needs a new thought
when we start

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.890
to think about
our gut microbiome

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.390
as a novel organ in our bodies.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.920
As part of my book, The Diet
Myth, I did lots of studies.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:50.670
And I'd just come off a
rigorous three-day raw milk,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:51.810
French cheese diet.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.170
You've obviously
tried it yourselves.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:02.690
Helped down only with the help
of a little bit of red wine.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.410
And it was fantastic just
eating a Epoisse, Roquefort,

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.650
and Brie de Meaux, which are
three unpasteurized cheese you

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.900
can easily get in the UK.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.280
Because they have
extra microbes.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.072
And I was trying to
see if I could build up

00:15:16.072 --> 00:15:19.980
my microbes in just three days.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.440
I didn't, as a matter of fact.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.240
But I did enjoy very much
the day one of the diet.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.510
Day two, not so good.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.170
By day three, I'd really had
enough cheese for the week.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.560
I could tell you.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.190
And the next study
I was going to do

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.900
was to do the 10 days
McDonald's challenge.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.800
Bit of a contrast there.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.290
Only eat all my
meals at McDonald's.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.500
And I wasn't very
looking forward to it.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.720
Because I'm not a big fan.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.900
But I'd do anything
for science of course.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.400
And it turned out there was
someone better qualified

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:51.900
than me.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.700
Someone whow actually liked
eating burgers and fast food.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.080
He was a student.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.370
He was hard up for money.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.390
He was also my son.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.160
He ticked all those boxes.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.910
Fantastic.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.200
So Tom did this.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.382
And all his friends used to
follow him into the McDonald's

00:16:11.382 --> 00:16:12.840
and take pictures
of him because he

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.580
was getting all this free food.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.150
And the staff knew
him for those 10 days.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:27.780
But he came back to me after
just four days and said,

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.780
I'm really not
feeling very well.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.020
My friends say I'm
going a bit grey.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.090
And I think we
ought to stop now.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.670
And as a concerned
parent, obviously, I

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.320
was worried about his health.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.340
But said, no way.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.080
We're going to carry on.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.370
We're going to publish this
in the Sunday Times, which

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.740
is exactly what we did.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.620
And when we published it in--

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.320
after 10 days, he really
was feeling even worse.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.680
And we even noticed
even in him a drop

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.190
in his academic achievements,
which was something.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:07.200
But what was worse is he'd
lost 40% of his gut microbes.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.760
So his diversity had
plummeted in those 10 days.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.900
And, really, we had to ask
the reason why that was.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.050
Because the traditional view
of junk food if you like,

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.569
oh, it's just lots of
fat and lots of sugar.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:25.619
It's a very naive idea
and maybe chemicals.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.089
That's why you
shouldn't have it.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.490
But from a gut
microbe point of view,

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.670
what happens when you
have that kind of diet,

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.710
you're not getting
any fibre at all.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.180
They need fibre to live.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.290
The only fibre is a little green
gherkin that most kids throw

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.000
away anyway.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.710
So he had 10 days with virtually
no fibre and lots of fat

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.800
and lots of sugar.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.790
And I think it's that
imbalance that really messed up

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.790
the gut microbes, messed
up his gut health.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.680
And that's why we just need to
think differently about this.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.970
It's the lack of
something rather than

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.972
necessarily this idea that
these things are all toxic.

00:18:02.972 --> 00:18:03.930
We need to be stinkier.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.640
Because microbes are good.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.660
The more you've got
the healthier you are,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.820
the better you are.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.210
If we destroy them other ways,
then we're in real trouble.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.950
Now he stayed bad,
actually, for several years

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.790
as he kept reminding me
when he wanted more money.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.550
But I think we may have
finally sorted them out now.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.520
Now, that's just an end
of one study, obviously,

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.880
and an anecdote.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.630
In our twins that we
follow, half identical, half

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.040
non-identical, we followed
a group between 30 and 80,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.500
3,000 of them that we had
very close measurements over.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.830
Because this is the most
detailed study of twins

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.480
in the world that we run.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.130
And every few years they
come in for a test and a body

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.090
composition scan.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.820
And we saw that over that
time as usual middle age

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.380
most people gain weight--

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.960
very unusual not to.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.210
And those that had high
fibre lost less weight

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.490
and particularly
weight around the gut,

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.640
the internal visceral fat, than
those that are on low fibre

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.470
diets.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.530
And each extra gramme
of fibre people ate,

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.740
reduced their weight
gain by 2 kilogrammes.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.370
So even a tiny amount of change
in fibre seems to have a very

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.330
big effect.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.700
And this was related to
their microbial diversity.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.820
So we could directly
link what they

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.100
were doing with how it
was changing the microbes.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.080
So we seem to now have a better
understanding why fibre's good

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.580
for you.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.520
It's not the old days of,
oh, it's just roughage.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.990
It just passes
straight through you

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.250
and gets rid of toxins,
which I was taught--

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.960
the very physical presence
of it as a substance to

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.335
just cleared, scouring
out of the inside of it

00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:50.460
and cleared everything out.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.320
Now there's a real
metabolic understanding

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.270
that this stuff is there
fueling your microbes.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.730
We also looked at
the genetics of this.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.480
Because in our twin study,
virtually everything we look at

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.080
turns out to be genetic except
whether you like Mr. Bean

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.260
or what football
team you support.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.340
And this turned out to
be a bit of an exception.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.770
It's not very genetic at all.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.100
It's about 10% or so heritable.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.170
Some microbes are genetic.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.410
But the vast majority seem
to just go with environment

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.050
you live in and in your diet.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.030
That was important for us.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.010
Because it suddenly realised
the potential to change

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.230
your microbiome is much greater
than to change your genes.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.760
Now, the other
thing we looked at

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.280
was pairs of identical twins--

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.230
remember, these are
genetic clones--

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.860
where one was much bigger
than the other one.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.440
And you can't explain that
in terms of their upbringing,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.290
because they lived together
till the age of 18 generally.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.640
And you can't explain it
in terms of their genes,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.020
because they're identical
in every cell in their body.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.840
So this particular pair differed
by about 15 to 20 kilogrammes

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.030
over most of their adult life.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.890
And when we added
up these pairs,

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.590
we found that in
nearly all cases

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.380
the skinny one had
more diverse microbes

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.590
and had particular microbes
that liked them and not

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.030
their sister.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.560
And there are a
couple of these that

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.350
called Christensenella and
Akkermansia that we only

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.830
found in the skinny twin.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.290
And when we looked,
about 10% of people

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.130
have these
Christensenella microbe.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.020
And the people that
have it in high numbers

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.250
always tend to be
on the skinny side.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.250
And some people reported
they could eat whatever

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.950
they liked, snacking on things.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:40.820
They never got fat.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.300
Aren't they lucky?

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.160
And when we took these
microbes from the twins

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.450
and put them into mice we
could stop them getting fatter.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.750
Now, that shows you that it
isn't just an association

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.820
due to being skinny
or being fat.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.740
But actually, it's part
of the causal pathway.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.280
And this is the clever
thing about gut microbes

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.710
is you can do the
experiments in humans,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.768
but you won't know whether
it's cause or effect.

00:22:05.768 --> 00:22:07.310
And then you can
take those microbes,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.760
transplant them into these
animals and make them fat,

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.600
make them thin, make them
depressed, make them anxious,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.730
do all kinds of stuff to them--
change their immune systems.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.540
And this is why we know that
they're so important and not

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.630
just bystanders in
what's going on.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.290
So this is really important.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.780
And there are
companies now trying

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.150
to experiment with these
microbes putting them

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.620
into breakfast
cereals and things

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.463
so everyone can eat as much
as they like and stay thin.

00:22:34.463 --> 00:22:35.880
They haven't
succeeded yet though.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.460
That's how to do badly.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.340
How can you improve
your microbes, I guess,

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.540
is the other question.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.400
And I don't know if any of you
listen to the food programme

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.470
on Radio 4.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.900
So I went with Dan
Saladino to Tanzania

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.400
and an anthropologist
called Jeff Leach

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.890
who's been studying
the Hadza, who

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.950
are a tribe that have been
in this part of Tanzania

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.947
for about 10,000 years,
possibly 50,000 years,

00:23:08.947 --> 00:23:10.280
in exactly the same way of life.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.160
So they're one of the last
hunter gatherers on the planet.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.290
And they have 30% or 40%
more microbes than we have,

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.310
even the healthiest.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.458
And they don't get
chronic diseases.

00:23:23.458 --> 00:23:24.250
That don't get fat.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.270
They don't get diabetes.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.478
They don't get heart disease.

00:23:26.478 --> 00:23:27.730
They don't get cancer.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.490
They do fall out of trees
and have other injuries

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.370
and infections, et cetera.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.870
But they didn't have any of the
sort of allergies or disease

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:35.602
we have.

00:23:35.602 --> 00:23:37.060
So we think it's
their way of life.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.860
We think it's their microbes.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.580
And I went there for four
days to live with them,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.810
eat their meat, and
basically ate what they did--

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.340
no washing
facilities, obviously,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.530
in the middle of nowhere.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.230
And as well as a
fascinating time,

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.860
I did manage to improve
my microbes by about 20%

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.230
or so in terms of diversity.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.410
But there was only a
short-lived effect.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.580
So as I got back on
the airplane home

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.500
and started eating
airplane food,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.900
I think everything dropped
back to where it was.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.670
So I need to stay
there a bit longer

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.890
or keep going back
there for a top up.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.370
But it does show that by
changing diets and environment,

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:21.730
you can actually improve, to
some extent, your microbiome.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.530
A bit about what the
foods are good and bad

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.580
for your gut microbes.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.200
Everyone knows green vegetables
are good, high in fibre.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.810
And there are certain fibres
that are better than others.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.650
And the fibres-- well, at
least we've studied them more.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.530
And so the ones we've studied
is something called inulin which

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:47.280
is particularly in vegetables
such as artichokes,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.760
both Globe artichokes and
Jerusalem artichokes also known

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.720
as fartichokes that will
have masses of inulin, which

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.750
the microbes break
down and convert

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.230
into very helpful things
called short-chain fatty acids.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.230
So they're converting this as--

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.060
as I said, they're
chemical factories

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.770
converting the
chemicals in the plants

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.830
you eat into other
useful substances.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.970
So knowing which ones
these are-- onions, garlic,

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.470
leeks all have very high
amounts of these in it.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.840
And also we know the
legumes are useful.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.337
And then we have things that
also have lesser amounts

00:25:28.337 --> 00:25:30.420
of fibre and have other
things that are important.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.800
So in the past we've been
told that drinking coffee is

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.880
bad for you.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.500
Peanuts are bad for you.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.050
Red wine's bad for you.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.150
Olive oil's bad for you.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.070
But it turns out that
all these things--

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.890
and dark chocolate, bad for you.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.880
Turns out, the recent evidence
is that it's all good for you.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.160
But the reason it's all
good for you is not just we

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.580
got it all wrong before.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.360
It's because they all have
some chemical component in them

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.950
that the microbes use.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.350
And that's called polyphenols.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.500
OK so polyphenols
have been around.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.220
They used to be called
antioxidants, which was just

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.970
a general way of
scientists and doctors

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.970
pretending they knew what
they were talking about.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.250
Because no one
really understands

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.950
why these things were helpful.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.630
It was just a general
word for things

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.950
that mop up nasty things.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.980
But this is a much
better theory.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.310
Because these polyphenols, we
can't actually use ourselves,

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.860
but for the microbes
it's rocket fuel.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.023
They love polyphenols.

00:26:30.023 --> 00:26:30.690
They break down.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.220
They get these polyphenols.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.170
They use them as energy sources.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.680
And they then convert that
into other helpful chemicals

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.740
for the lining of our gut
and our immune system.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.720
So it's a good deal
basically we get.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.940
And that's why the
Mediterranean diet

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.400
is particularly good
for you because of all

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.640
these polyphenols,
despite the saturated fat

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.940
that traditionally
we're told to avoid.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.400
And then we've got a few
other things in here.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.770
So you can see
some yoghurt there.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.540
How many people here
have yoghurt every day?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.040
Wow.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.540
Look at you.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.577
You're like a commercial.

00:27:07.577 --> 00:27:08.910
How many people here have kefir?

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.940
Who hasn't heard of kefir?

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.070
Kefir is the new super yoghurt.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.120
You will have heard--

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.230
now you've heard about it.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.422
You'll start seeing it now.

00:27:24.422 --> 00:27:25.130
It's interesting.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.870
When I my book first came
out a couple of years ago,

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.120
no one had heard of kefir.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:35.210
And suddenly where I live in
Islington, it's in every shop.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.850
You can't move for bloody kefir.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.940
But basically it's
sour, fermented milk.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.670
And it has about five times more
microbes than the equivalent

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.080
amount of yoghurt.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.920
So do get used to it.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.380
If you like yoghurt, mix it up
and start having that as a top

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.910
up, if you want your microbes.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.080
How many people
here have kombucha?

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.720
I've got you there.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.400
Kombucha is the next level.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.400
once you've mastered
kefir, you go to kombucha

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.380
which is fermented tea.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.140
So basically you get a--

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.400
and it comes from Russia.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.820
And it's very big in California.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.000
But it's taken ages to get here.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.420
But it's a fantastic drink.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:20.140
And it has about two or
three times more microbes

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.423
even than kefir.

00:28:21.423 --> 00:28:22.590
And you have fungi in there.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.100
But three times the fungi.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.720
Basically you grow
this mould thing.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.120
It's called a mother.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.920
It's a bit like a
sourdough mother.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.660
And you put in your tea.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.570
And after 10 days, it
converts the sugary tea

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.080
into a really
refreshing drink that

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.350
has a slight sour
acetic acid taste.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.450
It's packed with good stuff.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:43.950
OK.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.262
So we're diverging slightly.

00:28:45.262 --> 00:28:46.720
I could do the
whole kombucha talk.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.230
But just to show you that
these interesting foods all

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.250
have this common theme.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.200
They're all really good
for your gut microbes

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.120
either as fuel or as providing
actual microbes themselves--

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.790
these probiotics.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:07.650
Meat eaters, how many
vegetarians in the audience?

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.930
Not many.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.550
That's probably generational.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.230
Now it's about one in six of
the population is vegetarian.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.573
Less a vegan, but a lot of
people are giving up meat.

00:29:20.573 --> 00:29:21.990
Because they say
it's bad for you.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.440
It's bad for the planet.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.520
They're partly correct.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.240
And most of the studies do
show a slight harm of red meat

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.810
over not eating meat.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.760
But it's mainly processed
meat that's particularly bad.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.040
But some people maybe
don't eat meat, fine.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.740
It turns out your microbes
can determine whether you're

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.500
someone who processes
meat in a healthy way

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.228
or you produce waste products
that give you heart disease.

00:29:47.228 --> 00:29:49.020
And so they've done a
number of studies now

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.880
that show that this is just
subtle difference in how

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.550
our microbes break down some
of the carnitine in meat

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.430
to other chemicals.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.513
It makes a big difference.

00:29:57.513 --> 00:30:00.570
And likely many other
examples of this what we call

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.370
personalised nutrition.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.440
This was just to show you--

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.500
there was a headline a few weeks
ago that probiotics don't work.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.420
Remember that?

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:13.920
No.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.930
Well, the idea that eating
yoghurt doesn't work,

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.030
because all the
microbes get destroyed.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.480
Turns out that's partly true.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.510
That most of the
microbes get destroyed.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.700
But if you have
a billion of them

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.590
they'll always be
100,000 or so that will

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.540
get through and replicate.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.850
But they don't hang
around in your gut.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.275
Basically, they're there
to act as chemical signals

00:30:35.275 --> 00:30:35.900
for the others.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.930
They stimulate all
the other microbes.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.770
And you get a big
metabolic difference.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.760
So when we start measuring not
the microbes, but the chemicals

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.800
they produce, we
see big differences

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.260
between yoghurt eaters
and non-yoghurt eaters.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:52.430
And those same metabolites,
they produce the chemicals

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.500
we've shown are actually
good at reducing

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.680
some of the internal fat
using our twin study.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.597
So it's just another
way of looking at it.

00:31:00.597 --> 00:31:02.180
Thinking of them as
chemical factories

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.490
makes you understand
a bit more why you're

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.660
going through all this
and why so many of you

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.660
are eating your yoghurt.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.670
Because you obviously
think it's good,

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.460
despite the government
telling you it's got fat in it

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.463
and you should avoid it.

00:31:14.463 --> 00:31:16.130
You should always
have the full-fat one,

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.943
by the way, not the
low-fat one if you want

00:31:19.943 --> 00:31:21.110
to get most of the benefits.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:31.980
Now, just closing up, there was
a study a couple of years ago--

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.870
have you heard of
glycemic index of food?

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.920
So this is on packets where
they tell you this is what

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.770
the carbohydrate content is.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:46.830
And if you want to avoid sugar
spikes and things like this,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.110
you should pick low GI foods.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.290
But it turns out that an Israeli
group studied this and found

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:56.220
that actually what was
more important than your GI

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.060
index of your food was what
your microbes were doing.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.660
So for some people, what's
good turns out to be bad.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.810
So for me, if I have
grapes, my blood sugar

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.440
goes up into a
diabetic range of 9.4.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.210
If I have bread, I shoot
up to about 11 or 12

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.770
which is not good.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.100
But I can have as
much pasta as I like.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.080
I can have as much
rice as I like.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.180
I can drink as much
beer or wine as I like.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.775
So I'm happy.

00:32:26.775 --> 00:32:28.400
As long as I don't
have too much bread.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.370
But I wouldn't know that if I
hadn't done my own experiments.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.760
And what we're
hoping is that we can

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.760
start to measure people's
gut microbes in order

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.680
to predict which foods they
should be preferentially

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.180
having.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.610
So everyone should get
some personal nutrition.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.310
We've started this
huge study in the UK

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.200
in our twins called
the Predict Study.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.620
And we've done 300
twins so far doing

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.650
this kind of two weeks of
logging all their foods,

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:59.430
looking at their sugars
with these glucose monitors.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.680
I've got one on at the moment.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.140
You can now wear
them for two weeks.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:08.090
This shows that one twin
spiked when they drank Prosecco

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.560
and the other one didn't.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.740
And one spiked with rice
and the other one didn't.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.430
And these are just small life
choices that you can make.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.070
But if you thought
about this regularly,

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.400
you would know this can make a
big difference over years just

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.640
by changing what your lunch was
or what your favourite drink

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.180
was.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.160
It's not like cutting
out huge food groups.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.640
It's just making small choices
that your microbes prefer.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.480
I found out that my average
lunch at the hospital

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.450
was tuna sandwiches on bread.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.930
Thanks for Marks and
Spencer for 10 years.

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.680
Because that's what
we had in the canteen.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.610
And I thought that was healthy.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.260
It's got a bit of
sweet corn in it.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.110
Turns out that was every single
time it was giving me a glucose

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.420
spike and probably
responsible for me

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.270
gaining 10 kilos over 10 years.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.075
If I'd known that
now, I would have been

00:33:56.075 --> 00:33:57.890
in much healthier position now.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.130
And so just these subtle
things of changing

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:03.680
what that carbohydrate is
can make a huge difference

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.000
to people's lives.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.950
So that's what my
particular research is

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.409
going for in the next 10 years.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:12.889
Now, if all this has failed
and you can't work out

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:19.409
how to improve, these tablets
might be the thing for you.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:22.250
They're frozen poo tablets.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.440
And you just have
to about 15 of them

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.190
and you get a total makeover.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:32.020
The Americans call
them crapsules.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.650
They're always very good with
the short, snappy phrases.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:38.110
But they're no longer
a laughing matter.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:41.440
Because they are the number
one treatment for a very severe

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.320
infection now called
recurrent Clostridium

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.800
difficile infection.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.000
People have too many antibiotics
get recurrent infections

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.770
and they can die.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.389
And people do die.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:55.420
But this has a 90% success.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.180
If you have a poo transplant
from someone who's

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:03.530
super healthy and you're
very sick, 90% recovery,

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.430
which is three times better
than the nearest current medical

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.480
treatment.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.060
It also works for
ulcerative colitis

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.320
to the same extent
as the latest drugs.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.480
And it's being tried in a
number of other conditions.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.630
And so we know very
little about it.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.100
It's a very crude
tool as you can

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.467
imagine in more ways than one.

00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:24.550
And everybody's different.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.180
So clearly we may have to match
donors and recipients in ways

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.883
we hadn't thought about.

00:35:29.883 --> 00:35:31.300
But they're using
it for all kinds

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.810
of interesting treatments,
including treating diabetes

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:35.960
and obesity, et cetera.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.440
So watch this space.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.360
Finally, just to
recap, I think if you

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.910
can think of your gut
microbes with this garden

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.310
analogy you can't go far wrong.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.190
It's a key aspect in nutrition.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:59.020
You've got to realise that
food is a series of chemicals.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.340
It's not carbohydrates, fat,
and protein and calories.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.160
Start thinking of
these as chemicals

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.130
that react with
other microbes there

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.620
to produce all this
these chemical reactions

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.700
which you need.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.920
And everyone needs more fibre.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.850
There's certain more
polyphenols, more fermented

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.830
foods.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.250
And we need to explore also
the reactions with medicines.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.560
Everybody reacts
differently with medicines

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.600
as they do with
their foods as well.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.600
And so none of this is being
tested by modern science yet.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.100
We haven't caught up.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.020
And, really, there's
huge potential

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.120
for personalised diets.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.130
And the one message I
want to leave you with

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.610
is diversity,
diversity, diversity.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:44.300
The more you can do
that, the better.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.070
And realise with 100
trillion microbes inside you,
