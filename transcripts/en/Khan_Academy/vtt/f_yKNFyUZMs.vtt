00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.547
- [Voiceover] A high school
class is measuring the amount

00:00:02.547 --> 00:00:05.066
of nitrate in a local stream.

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.108
To be considered safe to
drink, the maximum amount

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:13.067
of nitrate that can be present
in water is 10 milligrams,

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:16.245
10 milligrams per liter.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:20.594
The class takes a sample
of 15 liters of water.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:23.334
If the number of milligrams
per liter of nitrate

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:27.966
in the stream water is 3/4 of the maximum

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.173
that is safe to drink,

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:31.959
how many milligrams of nitrate
should the class expect

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:33.794
to find in their sample?

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:35.303
Alright, this is interesting.

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:38.960
So in this sample, in
this 15 liter sample,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.419
they find that the number of
miiligrams per liter of nitrate

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:45.131
is 3/4 of the maximum.

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:46.269
Well what's the maximum?

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:47.775
Well they tell us up here. They tell us.

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:48.779
Let me underline this because

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:51.339
the maximum amount of nitrate

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.658
that can be present in water
is 10 milligrams per liter.

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:58.763
So what the class finds is

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:01.787
that they find that their sample has 3/4

00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:03.389
of this maximum value.

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.187
So what's 3/4 of 10 milligrams per liter?

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:07.940
Let's just write that down.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.340
So the maximum is 10 milligrams per liter.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.508
In their sample they find 3/4
of this maximum concentration,

00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:18.086
so let's just multiply that.

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:20.803
You can multiply that times 3/4,

00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:22.579
which is going to be equal to what?

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.979
That is seven and 1/2
milligrams per liter.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.362
So that is 7.5 milligrams

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:32.359
per liter.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.408
The way I think about this,

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:35.289
3/4 of 100 is 75,

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.705
so 3/4 of 10 is going to be seven and 1/2.

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:38.933
You could have done it
other ways, you can say

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.508
10 times three is 30,

00:01:40.508 --> 00:01:42.795
30 divided by four is seven and 1/2

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:43.968
and you keep your units.

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:46.452
So this is the concentration
that they find,

00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:49.006
that they find in their sample,

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.653
7.5 milligrams per liter,

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.393
and they do this, they
find this concentration

00:01:54.393 --> 00:01:56.448
in 15 liters of water.

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:58.653
So the total number of
milligrams they find,

00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:02.008
well you take the liters
of water, 15 liters,

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.609
and then multiply that
times the concentration,

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.811
7.5 milligrams per liter.

00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:09.922
Now the units should work out,

00:02:09.922 --> 00:02:10.928
and they do indeed.

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:12.902
You have liter being divided by liter

00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:14.597
so those cancel out,

00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:19.345
and you're left with 15
times 7.5 milligrams.

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:22.552
So we just need to figure
out what 15 times 7.5 is,

00:02:22.552 --> 00:02:23.559
so let's do that.

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:28.314
So if you have 7.5 times 15,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.747
five times five is 25,

00:02:30.747 --> 00:02:35.726
five times seven is 35 plus two is 37,

00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:39.574
and then one times 75 is 75,

00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:41.815
so let's see, five plus zero is five,

00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:43.904
seven plus five is 12,

00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:47.306
and then four plus seven is 11,

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:50.870
and you have one digit
behind the decimal point,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.136
So, they would expect

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:56.359
to find 112.5 milligrams,

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.758
and there we go.
