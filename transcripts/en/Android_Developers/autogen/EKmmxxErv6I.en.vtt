writing your game in unity you probably
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.760
writing your game in unity you probably
have your c-sharp code sitting there on

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

that's why classes that start with I are

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770
that's why classes that start with I are
 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.870
that's why classes that start with I are
cool that's true classes start with IRA

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880
cool that's true classes start with IRA

so this is what you have to do to get
 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.040
so this is what you have to do to get
people to authenticate so this is the

people to authenticate so this is the
 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.870
people to authenticate so this is the
first step you have to get people to get

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880
first step you have to get people to get
 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.089
first step you have to get people to get
authenticated with the game with cool

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099

Play game services so this is typically

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780
Play game services so this is typically
 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.089
Play game services so this is typically
what you would do when when somebody

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099
what you would do when when somebody
 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:39.950
what you would do when when somebody
will click the sign-in button right yeah

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960
will click the sign-in button right yeah
 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.140
will click the sign-in button right yeah
but you know you can also call that on

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150
but you know you can also call that on
 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.670

you know we find that when you actually

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000
you know we find that when you actually
 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.029
you know we find that when you actually
pop that dialogue on startup more people

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039
pop that dialogue on startup more people
 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.740

loading from the cloud so how do you go

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:55.790
loading from the cloud so how do you go
 

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.670
loading from the cloud so how do you go
ahead and load data from the cloud to do

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680
ahead and load data from the cloud to do
 

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.350
ahead and load data from the cloud to do
that all you have to do is call load

00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360
that all you have to do is call load
 

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.800
that all you have to do is call load
state and then you pass in as you know

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.810
state and then you pass in as you know
 

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.780
state and then you pass in as you know
the cloud our cloud save service has

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:04.790
the cloud our cloud save service has
 

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.610
the cloud our cloud save service has
separate slots so we have currently have

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:06.620
separate slots so we have currently have
 

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.780
separate slots so we have currently have
four slots so you can have different

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:07.790
four slots so you can have different
 

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.550
four slots so you can have different
types of data in each of the slots in

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560
types of data in each of the slots in
 

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.410
types of data in each of the slots in
this example we're just using slot 0 for

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:11.420
this example we're just using slot 0 for
 

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.720
this example we're just using slot 0 for
simplicity just call load state passing

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.730
simplicity just call load state passing
 

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.100
simplicity just call load state passing
the slot number and then you pass in a

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.110
the slot number and then you pass in a
 

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.180
the slot number and then you pass in a
listener that's going to be called

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.190
listener that's going to be called
 

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.250
listener that's going to be called
whenever that load operation completes

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:18.260
whenever that load operation completes
 

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.319
whenever that load operation completes
with asynchronous savings of the clouds

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:20.329
with asynchronous savings of the clouds
 

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:22.150
with asynchronous savings of the clouds
very similar just call update state

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160
very similar just call update state
 

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.939
very similar just call update state
passing the slot number the data and D

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:24.949
passing the slot number the data and D
 

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:26.470
passing the slot number the data and D
the listener notice that the data is

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480
the listener notice that the data is
 

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.569
the listener notice that the data is
just a byte array so to us is completely

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:28.579
just a byte array so to us is completely
 

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:30.970
just a byte array so to us is completely
opaque we have no idea what what's

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:30.980
opaque we have no idea what what's
 

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.559
opaque we have no idea what what's
inside that that byte array so it's your

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:32.569
inside that that byte array so it's your
 

00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:35.230
inside that that byte array so it's your
your games responsibility to encode the

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240
your games responsibility to encode the
 

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.639
your games responsibility to encode the
data into a byte array and then decode

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:36.649
data into a byte array and then decode
 

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.680
data into a byte array and then decode
it later and be careful about different

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:38.690
it later and be careful about different
 

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.750
it later and be careful about different
platforms and now all the usual caveats

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760
platforms and now all the usual caveats
 

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.400
platforms and now all the usual caveats
about dealing with serialization of data

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:44.410
about dealing with serialization of data
 

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.960
about dealing with serialization of data
again this is the load on state loaded

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:46.970
again this is the load on state loaded
 

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.889
again this is the load on state loaded
listener that's going to be called

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:47.899
listener that's going to be called
 

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:51.340
listener that's going to be called
whenever the game set is saved so this

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:51.350
whenever the game set is saved so this
 

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.660
whenever the game set is saved so this
is what the own state loaded listener

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:52.670
is what the own state loaded listener
 

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.829
is what the own state loaded listener
looks like notice that there is one

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839
looks like notice that there is one
 

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:55.720
looks like notice that there is one
additional method there that's called on

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:55.730
additional method there that's called on
 

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.850
additional method there that's called on
state conflict and on state conflict is

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:57.860
state conflict and on state conflict is
 

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.139
state conflict and on state conflict is
going to be called whenever there is a

00:09:59.139 --> 00:09:59.149
going to be called whenever there is a
 

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:01.480
going to be called whenever there is a
conflict so and a conflict happens when

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:01.490
conflict so and a conflict happens when
 

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.220
conflict so and a conflict happens when
for instance one device try to save one

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.230
for instance one device try to save one
 

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.660
for instance one device try to save one
state and then a different device try to

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:04.670
state and then a different device try to
 

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.519
state and then a different device try to
save a different state so this is where

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:06.529
save a different state so this is where
 

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:08.650
save a different state so this is where
you want to sort of like merge the two

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:08.660
you want to sort of like merge the two
 

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.680
you want to sort of like merge the two
states and return the combined progress

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:11.690
states and return the combined progress
 

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.639
states and return the combined progress
of the user so that the user doesn't

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:12.649
of the user so that the user doesn't
 

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:14.079
of the user so that the user doesn't
lose any progress so if they unlocked

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:14.089
lose any progress so if they unlocked
 

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:16.269
lose any progress so if they unlocked
one level level a on one device and the

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:16.279
one level level a on one device and the
 

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.189
one level level a on one device and the
level be on different device the result

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:18.199
level be on different device the result
 

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:19.449
level be on different device the result
you want to have is that the user has

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:19.459
you want to have is that the user has
 

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:21.879
you want to have is that the user has
unlocked levels a and B and not one or

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:21.889
unlocked levels a and B and not one or
 

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:23.500
unlocked levels a and B and not one or
the other so what happens if you try to

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:23.510
the other so what happens if you try to
 

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.629
the other so what happens if you try to
save this you know cloud save and you

00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:25.639
save this you know cloud save and you
 

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:28.150
save this you know cloud save and you
are not connected to the net so yeah so

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160
are not connected to the net so yeah so
 

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.150
are not connected to the net so yeah so
one of the advantages of our cloud save

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160
one of the advantages of our cloud save
 

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.460
one of the advantages of our cloud save
API is that it actually works offline so

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:33.470
API is that it actually works offline so
 

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.840
API is that it actually works offline so
you can have cloud save even though

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:34.850
you can have cloud save even though
 

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.780
you can have cloud save even though
there's no cloud because what happens is

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:37.790
there's no cloud because what happens is
 

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.610
there's no cloud because what happens is
that when you try to save to the cloud

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:39.620
that when you try to save to the cloud
 

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.230
that when you try to save to the cloud
you were offline it's going to get the

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240
you were offline it's going to get the
 

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.610
you were offline it's going to get the
that state that you're saying is going

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:42.620
that state that you're saying is going
 

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.500
that state that you're saying is going
to get stored in a local cache then

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:44.510
to get stored in a local cache then
 

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.730
to get stored in a local cache then
that's going to get synchronous to the

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:45.740
that's going to get synchronous to the
 

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.900
that's going to get synchronous to the
cloud as soon as there's a the the

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:48.910
cloud as soon as there's a the the
 

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.100
cloud as soon as there's a the the
connectivity comes back so same thing

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.110
connectivity comes back so same thing
 

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.140
connectivity comes back so same thing
with loading from from the clouds so the

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:53.150
with loading from from the clouds so the
 

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.400
with loading from from the clouds so the
device is going to have a cache of the

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:54.410
device is going to have a cache of the
 

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.410
device is going to have a cache of the
last known state of the cloud which

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:56.420
last known state of the cloud which
 

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.810
last known state of the cloud which
means that even if the user doesn't have

00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:58.820
means that even if the user doesn't have
 

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.940
means that even if the user doesn't have
an internet connection at the moment and

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:00.950
an internet connection at the moment and
 

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.950
an internet connection at the moment and
you ask the the device to load from from

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:02.960
you ask the the device to load from from
 

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.210
you ask the the device to load from from
the cloud it's going to return the last

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.220
the cloud it's going to return the last
 

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.519
the cloud it's going to return the last
known state that the device has cached

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:06.529
known state that the device has cached
 

00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:08.620
known state that the device has cached
so this is a this is very convenient

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:08.630
so this is a this is very convenient
 

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.290
so this is a this is very convenient
because after all mobile users are not

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:11.300
because after all mobile users are not
 

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.570
because after all mobile users are not
always connected to the Internet in the

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:13.580
always connected to the Internet in the
 

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.070
always connected to the Internet in the
real world world there are things like

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.080
real world world there are things like
 

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.260
real world world there are things like
parking lots and tunnels and so on and

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:17.270
parking lots and tunnels and so on and
 

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.970
parking lots and tunnels and so on and
even foreign countries where roaming

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:18.980
even foreign countries where roaming
 

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.260
even foreign countries where roaming
charges are very expensive the real

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:20.270
charges are very expensive the real
 

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.670
charges are very expensive the real
world is overrated yes exactly so we

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680
world is overrated yes exactly so we
 

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.100
world is overrated yes exactly so we
also have a example for you to play with

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.110
also have a example for you to play with
 

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.050
also have a example for you to play with
so if you download our source code from

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.060
so if you download our source code from
 

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.320
so if you download our source code from
the github repository you can also see

this cubic pilot samples it's it's a

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:34.580
this cubic pilot samples it's it's a
 

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.970
this cubic pilot samples it's it's a

artistic skill in creating graphics
 

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.920
artistic skill in creating graphics
which essentially is it's just trading

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:41.930
which essentially is it's just trading
 

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.199
which essentially is it's just trading
cubes so as you can see essentially

00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:44.209
cubes so as you can see essentially
 

00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:45.699
cubes so as you can see essentially
every enemy and every everything the

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:45.709
every enemy and every everything the
 

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:47.590
every enemy and every everything the
game is just the cube or combinations

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600
game is just the cube or combinations
 

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.120
game is just the cube or combinations
they're off but it's personally fun to

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.130
they're off but it's personally fun to
 

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.280
they're off but it's personally fun to
destroy geometry yes destroying geometry

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:51.290
destroy geometry yes destroying geometry
 

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.720
destroy geometry yes destroying geometry
is a very interesting pastime so if you

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:55.730
is a very interesting pastime so if you
 

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.860
is a very interesting pastime so if you
want to destroy some geometry I

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:56.870
want to destroy some geometry I
 

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.710
want to destroy some geometry I
definitely download that sample and you

00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720
definitely download that sample and you
 

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.870
definitely download that sample and you
can play it if you want to try the gup-a

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880
can play it if you want to try the gup-a
 

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.250
