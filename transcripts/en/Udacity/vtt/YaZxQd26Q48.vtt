First, I want you to know that this experiment was completely safe. The baby

00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:08.527
couldn't fall. The plexiglass could hold the baby's weight, and they also had a

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:12.532
barrier around the sides of the platform. I didn't draw it here, that way, you

00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:16.849
could see the cute baby. This demonstrates to us that by the time the baby can

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.100
crawl, he or she has developed the ability to perceive depth. We know this

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.523
because they won't go over the cliff. If they couldn't tell depth, they would

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:28.510
just keep going. That's cool, right? We learned more about sensation and

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.150
perception studies during the earlier sensation and perception lesson. So, we

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.040
just wanted to cover some of the interesting facts regarding human development.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.560
There's always more you can learn about sensation and perception development.

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:49.170
on to cognitive development with Susan.
