from hiatus we took a nice long break to

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
from hiatus we took a nice long break to
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.129
from hiatus we took a nice long break to
give ourselves some time to prepare for

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
give ourselves some time to prepare for
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.320
give ourselves some time to prepare for

conference is over we now have a chance
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.980
conference is over we now have a chance
to talk about all the cool things that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
to talk about all the cool things that
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.779
to talk about all the cool things that
that were announced all the different

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
that were announced all the different
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.400
that were announced all the different
sessions all the wonderful design

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
sessions all the wonderful design
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.009
sessions all the wonderful design
sessions that took place and that's what

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
sessions that took place and that's what
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.380
sessions that took place and that's what
we'll be doing today so with that let's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
we'll be doing today so with that let's
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.730
we'll be doing today so with that let's
just jump right in because we have a lot

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
just jump right in because we have a lot
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.290
just jump right in because we have a lot
to cover since there was a lot that

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
to cover since there was a lot that
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569
to cover since there was a lot that
happened that I am so the first thing we

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
happened that I am so the first thing we
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.459
happened that I am so the first thing we
want to do is look at all the different

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
want to do is look at all the different
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.400
want to do is look at all the different
sessions that took place there are a lot

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
sessions that took place there are a lot
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.979
sessions that took place there are a lot
of design sessions this year I know

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
of design sessions this year I know
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.720
of design sessions this year I know
exactly how many something like seven or

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
exactly how many something like seven or
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.130
exactly how many something like seven or
eight or something but they're all

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
eight or something but they're all
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260
eight or something but they're all
jam-packed with with different bits of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
jam-packed with with different bits of
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.119
jam-packed with with different bits of

topic subtype expand design so the first

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
topic subtype expand design so the first
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810
topic subtype expand design so the first
that we want to talk about is racial

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
that we want to talk about is racial
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.290
that we want to talk about is racial

simplify and amaze Android the design

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
simplify and amaze Android the design
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.939
simplify and amaze Android the design
principles so I mean I guess like the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
principles so I mean I guess like the
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.679
principles so I mean I guess like the
way we should probably do this is we

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
way we should probably do this is we
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.969
way we should probably do this is we
should all you know we should need to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
should all you know we should need to
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520
should all you know we should need to
talk a little bit about how you know

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
talk a little bit about how you know
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.039
talk a little bit about how you know
what takeaways there were for us for me

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
what takeaways there were for us for me
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.170
what takeaways there were for us for me
that the big takeaway here was kind of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
that the big takeaway here was kind of
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.960
that the big takeaway here was kind of
the the association of emotion positive

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970
the the association of emotion positive
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.560
the the association of emotion positive
and negative emotions from this from the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
and negative emotions from this from the
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.710
and negative emotions from this from the
session you know the rather the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
session you know the rather the
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.940
session you know the rather the
association of positive and negative

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
association of positive and negative
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.270
association of positive and negative
emotions with with kind of you is and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
emotions with with kind of you is and
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.789
emotions with with kind of you is and
kind of how those play together there's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
kind of how those play together there's
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.260
kind of how those play together there's
a lot of kind of interesting things

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
a lot of kind of interesting things
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999
a lot of kind of interesting things
about about writing guide and things

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
about about writing guide and things
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.969
about about writing guide and things
like that yeah and I guess for me it's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
like that yeah and I guess for me it's
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.109
like that yeah and I guess for me it's
interesting because I think Rachel

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
interesting because I think Rachel
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.319
interesting because I think Rachel
introduces the the the vision as the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
introduces the the the vision as the
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719
introduces the the the vision as the
sort of being touchy-feely and for me it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
sort of being touchy-feely and for me it
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.980
sort of being touchy-feely and for me it
was always hard to sort of wrap my head

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
was always hard to sort of wrap my head
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.830
was always hard to sort of wrap my head
around how that relates to design for

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
around how that relates to design for
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.789
around how that relates to design for
myself because I'm more of a developer

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
myself because I'm more of a developer
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620
myself because I'm more of a developer
and so I really like the examples that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
and so I really like the examples that
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719
and so I really like the examples that
she gave like actually showing how like

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
she gave like actually showing how like
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850
she gave like actually showing how like
for example when one of the ones here is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
for example when one of the ones here is
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.459
for example when one of the ones here is
own decide for me but let me have the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
own decide for me but let me have the
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.090
own decide for me but let me have the
final say you can see there so for

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
final say you can see there so for
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350
final say you can see there so for
example when you're deleting a message

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
example when you're deleting a message
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359
example when you're deleting a message
it deletes first and then there's an

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
it deletes first and then there's an
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.900
it deletes first and then there's an
undue action rather than a dialog

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910
undue action rather than a dialog
 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.600
undue action rather than a dialog
yeah so same thing is how they actually

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
yeah so same thing is how they actually
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.340
yeah so same thing is how they actually
applied these you know very very snappy

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350
applied these you know very very snappy
 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.440
applied these you know very very snappy
kind of their principles and how she

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
kind of their principles and how she
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.400
kind of their principles and how she
showed how they actually help them

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
showed how they actually help them
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.990
showed how they actually help them
inform their design decisions so there's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
inform their design decisions so there's
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.860
inform their design decisions so there's
a section in there where they're

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
a section in there where they're
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.560
a section in there where they're
assigning you know marbles for things

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
assigning you know marbles for things
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.390
assigning you know marbles for things
you do well and you know bad marbles for

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
you do well and you know bad marbles for
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.310
you do well and you know bad marbles for
things to do badly and really helps you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320
things to do badly and really helps you
 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.320
things to do badly and really helps you
to weigh up different design decisions

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
to weigh up different design decisions
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.100
to weigh up different design decisions
and I thought that was already

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110
and I thought that was already
 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.990
and I thought that was already
interesting to me yeah they also

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
interesting to me yeah they also
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.690
interesting to me yeah they also
mentioned very briefly the Android

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
mentioned very briefly the Android
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.670
mentioned very briefly the Android
baseline study that we conducted about a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
baseline study that we conducted about a
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.130
baseline study that we conducted about a
year or two ago that was kind of one of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
year or two ago that was kind of one of
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.380
year or two ago that was kind of one of
the foundations of a lot of these design

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
the foundations of a lot of these design
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.720
the foundations of a lot of these design
principles that's kind of I think it's

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
principles that's kind of I think it's
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.820
principles that's kind of I think it's
mentioned someone near the beginning so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
mentioned someone near the beginning so
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.140
mentioned someone near the beginning so
it was really kind of a really good

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
it was really kind of a really good
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.690
it was really kind of a really good
overview of other design principles and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
overview of other design principles and
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.210
overview of other design principles and
I think of the the closest page on a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
I think of the the closest page on a
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.520
I think of the the closest page on a
design guide to this session is

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530
design guide to this session is
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.620
design guide to this session is
obviously the creative vision design

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
obviously the creative vision design
 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.060
obviously the creative vision design
principle section which kind of goes

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070
principle section which kind of goes
 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.440
principle section which kind of goes
through all of them so they went through

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
through all of them so they went through
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.680
through all of them so they went through
that in excruciating Lee good detail so

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
that in excruciating Lee good detail so
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.930
that in excruciating Lee good detail so
that was a good session should we move

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
that was a good session should we move
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.050
that was a good session should we move
on to the next one yeah so next was

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
on to the next one yeah so next was
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.570
on to the next one yeah so next was
agile UX research practice in android

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580
agile UX research practice in android
 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.199
agile UX research practice in android
this is by Amica kono and bethany fong

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209
this is by Amica kono and bethany fong
 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.830
this is by Amica kono and bethany fong
and so here they go through a bunch of

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840
and so here they go through a bunch of
 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.540
and so here they go through a bunch of
different techniques that the Android

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550
different techniques that the Android
 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.430
different techniques that the Android
team uses as well as you know you know

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
team uses as well as you know you know
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.560
team uses as well as you know you know
lots of different companies out there a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570
lots of different companies out there a
 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.880
lots of different companies out there a
couple of different techniques for

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890
couple of different techniques for
 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.520
couple of different techniques for
really lightweight really cheap research

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
really lightweight really cheap research
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.470
really lightweight really cheap research
stuff that doesn't involve you know

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480
stuff that doesn't involve you know
 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.420
stuff that doesn't involve you know
millions of dollars or thousands of

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
millions of dollars or thousands of
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.949
millions of dollars or thousands of
dollars whatever it's stuff that you can

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959
dollars whatever it's stuff that you can
 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.270
dollars whatever it's stuff that you can
basically do like one of my favorites

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
basically do like one of my favorites
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.670
basically do like one of my favorites
was the cafe study you go into like a

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680
was the cafe study you go into like a
 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.650
was the cafe study you go into like a
Google cafe or rinse like a starbucks or

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
Google cafe or rinse like a starbucks or
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.660
Google cafe or rinse like a starbucks or
something you just show your app or show

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670
something you just show your app or show
 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.360
something you just show your app or show
a very specific flow within your app to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
a very specific flow within your app to
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.430
a very specific flow within your app to
a few people and kind of measure their

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440
a few people and kind of measure their
 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.010
a few people and kind of measure their
reactions in certain ways so it's very

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020
reactions in certain ways so it's very
 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.449
reactions in certain ways so it's very
very lightweight and very quick hence

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
very lightweight and very quick hence
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.660
very lightweight and very quick hence
the name agile yeah i'll admit i

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670
the name agile yeah i'll admit i
 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.650
the name agile yeah i'll admit i
actually haven't got around to watching

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660
actually haven't got around to watching
 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.240
actually haven't got around to watching
this particular session yet but it's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
this particular session yet but it's
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.410
this particular session yet but it's
unlike to do this yeah these are each

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420
unlike to do this yeah these are each
 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.810
unlike to do this yeah these are each
like 40 minutes or so so I mean it was a

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820
like 40 minutes or so so I mean it was a
 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.240
like 40 minutes or so so I mean it was a
lot of sessions to work yeah I like the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250
lot of sessions to work yeah I like the
 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.920
lot of sessions to work yeah I like the
way they get laid out the UNIX

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
way they get laid out the UNIX
 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.960
way they get laid out the UNIX
traditional research process it's like

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
traditional research process it's like
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.610
traditional research process it's like
this day for my visitation weather

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620
this day for my visitation weather
 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.530
this day for my visitation weather
station and said you know there's no way

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
station and said you know there's no way
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.340
station and said you know there's no way
that's gonna work

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350
that's gonna work
 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.650
that's gonna work
world where the pace of mobile app dalam

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660
world where the pace of mobile app dalam
 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.870
world where the pace of mobile app dalam
is just too agile and they can really

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880
is just too agile and they can really
 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.120
is just too agile and they can really
compress it down so boy is really really

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130
compress it down so boy is really really
 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.410
compress it down so boy is really really
interesting how you can you know they

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420
interesting how you can you know they
 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.360
interesting how you can you know they
stress how important to do researchers

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
stress how important to do researchers
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.280
stress how important to do researchers
but showed how to do in an agile way we

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290
but showed how to do in an agile way we
 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.710
but showed how to do in an agile way we
really really really great and in the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720
really really really great and in the
 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.120
really really really great and in the
very beginning they have this kind of

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130
very beginning they have this kind of
 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.480
very beginning they have this kind of
list of I guess this uh this grid not

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490
list of I guess this uh this grid not
 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.010
list of I guess this uh this grid not
really great I guess a chart of the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020
really great I guess a chart of the
 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.570
really great I guess a chart of the
different techniques that you could use

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
different techniques that you could use
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.510
different techniques that you could use
and they focused more on the qualitative

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
and they focused more on the qualitative
 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.370
and they focused more on the qualitative
and behavior side of things so right

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380
and behavior side of things so right
 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.740
and behavior side of things so right
around here they didn't really spend too

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750
around here they didn't really spend too
 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.730
around here they didn't really spend too
much time talking about the other stuff

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740
much time talking about the other stuff
 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.180
much time talking about the other stuff
because sometimes it can cost more some

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190
because sometimes it can cost more some
 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.040
because sometimes it can cost more some
of it is kind of outside of the scope of

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050
of it is kind of outside of the scope of
 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.110
of it is kind of outside of the scope of
kind of a small research team so

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
kind of a small research team so
 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.970
kind of a small research team so
definitely you know if you're interested

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980
definitely you know if you're interested
 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.380
definitely you know if you're interested
in this kind of area this general area

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390
in this kind of area this general area
 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.170
in this kind of area this general area
of UX research they talk about a whole

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180
of UX research they talk about a whole
 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.910
of UX research they talk about a whole
bunch of techniques and here i think

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920
bunch of techniques and here i think
 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.160
bunch of techniques and here i think
that i think the major four techniques

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170
that i think the major four techniques
 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.720
that i think the major four techniques
they talk about they actually also spent

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730
they talk about they actually also spent
 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.120
they talk about they actually also spent
a lot of time on the pulse study i think

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130
a lot of time on the pulse study i think
 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.680
a lot of time on the pulse study i think
they went into the most detail about

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690
they went into the most detail about
 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.600
they went into the most detail about
this pulse study so yeah UX research the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
this pulse study so yeah UX research the
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.690
this pulse study so yeah UX research the
next session was cognitive science and

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700
next session was cognitive science and
 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.180
next session was cognitive science and
design this is one of my favorites alex

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190
design this is one of my favorites alex
 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.190
design this is one of my favorites alex
is a tremendously good speaker he was on

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200
is a tremendously good speaker he was on
 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.960
is a tremendously good speaker he was on
the show in the think it was the most of

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970
the show in the think it was the most of
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.480
the show in the think it was the most of
the notifications his notifications and

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490
the notifications his notifications and
 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.400
the notifications his notifications and
something else some process yeah

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410
something else some process yeah
 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.770
something else some process yeah
wouldn't processor yeah so he was on the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780
wouldn't processor yeah so he was on the
 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.450
wouldn't processor yeah so he was on the
show and he talked about that and he's a

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460
show and he talked about that and he's a
 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.880
show and he talked about that and he's a
he's a tremendously good speaker and he

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890
he's a tremendously good speaker and he
 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.170
he's a tremendously good speaker and he
did a session on cognitive science and

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180
did a session on cognitive science and
 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.370
did a session on cognitive science and
design so he mentioned a couple of

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380
design so he mentioned a couple of
 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.620
design so he mentioned a couple of
things to get stopped principles he

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630
things to get stopped principles he
 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.970
things to get stopped principles he
mentioned things like proximity closure

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980
mentioned things like proximity closure
 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.730
mentioned things like proximity closure
etc we could see here this kind of

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740
etc we could see here this kind of
 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.220
etc we could see here this kind of
triangle and so on this is actually

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230
triangle and so on this is actually
 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.800
triangle and so on this is actually
really important because it it's one of

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810
really important because it it's one of
 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.170
really important because it it's one of
the fundamental basis of the holo visual

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180
the fundamental basis of the holo visual
 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.150
the fundamental basis of the holo visual
language kind of this use of space and

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160
language kind of this use of space and
 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.370
language kind of this use of space and
typography to communicate hierarchy and

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380
typography to communicate hierarchy and
 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.230
typography to communicate hierarchy and
structure you can kind of see that right

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240
structure you can kind of see that right
 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.510
structure you can kind of see that right
even without a whole bunch of lines you

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520
even without a whole bunch of lines you
 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.020
even without a whole bunch of lines you
can still make an association or kind of

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030
can still make an association or kind of
 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.890
can still make an association or kind of
form a mental model of the the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900
form a mental model of the the
 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.400
form a mental model of the the
relationship between these different

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410
relationship between these different
 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.440
relationship between these different
groups of circles right so it's kind of

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450
groups of circles right so it's kind of
 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.230
groups of circles right so it's kind of
one of the fundamental basis for the

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240
one of the fundamental basis for the
 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.910
one of the fundamental basis for the
holovision language so it's kind of a

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920
holovision language so it's kind of a
 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.160
holovision language so it's kind of a
good session for that yeah I think I'll

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170
good session for that yeah I think I'll
 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.300
good session for that yeah I think I'll
saying the room and this session

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310
saying the room and this session
 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.950
saying the room and this session
regardless of Android or design or

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960
regardless of Android or design or
 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.970
regardless of Android or design or
anything else it's just really really

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980
anything else it's just really really
 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.880
anything else it's just really really
interesting to watch and one particular

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890
interesting to watch and one particular
 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.170
interesting to watch and one particular
slide I like that I don't think we have

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180
slide I like that I don't think we have
 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.640
slide I like that I don't think we have
it here

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650
it here
 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.400
it here
it it had a bunch of different shapes

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410
it it had a bunch of different shapes
 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.020
it it had a bunch of different shapes
and then their weight colored in

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030
and then their weight colored in
 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.060
and then their weight colored in
different colors as well I mean he sort

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070
different colors as well I mean he sort
 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.620
different colors as well I mean he sort
of showed how the colors are very easy

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630
of showed how the colors are very easy
 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.999
of showed how the colors are very easy
to spot the differentiation but the

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009
to spot the differentiation but the
 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.340
to spot the differentiation but the
shapes are not so again applies back to

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350
shapes are not so again applies back to
 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.420
shapes are not so again applies back to
sort of the whole of holo visual

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430
sort of the whole of holo visual
 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.600
sort of the whole of holo visual
language using spacing and contrasting

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610
language using spacing and contrasting
 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.290
language using spacing and contrasting
colors to differentiate yeah he also

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300
colors to differentiate yeah he also
 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.939
colors to differentiate yeah he also
mentioned affordances and actually

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949
mentioned affordances and actually
 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.700
mentioned affordances and actually
really like this slide you know there

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710
really like this slide you know there
 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.320
really like this slide you know there
was the previous slide that showed a

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330
was the previous slide that showed a
 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.300
was the previous slide that showed a
bunch of similar trash K similar-looking

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310
bunch of similar trash K similar-looking
 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.310
bunch of similar trash K similar-looking
trash cans of different colors and then

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320
trash cans of different colors and then
 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.740
trash cans of different colors and then
this slide showed trash cans with

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750
this slide showed trash cans with
 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.180
this slide showed trash cans with
different colors obviously but also

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190
different colors obviously but also
 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.250
different colors obviously but also
different slots and that kind of the

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260
different slots and that kind of the
 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.529
different slots and that kind of the
afford different types of things being

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539
afford different types of things being
 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.270
afford different types of things being
put inside them so this is kind of a

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280
put inside them so this is kind of a
 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.909
put inside them so this is kind of a
more effective type of trash / recycling

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919
more effective type of trash / recycling
 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.400
more effective type of trash / recycling
combination and one other that I really

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410
combination and one other that I really
 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.830
combination and one other that I really
liked was a slide about peripheral

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840
liked was a slide about peripheral
 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.560
liked was a slide about peripheral
vision so like you know he used this

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570
vision so like you know he used this
 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.570
vision so like you know he used this
really funny analogy of a kind of like a

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580
really funny analogy of a kind of like a
 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.360
really funny analogy of a kind of like a
tiger you know or you walk into a room a

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370
tiger you know or you walk into a room a
 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.460
tiger you know or you walk into a room a
test study and the first thing you see

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470
test study and the first thing you see
 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.189
test study and the first thing you see
is a tiger and he kind of did the study

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199
is a tiger and he kind of did the study
 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.860
is a tiger and he kind of did the study
or something or I guess this is based on

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870
or something or I guess this is based on
 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.290
or something or I guess this is based on
a study your response time to things

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.300
a study your response time to things
 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.089
a study your response time to things
right in front of you is actually slower

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:25.099
right in front of you is actually slower
 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:26.830
right in front of you is actually slower
than your response time to things around

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840
than your response time to things around
 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.500
than your response time to things around
you and so kind of peripheral your

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510
you and so kind of peripheral your
 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.000
you and so kind of peripheral your
peripheral vision is very important and

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010
peripheral vision is very important and
 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.650
peripheral vision is very important and
that's actually one of the reasons that

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660
that's actually one of the reasons that
 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.420
that's actually one of the reasons that
a lot of things on Android are near the

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430
a lot of things on Android are near the
 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.219
a lot of things on Android are near the
corners and edges of the screen rather

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:36.229
corners and edges of the screen rather
 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:40.450
corners and edges of the screen rather
than in the very dead center and i think

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.460
than in the very dead center and i think
 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.219
than in the very dead center and i think
selicia total is phenomenal yeah it's

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:42.229
selicia total is phenomenal yeah it's
 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.350
selicia total is phenomenal yeah it's
really good it's really really good oh

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360
really good it's really really good oh
 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.210
really good it's really really good oh
one last thing I wanted to mention since

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.220
one last thing I wanted to mention since
 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.830
one last thing I wanted to mention since
this talk is so good he also talked

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840
this talk is so good he also talked
 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.439
this talk is so good he also talked
about recognition so like the ability to

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:50.449
about recognition so like the ability to
 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:52.600
about recognition so like the ability to
your ability to recognize people's faces

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:52.610
your ability to recognize people's faces
 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.270
your ability to recognize people's faces
and versus their names your ability to

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280
and versus their names your ability to
 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.270
and versus their names your ability to
recognize their faces is something like

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280
recognize their faces is something like
 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.339
recognize their faces is something like
almost constant time like within like a

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:00.349
almost constant time like within like a
 

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:01.540

hundred people you'll instantly
 

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.149
hundred people you'll instantly
recognize your friends versus in a list

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159
recognize your friends versus in a list
 

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:05.740
recognize your friends versus in a list
of 100 names it will take you a while to

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:05.750
of 100 names it will take you a while to
 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.930
of 100 names it will take you a while to
find that your friends names so really

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:07.940
find that your friends names so really
 

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.189
find that your friends names so really
kind of interesting tidbits here in

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199
kind of interesting tidbits here in
 

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.480
kind of interesting tidbits here in
there probably spent a lot of time on

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.490
there probably spent a lot of time on
 

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.800
there probably spent a lot of time on
this and let's just move on the next the

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:14.810
this and let's just move on the next the

next session was also very very good it

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:16.970
next session was also very very good it
 

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.210

both interaction designers and this

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:25.159
both interaction designers and this
 

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:27.180
both interaction designers and this
session they basically covered

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.190
session they basically covered
 

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.810
session they basically covered
navigation and really

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:28.820
navigation and really
 

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.840
navigation and really

looking at a nap as a set of pixels or
 

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.940
looking at a nap as a set of pixels or
you know set of individual screens they

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:36.950
you know set of individual screens they
 

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.740
you know set of individual screens they
looked at it as a whole and they talked

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:38.750
looked at it as a whole and they talked
 

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.620
looked at it as a whole and they talked
about different types of I guess they

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:41.630
about different types of I guess they
 

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.390
about different types of I guess they
use this kind of use case modeling

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:43.400
use this kind of use case modeling
 

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.360
use this kind of use case modeling
practice to to look at or to plan out or

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:46.370
practice to to look at or to plan out or
 

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.630

map out an application so they wanted

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640
map out an application so they wanted
 

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.670
map out an application so they wanted
took a little bit of depth on this kind

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680
took a little bit of depth on this kind
 

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.220
took a little bit of depth on this kind
of barkeeper app where they basically

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.230
of barkeeper app where they basically
 

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.080
of barkeeper app where they basically
you know like look at different people

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.090
you know like look at different people
 

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.090
you know like look at different people
and their different use cases and map

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:58.100
and their different use cases and map
 

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.620
and their different use cases and map
them out in this kind of not only a

00:08:59.620 --> 00:08:59.630
them out in this kind of not only a
 

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.360
them out in this kind of not only a
flowchart but more like a diagram and

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:01.370
flowchart but more like a diagram and
 

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.950
flowchart but more like a diagram and
this helped them kind of make decisions

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:02.960
this helped them kind of make decisions
 

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.320
this helped them kind of make decisions
about what navigation structures they

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:05.330
about what navigation structures they
 

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.930
about what navigation structures they
should use in the app one of my favorite

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:07.940
should use in the app one of my favorite
 

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.760
should use in the app one of my favorite
picks in this talk is where they explain

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:09.770
picks in this talk is where they explain
 

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.290
picks in this talk is where they explain
some of the design decisions behind some

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:11.300
some of the design decisions behind some
 

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.700
some of the design decisions behind some
of the google or android livestock

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:12.710
of the google or android livestock
 

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.560

outside the calendar and so forth so you

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:14.570
outside the calendar and so forth so you
 

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.450
outside the calendar and so forth so you
know they went through the process of

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:16.460
know they went through the process of
 

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.920
know they went through the process of
how they arrived at the particular

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:17.930
how they arrived at the particular
 

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.230
how they arrived at the particular
navigation structure they use and you

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240
navigation structure they use and you
 

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.910
navigation structure they use and you
know it showed variations and why they

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920
know it showed variations and why they
 

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.230
know it showed variations and why they
wouldn't work and so for which it was

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240
wouldn't work and so for which it was
 

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.880
wouldn't work and so for which it was
really interesting yeah I thought it's

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:24.890
really interesting yeah I thought it's
 

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.620
really interesting yeah I thought it's
just really useful how they show I think

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:26.630
just really useful how they show I think
 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.080
just really useful how they show I think
of several examples where they show what

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.090
of several examples where they show what
 

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.170
of several examples where they show what
a nap could look like with tabs with

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:31.180
a nap could look like with tabs with
 

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.940
a nap could look like with tabs with
with the spinner with the drawer I don't

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:33.950
with the spinner with the drawer I don't
 

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.380
with the spinner with the drawer I don't
know if they show examples of the six

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:35.390
know if they show examples of the six
 

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.960
know if they show examples of the six
pack or dash yeah that is but it is

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:37.970
pack or dash yeah that is but it is
 

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.910
pack or dash yeah that is but it is
almost never the property actually there

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920
almost never the property actually there
 

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.380
almost never the property actually there
was no it was never turned out to be

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:41.390
was no it was never turned out to be
 

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.930
was no it was never turned out to be
worth while selecting but I thought I

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:43.940
worth while selecting but I thought I
 

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.100
worth while selecting but I thought I
thought I was really useful just because

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.110
thought I was really useful just because
 

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.380
thought I was really useful just because
you know it applies to any app you could

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:47.390
you know it applies to any app you could
 

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.430
you know it applies to any app you could
sort of go through these different

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440
sort of go through these different
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.950
sort of go through these different
iterations and see how would work with

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:50.960
iterations and see how would work with
 

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.170
iterations and see how would work with
these different patterns and certainly

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.180
these different patterns and certainly
 

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.580
these different patterns and certainly
there's pros and cons to each of them

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:54.590
there's pros and cons to each of them
 

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.280
there's pros and cons to each of them
which I think was the takeaway yeah I

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:57.290
which I think was the takeaway yeah I
 

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.660
which I think was the takeaway yeah I
really like how they kind of separate

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:58.670
really like how they kind of separate
 

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.730
really like how they kind of separate
out the structure into or they have a

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:00.740
out the structure into or they have a
 

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.260
out the structure into or they have a
couple of common patterns for

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.270
couple of common patterns for
 

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.360
couple of common patterns for
recognizing structure right so they look

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370
recognizing structure right so they look
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.490
recognizing structure right so they look
at apps that may have a specific focus

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500
at apps that may have a specific focus
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.580
at apps that may have a specific focus
like one of the top level sections is

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:09.590
like one of the top level sections is
 

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.350
like one of the top level sections is
the most important and then apps that

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360
the most important and then apps that
 

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.940
the most important and then apps that
are very deep where they have kind of

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:12.950
are very deep where they have kind of
 

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.370
are very deep where they have kind of
like an equal weighting of sections but

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.380
like an equal weighting of sections but
 

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.930
like an equal weighting of sections but
each section itself is very deep and

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:16.940
each section itself is very deep and
 

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.020
each section itself is very deep and
then they look at another kind of type

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.030
then they look at another kind of type
 

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.330
then they look at another kind of type
of pattern or structural pattern where

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:22.340
of pattern or structural pattern where
 

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.420
of pattern or structural pattern where
an app is very very interconnected which

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:25.430
an app is very very interconnected which
 

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.160
an app is very very interconnected which
is this case so it's really kind of a

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.170
is this case so it's really kind of a
 

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.800
is this case so it's really kind of a
good way of structuring or thinking

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:29.810
good way of structuring or thinking
 

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.360
good way of structuring or thinking
about your app rather than thinking

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.370
about your app rather than thinking
 

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.600
about your app rather than thinking
about you know its features or

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:34.610
about you know its features or
 

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.880
about you know its features or
you know the individual components think

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:36.890
you know the individual components think
 

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.110
you know the individual components think
about it as a whole like what are the

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120
about it as a whole like what are the
 

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.639
about it as a whole like what are the
different types of use cases that you're

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:39.649
different types of use cases that you're
 

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:42.250
different types of use cases that you're
trying to solve for different users and

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:42.260
trying to solve for different users and
 

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.449
trying to solve for different users and
then of course they spent a fair amount

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:43.459
then of course they spent a fair amount
 

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:45.490
then of course they spent a fair amount
of time talking about the navigation

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:45.500
of time talking about the navigation
 

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.610
of time talking about the navigation
drawer print as well so this is I think

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:48.620
drawer print as well so this is I think
 

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.139
drawer print as well so this is I think
you answered it made an excellent point

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:50.149
you answered it made an excellent point
 

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.030
you answered it made an excellent point
about how this is a community pan that's

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040
about how this is a community pan that's
 

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.579
about how this is a community pan that's
emerged and how we've spent our time

00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:54.589
emerged and how we've spent our time
 

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:56.019
emerged and how we've spent our time
kind of taking a look at all the

00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:56.029
kind of taking a look at all the
 

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:58.449
kind of taking a look at all the
different community implementations and

00:10:58.449 --> 00:10:58.459
different community implementations and
 

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.280
different community implementations and
what works well and what we felt could

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:00.290
what works well and what we felt could
 

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.840
what works well and what we felt could
be improved slightly and how we've just

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:01.850
be improved slightly and how we've just
 

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.370
be improved slightly and how we've just
dated on that process and really put a

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:03.380
dated on that process and really put a
 

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.040
dated on that process and really put a
lot of lot of thought and effort into

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.050
lot of lot of thought and effort into
 

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.630
lot of lot of thought and effort into
providing some guidance that we hope

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:07.640
providing some guidance that we hope
 

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.340
providing some guidance that we hope
will really make in a solidified of

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.350
will really make in a solidified of
 

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.810
will really make in a solidified of
space if people have some stability of

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:10.820
space if people have some stability of
 

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.800
space if people have some stability of
expectations of how this works exactly

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:13.810
expectations of how this works exactly
 

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.150
expectations of how this works exactly
yeah so the navigation drawer was one of

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160
yeah so the navigation drawer was one of
 

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.560
yeah so the navigation drawer was one of
those patterns that was introduced in

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:17.570
those patterns that was introduced in
 

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.290
those patterns that was introduced in
agains and richest talk and Nick and I

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:20.300
agains and richest talk and Nick and I
 

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.540
agains and richest talk and Nick and I
covered it later which we'll talk about

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:21.550
covered it later which we'll talk about
 

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.650
covered it later which we'll talk about
but definitely it will probably do

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:23.660
but definitely it will probably do
 

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.310
but definitely it will probably do
another full episode of a DA on just the

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320
another full episode of a DA on just the
 

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.870
another full episode of a DA on just the
navigation drawer at some point suddenly

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880
navigation drawer at some point suddenly
 

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.259
navigation drawer at some point suddenly
what is Omega yeah yeah for sure alright

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:32.269
what is Omega yeah yeah for sure alright
 

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:35.290
what is Omega yeah yeah for sure alright
so moving on then Nick and I did a

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:35.300
so moving on then Nick and I did a
 

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.240
so moving on then Nick and I did a
session called Android design for you I

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.250
session called Android design for you I
 

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.759
session called Android design for you I
developers and this was kind of more

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:39.769
developers and this was kind of more
 

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:41.769
developers and this was kind of more
like a developer talk it wasn't really

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:41.779
like a developer talk it wasn't really
 

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:44.050
like a developer talk it wasn't really
so much for designers but I think

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:44.060
so much for designers but I think
 

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.210
so much for designers but I think
especially Nick's part the responsive

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:46.220
especially Nick's part the responsive
 

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.880
especially Nick's part the responsive
design area this is incredibly useful

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:48.890
design area this is incredibly useful
 

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.329
design area this is incredibly useful
for both designers and developers so at

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:52.339
for both designers and developers so at
 

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:55.210
for both designers and developers so at
a very high level we covered navigation

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.220
a very high level we covered navigation
 

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.590
a very high level we covered navigation
we so we've covered how to implement the

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600
we so we've covered how to implement the
 

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.810
we so we've covered how to implement the
navigation drawer for example the Nick

00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:58.820
navigation drawer for example the Nick
 

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.970
navigation drawer for example the Nick
did a whole big bid on responsive design

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980
did a whole big bid on responsive design
 

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.319
did a whole big bid on responsive design
techniques and they compared you want to

00:12:02.319 --> 00:12:02.329
techniques and they compared you want to
 

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:04.090
techniques and they compared you want to
talk about their here and then I I

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:04.100
talk about their here and then I I
 

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.949
talk about their here and then I I
finished off with implementing the holo

00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959
finished off with implementing the holo
 

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.300
finished off with implementing the holo
visual language like how to implement

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.310
visual language like how to implement
 

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.519
visual language like how to implement
dividers and and touch feedback and

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:09.529
dividers and and touch feedback and
 

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.380
dividers and and touch feedback and
different things like that yeah I took

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:11.390
different things like that yeah I took
 

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.970
different things like that yeah I took
the opportunity of having a the stage I

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:12.980
the opportunity of having a the stage I
 

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.650
the opportunity of having a the stage I
I still vote on my favorite topics is

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:14.660
I still vote on my favorite topics is
 

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.319
I still vote on my favorite topics is
responsive design so went about it I

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:17.329
responsive design so went about it I
 

00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:18.970
responsive design so went about it I
talking about some of the limitations of

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:18.980
talking about some of the limitations of
 

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.100
talking about some of the limitations of
the kind of scalable approach and and

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.110
the kind of scalable approach and and
 

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.110
the kind of scalable approach and and
discuss some strategies you can use to

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120
discuss some strategies you can use to
 

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.819
discuss some strategies you can use to
really like it to deal with that to cope

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:24.829
really like it to deal with that to cope
 

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:27.189
really like it to deal with that to cope
with it yeah there's very very good

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199
with it yeah there's very very good
 

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:28.689
with it yeah there's very very good
information especially for developers so

00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:28.699
information especially for developers so
 

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:30.430
information especially for developers so
if your designer and your developers

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440
if your designer and your developers
 

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.750
if your designer and your developers
come back to you and say oh that's going

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760
come back to you and say oh that's going
 

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.100
come back to you and say oh that's going
to take too long and I don't know how to

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.110
to take too long and I don't know how to
 

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.689
to take too long and I don't know how to
do it whatever just point into this

00:12:34.689 --> 00:12:34.699
do it whatever just point into this
 

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:36.100
do it whatever just point into this
session there's a lot of good

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.110
session there's a lot of good
 

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.840
session there's a lot of good
information yeah I have nothing else to

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:37.850
information yeah I have nothing else to
 

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.490
information yeah I have nothing else to
add other than a good watch this session

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:39.500
add other than a good watch this session
 

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.090
add other than a good watch this session
it's good

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100
it's good
 

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.480
it's good
alright so next we had oh actually

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:45.490
alright so next we had oh actually
 

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.180
alright so next we had oh actually
really quickly two things that we again

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:48.190
really quickly two things that we again
 

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.949
really quickly two things that we again
talked about for developers the

00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959
talked about for developers the
 

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:51.480
talked about for developers the
navigation drawer and the Nick talked

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.490
navigation drawer and the Nick talked
 

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.180
navigation drawer and the Nick talked
about sliding pane layout which is a new

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:54.190
about sliding pane layout which is a new
 

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.790
about sliding pane layout which is a new
sort of new presentation for master

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800
sort of new presentation for master
 

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.790
sort of new presentation for master
detail views and google hangouts as an

00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800
detail views and google hangouts as an
 

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.710
detail views and google hangouts as an
example of an app that uses this we're

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:01.720
example of an app that uses this we're
 

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.470
example of an app that uses this we're
basically on a phone it's a single pane

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480
basically on a phone it's a single pane
 

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.570
basically on a phone it's a single pane
that kind of slides off the screen to

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:06.580
that kind of slides off the screen to
 

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.600
that kind of slides off the screen to
reveal the master pain and on a tablet

they're both visible at the same time

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.290
they're both visible at the same time
 

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.050
they're both visible at the same time
there's obviously a lot more detail to

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.060
there's obviously a lot more detail to
 

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.940
there's obviously a lot more detail to
that pattern there but in case your

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:14.950
that pattern there but in case your
 

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.670
that pattern there but in case your
developer and looking to implement that

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680
developer and looking to implement that
 

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.690
developer and looking to implement that
basically look at the navigation drawer

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:18.700
basically look at the navigation drawer
 

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.699
basically look at the navigation drawer
guide here with this link at the top and

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:20.709
guide here with this link at the top and
 

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:23.190
guide here with this link at the top and
then the sliding pane layout link is

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200
then the sliding pane layout link is
 

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.350
then the sliding pane layout link is
kind of a link to the reference there's

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360
kind of a link to the reference there's
 

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.780
kind of a link to the reference there's
no actual design guide topic for sliding

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:27.790
no actual design guide topic for sliding
 

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.300
no actual design guide topic for sliding
pains right now but that's kind of the

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:30.310
pains right now but that's kind of the
 

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.490
pains right now but that's kind of the
best place to look at for for basic

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:32.500
best place to look at for for basic
 

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.050
best place to look at for for basic
information about it obviously in this

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.060
information about it obviously in this
 

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:40.230
information about it obviously in this

calots I heard about this but there's

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:09.940
calots I heard about this but there's
 

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.910
calots I heard about this but there's
still no video up so we heard we all

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920

and then there was another session from

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:38.990
and then there was another session from
 

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.350
and then there was another session from
from some YouTube folks on designing

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360
from some YouTube folks on designing
 

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.300
from some YouTube folks on designing
products for a multi-screen world the

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:43.310
products for a multi-screen world the
 

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.180
products for a multi-screen world the
YouTube perspective I things from Tom

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:46.190
YouTube perspective I things from Tom
 

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.260
YouTube perspective I things from Tom
Braxton and Josh session that's right

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.270
Braxton and Josh session that's right
 

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.450
Braxton and Josh session that's right
and my favorite thing about this was

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:52.460
and my favorite thing about this was
 

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.380
and my favorite thing about this was
actually these these kind of charts they

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:56.390
actually these these kind of charts they
 

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.030
actually these these kind of charts they
basically did a whole bunch of research

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040
basically did a whole bunch of research
 

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.820
basically did a whole bunch of research
into how people use their devices so

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:00.830
into how people use their devices so
 

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.230
into how people use their devices so
this wasn't an Android specific talk

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240
this wasn't an Android specific talk
 

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.030
this wasn't an Android specific talk
this is basically looking at android

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040
this is basically looking at android
 

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.510
this is basically looking at android
iphone TV ipad android tablets every

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:07.520
iphone TV ipad android tablets every
 

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.710
iphone TV ipad android tablets every
screen that you could post yeah

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720
screen that you could post yeah
 

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.840
screen that you could post yeah
basically every every screen that lets

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:10.850
basically every every screen that lets
 

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.060
basically every every screen that lets
you go day yeah and so they created

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.070
you go day yeah and so they created
 

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.310
you go day yeah and so they created
these kind of like little diagram

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320
these kind of like little diagram
 

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.860
these kind of like little diagram
journals of how people use their devices

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:17.870
journals of how people use their devices
 

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.140
journals of how people use their devices
so this is basically like a time graph

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.150
so this is basically like a time graph
 

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.120
so this is basically like a time graph
where I think it's just kind of a full

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.130
where I think it's just kind of a full
 

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.040
where I think it's just kind of a full
day and they just highlighted the

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.050
day and they just highlighted the
 

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.810
day and they just highlighted the
portions where people were using their

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:25.820
portions where people were using their
 

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.560
portions where people were using their
devices and so they made kind of little

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:28.570
devices and so they made kind of little
 

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.700
devices and so they made kind of little
observations around like people mostly

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:30.710
observations around like people mostly
 

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.080
observations around like people mostly
use their phones throughout the entire

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.090
use their phones throughout the entire
 

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.880
use their phones throughout the entire
day kind of snacking a little bit at a

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:33.890
day kind of snacking a little bit at a
 

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.630
day kind of snacking a little bit at a
time whereas at the TV portion of your

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:37.640
time whereas at the TV portion of your
 

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.480
time whereas at the TV portion of your
usage was more towards the nighttime

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:40.490
usage was more towards the nighttime
 

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.710
usage was more towards the nighttime
obviously with very very kind of heavy I

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720
obviously with very very kind of heavy I
 

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.260
obviously with very very kind of heavy I
guess continuous portions so kind of

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:47.270
guess continuous portions so kind of
 

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.090
guess continuous portions so kind of
some of these some of these charts were

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.100
some of these some of these charts were
 

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.370
some of these some of these charts were
very interesting to watch and they've

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:51.380
very interesting to watch and they've
 

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.570
very interesting to watch and they've
definitely some good observations I'm

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:55.580
definitely some good observations I'm
 

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.280
definitely some good observations I'm
yet to see it yet but I think it's a

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.290
yet to see it yet but I think it's a
 

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.780
yet to see it yet but I think it's a
really interesting space as well how we

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:58.790
really interesting space as well how we
 

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.190
really interesting space as well how we
deal with the multi-device like when

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:00.200
deal with the multi-device like when
 

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.530
deal with the multi-device like when
everyone has all these different devices

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:01.540
everyone has all these different devices
 

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.850
everyone has all these different devices
he was really interesting Oh another

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:03.860
he was really interesting Oh another
 

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.230
he was really interesting Oh another
thing that was really good about this is

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240
thing that was really good about this is
 

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.940
thing that was really good about this is
that they spent so YouTube is is

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:06.950
that they spent so YouTube is is
 

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.310
that they spent so YouTube is is
obviously a very popular brand and one

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:09.320
obviously a very popular brand and one
 

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.450
obviously a very popular brand and one
of the things is very important to them

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:10.460
of the things is very important to them
 

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.830
of the things is very important to them
is maintaining their brand across

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:11.840
is maintaining their brand across
 

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.230
is maintaining their brand across
different platforms and there's

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240
different platforms and there's
 

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.970
different platforms and there's
especially a part at the end where they

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:15.980
especially a part at the end where they
 

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.500
especially a part at the end where they
talked about you know how do they

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:17.510
talked about you know how do they
 

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.170
talked about you know how do they
reconcile their brand with the platform

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:20.180
reconcile their brand with the platform
 

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.930
reconcile their brand with the platform
and then I guess I think it was Tom that

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:22.940
and then I guess I think it was Tom that
 

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.700
and then I guess I think it was Tom that
mentioned this but he's basically like

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:24.710
mentioned this but he's basically like
 

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.580
mentioned this but he's basically like
you know we want to be true to our brand

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:26.590
you know we want to be true to our brand
 

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.290
you know we want to be true to our brand
and we want to be true to the platform

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:29.300
and we want to be true to the platform
 

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.150
and we want to be true to the platform
but we don't want to sacrifice one or

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160
but we don't want to sacrifice one or
 

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.880
but we don't want to sacrifice one or
the other so like if if you're working

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:33.890
the other so like if if you're working
 

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.620
the other so like if if you're working
with somebody or you know product

design in action live lab and I was also

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.130
design in action live lab and I was also
 

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.940
design in action live lab and I was also
quite popular we only did one of these

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:04.950
quite popular we only did one of these
 

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.800

personas and use case of stuff we

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640
personas and use case of stuff we
 

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.550
personas and use case of stuff we
thought about it a little more from an

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:17.560
thought about it a little more from an
 

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.200
thought about it a little more from an
engineering standpoint you know

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.210
engineering standpoint you know
 

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.540
engineering standpoint you know
different objects you work with the

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:21.550
different objects you work with the
 

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.100
different objects you work with the
different kind of connections between

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:23.110
different kind of connections between
 

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.560

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:02.980
design community like Taylor Ling was
 

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.320
design community like Taylor Ling was
there we had Lucas Roca Orisha from

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.330
there we had Lucas Roca Orisha from
 

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.980
there we had Lucas Roca Orisha from
pattern walmer from from Brazil whole

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:10.990
pattern walmer from from Brazil whole
 

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.170

bunch of folks were there as TAS so they

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:13.180
bunch of folks were there as TAS so they
 

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.400
bunch of folks were there as TAS so they
walked around and help people as they

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:14.410

had questions would you guys think of
 

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.120
had questions would you guys think of
the the experience of the live lab I

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.130
the the experience of the live lab I
 

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:22.410
the the experience of the live lab I
thought it was really cool I mean it was

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:22.420
thought it was really cool I mean it was
 

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.940

a definitely something we haven't done
 

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.440
a definitely something we haven't done
before like normally we're used to doing

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.450
before like normally we're used to doing
 

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.470
before like normally we're used to doing
code labs at Google i/o so it was

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480
code labs at Google i/o so it was
 

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.300
code labs at Google i/o so it was
something new and different and I was

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:30.310
something new and different and I was
 

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.740
something new and different and I was
just really impressed with all the work

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:31.750
just really impressed with all the work
 

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.720
just really impressed with all the work
that the attendees came up with at the

end so I think we may post some of those
 

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.140
end so I think we may post some of those
at some point yeah it's some points

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.150
at some point yeah it's some points
 

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.090
at some point yeah it's some points
there we go yeah I I made sure to

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.100
there we go yeah I I made sure to
 

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.850
there we go yeah I I made sure to
capture the G+ profiles of all the

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:41.860
capture the G+ profiles of all the
 

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.030
capture the G+ profiles of all the
winners well the winners I think we the

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.040
winners well the winners I think we the
 

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.250
winners well the winners I think we the
TAS selected like four or five different

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:47.260
TAS selected like four or five different
 

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.090
TAS selected like four or five different
apps to I guess to win

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:51.100
apps to I guess to win
 

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.970

kind of awesome oh and by the way these
 

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.720
kind of awesome oh and by the way these
were hand-sketched designs in the end I

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:15.730
were hand-sketched designs in the end I
 

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.360
were hand-sketched designs in the end I
some people did use their computers but

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.370
some people did use their computers but
 

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.680
some people did use their computers but
for the most part they'll hand sketch

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:19.690
for the most part they'll hand sketch
 

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.510
for the most part they'll hand sketch
which was really cool yeah pursue things

which was really cool yeah pursue things
 

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.340
which was really cool yeah pursue things
I liked about lab boys and because it's

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:23.350
I liked about lab boys and because it's
 

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.720
I liked about lab boys and because it's
a developer conference and we pulled the

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:24.730
a developer conference and we pulled the
 

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.310
a developer conference and we pulled the
audience who is primarily developers

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320
audience who is primarily developers
 

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.590

there and we said you know we want to
 

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.750
there and we said you know we want to
introduce you to the concepts how you

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760
introduce you to the concepts how you
 

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.700
introduce you to the concepts how you
know you think through your application

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:32.710
know you think through your application
 

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.500
know you think through your application
and sketch it all out rather than just

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:34.510
and sketch it all out rather than just
 

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.909
and sketch it all out rather than just
you know which I think a lot of people

you know which I think a lot of people
 

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:38.220
you know which I think a lot of people
do is dive into the code too quickly and

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.230
do is dive into the code too quickly and
 

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.500
do is dive into the code too quickly and
you know build and invest a lot of time

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:40.510
you know build and invest a lot of time
 

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.090
you know build and invest a lot of time
is something which then won't throw away

so it's really interesting to get people
 

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.600
so it's really interesting to get people
thinking about sketching and like

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:45.610
thinking about sketching and like
 

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.520
thinking about sketching and like
thinking through the problem space a lot

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:47.530
thinking through the problem space a lot
 

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.830
thinking through the problem space a lot
more you know find the design rigor a

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840
more you know find the design rigor a
 

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.600
more you know find the design rigor a
lot more before jumping to code which is

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:51.610
lot more before jumping to code which is
 

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.310
lot more before jumping to code which is
really interesting and also on a second

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320
really interesting and also on a second

great to see a heavier design focus than

00:22:59.399 --> 00:22:59.409
great to see a heavier design focus than
 

00:22:59.409 --> 00:23:01.470
great to see a heavier design focus than
previous years sort of especially in the

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480

so on so we were involved a bunch of
panels for example where we're meeting

00:23:17.399 --> 00:23:17.409
panels for example where we're meeting
 

00:23:17.409 --> 00:23:19.289

things that came through for me was the
 

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.159
things that came through for me was the
importance of Android design a lot of

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:26.169

businesses were saying you know this is
like impacted numbers we care about like

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:29.860
like impacted numbers we care about like
 

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.620
like impacted numbers we care about like
install numbers revenue and so on

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:31.630
install numbers revenue and so on
 

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.820
install numbers revenue and so on
because we've had talked to the Android

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:32.830
because we've had talked to the Android
 

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.350
because we've had talked to the Android
design principles so I think it really

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360
design principles so I think it really
 

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.909
design principles so I think it really
shows the maturity of like the android

00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919
shows the maturity of like the android
 

00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:37.169
shows the maturity of like the android
user base out there and how they really

00:23:37.169 --> 00:23:37.179
user base out there and how they really
 

00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:39.510
user base out there and how they really
appreciate a well-designed out yeah and

it now has an android version so you can

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:23.980
it now has an android version so you can
 

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.220
it now has an android version so you can
actually mirror what what's on your

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:26.230
actually mirror what what's on your
 

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.410
actually mirror what what's on your
computer to your android device very

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:28.420
computer to your android device very

similar to the Android design preview

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720
similar to the Android design preview
 

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.390
similar to the Android design preview
the tool that we talked about I think a

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:33.400
the tool that we talked about I think a
 

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.690
the tool that we talked about I think a
few few weeks ago but this net this is

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:36.700
few few weeks ago but this net this is
 

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.120
few few weeks ago but this net this is
now free and it also works over Wi-Fi so

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.130
now free and it also works over Wi-Fi so
 

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.680
now free and it also works over Wi-Fi so
basically the almost the same thing as

actually play with it because I think

00:29:38.419 --> 00:29:38.429
actually play with it because I think
 

00:29:38.429 --> 00:29:39.710
actually play with it because I think
you have to see it in motion

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720
you have to see it in motion
 

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.840
you have to see it in motion
to really sort of understand it but yeah

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:41.850
to really sort of understand it but yeah
 

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.130

and then someone else has also turned

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140
and then someone else has also turned
 

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.930
and then someone else has also turned
into a library on get out of here yeah

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940
into a library on get out of here yeah
 

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.940
into a library on get out of here yeah
great stuff yeah I'm sure they'll

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:46.950
great stuff yeah I'm sure they'll
 

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.130
great stuff yeah I'm sure they'll
they'll link up at some point but the

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140
they'll link up at some point but the
 

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.390
they'll link up at some point but the
idea is that you me you have this kind

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:50.400
idea is that you me you have this kind
 

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.279
idea is that you me you have this kind
of transparent action bar that shows

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:52.289
of transparent action bar that shows
 

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:54.080
of transparent action bar that shows
content at the top but as soon as you

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.090
content at the top but as soon as you
 

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.320
content at the top but as soon as you
start scrolling it becomes solid so it's

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:57.330
start scrolling it becomes solid so it's
 

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.720
start scrolling it becomes solid so it's
very cool effect definitely you know

00:29:59.720 --> 00:29:59.730
very cool effect definitely you know
 

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.990
very cool effect definitely you know
worth considering for one of your apps

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000
worth considering for one of your apps
 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.720
worth considering for one of your apps
so that was that was that and then I

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:05.730
so that was that was that and then I
 

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:06.950
so that was that was that and then I
think this is though this may be the

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960
think this is though this may be the
 

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.740
