00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.380
When you say the word "chemicals", most people
think "chemicals bad" or "chemicals dangerous,"

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.889
those people say things like, "I don't give
my kids food with chemicals in it" or

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.559
"that factory puts chemicals in the water."

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.320
Sometimes these people are thinking of liquid
chemicals that are, for example,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.789
sprayed on crops, or gaseous chemicals that
come out of smokestacks, or exhaust pipes.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.710
But those people probably don't think of chemicals
as solids.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.509
To them, solids like thr table, here, or my
computer, or aardvarks -- that's just stuff.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.730
But it's vital to recognize that, as I've
said before,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.800
almost everything you interact with on a daily
basis is chemicals, except for like, light.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.680
And with the exception of air, the vast majority of the matter that you interact with is in the form of solids.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.840
Like I'm interacting with my clothes right
now,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.660
which is good, otherwise this would be...this
would be an inappropriate episode.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.180
But solids are a lot more diverse than what
we might think of as just hard or strong or stuffy.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.650
Stuff-like. Stuffish. Stuffable.
Stuff the Magic Dragon.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.900
Many metals, for example, are almost infinitely
moldable under the right conditions.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.040
Meanwhile, rocks aren't moldable at all,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.729
their lack of flexibility causes them to shatter
or crumble under sufficient force.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.460
Then there are solids that we think of as
being softer, like rubber and clay and Styrofoam,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.740
all of which are soft for different reasons,
and behave in very different ways.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.000
None of this is random.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.140
Like all matter, solids get their characteristics
from the arrangement of their electrons,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.770
their chemical bonds,
and their intermolecular forces.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.210
There are 2 main classes of solids, crystalline
and amorphous.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.259
The atoms in molecules in crystalline solids
are arranged in an orderly, predictable way.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.290
Amorphous literally means "without shape,"
and amorphous solids, unsurprisingly,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.399
don't have a definite shape because their
atoms and molecules are arranged randomly.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.520
And just within these 2 classes, solids can exhibit a pretty amazing variety of characteristics and behaviors.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.659
So you may just surprise yourself by learning something new about materials that you thought you knew inside and out.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.180
And even better than that, you can explain it to some of those people who don't even know what chemicals really are.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.160
[Theme Music]

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.240
The category of amorphous solids includes
things that you might expect,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.840
like foams and gels and colloids, like mayonnaise, rubber, waxes, and some biological tissuessuch as fat.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.260
They also include some things that you might
not expect,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.600
like coal, the things silicon panels use in
semiconductors, and even glass.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.560
That's right, despite what you may have heard, glass is not a liquid, I don't know who made that up.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.060
In chemistry, amorphous doesn't mean soft
or even flexible,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.160
although many amorphous solids are both of
those things.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.360
Instead, the classification is all about the fact that their atomic structure is disordered, or random.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.020
Amorphous solids do however have a couple
of macroscopic properties in common.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.280
First, it is important to understand that because the particles in an amorphous solid are arranged randomly,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.680
the strength of the bonds holding them together
are also random.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.900
That's what causes amorphous solids to melt
gradually, like this glass tube.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.870
As the material is heated, the weaker intermolecular
bonds break first,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.360
then the stronger ones break as the energy
threshold is broken by heat.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.700
So amorphous solids don't have the sharp discrete melting points of things like ice, which melts exactly at 0,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.510
instead, they melt over a range of temperatures,
as the heat energy increases.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.760
Amorphous solids also respond to stress very
differently than crystalline solids.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.110
Because the arrangement of crystalline solids
is so orderly,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.690
they're often very easy to break along a plane
that falls between adjacent molecules,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.700
and when they break, they tend to do it along
straight lines,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.870
the way cutting a diamond creates perfectly
smooth facets.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.940
But with many amorphous solids, it's hard
to find a plane like that.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.650
No matter how you attack it, you'll usually
run into molecules that are sitting right

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.340
in the middle of that plane, resisting the
break.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.000
And even hard amorphous solids that do break under pressure rarely do it along straight lines,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.740
that's why broken glass ends up in crazy random
shapes.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.640
And why coal looks like a random rock, not
like a nice orderly crystal.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.170
We have a name for this, amorphous solids
are isotropic.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.620
Meaning that they respond to stress in the
same way in every direction.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.220
No matter which direction you poke a piece of clay, or hit a piece of glass, it's resistance to breakage will always be similar.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.620
But crystalline solids are anisotropic, they break differently depending on which plane you hit.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.800
Speaking of diamonds, you probably think of 'crystalline' as things that look sorta like that.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.040
But there are actually 3 different types of
crystalline solids,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.530
and they cover a huge array of materials,
some of them pretty surprising.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.280
Those types are based on composition.
They can be molecular, ionic, or atomic.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.660
Molecular solids are made up of covalent compounds that form an orderly crystalline structure as they solidify,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.170
while their molecules remain unchanged.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.330
Examples include things like water ice, dry
ice - which is just frozen CO2, and sugar.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.120
Because the molecules are held together by weak Van de Waals forces, they break down pretty easily.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.140
For that reason, these solids generally tend
to be soft with fairly low melting points.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.360
Ionic solids are basically the solid forms of things we think of as ionic compounds like sodium chloride - or table salt,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.120
calcium carbonate - which is chalk and limestone, and magnesium sulfate - otherwise known as Epsom salt.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.600
Because they are made of ions, they are often
soluble in water and other polar solvents,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.650
but they have very high melting points.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.260
So table salt would be gone in no time if
I put it in water,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.060
but if I applied heat directly to it, it wouldn't melt until the temperature reached 801 degree Celsius.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.100
Atomic solids, as the name suggests, are made
up of individual atoms, not molecules at all.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.980
Sounds simple, well there are actually 3 types of atomic solids too: network solids, group 18 solids, and metals.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.740
Network solids are so interesting and important that we're going to cover them in a separate lesson.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.490
I won't get in to it now except to say that
the atoms basically form a rigid crystal structure.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.110
A diamond, for example, is just a big crystal
made of carbon atoms.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.880
So you can think of diamonds, and other network
solids, as really giant molecules.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.140
Group 18 solids meanwhile are the solid phase materials of the noble gases - Group 18 on the periodic table.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.920
Since noble gases have little interest interacting,
even among themselves, it's very hard to cool

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.920
and pressurize them enough to make them form
a liquid and even more so to make them solidify.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.760
So when they do crystallize, the atoms are
held together by weak little Van de Waals

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.650
forces, not stable at all to say the least,
so they don't tend to stick around for long.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.800
Because of this, they're really rare, and
not something that you'll, like, ever encounter,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.300
unless you go on to study them specifically.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.020
But metals, you know metals they're everywhere.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.680
You're probably looking at me on a device
made of metal.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.580
You probably have metal in your pocket.
You might have metal in your teeth.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.620
And yeah, you probably don't think of metals
as crystals,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.560
but remember the key is that their atoms are
arranged in an orderly way.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.090
The atoms, in fact, form several different
arrangements

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.680
in order to best take advantage of the space
and the structure.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.480
These structures are called closest packing
arrangements.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.650
To picture how it works, think of metal atoms
as spheres

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.950
and consider how they can pack together in
the most efficient ways possible.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.120
Like imagine if you have to fill the box with
as many ping pong as you can,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.810
the atoms stack just like the ping pong balls
would.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.000
In spite of their orderly arrangement though,
most metals are quite malleable.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.740
Meaning that they can be pounded in to various
shapes,

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.580
and ductile, meaning that they can be stretched
out in to wires.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.260
Both of these characteristics result from the nature of their atoms and the bonds between them.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.660
The atoms in metals are large.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.780
So large, that the valence electrons aren't
held very strongly by the nucleus.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.919
This gives them much more freedom to move
around than the electrons on most elements.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:18.060
So instead of belonging to a single atom, they form a kind of sea of electrons, wandering from 1 nucleus to another.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.460
These freely moving electrons are in fact the main reason that metals can conduct heat and electricity so easily.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.420
It's actually more accurate to say that the
electrons form large,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.520
somewhat unstable, orbitals around collections
of atoms.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.120
The nuclei are tightly bonded together by
the electrons that are all around them,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.470
making the metal structure extremely strong.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:41.170
But the bonds are uniquely flexible, allowing the kinds of deformations that we're accustomed to from metals.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.360
Despite the crazy array of solids that classify as crystalline, they do all have certain things in common.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.440
And as usual, most of their common characteristics
are related to their bonds.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.400
Since all the bonds in a crystal are the same
length, their all equally strong.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.919
Which means they can be broken by the same
amount of energy,

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.519
and their melting points are very specific
temperatures, not broad ranges.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.760
Crystalline solids are also generally more
brittle than amorphous ones,

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.139
and as I mentioned, respond to force differently
in different directions.

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:10.360
It's kind of crazy to think that all of the
different things that we think of as solids

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.370
are actually so different from each other.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.570
All of the Volvos, and reusable shopping bags,
and kid's bicycle helmets,

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.940
are all from a diverse array of chemicals
called solids.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.199
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.180
If you've paid attention, you've learned the difference between amorphous and crystalline solids.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.740
You've learned that crystalline solids can
be made up of molecules, ions, or atoms.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.289
And that the ones made of atoms, can be networks,
noble gases, or metals.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.200
You also learned some of the properties of
solids in each of those categories,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.420
and you learned that in every case the properties
of the solid are

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.300
much more related to the bonds between the particles than to the identity of the particles themselves.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.580
