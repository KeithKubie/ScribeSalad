00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.390
- [Instructor] In this video
I want to take a look back

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.130
at the period from 1800 to 1848,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.700
kinda from a bird's eye view.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.510
This is a huge time in American history.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.750
In 1800, the United States
was just a fledgling nation,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.010
less than 20 years out from
winning its independence.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.570
Political parties were in their infancy,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.210
infrastructure was
practically non-existent,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.880
and one disastrous war with a world power,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.160
with the likes of Great Britain or France,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.150
could easily have wiped it out.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.980
But fast forward to 1848,
less than 50 years later,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100
and by then the United
States had developed

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.240
a great deal as a unified
independent nation.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.960
It occupied a vast amount of
territory in North America,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.230
trains and steamships transported
goods to distant markets,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.370
factories churned out textiles,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.440
and politics saw the rise and fall

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.860
of not one, but two party systems.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.700
Despite all this growth,
in 1848 the United States

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.210
was just 12 years away from the onset

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
of an incredibly bloody
civil war that pitted

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.440
Southern states against
the U.S. government.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.850
This seems like quite a contradiction.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.650
Over the course of the first
half of the 19th century,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.360
was the United States developing

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.300
a unified national identity?

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.220
Or were its geographic sections

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.700
developing a divided regional identity,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.010
barely held together by the Constitution?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.440
What we're doing here really

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.160
is asking a historical question.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.070
If you saw this on the AP exam,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.380
the question might look
something like this.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.750
Explain the extent to
which politics, economics,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.460
and foreign policy
promoted the development

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.380
of the American identity
from 1800 to 1848.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.060
Sounds pretty fancy schmancy.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.930
But we can translate that
to a simpler question.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.550
What tied the United States
together as a country

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.050
over the course of 1800 to
1848, and what split it apart?

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.850
To answer this, let's review what

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.180
happened in this period
in these three areas,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.950
politics, economics, and foreign policy,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.930
and see if we think they contributed

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.810
to a unified American identity

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.920
or a divided regional identity.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.880
And just to remind you
this is a big overview

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.470
of the historical developments
from 1800 to 1848.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.520
I'm not gonna take a lot of time here

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.550
to explain everything in depth,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.960
but if you find that you're unfamiliar

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.870
with some of the things we discuss,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.290
make a note of it and then go back

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.740
to review that concept
when you've got some time.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.180
Okay, as we set about
to answer this question,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.320
let's just brainstorm some of
the major political, economic,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.210
and foreign policy developments
in this time period.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.610
It doesn't have to be an exhaustive

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.490
list of everything that happened,
just some key highlights.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.480
I'll suggest a few, but
feel free to pause the video

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.110
and see what you can think of on your own.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.940
Alright, what happened in politics?

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.640
Well, there was the development
of political parties.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.760
First, the Federalists and
the Democratic Republicans,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.310
and then later on they were replaced

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.130
with the Jacksonian
Democrats and the Whigs.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.750
There was the expansion
of the right to vote

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.390
to almost all white men in this era,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.700
and there were a lot of
political controversies.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.460
Two that come to mind are
the Missouri Compromise

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.770
and the Nullification Crisis.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.740
So which of these things
contributed to a unified identity,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.000
and which contributed
to a regional identity?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.100
Well, I would say that
the Missouri Compromise

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.340
and the Nullification
Crisis were both examples

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.080
of regional identity
trumping American identity,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.470
since they concerned the balance of power

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.950
between free states and slave states,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.300
and whether states or
the Federal Government

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.030
should have the final say.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.350
The expansion of the right to vote

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.030
seems like a point for unification to me

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.640
since it celebrated American democracy

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.190
as the birthright of
white men from all states.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.290
On political parties, I might
say this is inconclusive.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.190
There are elements of both
unity and division among them

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.750
since political parties
weren't exclusively defined

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.710
by region in this time period,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.130
but they were often defined by how

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.480
much power they believed
the Federal Government

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.410
should have compared to the states.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.880
Okay, on to economics.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.910
Major developments in
this time period include

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.840
the Market Revolution, the
controversy over tariffs,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.190
and the increasing separation
between the economies

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.210
of the industrial North
and the agricultural South.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.270
Of these, I would say that
separate economic systems

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.780
definitely promoted a
divided regional identity.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.690
The controversy over tariffs
also promoted divisions

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.700
in that Southern plantation owners

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.620
thought that tariffs gave advantage

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.580
to Northern manufacturers
at their expense.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.950
The Market Revolution is a
bit tricky to categorize.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.350
It promoted some ties between the sections

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.870
because it became easier
to conduct business over

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.220
long distances due to innovations

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.700
in transportation and communication.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.100
But a lot of the major networks

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.460
of transportation and
communication connected the North

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.300
and the West to each other, not the South.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.300
Lastly, foreign policy.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.560
In this era there was the War of 1812,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.100
as well as westward expansion
that caused conflict

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.380
with Native Americans and with Mexico.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.910
I'd say that the War of
1812 was a force that

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.680
brought Americans together in
a shared sense of patriotism

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.510
following victories like
the Battle of New Orleans.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.960
The westward expansion was
a bit more of a mixed bag.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.190
In general, most white Americans supported

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.220
the concept of Manifest Destiny

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.550
and thought that the
removal of Native Americans

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.400
for that purpose was justified.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.910
But westward expansion also
led to regional conflict

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.900
because the admission of
new states into the Union

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.070
threatened the balance of power between

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.300
free and slave states in Congress.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.400
So based on the evidence
we've gathered here,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.480
let's see if we can formulate a

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.110
thesis statement to answer this question.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.390
The prompt is asking us
to evaluate the extent

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.620
to which developments in politics,

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.890
economics, and foreign policy promoted

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.830
the development of an American identity.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.400
So I think that we want
to approach this not as

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.410
an either-or, or a yes-no question,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.100
but rather a question of degree.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.320
I would say that the overall evidence

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.710
here points to a divided regional

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.290
identity with a few points of unity.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.040
Americans agreed that the
United States needed to expand,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.510
and that democracy was the
birthright of all white men,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.520
but in almost every
other aspect of politics,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.640
economics, and foreign policy they were

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.020
divided along sectional lines.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.150
Would you come to the same conclusion?

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.490
Remember this is only one way
of answering this question.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.000
You may have come up with
some different examples,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.850
or you might interpret these examples

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.210
in a different way than
I have, and that's okay.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.010
The next step now that you've
evaluated your evidence

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.990
and composed your thesis statement,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.710
is to think about how you
might arrange the thoughts

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.953
you've gathered here into
an argumentative essay.
