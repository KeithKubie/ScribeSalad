Today's video is sponsored
by War Thunder.

00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:05.300
Today, we're putting a common
household hazard to the test.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900
We are going to see what happens

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.000
if you stick a paperclip
into a live outlet.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.360
[Music]

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.800
Here, we have an outlet,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.900
and of course, normally,
outlets aren't just sitting

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.000
in the middle of desk.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900
But this outlet has been
extended from the wall outlet.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.406
This is a normal outlet.

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:27.100
It has all the same insides

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000
and parts and workings and wires
as the outlets in your wall.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.900
The only difference is it's
a lot easier to get

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.985
to here on the desk.

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:33.835
As you can see,

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:35.600
Calli has plugged
in this lamp,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.762
and it is functioning.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.400
Of course, it's also not normal

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.300
for a tank to come crashing
through your wall,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.694
but that's something you can do
in the game War Thunder,

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:44.000
our sponsor for today's video.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Nate and I had a chance to try

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.700
out this online military
vehicle combat game,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.700
and it's a lot of fun.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.200
It's true.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.434
We were able to download it
for free on our computers,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.900
but you can also play it
for free on Xbox and PS4,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.880
and if you want
to play with friends,

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.049
but don't have
the same system,

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.899
that's all right,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.780
because War Thunder allows
for cross-platform play.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.200
Something that I
thought was really cool

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.300
about this game too is

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.400
that this game has
more than 1,200 historically

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.694
accurate playable tanks,

00:01:05.694 --> 00:01:07.400
aircraft, helicopters, ships,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.105
everything ranging
from the 1930s to the 1990s.

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:12.600
Personally, I like
playing the M1 A1 Abrams.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.606
It's just amazing to drive
around this vehicle

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:15.900
that you see in today's news.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.800
Click the link
in the description to register

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.300
and download War
Thunder for free.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.126
By using our link,

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:22.100
you will receive
a premium tank or aircraft,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.300
as well as three days
of premium account time.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.800
So let's take a look at
what's inside an outlet.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.500
And again, this
is the same thing

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.100
that's going on
inside your wall.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.600
This is just kind of
a slick little packaging for it.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.400
Other than that,
it's exactly the same.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.223
So you can see

00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:37.102
that the three wires
here actually connect

00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:39.099
with the three different
parts of the socket.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.199
So you've actually got
a ground, a neutral,

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.636
and a hot,

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:43.600
and they all connect
with the different wires.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.747
In the United States,

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:47.100
ground is either going
to be bare copper,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.200
or with a green
covering over it.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.100
Neutral is white,
and the hot wire,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.413
the one where electricity
comes in, is black.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.920
Those connect onto our outlet.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.300
Usually, in an outlet
in the United States,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.800
where you attach the hot wires
is going to have gold screws,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.000
and where you attach
the neutral wire is going

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.100
to have silver screws.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.699
In this case,

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:05.659
they've also used
a green screw to show

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.000
where the ground attaches.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.700
The ground is
an emergency backup wire.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.400
It's in case
something goes wrong.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
If too much
electricity flows through,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.469
or if something
gets physically broken,

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.587
the ground is there
to make sure that

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:18.584
any wire flowing

00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:21.700
through the hot get sent
into the safe ground spot,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.885
because it's not going
to be flowing correctly

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:25.149
through the neutral wire.

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.400
So now, you've seen
what's inside the outlet.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.203
We have the three different
wires that each corresponds

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:31.953
to the three holes
in the plug face.

00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:32.642
This bottom one

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:34.500
that's shaped kind
of like an archway,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.700
that's the ground wire.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.800
All of the electricity is coming
in through the hot wire.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.683
That's the smaller
hole on the right.

00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:43.300
The other two holes are
the neutral and the ground,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.600
and that's where
the electricity goes back out.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.423
To get alternating
current to work,

00:02:47.423 --> 00:02:49.300
it needs to be
completing this path,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.100
and it only comes from one side
and goes out the other side.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.400
So now, we want to find out
exactly what's going to happen

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.900
if we start sticking bits
of metal into our outlet.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.000
Here's the basic idea.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.022
We have got paper clips,

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:00.904
we've got knives,
and we've got electricity.

00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:03.140
Let's see what happens
when they all meet.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.000
We've got a voltmeter,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.800
and we can use it
to test the voltage

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.200
running through this outlet.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.600
We'll attach one lead
into the hot and one lead

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600
into the neutral,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.400
and then, we can also
attach to the ground,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.049
and we should get
the same result.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.600
We're seeing about 122.9,
and we are in the United States,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.070
where usually that's
putting out about 120.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.894
So that lines up pretty nicely.

00:03:24.894 --> 00:03:25.800
If a person were

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.935
to get 15 amps running
through them at 120 volts,

00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:30.700
that could stop your heart.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.200
It's really, actually,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.000
a dangerous amount
of electricity.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.162
So, is this something
that can happen to you just

00:03:37.162 --> 00:03:39.600
by sticking a paperclip
in the outlet?

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.500
So, in the neutral,
we get a reading of 123.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.961
If we put the lead
in the ground,

00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:50.260
the exact same
reading, 123 volts.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.500
Is a paperclip going
to complete a circuit?

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.450
Well, it's possible.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.400
Here's the thing you
have to keep in mind.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.800
If the paper clip is
in the hot side of the outlet,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.700
there is electricity
flowing into it,

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.849
but electricity isn't
going to flow

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.920
unless it can go somewhere.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.048
With a neutral and ground,

00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:08.082
that allows the
circuit to complete.

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:10.200
If the paperclip
is touching nothing,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.000
then a circuit
is not going anywhere.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.900
It's not complete,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.000
and electricity is not going
to flow through it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.600
However, you could be grounded.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.600
Currently, I'm wearing
shoes with rubber soles

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.515
and rubber gloves,

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:22.500
but they are kind of
thin rubber gloves,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.100
and I don't know exactly
how conductive my shoes are.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.041
So it's possible

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:28.982
that if I put this
into the hot side of the outlet,

00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:29.807
it would zap me.

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:32.800
Although, I do feel fairly safe
putting it into the neutral

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800
and the ground side,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.400
and I'm even gonna try
that right now.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.154
It doesn't seem to be
doing anything to me.

00:04:38.154 --> 00:04:39.400
I'm not feeling it.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.380
Ground.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.560
Neutral.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.420
Nothing's really
happening there.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.700
With the outlet unplugged,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.200
we've now fit this paper clip
into the hot side,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.200
and now, we're going
to plug it back in,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.900
and do some more testing on it.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.200
Not by grabbing it though.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.888
Let's take our voltmeter,
and check this again.

00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:58.300
So again, we're going to have
one connected to the neutral,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.980
and the other one,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.535
we're going to touch
to our paper clip,

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:01.600
which is now extended out.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.500
So this paper clip is now hot.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.852
And by hot, I don't mean
temperature, it's warm.

00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:10.500
I mean, that it has electricity
ready to flow right through it.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.600
123 flowing through
that paper cup right there.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.900
Now, I'm not quite dumb

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.198
enough to just grab
straight on to that,

00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:19.728
but we have some hot dogs,

00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:23.280
which have a similar moisture
and sodium content to people.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.952
And we're going
to see what happens

00:05:24.952 --> 00:05:27.600
if we connect hot dogs
to both of these wires.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.600
So, he's putting
on a much thicker,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.500
much more insulated
gloves for this.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.720
Okay.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.700
So now, we're going to see
if anything happens

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.500
with this hot dog touching
to both of these paper clips.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.140
Oh!

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.720
That is sparking
and that is burning.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.900
Yeah, I don't know
about, you guys,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.400
but I like my fingers
more than that.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.100
So that would,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.700
that would be
your fingers right there.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.300
Yeah, it almost has
a smell of burning hair.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.900
That's actually what
this reminds of.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.800
Probably the casing
around the hot dog.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.700
So, you may see this
and think well, I mean,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.200
I get that it's shocking
and it's burning a little bit,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.020
but that doesn't look
like that bad of an injury.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.600
So, if you just left
a hot dog sitting

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.100
on this for like 10 minutes,
would you have a cooked hot dog?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.500
At least, partially.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.120
Right now, we've got
the lead so close together

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.060
that they're not going
to cook most of the hot dog.

00:06:14.064 --> 00:06:16.114
It's just going to travel
the shortest path from

00:06:16.114 --> 00:06:17.056
where it's touching.

00:06:17.056 --> 00:06:18.800
But now, I'm going
to see what happens

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.770
if I actually try and to stab it
onto the paper clips.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:29.160
[Music]

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.940
&gt;&gt; I think--
&gt;&gt; Yeah...

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.260
I don't think you want
that on your skin.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.100
I think you made it angry.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.700
Oh, boy.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.500
Did I ever?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Oh, no.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.240
That smells awful.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.900
Okay, that's not the smell
of burning meat, guys.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.500
That smell of like melting
acrylic and burned hair.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.539
That's terrible.

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.139
This like carved a hole
into the hot dog,

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.000
and completely blackened
out that paper clip.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.500
So with the hot dogs,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.350
it just takes
a little bit of contact,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.000
and you can see
it starts burning.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.700
However, there is
a bigger concern with people.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.700
When electricity flows
through muscles on a person,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.900
they actually are activated.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.640
They seized up,
and they contract.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.080
Hot dogs don't have a lot
of muscles going on in them.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.220
In fact, I'd go
ahead and say no...

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.980
None muscle.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.256
No connected, active muscles
inside a hot dog.

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:20.200
People, however,
are full of them,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.600
and it takes only as

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.200
little as 0.005 of a volt to
make the muscles start spasming.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.000
This is much more than that.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.180
This is 120,

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.660
about 123, actually,
volts running through this.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.500
So, if you were
to accidentally touch this,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.679
then your muscles

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:40.906
could seize up, grab
the paper clips even harder,

00:07:40.906 --> 00:07:44.200
and maybe pull you in
so that you can't let go,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.300
and then the electricity
keeps flowing through you

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.300
with no other path.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.700
It's just going to go
through you until something

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.953
breaks that circuit.

00:07:52.953 --> 00:07:53.793
So, we've seen

00:07:53.793 --> 00:07:56.700
what our finger analog does
if it comes in contact

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.900
with both the hot and the
neutral leads at the same time.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.300
All right, so I want us to try

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.027
and actually bend one
of these paper clips,

00:08:03.027 --> 00:08:03.610
and see if we

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.900
can complete that circuit
without using a second one.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.900
When I say "we",

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.800
I meant I was going
to make Nate do it.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.569
Now, I'm going to be wearing
a thick rubber glove,

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:16.340
I have rubber-soled shoes,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.800
and the paperclip should conduct
electricity very well.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.900
So this paper clip will be
the path of least resistance.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.200
This should mean

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.836
that electricity isn't flowing
into me, especially,

00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:29.473
because this is a pretty good,
sturdy rubber glove,

00:08:29.473 --> 00:08:31.881
and I really think
it's going to do a good job.

00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:32.876
Let's plug this in,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.600
and see what a paperclip does
in the hot and neutral.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.840
Well, definitely,
got a lot of sparks out of that.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.660
Well...

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.100
Got a lot
more sparks out of that.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.860
You were making...

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.355
Wow!

00:08:45.355 --> 00:08:47.000
&gt;&gt; That went--
&gt;&gt; Staying very connected.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.299
Oh, did the light turn off?

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:49.800
Oh, the light just turned off.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.800
Okay, so we had lights plugged
in all around the studio,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.100
and that second time there
where it sparked,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.660
they all turned off.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.200
So I'm pretty sure that means
we've now tripped the breaker,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.100
which is what we
were hoping would happen.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.394
That's what the breaker
is designed for.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.700
And you can see now,
this is still in there,

00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:10.600
and nothing's happening,
no more sparks, it's not hot,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.100
and all the lights are off.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.700
So, we need to find
the circuit breaker.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.400
Should be this switch.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.694
You can see how this,

00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:20.900
for example, this doesn't move
that direction at all.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.360
This one however,
can click that way.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.000
That means it's tripped.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.100
So what we do is
we switch it back to off,

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.300
and then the paper clip is
not in there anymore, is it?

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:30.550
Nope.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.400
I'm checking.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.320
You're good.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.460
That should have fixed it.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.000
We've got our outlet unplugged

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
again after successfully
tripping the breaker

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.700
with our paper clip
a couple of times.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.200
The next thing we're going
to try is fitting our paper clip

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.400
into the hot lead side
of the outlet,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.500
and then, touching it
to the grounded screw

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.675
in the middle of the outlet.

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.900
We're going to see if we get
the same reaction to that

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.660
as we did with the neutral
side of the outlet.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.840
Yep.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.300
That tripped the breaker again.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.700
Whoo.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.500
Wow.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.807
Yep.

00:10:04.807 --> 00:10:07.100
That zaps it pretty good.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.400
There's just burn marks all
around the screw now.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.500
Something that I
think is important to note.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.000
When we had the paperclip
connecting the circuit,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
it sparked a lot,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.354
but the breaker tripped,
it turned off.

00:10:17.354 --> 00:10:20.700
When we had the hot dog
connecting the two paper clips,

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.020
it wasn't flowing enough
to trip the breaker.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.356
That's probably the same thing

00:10:24.356 --> 00:10:26.092
that would happen
with your fingers.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.520
The electricity would flow,
it would burn,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.620
it would cause your muscles
to contract and seize,

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:32.976
but it probably isn't going
to trip the breaker,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.200
which means...

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.600
&gt;&gt; It's gonna keep hurting.
&gt;&gt; You're in trouble.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.300
Yeah, it's gonna keep going.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.500
You've heard the story

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.480
of the kid who puts a fork
in the socket and gets shocked.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.200
So we've got a paperclip stuck
into the neutral side,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.749
and we're going to do
some tests with a fork

00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:48.446
and a couple of knives, and see

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:51.260
if we can complete
that circuit using those.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.600
Right now, it's not plugged in,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.100
but can a fork fit in there
enough to make contact

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.200
with the leads?

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.276
Or is it too big and broad?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.000
How about the two
knives we've got?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.600
We're going to try
it with all them.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.140
Let's try butter knife first.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.920
Well, first problem immediately,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.375
and I don't think there's
any way to wiggle or fine angled

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:10.737
that into actually make it.

00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:12.100
So let's try our fork next.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.280
[Music]

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.833
I don't think
that's going to go either.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.520
I don't think there's any way
to touch that hot wire.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.294
Last utensil we're going to try,

00:11:21.294 --> 00:11:23.858
I think we might have
some success with this one

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.800
given the angle.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.580
You do jump.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.000
I told you.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.700
Look at that.

00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:39.230
So this where the paperclip
touched our knife.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.161
Zap.

00:11:40.161 --> 00:11:42.700
So with this fork
and table knife,

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.300
it wouldn't fit into the outlet.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:44.900
It would not.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.583
So, I'm thinking

00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:47.900
that this butter knife was
just too rounded to actually

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.850
touch the hot wire,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.200
and for this fork,
those tines are just too thick.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.269
I'm sure if somebody

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:54.389
was very determined
and had a thinner fork,

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:55.600
they could make it work.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.451
This particular fork
is just very sturdy.

00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:58.349
We want to be clear

00:11:58.349 --> 00:12:00.800
that just because we
weren't able to fit this fork

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.400
and this knife in this outlet
does not mean it's safe.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.050
It doesn't mean
you should try it.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.300
You should not try to do it.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.932
That's the whole point
we're trying to make.

00:12:08.932 --> 00:12:10.186
We're not putting
this to the test

00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:11.500
for you to put this to the test.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.500
We're showing you
why not to do this.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:13.814
Yeah.

00:12:13.814 --> 00:12:17.400
So, what happens when you stick
a paper clip in an outlet?

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.760
Burns, shocks, sparks.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.380
Tripping the breaker.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.013
So overall, not a good plan,

00:12:23.013 --> 00:12:25.200
but it's fun
to show what happens

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.490
because you always hear,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.360
and now, you can see why
you don't want to do that.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.400

to see something explode,

We got this bomb
here in the middle.
