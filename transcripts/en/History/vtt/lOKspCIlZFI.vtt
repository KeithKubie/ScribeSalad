00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.170
- All right, smiths, welcome to
our strength test.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.880
Now what I'm going to do is
take each of your daggers

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.880
and very violently stab them
into these steel fuel cans.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.170
Now I don't really care what
your daggers do to the cans.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.620
I want to see what the cans are
going to do to your daggers.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.830
Jason, you're up first.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.790
You ready?

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.540
Let's get to it.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.210
Damn right.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.710
Please, please, let
this thing not break.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.920
[rock music playing]

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.380
Jason, the big thing is you
picked up a bend in your blade.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500
The handle is also very large.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.920
It's kind of hard to hold onto.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920
And even with the
glove thrusting in,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.420
I can feel those edges.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.750
But, overall you survived.
Good job.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.920
Thank you.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.880
Daniel, what you thinking?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.330
You ready?
- Go for it.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.210
I'm hoping I don't
pick up a warp,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.540
and I hope my handle
doesn't break.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.500
[rock music playing]

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
All right, Daniel, we
got a couple problems here.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.880
Your blade and your
dagger picked up a bend.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.620
And also, there's
a lot of chipping

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.040
on both sides of the knife.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.420
And the other thing, your handle
is very, very lean, very little

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.620
to hold onto.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.960
But overall, your
dagger survived.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.790
Good job.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.040
Thank you.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.620
Drew, what you thinking?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.960
Let's make some holes.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.290
[rock music playing]

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.000
All right, Drew, you
did get a little bit

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.250
of a roll on your tip.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.670
And you picked up a
little chip right there.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.830
Your handle is really slim.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.500
And the fluting
doesn't even make

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.170
a quarter rotation, really.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.500
So it's really just
ridges I'm holding onto.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.750
It's not the most comfortable
handle in the world.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.580
But overall, your
dagger survived.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.000
Good job.
- Thank you.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.750
Bladesmiths, to see how
sharp your blades are,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.000
I will stab this fish,
I will slice this fish.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.420
Unlike the strength test,
this is all about what

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.920
your knife will do to the fish.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.750
Jason, you're up first.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.120
You ready for this?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.750
Let's go.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.500
[rock music playing]

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.330
All right, Jason, let's talk
about your dagger right here.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.960
First up, your inside edge, once
you penetrate into the fish,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.880
your edge is sharp
enough to slash off.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.460
Now in a motion where you're
slashing away from the fish,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.540
this edge cut cleanly
on the bottom.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.500
But the other cuts pretty
much bounced off the fish.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
But overall, it will cut.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.790
Thank you.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.540
Dan, you're up next.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.380
You ready?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.540
Let's make sushi.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.000
Absolutely.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.210
[rock music playing]

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.170
All right, Dan.
Let's talk about your blade.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.830
One of your edges cuts clean.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.670
When you penetrate into the
fish, lacerates all the way.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.000
But the area that has
a little bit of a chip

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.500
does show a little bit of some
jagged cuts over the fish.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.250
But the important
thing is, it will cut.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.250
Thank you.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.580
All right, Drew, you ready?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580
Let's do this.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.880
[rock music playing]

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.080
Well, young man,
your dagger has

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.460
a great symmetry in here that it
penetrates deep for the thrust.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.790
And it lacerates cleanly
on your drag coming down.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.210
The big issue is your handle.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.710
It's on the slim side.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.290
And your fluting did not
provide a very good grip.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.120
So it started to
rotate a little bit,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.620
especially because
of all the slam

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.960
it's getting from the fish.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.710
But your edges will cut.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.120
That's all I needed to hear.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.120
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.540
They've made a final decision.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.880
It's time for one of
you to leave the forge.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.120
Daniel, your blade
didn't make the cut.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.790
Daniel, during
the strength test,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.080
you lost chunks of your edge
on both sides of the dagger.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.790
And you had a failure
on the handle, too.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.580
And that pull, that's
punched through

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.670
into where the tang is sitting.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.830
That's why we're
going to let you go.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.080
Daniel, please
surrender your blade.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.000
I agree with the
judge's decisions.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.120
The chips in the handle were
just too much to get past.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.670
I had a heck of a good time.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.670
It was a great personal
accomplishment.
