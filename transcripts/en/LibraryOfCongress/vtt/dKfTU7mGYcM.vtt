00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.790
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: I'm Gwen
Kirkpatrick from the Department

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.600
of Spanish and Portuguese
at Georgetown University;

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.920
it's actual Spanish and
Portuguese and Catalan.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.870
And I'm honored to participate in
the National Book Festival hosted

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.680
by the Library of Congress
throughout its 16 years

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.480
of existence.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.260
And I'd also like to give a special
thanks to the Hispanic Reading Room

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.160
of the Library of Congress and its
amazing staff and a long history.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
We also want to thank the
co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.040
David Rubenstein and the many
National Book Festival sponsors,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.520
who made this event possible.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.100
We also especially want to thank
the Embassy of Spain and Spain Arts

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.810
and Culture, who have a
beautiful house on 16th Street

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380
with many wonderful events.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.920
You, too, can support the
festival with a gift of a donation.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.740
Just check your program,
and on the app.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.590
The festival would not be
possible without the support

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010
of sponsors and book lovers.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.460
Just to ask you a favor,
if you have a cell phone,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.410
make sure it's turned off.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.820
We'll have a question and answer
after the author's presentation,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.350
so you can save your
questions until then.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.630
And please be aware
that your questions

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.520
and answers will be
filmed and conserved.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.270
Carlos will also be available
for book signing from 2:30

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.890
to 3:30 on the lower level.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.510
Okay, from the size of the
audience, I see you know

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.130
who Carlos Ruiz Zafon
is, but I'm going to go

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.020
through my little paragraph anyway.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.930
Carol Ruiz Zafon originally
from Barcelona,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.820
is an internationally
acclaimed author,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.370
whose works have been translated
into more than 50 languages.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.490
More importantly, he is one of
the world's most read novelists.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.850
His literary career began in
1993 with the Prince of Mist,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.340
which was followed by The Midnight
Palace and September Lights.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.520
Those three are available
as the Mist Trilogy,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.020
and then The Haunting Maria.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.850
In 2001, he published his first
novel for adults; the others were

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.880
for young adults like me.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.820
I love Marina.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.550
The Shadow of the Wind, which
soon became an international

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.710
literary phenomenon.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.300
With the Angel's Game of 2008,
he returned to the universe

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.400
of The Cemetery of Lost
Books, which grew further

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.850
with the Prisoner of Heaven, 2011.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.120
And this November, I understand,
he will publish another volume

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.510
of this group called Labyrinth
of the Spirits, but in Spanish.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.040
[Applause]

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.340
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
And as you know,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.080
his works have won many prizes;
and he has millions of readers.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.190
Okay, so now.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.100
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
That's my exemplary life.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.400
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Right.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.120
A question, all readers and critics
have praised your story-telling

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.630
abilities, the strong plots and
the strong characterizations.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.590 position:56%
Why is it that the world still needs
stories and needs stories in series?

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.380
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Well,
I think story telling is one

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.680
of our natural instincts.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.560
We communicate through
stories, through sequences.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.790
The human brain can only
absorb, that can be structure

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.650
as a sequence of events of ideas.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.830
And naturally at some point
because this is how we think,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.930
this is the software of our
brain, at some point the instinct

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.070
to tell stories, to take that
and transform it so to speak,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.040
into an art, and trying
to understand ourselves,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.600
our experiences, the world, the
world we inhabit to communicate

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.340
through fiction, through creations,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.150
through ideas, through
symbols evolved.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.550
And it has existed in
every single culture.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.790
It has reached many
different mediums,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.740
and no matter how many
technological changes,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.420
cultural changes we go through, the
need to communicate and the need

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.310 position:56%
to create, generate stories that
can be stories about the real world,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.130
can be narratives, persists.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.460
So in way, literature, what it
is, is trying to take that and try

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.750
to create an art of storytelling,
trying to work with language

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.780
in a way which is not
merely functional,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.750
but allows us to explore all these
classic themes in human nature,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.580
in our history, in our world
and try to create a narrative

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.660
for our imaginary world, characters
that speaks and engages us.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.980 position:56%
And I think it's one of our natural,
most natural and direct instincts

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.310
that will always exist
in some way or another.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.610
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: And so much

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.750
of the world's literature
exists as oral stories.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.050
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
That's how we began, uh-huh.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.350
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
Huge, huge amounts,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.720
still many parts of the world.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:01.220 position:56%
You talked about continuing the 19th
century gothic genre in some novels

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.170
or modifications of it, I think
it's, with its mysteries, monsters,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.340
and dark palaces or mansions.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.810
We have a lot of mysterious
monsters in contemporary television

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.130 position:56%
and films often set in remote times.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.330
Why is this so appealing
to the public,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.880
especially to the young public?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Well, I think
that the narrative of the fantastic,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.870
the monsters, imaginary worlds,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.140
all these elements are just
elements in storytelling.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.670
I think it's only recently through
the 20th century that the marketing

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.680
of storytelling has forced us
to consider different niches

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.720
or different segments and to
create genres for the purpose

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.530
of marketing them differently.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.820
Now we pull something fantasy
in science fiction and horror

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.690
and mystery and literary fiction;
whatever the hell that means.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.180
So we have in all this
different labels that make sense

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.050
from a marketing point of view, but
from a story telling point of view,

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.300
all these elements have
been combined together

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.910
since the early stages of
storytelling from oral storytelling

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.870
to the written words, audio-visual
storytelling and they exist.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.470
And what I think is appealing
about these elements for instance,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.740
elements in the Gothic, the
sense that you can transform

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.020
and take elements of the fantastic
or the atmosphere of many things

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.530
and give them a new meaning,
give them, use the symbols

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.840
and empower them to provide a
dramatic function inside the plot,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.080
inside the story that may not
have if we were to treat them

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.960
from a purely pluralistic
point of view.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.950
And I think this is what makes
them so powerful and also so hard

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.200
to use well because they're
like big weapons that can easily

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.420
if they're not managed well,
they can fire back at you.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.030
But if they're well used, I
think this is why the tradition

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.280
of the fantastic that goes back
centuries, you know, if you,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.620
for instance you take an example

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.660
that everybody knows,
William Shakespeare.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.110
The plays of Shakespeare are
filled with monsters, with ghosts,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.820 position:56%
with the prodigious, with mysteries,
with elements; and he combines all

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.940
that stuff because it
it's a ghost story.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.440
Hamlet is a ghost story, not
necessarily, it's a tragedy.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.010
It's a great story about human
nature about the human condition,

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.400
but he uses all of these elements
as devices to tell the story,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.120
to give a specific
power to symbolism.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.910
And I think this is
why if these devices

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.920 position:56%
of the fantastic are well used, they
continue to resonate with audiences

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.740
because there's a point of them,
not because the audience believes

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.620
that these things are real.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.190
Yeah, they're, you know, right
here in the mold, dragons

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.780
and elves and things like that.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.240
No, but if we use this kind of
elements, vampires or ghosts,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.380
the stories, or haunted
houses or whatever,

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.350
these things I think allow us to
tell more and tell more intensely

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:06.100
and reach into the topic elements
that are in the minds of readers

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.010
or in the audience and
this is where why they're

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.340
so interesting and so rich.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.510
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: But
your monsters are not,

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:22.060 position:56%
we have a lot of block-buster movies
where the monsters or like robots;

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.190
they're highly technological.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.330
And a lot of your monsters are...

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.750
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Yeah,
they don't run on batteries.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.100
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: They
don't run on batteries,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.140
they're incredibly physical.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.050
Could you just talk, I was
thinking about that in Marina.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.350
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Yeah, Marina.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.220
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: The
monsters, they have, they're wood

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.890
and secret and plants and vines.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.100
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Yeah, one of
the things I've been trying to do

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.910
for now, I was very
intrigued by the storytelling

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.020
and especially the Gothic
novels of the 19th century,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.170
the great tradition of the great
novelists of the 19th century.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.520
And ever since I was a
child, I tried to figure

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.910 position:56%
out how these narratives were built.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.500
And in a way so to speak, to
reverse engineer them and say,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.210
"How, how do they do this?"

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.200
And what I was interested
is in trying

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.710
to get this grand tradition
all these fantastic writers

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.240
from Wilkie Collins Dickens
to all the great writers

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.430
of the 19th century and say, "Would
it be possible to take this model

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.370
of storytelling, which is the
birth of modern story telling;

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.310
most of the early grammar of film
comes from 19th century novels,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.920 position:56%
the structural way, the use of time,
the use of plots and sub-plots,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.720
everything comes from there.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.560
But at the time of course
the readers, the audience,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.440
for instance the audience
of Dickens,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.160
Dickens was an immensely
popular writer in his day...

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.620
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Newspapers.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.590
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: It was
published in installments

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.440
in magazines, in newspapers.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.570
He was making it up as he went.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.950
The versions of Dickens
we read today are kind

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.180
of laboring when he finished.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.570
The famous 3-tong novel was
something that he had to go back

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.650
and try to match things up
because they never matches.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.240
They had been published
originally because he was making

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.870
up these huge stories
week after week.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.170
And so eventually...

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.470
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
With a deadline.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.770
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Oh,
yeah, with a deadline.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.390
But this created this kind
of serialized storytelling,

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.630
the way of trying to hold
your audience' interest.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.830
I think there was very
interesting to me in this model.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.760
And what I've been trying to do
for many years, and I started doing

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.190
that in Marina, is could it be
possible to deconstruct this model,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.900
this type of storytelling
and rebuild it

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.200
as if it were a new engine,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.780
but incorporating all
the things we've learned

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.040
through the 20th century, interest
of storytelling, which are many.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.040
Through the 20th century,
both story tellers

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.110
and audiences have become
extremely sophisticated.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:55.020
In a way it's like we could speak
about a technology of storytelling

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.800
in the way that technology has
evolved, what we've learned

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.660
about how people absorb codes,

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.420
how they can interpret
different languages,

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.890
how they can be stimulated
in many different ways.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.060
And we've learned this
through movies and television,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.890 position:56%
through advertising, through
graphic design, through comic books,

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.570
through literature, through
many different genres,

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.790
through modernist fiction,
through genre fiction to mystery,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.300
from Noir, from all these things.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.510
We've learned many, many different
things about the technology,

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.600
the technique of how
can we tell a story

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.650 position:56%
in a more efficient and intense way.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.630
So what I wanted to do is see
would it be possible for me to try

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.780
to take all these things, all
these devices, all these techniques

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.360
and recombine them in trying to
bring back the classic tradition

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.090
of storytelling from
the 19th century novels,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.240
which is about the classical themes
of literature of old time and try

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.130
to re-invent this in a way that
stimulated modern readers in all

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.390
of these different de-coders
that now we have in our brains

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.320
because we've grown up
watching TV, watching movies,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.320
reading comic books, reading
different types of fiction,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.600
seeing journalists, and
seeing many different things.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.400
So we have built in
without even realizing

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.690
from childhood all these
little decoders in our brains

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.440
that a reader of Dickens never had.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.430
A reader of Dickens had never
seen a movie, had seen TV,

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.290
barely had seen any theater,
barely had been exposed

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.130
to many forms of storytelling.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.950
Now days in our world, we are just,

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.690
we don't even realize how
sophisticated we are as audiences.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.660 position:56%
So I thought, could it be possible
to bridge this thing for an audience

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.670
that can be simulated from
many different angles and try

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.660
to use the classical themes of
literature that we've learned.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.200
And this was something that
I've been trying to do,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.330
move in that direction
for a long time.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.490
Marina was the first
attempt to try to do this.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.980
And then the quartet of
the World of The World of,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.980
Cemetery of Forgotten Books,
The Shadow of the Wind,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.730
The Angel's Game, so forth, is
what I've been really trying

00:13:53.730 --> 00:14:00.000 position:56%
to implement this, trying to do this
attempt to get closer to this ideal.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.870
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: We're
smarter than we know.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.260
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: You
didn't know about that.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.550
While you're looking into the
kitchen, this what happens

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.450 position:56%
when you step into the kitchen, say,

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.050
"I didn't know you put this
crap into what I'm eating."

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.540
Say, "Well, if you step into the
kitchen, you're going to find

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.730 position:56%
out too much information, so you
either stay there in the dining room

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.160
and you don't know
what you're eating.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.020
It tastes good, don't ask.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.470
But if you want to know
what goes into the pot, hey,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.370
it's your choice, so now you know."

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.670
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Okay.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.970
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: I know
it sounds very pretentious

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.100
and very laborious and like it's a
laboratory, and then the technology

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.800
of the 19th century, sounds like
some kind of steam punk stuff.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.780
And, you know, it's
just storytelling.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.360
I think it's the job of a
novelist, of a story teller

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.480
to figure these things out and then
to present them in a seamless way

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.890 position:56%
in which when you're reading,
you're just flowing through the text

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.200
to see what are, you're
immersing yourself in the imagery

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.190
of the characters in
the world you're telling

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.100
and you are not seeing
all the technicalities;

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.030
things like when you cross
the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.130
you don't think about mathematics.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.000
But it's about mathematics, that's
why it's a glorious engineering...

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.300
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
We hope they knew.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.360
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Or the
Cathedral of Cologne, you know,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.760 position:56%
that thing centuries ago, you know,
it was designed so when you walk in,

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.700
people would go in and say, "Oh,
my God, this is the House of God,"

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.000
and they would be humbled
by that monumental structure

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.340
and that's how they
thought in emotional terms.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.280
But the Cathedral of Cologne, it's
about mathematics and engineering

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.630
and is a prestigious feat that
even to this day is so impressive,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.030
imagine that in the 13th century.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.910
So I'm putting this parallel
between engineering or technicality

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.890
of architecture and literature
because I think they're very close.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.160
You build something that in
nature is very technical,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.480
but the reader should
never realize about it.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.960
It should fell easy, simple,
something that you enjoy

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.770
and you are not aware
of how it was done.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.070
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: One

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.020
of your main characters
wants to be an architect.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.710
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Yeah,
there's one in Marina and one of,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.860
there's a parallel
in which he wants,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.340
he dreams of becoming an architect,
and by the end of the book,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.350
he inherits this mission in which
Marina was trying to write a book

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.760
that she will be never able to.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.000
So he takes it upon
himself to finish the task.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.640
So he was dreaming of
becoming an architect,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.590
and he will be an architect,
but an architect of story

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:27.060
that Marina leaves in his hands.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.360
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Okay.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.990
Your first four novels were
called young adult novels,

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.700
but there are similarities
with some of the later novels.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:43.590
Some of the same things reappeared,
young orphans or young people

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.980
who might as well be orphaned.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:51.860
They're alone in the world
unanchored, particular attention

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:59.880
to old people, I think, really
moving portraits of older people,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:05.220
older than I am, mystery,
and the presence

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.870
of the real evil in the world.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:14.500
And I suppose a question
why for young adult novels?

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.990
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Well, the
ugly truth, it was an accident.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.870
I never meant to write
for young adults.

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.790 position:56%
I was hoping to at some point, I
always knew I wanted to be a writer.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.650
I wanted to make a
living writing stories,

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.330
writing books, and
that was my calling.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.390
And when I was four years
old if you asked me,

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.170
kids want to be an astronaut,
a soccer star, or psychopath,

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.140
or something, I would say,
"No, I want to be an author.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.440
I want to be a writer."

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.030
And for me it was very clear,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.130
the only thing was how
do I convince the world

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.760
that this is such a clear thing?

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.560 position:56%
And it took me a few years, so until
I was maybe in my mid-20s or so,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.580
I had to make a living doing
other things that had a lot to do

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.260
with storytelling,
but were not novels.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.750
But at some point I managed
to do that and I became

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.140
when I was 20-something
a full-time writer

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.860
and that's what I've been
doing for my entire adult life.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.610
And the thing is why that?

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.760
I had written a number of
novels that I didn't publish.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.190
There's some monstrous
things that you have to write

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.830
to learn your craft and nobody
should ever read, should be burned.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.580
But I think, I always
thought that you had

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.360
to earn your right, you know.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.430
Time is limited, so if you have
the enormously pretentious sense

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.310
that you deserve other
people's time,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.200
if what you write is worth other
people's time, you should work

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.180
as hard as you can to provide the
best you can to them because say,

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.800
"You know, I'm going
to take a few hours

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.480
out of your life, so
I better earn it."

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.880
So I wrote this novel
for young adults

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.770
because at the time I thought
it was a good idea, whatever.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.830
I had written a number of novels
that I didn't want to publish,

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.680
and this book that was my first
published book called The Prince

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.630
of Mist [title in Spanish].

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.360
I won a big award in Spain
for young adult literature.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.370
And because of that and because
the book became quite successful

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.590
and I found success in a field
that I had never expected to,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.660
and I was aware of how hard
it was to survive as a writer.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.550
You know, you see it around you
and all writers are like people,

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.540
it's like an abyss and people
are hanging from a thread,

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.670 position:56%
like you know, in cheap movies where
you see the rope is going, like,

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.970
threeep, threeep, threeep,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.260
and everybody's looking
to see who's next.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.200
And down there are the snake pit.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:37.230 position:56%
And at some point somebody snaps and
they fall jumm, you never even it,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.850
he never hits the bottom.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.830
It's like, "Oh, my
God, I'm going next."

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.030
So you become very much
aware of how hard it is just

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.800
to survive as a novelist.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.010
So because I had found
success in that field,

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.720
I became very conservative
and I didn't want to leave.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.510
I was scared to leave,
so I pretended

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.060
to be a writer for young adults.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.590
I don't even know to
this day what that means.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.170
What is a young adult?

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.470
It's an adult?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.770
It's a child?

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.070
I don't know, to me
they are readers.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.950
Some of them are 8 years old,
some of them are 90 years old.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.670
I don't care, I don't ask from them

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.760
for a driving license,
I don't card people.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.710
And I found 15-year-olds
were immensely more mature

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.840
than people they you need
to do the carbon test,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.090
you know, where they from, so.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.300
It's like, I don't care,
I don't care about that,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.940
but at some point there's what we
were saying about marketing labels.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.660
So I wrote a few, three books
that could pass for young adults.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.870
To me they were just gothics,
super natural adventures,

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.400
some kind of re-invention of
Victorian, old ghost stories.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.950
That's what I was trying to do.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.700
But then I realized that I was
kind of betraying myself, saying,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.950
"You know, I found success
and did something well,

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.030
but this is not the kind
of book I want to write."

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:54.220 position:56%
So at some point I needed to, so
Mariana was a little bit of a bridge

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.040
between the world of the
books I wanted to write

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.670
and the books I had been writing.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.150
So it's a book in which I realized
that I could not pretend any more.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.080
I told my publisher at the
time, I'm working on something,

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.220
but it's not going to be for you.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.690
He said, "What do you mean?"

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.260
And by the end of Mariana I
knew that I could not go back

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.090
to writing a genre, not because
there's anything wrong with it.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.940
I think it's a fantastic genre in
which it creates readers, you know,

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.820 position:56%
invites young people to read and to
consider the wonders of all the fun,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.870
all the pleasure, of all the
wonderful things they can find

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.170
in the world of books.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.070
So these books have an importance,
you know, they have to be decent

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.110
so people are engaged and
become readers for life.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.380
But I knew that I didn't really
have the stuff to do that.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.160
So I tried to veer into the,
what I felt were the kind

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.750
of books I wanted to write.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.930
And the first one that was, you
know, for the first time I'm going

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.540
to give myself the chance to
do what I always wanted to do

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.970
and maybe I'll fail or not, but
at least I think I've earned

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.350
after a few years of decent
success as a young adult novelist,

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.360
and then it was Shadow of the Wind.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.090
Marina is somewhere in-between
because it was the place

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:11.420
where I was trying to figure out
how to use my roots, my memories,

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.250
my own city, Barcelona,
and try to, how to shape.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.070
At some point I think it
happens to all writers,

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.810
you want to go back home in a way
and try to use all that stuff.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.200
At first you need some distance,
and I put some distance,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.560 position:56%
my first three novels happened while
I was in the south of the coast

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.940
of England during World War II
[inaudible] and Calcutta, you know.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.610
And the third one could
have happened in the moon,

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.670
it just happened in
Normandy, in France,

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.400
places that were kind of far away.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.910
So for the fourth one, say, you
know, the time has come for me

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.950
to go back home and try
to figure out this thing.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.200
And I started using
Barcelona in trying to use it

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.980
as a character, not as a backdrop.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.200
I tried to create a
character out of the city

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.100
that to me represented what its
soul of the city and the whole city

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.020
with many secrets with
a dramatic history.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.080
And I came out with this kind of
Gothic, Noirish, Barcelona with,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.820
has many secrets and old
palaces and all that stuff.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.120
I tried to create a character.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.820
It's not the real Barcelona
even though if you go there,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.000
you can see it, you can find it.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.900
And I was interested
in drowning it in fact.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.240
Most of the structures
I'm mentioning

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.000
and everything, usually it's rel.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.300
It's there.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.170
You can go there and touch
the stones or these places,

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.900
but the whole thing
is heavily stylized.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.620 position:56%
It's seen through its stage in a way

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.400
that gives them this
additional atmosphere.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.120
So it was a little bit, the
journey I had from writing books

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.970
in which I had found success,
but were not my kind of material

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.640
to just, you know, try
to be myself as a writer,

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.420
which at some point you just
find what is your voice;

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.470
what is your register?

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.780
And that was with I
think part with Marina.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.620
And then it allowed me in a
way I felt that I was able then

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.040
to tackle the kind of work I wanted
to do, which began with Shadow

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.690
of the Wind, and the cycle of
The Cemetery of Forgotten Books.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.270
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Well, you
took my Barcelona question,

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.610
so I'll go to another one.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.090
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
Always do that.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.320
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: In 2008, I
read an interview in which you said

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.410
that 99 percent of the
best writing was being done

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.130
for television and film.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Well, that has
to be, that comes from an interview

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:21.790
that was heavily doctored.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.090
These were not the words.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.390
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Oh.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.690
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
Yeah, sometimes it happens

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.850
that when you do print interviews,
usually if you say something on TV

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.200
or on the radio, it's your words,
nobody can put words in your mouth.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.960
Sometimes if you do
a print interview,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.470
sometimes either there's
a mistake in the,

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.730
or something maliciously
somebody puts you

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:41.280
because it sounds very
provocative and it's going to sound

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.480
like you're saying, "Everybody
is an idiot, ha, ha, ha."

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.310
And they put that in the headline
and you're are never said that.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.880
Why would I say something
as stupid as that?

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.870
What I said about this, and
I'm sorry about becoming

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.800
because I've been hearing crap
about that interview for ages

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.020
because people say, "Do
you really believe that?"

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.270
And I say, "I never said that."

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.110
Why would anybody say that?

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.620
It's just idiocy.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.170
What I said that in
the last few years,

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.080
a lot of the best storytelling,
not the best literature,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.510
a lot of the best storytelling
had been seen in mediums

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.820
where maybe 20 years ago
we were not looking for.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.000
And mainly it was television
and cable television.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.750
And to this day I think
people, not 99 percent,

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.970
I think that over the last 10,

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.590
15 years in which mostly cable
outlets have granted the power

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.200
of creative control to
writers, we've seen a wealth

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.770 position:56%
of TV series that are extraordinary.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:39.290
And I think even though
I'm in the book business,

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.010
I have to acknowledge that.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.330
You know, a lot of the best
storytelling today, not all of it,

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.510
but a lot of the best
storytelling is done

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:52.280
by very talented dramatists working
very hard and creating TV series.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.170
For how long, this will
depend if the economic model

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.750
that has it made possible,
it's viable, it will continue.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.590
If not, it will disappear, so.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.830
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: You,
yourself are a script writer.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.130
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: I was.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.430
I bought my freedom though.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.730
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
You bought your freedom?

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.990
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Yeah,
I'm like those Roman slaves

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.230
that they bought their
freedom after working

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.180
for their master for a while.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.740
I used to work as a screen
writer many years ago.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.280
It lasted for a few years, it was
spectacularly and successful career

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.530
in which I wrote things
or mostly rewrote things

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.820 position:56%
that never were produced, which is
what happens to most screen writers.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.140
You get hired to write something
that will never get done,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.650
and usually you're rewriting
somebody else at some point.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.960
You get fired, somebody
rewrites you.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.960
And you make some money and you
see there at some point you say,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.110
"What the hell I'm
doing with my life?"

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.320
So you learn many things
about, along the way,

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.340
some things about storytelling;
other things about the nature

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:56.600 position:56%
of the film business and about human
nature, which you could do without.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.220
But, you know, I guess it's useful
information that at some point

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.440
if you're going to join organized
crime, now you know how it works.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.210
And so I worked for a while.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:10.080
And around the time I started
working on Shadow of the Wind,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.610
I was working on a rewrite, I
don't know, a certain project

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.120
for a producer and I
asked him to fire me.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.260
I said, "You know, you and me know
you're going to fire me eventually,

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.260
why don't you fire
me now, pay me off?

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.560
You'll do me a great favor."

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.870 position:56%
And he said, "Whatever, you go write
your art book or whatever it is,

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.100
get it out of your system,
and then you come back."

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.600
I'll say, "I'll do that."

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.020
Luckily Shadow of the Wind
did very well and so I kind

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.840
of bought my freedom not to have
to be a screen writer anymore,

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.510
which is not to put down
the labor of screen writers

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.190
because there are fantastic
writers and dramatists working

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.730
as screen writers, and a lot of
them got the chance to finally

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.700 position:56%
to show their jobs on TV because now
they were granted creative control

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.280
by the film industry.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.760
You have serial creative
control as a writer.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.740
You're just a hired hand
and you're a chewing pawn

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.940
and spit through the other door.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.040
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Were you
joined a very exclusive club

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.030
in being an unhappy script
writer in California?

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.020
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Yeah,
they're very few in California.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.470
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
William Faulkner

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:17.170
and Francesca Fitzgerald were
big flops as screen writers.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:21.640
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Well, Frances
Fitzgerald drank himself to death.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.320
Most known Frank around
Hollywood Boulevard,

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.770
and William Faulkner
had this very fond thing

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.690
in which years ago I became very
interested in William Faulkner,

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.780
his adventures in Hollywood,
so what [inaudible] them?

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.290
And he had an affair with
Howard Hawks' secretary.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.670
He used, lives in Oxford,
Mississippi

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.200
and he was writing his fiction
there and his sales were very weak,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.550
so he couldn't feed his
family with his fiction.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:48.110
And so every once and a while,
because Howard Hawks like him,

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.410
he gave him an assignment.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.170
He say, "Why don't you come
to Hollywood for a few months,

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:55.510
make some money and then you go
back to write your art shit?"

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.420
And he would go gladly.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.060
So in all these trips, he
started having an affair

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.230
with Howard Hawks' secretary, which
was then later made a caricature.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.000
I don't know if you know the movie
Barton Fink by the Coen brothers.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.570
There's an illusion,
there's a sub-plot

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.780
in which you find a character that
seems like an alcoholic novelist

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.950
that is working as a, and they, he
has an affair with the secretary

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.910
of big film maker or whatever.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.620
And they were having
their meetings in a hotel,

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.690
which is the Knickerbocker
Hotel, which is just north

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.150
of Hollywood Boulevard in an area
where now everything is owned

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.850
by the Church of Scientology.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.150
The world has changed.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:36.980
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
The world has changed.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.280
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
The aliens landed.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.500
And nowadays that is a residency
for old people, very old people.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.580
And it's a ghostly twilight
world, and in there, you know,

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.560
William Faulkner had this
love affair with this lady

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.070
and everything he wrote,
barely anything

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.840
of what he wrote got produced.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.740
And I don't think he ever
understood the business.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.110
There's this, an addict dote
in which Howard Hawks takes him

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:04.240
and Clark Gable on a hunting
trip with a lot of big guns

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.940
and big men with big guns.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.670 position:56%
They're shooting things that move
and Clark Gable approaches Faulkner,

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.000
who was kind of a short gentleman,
very dapper, very well-dressed,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.090
always with a [inaudible]
thing, and he goes,

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.100
"And Mr. Faulkner,
what is that you do?"

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.350
And he said, "Well, I'm a writer.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.980
And Mr. Gable what is that you do?

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.190
"And so, he never got it;
he never got Hollywood,

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.050
but he made some money that allowed
him to write some of his books

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.250
that became very popular
and that hopefully

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.490
to this day we can enjoy
which is a wonder thing.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.190
So you know, Hollywood
can be good in that sense.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.490
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Good.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.580
Well, I was going to ask you
about your work as a musician

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.940
and composer, but we need to open
the time for questions and answers.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.330
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: We don't
need to scare people with that.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.520
We already heard enough
horrendous stuff.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.270 position:56%
Say, "Don't let this guy make music.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.640
Give me a break."

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.940
Don't worry.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:10.550
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: So please
use the microphones in the aisle.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.340
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
People already escaping

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.640
when you mentioned the music.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.680
That's right, let's
run away from here.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.980
We need to get out of here.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.280
&gt;&gt; I do have a question.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.580
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Alright,
how about the first question.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.090
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: I hope
they survive the trauma.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:27.330
I'm so sorry.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.660
&gt;&gt; On the theme of Hollywood,
Shadow of the Wind seems

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.480
like a very visual movie.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.000
Can we hope that someone
has an option on that?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.110
Will it be made into a movie?

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.030
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Well, for
many years many people have wanted

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.920
to do Shadow of the Wind and some
of the other books into movies

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.060
and you know, to cut a very long
story short, I've always said, 'No,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.720
I don't want to transform
it to a movie.'

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.020
I turn everybody down
now because I didn't,

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.340
the people I most respect I know in
the film industry wanted to do this

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.180
out of good faith and
believed in the project.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.340
I told them, "Thank you very
much, but to me this whole cycle

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.400
of books is," and this
may sound a bit naive

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.190
because I could make a lot more
money and make them more popular

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.790
if I sold the rights or make
them into a movie or TV series,

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:14.860
but to me these are books
about readers, about writers,

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.490
about the written word,
about literature,

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.110
about the world of books.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.340
And I think it would be a
betrayal of their nature.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.930
And that's they mean to me and
that's how for me the version

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:28.290 position:56%
that I want all of you to experience
of these stories is already there.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.150
It has been projected in
the theatre of your mind

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.510
in the way exactly I want it.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:37.050
[Applause]

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.740
&gt;&gt; Hello. Since I'm
fond of the name Marina,

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.790
I'd like to know how you chose it
for your book title and character.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.240
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: How
do I choose the book title?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.540
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Marina.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.330
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
Well, Marina is the name

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.380
of a girl who's the central
character in this novel.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.000
This is a story of Oscar and
Marina and they're in the '70s

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.670
in a very twilight Barcelona.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.550 position:56%
And this is the story, it's
narrated by Oscar when he's an adult

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.240
and he remembers what happened,
his coming of age story

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.210
and what he remembers about Marina.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:16.620
So it's mostly about his sense
of what happened and this kind

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.730
of magical character
that he discovers

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.200
and that's the name, Marina.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.480
It's not about a yatzee
club of something.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.330
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Over here?

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.090
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name's Catherine.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.320
Thank you so much for coming
out today and doing this.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.620
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Thank you.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine: I was first introduced

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.520
to your literature a few years
ago reading The Shadow of Wind

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.500
and the other two in the
Forgotten Book Series.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.840
The writing is just so
beautiful and engaging.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.950
And I have the chance to go
to Barcelona and see some

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.950
of the places you were
talking about,

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.860
and every time I read these
books I always worried

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.680
that I'm losing something
in translation.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.670
How do you ensure when your books
are translated across the globe

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.870
into so many beautiful
languages that the essence

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:08.050
of what you're saying isn't lost
so that those of us who read them

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:12.950
in whatever language is
still getting what you wrote?

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.250
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
Well, I try to work

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.690
with the best possible translators.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.060
In the case of English, I work with
Lucia Graves, who we work together

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.580
for a long time and we have
a particular way of working

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.990
in which Lucia starts working
on a very rough first draft.

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:30.280
She sends this to me, I start
reworking it and rewriting it.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.810
It goes back to her, she looks
at it and we go back and forth.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.230
And then I do a final edit
to make sure that a reader

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:41.350
in English doesn't need anything;
that each dynamic, it's the music

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.310
of each sentence, the pacing,

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.980
everything that is exactly a
replication of what you get.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.610
In other languages, if I have
some knowledge of that language,

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.600
I can work more closely or
not with the translator.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.820
And there are cases in which I
cannot help them unless I get a

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.100
query from, I don't know,
from my Korean translator

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.400
and she comes up with a problem.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.960
And I say, "Baby, you're
on your own."

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.300
So in those cases,
yeah, you trust them

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.720
because they're good
and they do their best.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.940
And one day maybe one day I show up
in Soule, a hundred people waiting

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.290
for me in the airport
to throw tomatoes.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.460
Say, "What is this piece of crap?"

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.760
And it's never happened.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.530
I think I've always
been very fortunate

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:26.640
in finding great translators in
over 40-plus languages or so.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.600
But there are in some
instances you can't tell;

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.900
in some instances you
can because you know.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.000
And there are some languages,
English, for instance.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.850
From Spanish to English
it's pretty easy to travel,

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:42.210
and then there are a few dangers
along the way, but if you're aware

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:47.600
of them, I think you can match
them almost, like, 99.9 percent.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:53.690
And most of romantic languages from
Spanish to French to Portuguese

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.750
to Italian to many of these
romantic languages you can always

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.050
be seamless.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.970
Then there are other, for instance,
Dutch in which the structure

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:06.180
of the language grammatically has
some requirements or structure.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.100
You need to sometimes
break a sentence in two

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.990
that in Spanish may be longer.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:15.400
You need to decide where
units of meaning would go

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.500
and sometimes it's
trickier in some languages.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.490
But, you know, it's one at
a time and hopefully if,

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.060
in the case of English,
which probably concerns most

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:30.050
of you fellows today, I can vouch,
you know, every single thing

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.130
in there, it doesn't go to print

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.130
until I've redone it
a million times,

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.180
so I can say this is
the book I wrote.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.280
And then in some cases
rewrote just for the English

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.650
to make sure an English
reader doesn't lose anything.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.800
&gt;&gt; Catherine: That's
phenomenal, thank you very much.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: This gentleman.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.430
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.630
So I'd like to return to something
you said earlier in your talk

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:58.250
about how elements of the fantastic
have been in storytelling ever

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:03.290
since we could tell stories from
Greek tragedies to, you know,

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.930
Renaissance and how there's
a tendency in these days,

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.740
we're so sophisticated, we're
almost hyper-sophisticated

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:15.310 position:56%
into labeling things that have these
fantastic elements into different.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:18.820
So I suppose my question
as a writer who may want

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.550
to incorporate fantastic
elements, but not be labeled;

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:26.930 position:56%
is that unavoidable in order to get
published, in order to get marketed?

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:28.360
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
It depends, you know,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.670
it's a very interesting question.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.580
I remember the great
American writer, Gene Wolfe,

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.310
which is one of the greatest
fantasy writers, one...

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.610
&gt;&gt; The Book of the New Sun, yeah.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:38.520
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: They asked
him, "What is magical realism?"

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.160
And he said magical
realism is fantasy written

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.880
by people with Spanish names.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:51.150
So, and I think it's the best
definition I have for it.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.680
And it's true, you know, a lot
of these things are publishers

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.870
and books sellers and distributors,
they need to find a place.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.890
When you walk into a book store,
there's a section that says,

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:03.190
Fiction; and there's a section
that says, Mystery Thriller;

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:07.830
another one says, Fantasy; and
say, Science-Fiction, Horror.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.130
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Literature.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:10.430
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
Literature, you mean what?

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.520
The rest is crap then?

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.960
Or it means that this is so boring
and pretentious that just avoid it

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.620
and go to the Mystery section.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.920
What does it mean?

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.370
So it doesn't mean anything.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.960
It's just labels, it's marketing.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:27.430
So depending I think if your use of
the fantastic, it's more integrated

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:28.770
into a more naturalistic way.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.340
I think it's about the
sensibility, how you use.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.300
If you really go for the genre
traps, if you really want

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.950
to write a sword and sorcery novel,

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.490
then you're going to
be labeled that.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.960
But then again, you
have interesting case

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.140
in which they're writers
who're always borderline.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:51.800
Ursula Le Guin, she hates to be
classified away because she feels

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.600
that she's being cut off from
an audience and she's right,

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.430
but it's going to happen.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.410
I think one or two years ago the
English novelist Cakuto Shekuro

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:04.690
wrote what would be called, you
know, a sword and sorcery novel.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.590 position:56%
And he of course was so concerned
that nobody labeled it and say, "No,

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.240
no, it's literary fiction."

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.900 position:56%
He came so estranged the whole
thing, say, "Dude, you wrote a story

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.410
about the swords and giants
and dragons and castles

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.470
and fairies," So this is it."

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.000 position:56%
And say, "No, no, no that's not it."

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.610
I think he was concerned about this
labeling, about this thing about,

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.460 position:56%
you know, not being taken seriously.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.430
I think at some point,
you know, we as readers,

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.060
we have the criteria
to decide what's what.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.550
And, you know, there's fantastic
material published as fantasy,

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.270
as horror, as Noir, as mystery,
as literary fiction, as whatever.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.700
So, you know, you as a
reader, you just enjoy,

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.660 position:56%
and it's not about what's the label.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:53.090
The quality of a work of fiction
is defined by the use of language,

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.490
by the storytelling, by
the characterization,

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.790
by the world you create,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.610
how you engage the reader,
what the things you do.

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.840 position:56%
If it's a mystery novel, if there
are detectives, if people wear guns,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.590
if there's a spaceship, if
there's a monster or not,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:11.000 position:56%
it's just people walking around in
room in Brooklyn in the '50s talking

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.150
about the meaningless of
existence, whatever, you know,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.490
if it's good, it's not about that.

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:19.460
Books are about storytelling
and what defines them,

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.970
it's the storytelling, the
language, and the craft.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.160
What they're about, but
general they can be labeled.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.560
That it's just marketing
device, if you start believing

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.870
in these things, you
fall into a trap.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.600
And if you're a writer and you're
trying to work in-between the seams

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.420
and you're trying to incorporate,

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.590
you're going to be
labeled in some way.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.680
And sometimes for reasons
that are pretty absurd.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.030
And end you may get your box of
books and you may find a dwarf

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:49.930
with a sword and a monster
behind in the cover,

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.600
and you say, "Oh, my God, why?"

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.350
And, you know, somebody marketing
thought it was the best way

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.440
to market your book or not.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.070
Or they may find something
very mysterious

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:04.070
because it's literary fiction, so
we don't really know what it is,

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.370
and then you cannot talk.

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.670
But there's a dwarf in the book

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.120
and he has a sword
and he kills monsters.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.450
Shh, shut-up, it's not about that.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.420
And so, you know, all
of this preconceptions

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.350
and prejudices are a bit silly, but
are part of the industry or part

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.230
of the business and you just have

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.420
to navigate them in
the best way you can.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.260
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: One
final and brief question.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:33.360
&gt;&gt; Shadow in the Wind and so many
of your books are ode to books

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.230
and stories and literary lovers
and so I was just wondering

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:40.470
if you could name a couple titles
or authors that you love or serve

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:43.200
as a source of inspiration to you.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Well,
there's a writer I admire profoundly

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.460
who I had the chance
to meet today and talk

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.260
to [inaudible] Joyce Carol Oates.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.820
Joyce Carol Oates I
think is a genius,

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.200
is one of the greatest
living writers today

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.260
and she's one of my
favorite authors.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.560
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
She's about [inaudible].

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.700
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: She's just
incredible about how she manages

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.930
to be so prolific and
produce this level of quality.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:10.120 position:56%
This is an example of, I have a very
wide range of interests and tastes.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.360
I for instance I think
one of the best writers

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.130
of the last 50 years is John
le Carre just for his work

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.990
in the language and
characterization as a storyteller.

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.360
And say, "Well, it's
because," and I don't see him

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.610
as a spy novelist or
something like that.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.980
He's a novelist, he's
a prestigious writer.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:29.290
He just happens to tell stories
in which sometimes there are spies

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.260
and international intrigue.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.160
There are many, I'm very
interested in the work of some

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.460
of the 19th century
writers that we mentioned,

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.910
Dickens, Dumas, and company.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:44.770
I'm also very interested in a lot
of Noir writers from the Golden Age

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:47.740
of Noir, Raymond Chandler,
Ross Macdonald,

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.200
all of that to many
contemporary Noir writers,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.280
which I think are doing
tremendous job, the generation

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.660
of the Dennis Lehane, George
Bellacontus, people like that.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.550 position:56%
I love Stephen King, which today was
here blessing us with his presence,

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:03.450
which I think is one of the
greatest storytellers of all time.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.820
I think he's a modern day Dickens
and he's also a prestigious writer.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.420
You know, there are a lot
of very different things.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.430
I try to read without prejudice,

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.390
without paying attention
what things are labeled,

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.830
if this is because
this is commercial

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.290
or this is not commercial.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:24.130
I find a lot of these labels
downright silly, if not perverse

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.460
at some point to try to
discriminate certain things.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.530
And, you know, what I do my
test, is I pick up something

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:35.460
and I read half a page or the
first page or a page at random.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:39.500
You know right there
if you're in the hands

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.670
of somebody who knows their craft.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.400
You know, if the language works,
if there's something there it's

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.700
in the texture of the work.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.270
If something is well done,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.980
I don't care what's the
genre, what it's about.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.610
That's not what I'm going to enjoy.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.380
What I'm going to enjoy
is good work.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.320
And then I'm going to
be taken on a ride.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.560
I don't know, you tell me
the story, whatever that is

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.420
and take me to another world.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:05.370
And I think that's the most to me
the best way to approach anything.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:09.350
So, you know, I could go on
and on about writers and things

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.740
that I'm interested
in, and I'm hoping

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.730
to continue discovering
new writers, you know.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.750 position:56%
There are a lot of people out there
working hard, creating great things,

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:21.520
so keep an open mind and go for it.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:30.460
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick: Thank
you, Carlos Ruiz Zafon.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:31.760
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon:
Thank you so much.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.060
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
A real pleasure.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.360
&gt;&gt; Carlos Ruiz Zafon: Thank you.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.660
[Applause]

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.960

of the Library of Congress.
