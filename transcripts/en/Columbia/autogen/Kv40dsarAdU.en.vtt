was in front of me and her burro tripped
 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.530
was in front of me and her burro tripped
and she said that's one then it stumbled

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540
and she said that's one then it stumbled
 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.970
and she said that's one then it stumbled
a little bit more and she said that's

a little bit more and she said that's
 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.820
a little bit more and she said that's
two and then finally a really really

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830
two and then finally a really really
 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.440
two and then finally a really really
stumble a lot and she almost fell off

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450
stumble a lot and she almost fell off
 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.060
stumble a lot and she almost fell off
and she said that's three and she got

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070
and she said that's three and she got
 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.400
and she said that's three and she got
off her animal and pushed it off the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410
off her animal and pushed it off the
 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.940

she said that's one so the whole point

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919
she said that's one so the whole point
 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.620
she said that's one so the whole point
of this is you need to understand the

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630
of this is you need to understand the
 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.900

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680
 
 

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.790
 
that hold it cause it didn't even sound

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800
that hold it cause it didn't even sound
 

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:55.760
that hold it cause it didn't even sound
right so what about these girls

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:55.770
 
 

00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:00.320
 
another excellent question I'll talk

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:00.330
another excellent question I'll talk
 

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:01.940
another excellent question I'll talk
about the challenge of implementing this

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:01.950
about the challenge of implementing this
 

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.170
about the challenge of implementing this
and that's right at the heart of that

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180
and that's right at the heart of that
 

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:07.180
and that's right at the heart of that
challenge we think the key is to prove

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:07.190
challenge we think the key is to prove
 

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.310
challenge we think the key is to prove
prove these first in a controlled

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:10.320
prove these first in a controlled
 

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.430
prove these first in a controlled
environment but to be honest with you

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440
environment but to be honest with you
 

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.130
environment but to be honest with you
the conventional cars can be equipped

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140
the conventional cars can be equipped
 

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.860
the conventional cars can be equipped
with sensors and transponders at

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:18.870
with sensors and transponders at
 

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.530
with sensors and transponders at
relatively low cost to interact with

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540
relatively low cost to interact with
 

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.080
relatively low cost to interact with
these now you may say you need a special

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.090
these now you may say you need a special
 

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.360
these now you may say you need a special
need a special roadway I think what's

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:26.370
need a special roadway I think what's
 

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:28.160
need a special roadway I think what's
very interesting in Europe's leading the

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:28.170
very interesting in Europe's leading the
 

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.020
very interesting in Europe's leading the
way on that a lot of cities are

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:30.030
way on that a lot of cities are
 

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.270
way on that a lot of cities are
restricting automobile travel in their

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280
restricting automobile travel in their
 

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.360
restricting automobile travel in their
downtown areas because automobiles are

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:35.370
downtown areas because automobiles are
 

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.640
downtown areas because automobiles are
just not compatible with that kind of a

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:37.650
just not compatible with that kind of a
 

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.640
just not compatible with that kind of a
setting so we can begin to try these out

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:40.650
setting so we can begin to try these out
 

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.800
setting so we can begin to try these out
in situations where they don't mingle

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:42.810
in situations where they don't mingle
 

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.830
in situations where they don't mingle
with other cars but really all you need

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:45.840
with other cars but really all you need
 

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.290
with other cars but really all you need
to do is add a transponder to the

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300
to do is add a transponder to the
 

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.570
to do is add a transponder to the
existing cars which will probably cost

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:50.580
existing cars which will probably cost
 

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.730
existing cars which will probably cost
less than $100 and it can send out a

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740
less than $100 and it can send out a
 

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.910
less than $100 and it can send out a
signal I'm a car and I'm here and it can

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920
signal I'm a car and I'm here and it can
 

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.280
signal I'm a car and I'm here and it can
share its data on how fast it's moving

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:58.290
share its data on how fast it's moving
 

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:02.300
share its data on how fast it's moving
and where it's going and so it's right

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:02.310
and where it's going and so it's right
 

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.410
and where it's going and so it's right
at the heart of the issue of

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420
at the heart of the issue of
 

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.060
at the heart of the issue of
implementation but I think it is

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:05.070
implementation but I think it is
 

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.760
implementation but I think it is
something that if we can try it out we

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:07.770
something that if we can try it out we
 

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:09.260
something that if we can try it out we
can prove it out and get people's

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:09.270
can prove it out and get people's
 

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:10.970
can prove it out and get people's
attention so you put these three

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980
attention so you put these three
 

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.850
attention so you put these three
internets together the information

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:13.860
internets together the information
 

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.260
internets together the information
internet the energy internet and

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:15.270
internet the energy internet and
 

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.210
internet the energy internet and
mobility internet and you get

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220
mobility internet and you get
 

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.280
mobility internet and you get
transformational change in terms of how

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:19.290
transformational change in terms of how
 

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.630
transformational change in terms of how
we live our lives now I said at the

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640
we live our lives now I said at the
 

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.760
we live our lives now I said at the
beginning I think the only thing that's

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:22.770
beginning I think the only thing that's
 

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.770
beginning I think the only thing that's
going to bring about large-scale changes

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780
going to bring about large-scale changes
 

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.680
going to bring about large-scale changes
the market so can we give consumers

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:27.690
the market so can we give consumers
 

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:32.180
the market so can we give consumers
something better we've modeled let me go

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:32.190
something better we've modeled let me go
 

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:36.790
something better we've modeled let me go
back here a second

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800
 
 

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.339
 
we've modeled this type of vehicle in a

00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:40.349
we've modeled this type of vehicle in a
 

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:43.460
we've modeled this type of vehicle in a
community where not only are they

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:43.470
community where not only are they
 

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.339
community where not only are they
driverless and not crash not only are

00:45:46.339 --> 00:45:46.349
driverless and not crash not only are
 

00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:48.950
driverless and not crash not only are
they purposefully designed not only are

their paths coordinated precisely with
 

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.569
their paths coordinated precisely with
the mobility internet but their shared

they're not privately owned and very

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:57.030
they're not privately owned and very
 

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.450
they're not privately owned and very
very interesting results that suggest

00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460
very interesting results that suggest
 

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.390
very interesting results that suggest
that communities can have the same

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400
that communities can have the same
 

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.859
that communities can have the same
amount of freedom as they have with

00:46:03.859 --> 00:46:03.869
amount of freedom as they have with
 

00:46:03.869 --> 00:46:07.040
amount of freedom as they have with
privately owned automobiles with about

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.050
privately owned automobiles with about
 

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.290
privately owned automobiles with about
one-fifth to one-tenth the number of

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300
one-fifth to one-tenth the number of
 

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.589
one-fifth to one-tenth the number of
automobiles that dramatically lower cost

00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599
automobiles that dramatically lower cost
 

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:14.510
automobiles that dramatically lower cost
so that's what we're giving the

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520
so that's what we're giving the
 

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.180
so that's what we're giving the
consumers the same level of freedom to

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:17.190
consumers the same level of freedom to
 

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.730
consumers the same level of freedom to
move around and interact significantly

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740
move around and interact significantly
 

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.310
move around and interact significantly
lower cost and what we give society are

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:22.320
lower cost and what we give society are
 

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.849
lower cost and what we give society are
solutions to roadway crashes energy

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:25.859

consumption co2 inequality of access so

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:30.030
consumption co2 inequality of access so
 

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.430
consumption co2 inequality of access so
we think that that sets up for a pretty

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440
we think that that sets up for a pretty
 

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.099
we think that that sets up for a pretty
exciting future I'm about to wrap up

00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:34.109
exciting future I'm about to wrap up
 

00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:36.589
exciting future I'm about to wrap up
here in a second so how do you get to

00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599
here in a second so how do you get to
 

00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:42.160
here in a second so how do you get to
this how do you actually make it happen

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:42.170
 
 

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.170
 
first it had to get common understanding

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180
first it had to get common understanding
 

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.210
first it had to get common understanding
and I know that's hard to do and that's

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220
and I know that's hard to do and that's
 

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.079
and I know that's hard to do and that's
why I do what I do my second career dr.

00:46:51.079 --> 00:46:51.089
why I do what I do my second career dr.
 

00:46:51.089 --> 00:46:52.970
why I do what I do my second career dr.

all of them and we need to do that in a
 

00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:34.880
all of them and we need to do that in a
system of systems approach there's a

so one thing won't satisfy all of those

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680
so one thing won't satisfy all of those
 

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.090
so one thing won't satisfy all of those
needs and you need to get to that magic
