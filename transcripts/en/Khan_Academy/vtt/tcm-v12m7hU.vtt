00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.630
Problem 110.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.820
If candy bars that regularly
sell for $0.40 each are on

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.940
sale at 2 for $0.75-- so they
used to be $0.40, and now

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.400
they're going 2 for $0.75-- what
is the percent reduction

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880
in the price of 2
such candy bars

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.110
purchased at the sale price?

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.130
What is the price reduction?

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.950
So before, if I was going to
buy 2 candy bars, I'd be

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.140
paying $0.80, and now for 2
candy bars I'm paying $0.75.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.380
So I'm saving $0.05
or I'm getting

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.240
a $0.05 price reduction.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.130
So they want to know the percent
price reduction.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.720
So it's essentially what percent
is $0.05 of $0.80?

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.940
5 over 80 is equal to
what percentage?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880
So let's just figure it out.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.980
80 goes into 5-- and actually,
we could divide the top and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.140
the bottom, make it a
little bit easier.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.450
5.00, add some 0's there.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.170
So 80 does not go into 50.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.460
80 goes into 500, so how many
times does 8-- It goes into it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.420
six times, because
8 times 6 is 48.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.465
6 times 80 is 480.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.940
500 minus 480 is 200.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.780
80 goes into 200 two times.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.780
2 times 80 is 160, and then
remainder of 400.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.170
800 goes into 400 five times.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.200
So that's 0.0625, which is
the same thing as 6.25%.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.280
And that is choice B, 6 1/4%.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.570
Same thing.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.950
Choice B.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.690
Problem 111.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.780
If s is greater than 0, and the
square root of r over s is

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.410
equal to s, what is
r in terms of s?

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.900
OK, so let's just square both
sides of this equation, so you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.540
get r over s.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.450
The square root of r over s
squared is just r over s.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.650
And that's going to be
equal to s squared.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.990
We've got to square both
sides of the equation.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.790
Now let's multiply both sides
of the equation times s, and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.160
we get r is equal to
s to the third.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.690
r is equal to s to the
third, either way.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.000
And that is choice D.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.560
Next question, 112.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.540
They've drawn us a neat
little diagram here.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.210
Let me see if I can draw
what they have drawn.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.720
They drew it in a dark color, so
I'll draw it-- That's kind

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.590
of overly bright, but it
gets the job done.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.400
And then they have two
boxes inside of it.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.070
It looks like that.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.110
One box, something like that.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.570
One box, and then there's
another box in there.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.880
It looks something like that,
although they look like the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.560
same size in the picture.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.440
And they tell us that this
distance is 6 feet.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.230
They tell us that this
distance is 8 feet.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.700
The front of a 6 by 8 foot
rectangular door has brass

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.930
rectangular trim, as indicated
by the shading

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.560
in the figure above.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.560
OK, this green stuff is brass.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.340
If the trim is uniformly 1 foot
wide-- so that's 1 foot--

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.880
what fraction of the door's
front surface

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.590
is covered by trim?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.390
So we need to figure
out the area that

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.400
is essentially green.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.040
Well, the easier thing might
be to figure out the area

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.620
that's black, and
then subtract it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.470
from the total area.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.195
So what's the area
that's black?

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.955
So both of these-- well,
they don't tell us.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.325
Well, it doesn't matter,
we could figure it out.

00:04:13.325 --> 00:04:14.860
Well, there's a couple of
ways to figure it out.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.200
Let's just figure out the
area that's green.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.680
I'm going to do it in
different color.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.350
So let's figure out this
area right here.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.060
I hope you can see that.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.180
So that area is what?

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.400
Let me actually draw all of the
different boxes and then

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.650
we can figure out the areas.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.660
Then we have that one.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.560
And then we have this one.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.440
And then we have this
one right here.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.690
What's the area of this?

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.450
Its height is 8, this is
8, and its width is 1.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.980
So the area here is 8, and so
the area here is going to be 8

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.190
of this box right here,
that whole box.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.970
What's the width of this?

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.800
Well, it's not the whole
6, because you have

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.860
1 here and 1 here.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.090
So the width is going to be 4 by
1, so this is going to have

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.450
an area of 4.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.460
This is the same thing, width of
4 by 1, and that's 4 and 4.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.500
So all of the green stuff has
an area of-- 4 plus 4, plus

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:32.510
4-- that's 12-- plus 8, plus
8, plus 16, is equal to 28.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.390
They want to know what fraction
of the door's front

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.500
surface is covered
by the trim.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.190
So 28 is the amount of square
feet covered by the trim.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.870
And what's the total surface
area of the front?

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.550
The total area's going to be 6
times 8, which is equal to 48.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.580
So if you want to know the
fraction that's covered by the

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.890
trim, it'd be 28 over 48, which
is equal to-- let's see,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.210
you divide the top and bottom
by 4-- 7 over 12, 7/12.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.420
And that's choice D.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.410
Next question, 113.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:15.070
If a is equal to minus
0.3, which of the

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.510
following is true?

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.260
OK, so they have a bunch of
statements that relate a-- I'm

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:30.040
just trying to see the pattern
in the-- So in all of these

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.530
choices, they're relating a to
a squared, to a to the third,

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.620
and then they're putting
it in order.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.750
They're saying which of these
is the least, then next, and

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.910
then the greatest. So let's
just figure it out.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.420
a is minus 0.3.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.270
What's a squared?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.330
So it's going to be positive.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.350
Negative times a negative
is a positive.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.590
And then 3 times 3, and we're
going to have two digits

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.460
behind the decimal, right?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.370
Because 0.3 times 0.3.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.410
So it's going to be
positive 0.09.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.940
And then what's a
to the third?

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.350
Well, 0.09 times 0.3.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.085
9 times 3 is 27.

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:09.780
And we're going to have 1, 2,
3 numbers behind the decimal

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.210
spot, so it'd be 0.027.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.830
And we have a negative
times a positive, so

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.230
it's going to be negative.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.880
So let's put these in order.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.690
Which of these is the
smallest number?

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.800
So think about it.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.410
The smallest number is going to
be the one that's actually

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.020
the most negative.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.560
So this right here is
the most negative.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.310
Minus 0.3 is the
most negative.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.860
We could even draw a
number line here.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.240
You could have minus
0.3, which is a.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.120
Then you have minus 0.027,
which is a to the third.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.700
And then you have
0 some place.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.450
And then you have 0.09,
which is a squared.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.130
So the correct answer should
be a is less than a to the

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.420
third, which is less
than a squared.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.130
And that is choice B.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.040
Problem 114.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.930
Let me switch colors.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.240
Which of the following is the
product of two integers

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.500
whose sum is 11.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.040
So they're telling us that
x plus y is equal to 11.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.440
And which one is the product?

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.580
So xy is equal to what?

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.000
So let's think about it.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.250
Which of the following is a
product of two integers

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.619
whose sum is 11?

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:39.440
So this is interesting.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.200
Maybe we just have to do some
experimentation right now.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.230
We could we could be dealing
with negative numbers here.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:54.190
So let's think about how
we can rearrange this.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.240
I'm just experimenting.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.340
Let's see, if we have y is equal
to 11 minus x, does that

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.140
give us an intuition?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.990
Then xy is equal to 11 minus
x, because y is 11 minus x.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:10.810
That equals 11x minus
x squared, where x

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.040
is really any integer.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:24.830
So if you put a 1 there, you
could you could get a 10.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.480
They don't tell us that they're
greater than 0.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.780
So let me think about this.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:36.360
So 32 is 8 and 4.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:43.770
26 is 13.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.840
Let me look at all
those choices.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.190
This one has me temporarily
stumped, hopefully

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.530
temporarily.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.270
So minus 42, what are
the different

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.240
ways I could get there?

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.280
I can get 21 and 2.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.270
I could get 7 and 6, but one
would have to be positive and

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.050
one would have to be negative.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:08.405
I can get 14 and
3, 14 times 3.

00:10:08.405 --> 00:10:13.610
And actually if I have 14
times minus 3, what

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.500
is that equal to?

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.016
It's minus 42, and then
14 plus minus 3,

00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:20.990
and that equals 11.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.110
So it's answer A.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.620
I wish I could give you an
analytical way of doing it

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.000
instead of just experimenting
with numbers.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.080
I was just trying to figure
out what equals 42.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.380
Which of the following is a
product of two integers

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.740
whose sum is 11?

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.960
I guess a more systematic way of
doing it might have been to

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.210
just say what are the
factors of 42?

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:57.600
It'd be 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3
and 14, and then 6 and 7.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.370
And you say OK, if I-- and
since this is a negative

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.350
number, one of these has to be
positive and one has to be

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.780
negative-- so if I were to take
a positive 1 of one of

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.230
these, and a negative 1 of one
of these, and add them up, can

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.210
I get to 11?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.410
And I guess that's where your
brain should say, oh, 14 minus

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.620
3, that is equal to 11.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.280
And luckily it was choice
A, and you didn't

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.990
have to go any further.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.810
But you would have to do this
with every one from there.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.620
You might want to look
at the solutions.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.650
Maybe they have more elegant
solution to this.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.010
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
