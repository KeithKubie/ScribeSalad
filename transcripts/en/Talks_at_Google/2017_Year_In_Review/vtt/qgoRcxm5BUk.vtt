00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.210
MATT BRITTIN: --I'm cold by the
standards of Sir Alex Ferguson.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.626
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:56.626 --> 00:08:59.365
What can you tell us about that?

00:08:59.365 --> 00:09:00.439
RIO FERDINAND: Ha, ha.

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:01.480
No, you know what it was?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.610
It was when I signed
for Manchester United,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.800
my mum was in the--

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.100
[AUDIO OUT]

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.530
--after in a big--

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.490
black-- in a big room--

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.249
big hall.

00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:14.290
All the families and stuff
were there, flown over

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:14.900
with the team.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.290
[AUDIO OUT]

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.467
MATT BRITTIN: --your
upbringing as a child, as well.

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:20.800
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.700
I mean, I was always focused
on what I wanted to do.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.710
I didn't care what anyone
thought about anything.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.150
For instance, I
mean, on the estate

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.358
I grew up on, to talk about
got into ballet as a boy,

00:09:28.358 --> 00:09:28.981
it was a--

00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:29.730
you weren't done--

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.620
MATT BRITTIN: This is
Peckham, we're talking about.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.645
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:34.654
But again, even
in my household, I

00:09:34.654 --> 00:09:36.070
knew that my mum
and dad loved me,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.110
but they didn't
speak about love.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.080
They didn't really
show affection.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.846
My mum and dad-- simple
things, like never

00:09:41.846 --> 00:09:42.720
sat on the same sofa.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.130
I never saw them sit and
cuddle on the same sofa.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.420
So I never had any idea of
how to show affection and love

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.410
in that sense.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.400
My dad's showing love to
me was through traveling

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.147
to work in North London,
coming back to South London

00:09:57.147 --> 00:09:57.980
to pick me up, and--

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.040
[AUDIO OUT]

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.637
MATT BRITTIN: --the person
you were when you met Rebecca.

00:10:01.637 --> 00:10:02.470
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.750
MATT BRITTIN: So she
didn't immediately

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.610
see you as somebody
that opened up to her.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.500
Tell us little about
meeting with her,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.300
and what turned
you on to the fact

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.925
that maybe this was
somebody different.

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:14.841
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, she
didn't like football,

00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:15.806
which was a good start.

00:10:15.806 --> 00:10:16.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.890
She didn't want to talk about
anything to do with my career.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.540
Didn't really have
any idea who I was,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.920
until her friend told her.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.070
Yeah, and I think that was
a great starting point.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.850
And I think that when I
came home from football,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.386
as we were together, and
years and years went by,

00:10:31.386 --> 00:10:33.760
she didn't want to speak about
football, which was great.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.060
I think a lot of
people would go home,

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.018
and people would talk
about football and stuff.

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:40.350
I wanted to just switch off
from that, as much as I could.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.820
And it's difficult,
because a lot of people

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.450
think it's a glamorous life,
being a footballer's wife.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.840
Listen, there are great
perks to do go with it,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.360
but it's a lonely time, as well.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.630
And what she was
willing to do was

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.400
to kind of put one
stage of her life

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.930
on hold, with the view
that when I retire,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.360
we'll become a normal family
and do things together.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.940
Because when the kids had
their six weeks holidays--

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.320
summer holidays--

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.145
and they were free to
go away and do stuff,

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:09.950
they would go on alone.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.590
I was on tour in Asia, or
wherever I was with the team,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.000
getting ready for the season.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.960
Same as Easter.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.170
Same as Christmas-- I was
training Christmas Day.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.190
New Years, the same.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.375
So that was all put
on hold, with the mind

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:23.750
that there was going to be
time when I retire to do that.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.400
But we were never
afforded that time.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.360
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah,
because you got together

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.717
with Rebecca in 2000, I think.

00:11:27.717 --> 00:11:28.550
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.470
MATT BRITTIN: And
you then started

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.420
to think about your
retirement quite

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.450
early, as you might expect, with
somebody with so much focus--

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.691
other business interests,
restaurant, media career,

00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:38.190
and so on.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.689
So you're moving
towards that point.

00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:42.350
You've moved back to
London, playing at QPR.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.785
So you were really
looking for the next stage

00:11:44.785 --> 00:11:46.910
to start, where you were
going to be much more part

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.039
of the family scene, I guess.

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:51.080
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, and
that was the whole plan,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.190
for many years.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.110
And so then all of
a sudden, bang, you

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.920
get a bolt out of nowhere that--

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.430
cancer.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.490
And you don't know what to do.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.750
You're going-- we
were speaking before.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.580
You just go into a blur,
and you just don't really

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.430
know what's hit you.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.570
And I'm from a
background of sport,

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.347
where I can almost dictate
what happens, to some extent.

00:12:10.347 --> 00:12:12.180
MATT BRITTIN: Control
all the controllables.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.890
RIO FERDINAND: Control
everything, yeah.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.110
And then this was just taken
straight out of my palm.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.610
I could have no
control, whatsoever.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.020
MATT BRITTIN: So can
we talk a little bit

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.190
about this, if we may?

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.070
So this is 2013,
and she's diagnosed

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.990
with quite an aggressive
form of breast cancer.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.300
So that must have been--

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.130
and you have got, at that
point, three young children.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.050
That must have been a real blow.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.840
And you say you went
into sort of a blur.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.760
Tell us a bit about that.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.210
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah,
well, I was driving home.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.040
I remember perfectly--
I was driving home.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.372
I was about two
roundabouts away from home.

00:12:40.372 --> 00:12:41.830
And then I remember
Rebecca phoned,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.700
and her voice was croaky.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.430
And she told me she'd
been to the doctor's.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:51.960
But again, I knew she was going
to the doctor's about a lump

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.920
in her breast.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.216
But because I was so focused
and in a bubble of playing

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:57.090
football, and so focused
on being successful,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.930
it didn't even come into
my mind when she phoned me.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.440
And then when she said cancer,
your kind of world just kind

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.780
of stops, and you just--

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.330
I don't know.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.825
It's hard to explain
what happens.

00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:08.700
You just don't know--

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.260
all you're looking for is,
are you going to survive,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:10.885
or are you not?

00:13:10.885 --> 00:13:13.269
So we went to see
professors, doctors, etc.

00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:15.310
And you're asking the
questions, and you walk in,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.700
and you're in there for an hour.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.990
And if anybody asked me what
I'd come out of that meeting

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.030
and learned, or listened
to, I wouldn't have

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.850
a clue of any of the detail.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.310
Because all I wanted
to know was, is she

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.460
going to survive, or not.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.420
And if I didn't get
a yes or no in that,

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.050
everything else was irrelevant.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.950
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.806
And you applied a kind
of a winner's mentality

00:13:37.806 --> 00:13:38.430
to that period.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.610
And fortunately, she did
get through breast cancer.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.834
So it felt like you had got
through that terrible time,

00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:46.500
and you'd come out
of it the other side.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.333
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:49.500
And for a good period of time--

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.540
I think it was 18 months--

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.360
she was fine.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.290
She was in recovery.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.730
Her hair was growing back,
and seemed healthy and fine.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.450
And then all of a sudden,
bang, it comes back again.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.980
And by this time I'd been back
in London playing for QPR.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.530
And her sister called me when
I was on the way into training

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.905
and just said, listen, you'd
better come to the hospital.

00:14:09.905 --> 00:14:13.000
Rebecca's been called
into intensive care.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.730
It could be cancer again.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.441
And by the time I got
there she was in a bad way.

00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:19.440
And then from then it was
like six, seven weeks,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.730
and she passed away.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.230
MATT BRITTIN: Devastating.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.527
The cancer had metastasized
into bone cancer--

00:14:24.527 --> 00:14:25.860
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, everywhere.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.260
MATT BRITTIN: And she
didn't come out of there.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.420
Well, she came out once or
twice to visit home, I think.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:29.680
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.888
MATT BRITTIN: But that was
basically very, very quick

00:14:31.888 --> 00:14:34.384
from the diagnosis
to the end for her.

00:14:34.384 --> 00:14:35.550
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, it was.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.960
I mean, it showed the strength
of character, and of her, that

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.640
probably 48 hours--

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.040
two or three days
before she passed away--

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.020
it was my little
girl's birthday.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.145
And she made--

00:14:47.145 --> 00:14:49.270
I don't know where she
gathered the strength from--

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.690
but to come home.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.460
And she half organized a party
for all of her school friends.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.640
And she came, and was part
of that last celebration

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.386
of Tia's fourth birthday.

00:14:58.386 --> 00:15:00.760
And then it was three or four
days later she passed away.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.234
But she had terrible
nose bleeds.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.650
Even people at the party who
hadn't been told, because she

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.080
was quite secretive
about it, they must

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.400
have thought something was up.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.570
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.592
And what did you tell the
children at this point?

00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:13.800
Because they're pretty young.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.190
RIO FERDINAND: Mm.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.554
And that's the difficult part.

00:15:15.554 --> 00:15:16.470
What do you tell them?

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.180
Do you tell them what the
full extent, and panic them?

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.187
And because you don't
know how long she's

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:23.270
going to stay alive-- is
she going to stay alive--

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.890
what do you say?

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.511
And Rebecca was
adamant that, listen,

00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.010
just try and keep
everything normal.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:30.150
Keep going to work.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.800
Keep going out and
taking them to school.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.300
Bring them here
every now and again.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.830
Mummy's ill, but don't
give them the full extent

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:38.880
until we have to.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.480
And obviously that day came,
where I had to tell them.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.285
I mean, you wouldn't get
a harder day in your life

00:15:45.285 --> 00:15:47.535
than having to tell your
three kids that they're never

00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:48.743
going to see their mum again.

00:15:48.743 --> 00:15:53.630
So to have to do that,
it's not an easy thing.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.830
MATT BRITTIN: Absolutely.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.530
And then you describe in
here how you have to pick up.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.635
You've got to try
to get them to have

00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:01.760
some kind of a normal life.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.260
You had lots of
friends and family

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.343
around to try to help you.

00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:07.310
But initially it was just like
getting people out of the door

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.740
for you, and trying to get
into some kind of a routine.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.750
How was it, initially
for you, trying

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.640
to manage that sudden
enormous gap in your life?

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.220
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, you
become the person they look to.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.760
You become the leader in the
house, and the only person,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.450
and the focal point
of their life.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.290
Normally they've got two
of you to bounce off.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.470
But being that person that
has to organize everything--

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.200
luckily I've got a good network
of people around me to help.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.180
And I'm from a
background where--

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.716
in sport, especially in
football, it's like sheep.

00:16:40.716 --> 00:16:42.715
I go to an airport, I
don't even look at a sign,

00:16:42.715 --> 00:16:43.590
you just follow feet.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.589
Do you know what I mean?

00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:46.210
It's just, you
haven't got a doctor.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.090
The doctor's in the
training ground.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.180
So I've not got a
dentist anywhere,

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:51.550
the clubs sort that out.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.630
So when you get thrown into
the situation that I was in,

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.187
you've got to find this kid's
doctor, the kids' dentist.

00:16:58.187 --> 00:17:00.020
When do they go for
their checks, et cetera.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.679
This was all on
autopilot before.

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:03.220
So there's so many
different things--

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.575
and then going to school--

00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:06.680
that you've got to get your hand
on, and make sure that you've

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.660
got it all sorted out.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.760
But yeah, it can
be overwhelming.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.420
And that's when I spoke about,
in the book, where you--

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.089
I've never, ever
contemplated suicide.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.060
But I'd always look to people
that had committed suicide

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.819
and thought, selfish people,
and never understood it.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:28.310
But when I got to this point, in
the days, weeks, months after,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.930
I'd sat there a few times and
understood exactly how and why

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.334
they'd got to that point.

00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:35.750
I'd never-- I'm not saying I'd
ever contemplate it at all,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.020
but I could understand.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.400
And I said, without a
network of friends and family

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.240
that I had around me, you could
see it's easy for somebody

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.750
to slip into that state.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.360
MATT BRITTIN: And you talk in
the book about reaching out

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.690
for help, and trying to
figure out when you're ready,

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.850
and when your family
is ready for that.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.120
Can you tell us a little
bit about when you first

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.400
started realizing
that you needed

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.100
some help-- more than
friends and family

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.934
being around you to
help with the logistics?

00:18:03.934 --> 00:18:05.308
RIO FERDINAND:
Well people always

00:18:05.308 --> 00:18:06.840
said, oh, go and
see a counselor,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.460
go ans see a therapist.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.145
But again, that macho
sport environment

00:18:12.145 --> 00:18:16.460
that I was born
into, and was into

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.270
would always shut
that away and say, no,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.710
why am I going to
talk to somebody

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.430
who hasn't been through it?

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.570
It's like the only thing
I could think about.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.040
Because they sent us
someone into the hospital.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.930
When Rebecca was in
her last few days,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.580
they sent a counselor
into the room.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.100
I remember when the
lady walked out,

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.300
Rebecca said, well, you're
not going to see her again.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.010
Because she asked her, has
anyone passed away from cancer

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.640
in your family?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.577
And she said no.

00:18:35.577 --> 00:18:37.160
And the only thing
you can liken it to

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.100
is going for a driving test
with a driving instructor who

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.147
hasn't passed their test.

00:18:41.147 --> 00:18:41.980
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.350
RIO FERDINAND: And that's the
way I was thinking about it.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.070
And so once someone asked
me about the documentary.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.130
And I thought, yeah, this
could be a great journey for me

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.880
to actually learn.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.250
And quite a therapeutic journey
for me to go and see people.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:59.240
So I went to a widower's meeting
with about seven or eight guys

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.710
who had been in my position.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.780
Some six months in,
some 10 years in.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.110
And I just learned so
much from these guys

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.832
that had been in my shoes
and walked my path already.

00:19:08.832 --> 00:19:10.790
For instance, just when
is it right to take off

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.017
your wedding ring?

00:19:12.017 --> 00:19:14.350
I was the only one sitting
there with a wedding ring on.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.770
All of them were looking
at me like I was mad.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.610
But everyone--

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.810
MATT BRITTIN: You
thought they were mad.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:18.840
RIO FERDINAND: And I was
thinking, you're crazy.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840
I'm not the mad one.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.830
You obviously didn't
love your wife then,

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.270
if you took your
wedding ring off.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.260
That's how you think,
and you're judgmental.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.195
But it's only with
time and speaking

00:19:26.195 --> 00:19:27.820
to people you start
thinking, you know,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.982
actually certain
things are natural.

00:19:29.982 --> 00:19:31.190
And they are going to happen.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.360
You're going to change.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.100
Your feelings are
going to change.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.660
Even the relationship.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.160
MATT BRITTIN: A
couple of things you

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.790
said are kind of remarkable.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.760
I mean firstly, your
approach to getting help

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.170
was to make a BBC documentary.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.370
That probably
wouldn't be something

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.453
that most people would do.

00:19:44.453 --> 00:19:46.460
But why did you choose?

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.060
Having been such a
self-described closed person,

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:55.160
you basically chose to make a
documentary about your grief

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.300
and your family.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:56.800
RIO FERDINAND:
Yeah, I mean, I've

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.580
never done "Hello
Magazine," or "OK,"

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.170
and stuff like that
with my family,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.390
or come into my
house type thing.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.190
That was just so far
from what I was about.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.350
But this was
something that I knew

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.860
would help my kids,
first and foremost.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.750
They would be to visualize
something that would be easy

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.880
for them to digest,
and understand me

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.210
and the situation better, maybe.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.050
Men-- help them to speak
out, because we're not

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.449
natural at doing
stuff like that.

00:20:22.449 --> 00:20:23.990
No matter what
environment you're in,

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.531
whatever workplace you're in,
it's just not natural for a man

00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:28.460
to kind of take down
that barrier or guard

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.320
and be a little bit softer.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.140
And I realized the importance
of that, and how important

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.370
that could be.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.185
And just opening
up to more people.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.214
And what it's done is
enabled other people to--

00:20:43.214 --> 00:20:45.630
I've been in supermarkets, old
ladies who I'd have thought

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.270
would never even know who I
am coming up to me and saying,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.433
listen, give me a hug.

00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:49.590
And I'm like, oh.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.870
I didn't think I
was that appealing.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.150
But I've seen your documentary.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.510
I heard your book's coming out.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.050
And so it's enabled people--

00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.600
MATT BRITTIN: And
what's it meant

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.725
to those-- you've got some
notes, actually in here,

00:21:01.725 --> 00:21:04.160
from people who say thank
you for the documentary.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.243
It meant lots of different
things to those people,

00:21:06.243 --> 00:21:07.240
hasn't it?

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.750
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.292
Some people just
would come up to me,

00:21:10.292 --> 00:21:12.791
and I haven't spoke for five
years-- my mum passed away five

00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:13.940
years ago, and never spoke.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.750
I couldn't.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.550
But I watched your
program, and I

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.380
heard about your
book coming out,

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.890
and it's enabled me to speak--

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.687
or feel free to speak openly.

00:21:21.687 --> 00:21:23.270
And that's what the
purpose of it was.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.762
That's the most rewarding
part of doing this.

00:21:25.762 --> 00:21:28.220
MATT BRITTIN: So that forced
you into this journey of going

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.300
and trying some things.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.716
And then the second
thing you said

00:21:30.716 --> 00:21:33.170
there was that you found
talking to other people who'd

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.880
been through exactly what you've
been through the most helpful.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.180
So maybe tell us a bit
about those stories

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.540
that opened you up a bit.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.540
RIO FERDINAND: Obviously
the memory jar-- anyone

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.164
who saw the documentary,
the memory jar

00:21:43.164 --> 00:21:46.100
was such a huge thing, because
I was finding it very difficult

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.920
to understand or work out where
my children were mentally,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.420
emotionally.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.295
MATT BRITTIN: So the
memory jar was this idea

00:21:52.295 --> 00:21:53.430
of writing down memories.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.054
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, so I saw a
girl from Child Bereavement UK.

00:21:56.054 --> 00:22:00.314
I went to watch some children
having a counseling session.

00:22:00.314 --> 00:22:01.730
And one of the
things that came up

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.920
was that this young
girl called Emily

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.700
said that introducing the memory
jar-- where you write memories

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.520
of the person that's passed
away, and put it into the jar.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.795
So it could be the
person's favorite color.

00:22:12.795 --> 00:22:13.670
It could be anything.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.640
Anything as small as that,
to the perfume they wear,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.564
et cetera.

00:22:17.564 --> 00:22:19.730
And I thought, well, I'll
take that back to my kids.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.534
Because, my boys especially, I
couldn't get through to them.

00:22:23.534 --> 00:22:24.950
Didn't know how
they were feeling.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.660
And for a parent
to not understand

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.480
how your kids are feeling
is quite a bad place to be.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.070
So once I introduced
the memory jar to them,

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.270
it was like everything
just opened up.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:41.180
They became so much more
happy talking about their mum

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.720
immediately.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.370
This is her favorite
song, singing her song.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.703
And just things that just
kind of open you up and think,

00:22:45.703 --> 00:22:48.204
you know, actually
I'm getting something.

00:22:48.204 --> 00:22:49.620
I can breathe a
little bit easier.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.680
So that was a huge thing.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.870
But also when I went
to Ireland to see

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.506
Darren Clarke, who's a golfer.

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:56.630
There's a lot of parallels.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.515
He is a sportsman.

00:22:57.515 --> 00:22:59.210
His boys were a
similar age to my boys

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:01.180
when his wife passed away.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.350
And he was the first person that
actually made me sit and think,

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.200
yeah, there is a life after.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.570
And he was saying, listen, I
can see you're not smiling.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.200
You don't look happy.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.290
But one day you will be.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.570
I'm living proof.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.285
I'm as happy as I
was ever before.

00:23:13.285 --> 00:23:14.820
I never, ever
thought I could be.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.514
You're sitting there
thinking that, Rio.

00:23:16.514 --> 00:23:17.180
I've been there.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:17.910
But I am happy.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:18.410
Trust me.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.490
You will be happy one day if
you let yourself open yourself.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.230
And so at that point that
was the first time thought,

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.800
you know what, maybe I will be.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.600
And allowed myself to
be a lot more open.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.830
And I think if
somebody had asked me

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.930
before going to
Ireland, will I be open

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.610
and have a full blown
relationship with someone?

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.560
Will I introduce that
person to my children?

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.930
Will I be public
with that person?

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:43.530
No chance.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.550
I'd have stood on a stone
wall and said, no way,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.260
I ain't doing that.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.134
It will never happen.

00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:49.520
I wouldn't do that to my kids.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.570
What will people
think is a disgrace?

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.380
They will say I didn't love my
wife as much as I should have.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.460
But he gave me
almost that clearance

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.949
to say, no, it is doable.

00:23:59.949 --> 00:24:01.740
MATT BRITTIN: I think
you start the chapter

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.840
where you go and see
Darren Clarke by saying,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.600
I'm flying back from
Ireland and I've

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.000
got a big smile on my face.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.080
And it's a genuine smile
for the first time.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.455
And there's also
a sense, though,

00:24:12.455 --> 00:24:15.420
that he kind of made you
realize how important it

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.600
was for you to be happy again
for the sake of your family.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.120
I think he says here,
in the long run,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.620
your kids will only
get through this

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.820
if they see you smiling again.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.236
If you love your
kids-- and I know

00:24:25.236 --> 00:24:27.370
you do-- you need
to do it for them.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.340
Almost like that
gave you permission

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.109
to move on and
start this journey.

00:24:31.109 --> 00:24:31.900
RIO FERDINAND: Yes.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.510
MATT BRITTIN: And the sense of
the memory jar on your children

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.870
is incredibly powerful.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.949
The family started to
almost come to life

00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:38.490
again, really, for
you at that point.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.823
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, definitely.

00:24:39.823 --> 00:24:40.800
It's just so right.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.760
I mean now I'm
living proof of that.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.710
An example of that.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.376
That I actually can
see that my kids are

00:24:46.376 --> 00:24:48.280
happier when they see me happy.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.920
And it is quite an obvious
thing, when you think about it.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.800
But when you're in that bubble,
when you're in that situation,

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.910
you don't see things as clearly.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.701
You need someone to
sometimes spell it out.

00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:57.697
And that's why,
throughout the book,

00:24:57.697 --> 00:24:59.280
I always keep saying
it's so important

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.610
to talk, and to
release your emotions,

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.490
so that somebody can give
you a bit of feedback

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.606
so you can learn again.

00:25:06.606 --> 00:25:07.980
MATT BRITTIN: And
you said, also,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.188
your children were dealing
with it in different ways.

00:25:10.188 --> 00:25:12.600
Obviously they're different
ages from 11 through to--

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.072
RIO FERDINAND: Six.

00:25:13.072 --> 00:25:14.016
MATT BRITTIN: --six.

00:25:14.016 --> 00:25:17.670
And some were more open
and talking about Rebecca,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.140
and some were not.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.420
But the memory jar
brought you all together.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.253
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:25:22.253 --> 00:25:24.550
I mean, my oldest
boy, Lorenz, he was--

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.550
if you talked about his
mum, he'd just walk off.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.050
He'd get up and walk off.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.711
Or he would just sit there
and just look through you.

00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:32.210
And when you're a
parent, and you're

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:36.020
trying to talk to your
kid about how you feeling?

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.900
And because I was always
approaching it with quite--

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.730
without wanting to be, but
it's almost a depressive tone.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.220
How you feeling today?

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.080
You thought about mum?

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.370
And I didn't know, but
I realized quickly after

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.320
the memory jar-- if you can
speak to them in a happy way

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.594
and make them feel--

00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:56.260
because if you-- what about mum,
and the jokes she used to say--

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.939
they're so much more
open to talking.

00:25:57.939 --> 00:25:59.980
Obviously, it's a depressing
thing to talk about.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.780
And if you take that into the
conversation with the kids,

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.140
they just want to run a mile.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.660
So it's the memory jar.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.070
And I think them
seeing bits of--

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.460
I was lucky that BBC gave me a
few edits of the documentary,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.740
condensed into a few
minutes, that they

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.990
could get to see a few things.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.270
Seeing me cry, even.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.274
Because I tell them,
listen, it's OK to cry.

00:26:20.274 --> 00:26:21.690
But they need to
see it sometimes.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.050
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.820
RIO FERDINAND: So little things
like that have been so helpful.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.849
And that's why it's been so
important to write this book,

00:26:27.849 --> 00:26:28.890
but also the documentary.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.960
MATT BRITTIN: And the book is
published this week, I think,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.240
isn't it?

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:31.490
RIO FERDINAND: Tomorrow.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.281
MATT BRITTIN: So you've
got copies at home,

00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:36.580
and they've had a look at the
fact that dad's written a book?

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.180
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah,
they were just happy

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.160
that they're on the front cover.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.210
Just asking, why aren't
our faces are on there?

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.186
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:41.685 --> 00:26:42.810
MATT BRITTIN: They always
want something else.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.240
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah,
they want more.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.360
MATT BRITTIN: We're
going to have time

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.290
to take a few questions.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.914
So if you want to
ask questions to Rio,

00:26:47.914 --> 00:26:49.870
then please do come to the mics.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.872
And while you're doing
that, Rio, you also

00:26:52.872 --> 00:26:55.080
talk in the book a little
bit about the conversations

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.740
you did and did not
have with Rebecca

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.830
when she was very clear that
it was going to end for her.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.550
Can you us a little
bit about that, and how

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.020
you look back on that time now?

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.430
Whether there are things you
might have done differently.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:10.930
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah,
I think, again,

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.780
because I was so
emotionally closed,

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.920
and I'd never seen love
in a cuddly feely way,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.290
I could never show it.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:24.220
And the times that I
was up late at night--

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.440
especially the early times--

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.890
and feeling guilt and
regret, was about me.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.140
Did I show enough love?

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.760
Did Rebecca know enough
how much I loved her?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.240
I didn't allow her to
speak about even death--

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.090
about passing away.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.730
She used to say to me, listen,
if something does happen,

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.944
I'm not here, let's
talk about what happens.

00:27:44.944 --> 00:27:46.610
And I'd say, what are
you talking about?

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.380
And that's that sport mentality.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.884
Defeat-- you can't talk
about defeat with this.

00:27:50.884 --> 00:27:51.550
It does nothing.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.000
I've never done that in my life,
so I ain't going to start now.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.291
And you're going to waste
energy on talking negatively?

00:27:56.291 --> 00:27:57.600
I can't do it.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.310
But if I had it again-- and
I was unfortunate enough

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:04.006
to have the situation come again
with my mum, not so long ago.

00:28:04.006 --> 00:28:05.580
And I spent many
days in the hospital

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.450
talking about what she wants.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:08.460
Writing lists.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.200
Even her funeral--
writing out everything

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.110
she wanted, from the music, to
the people she wanted there.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.130
But I felt so much
better and clearer,

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.840
and don't have the moments
of thinking about what

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.430
my mom would want now.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.225
Because I learned
from the first time.

00:28:22.225 --> 00:28:23.850
MATT BRITTIN: I mean,
unfortunately you

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.950
had the opportunity to put
those lessons into practice just

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.491
as you finished the
book, as you say,

00:28:27.491 --> 00:28:29.760
with the loss of
your mother, as well.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.630
And you've also got a bunch
of other lessons you think--

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.490
very simple, but
very powerful lessons

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.710
that you've learned
through this process,

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.040
that you've tried to
share with other people.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.300
Are there other things
that you'd say, absolutely,

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.780
people should do this more?

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.440
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, I think
one thing is quite important, as

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.570
well, is when you go to see
the professor, or the doctor

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.260
for the information
of a diagnosis,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.470
or what your next steps are,
is to always take someone who

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.629
is a little bit detached from
you guys as a little bit,

00:29:01.629 --> 00:29:03.920
so you could come in and take
information-- take notes.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.230
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.813
RIO FERDINAND: Like
I said before, you

00:29:05.813 --> 00:29:07.410
go into that situation,
you walk in--

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.034
if someone was doing
a test and started

00:29:09.034 --> 00:29:11.720
asking you questions on what was
said, you wouldn't have a clue.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.011
You wouldn't-- because all
you're going in there really

00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:15.840
for is an answer
to your question.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.530
Which is, is the person
I'm sitting next to going

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.060
to survive, yes or no?

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.330
And everything else around
that becomes a blur.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.660
So if someone said to me,
what did Rebecca pass away of?

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.027
What was the diagnosis?

00:29:31.027 --> 00:29:33.360
I would have been sitting
there with a blank expression.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.520
I wouldn't have a clue.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.160
Didn't have any idea
what had happened.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.670
But that's just natural.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.850
The mind and body just goes
into kind of a mad state

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:42.787
and wants answers.

00:29:42.787 --> 00:29:44.370
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah,
You can't possibly

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.890
be detached from anything
like that, of course.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.730
And you say in the book,
the heartbreaking thing

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.824
is that losing Rebecca
has made me more loving.

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:54.990
And I think you can see
that from some of the things

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.290
you've said there.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.834
So if you could go back to that
bar in 2000 when you met her,

00:30:00.834 --> 00:30:03.000
is there any advice you'd
give to your younger self,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.250
or you would give
to your children

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.570
now, that's different you think?

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.820
RIO FERDINAND: My chat up
line would have been better.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:09.990
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.640
It seemed to work pretty well.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.260
RIO FERDINAND: It worked,
but it wasn't a good one.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.230
But yeah, being more open,
and just making the person

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.930
that you are with know
and understand how much

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.980
you do care about them.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.900
I think that's a big thing
that I'd never done before,

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.358
and I want to make sure that
I don't make that same mistake

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:29.536
again in my relationship.

00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:31.410
But also in my relationship
with my children.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.241
So they know exactly
how much their dad does

00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:35.490
love them and care about them.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.829
And discipline, obviously,
but with a soft touch.

00:30:38.829 --> 00:30:40.620
MATT BRITTIN: Discipline
with a soft touch.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.570
I can imagine there's quite,
quite clear discipline

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:43.111
in the house.

00:30:43.111 --> 00:30:44.147
Is that fair?

00:30:44.147 --> 00:30:44.980
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.140
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:45.992
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:45.992 --> 00:30:46.420
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.250
MATT BRITTIN: And you also
touch on, in the book,

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.930
your relationship
with your own father.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.360
And obviously that's changed
again recently, particularly

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.850
with the loss of your mother.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.170
How has that changed you?

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.590
Because you've seen, as
a dad yourself, but also

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.622
seeing the world through
your father's eyes.

00:31:02.622 --> 00:31:05.080
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, and that's
been a great thing as well,

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.205
especially during the book.

00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:09.370
Because I've got to kind of
work out why I am how I am.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.520
Because I've had to look
back at my dad's upbringing

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.800
a bit deeper, to find out why my
emotions are the way they are.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.090
My dad was a very hard,
tough to talk to person.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.490
Discipline was high on his list.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:28.990
And again, he didn't
show much affection

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.870
in the way that was able
to be seen immediately.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.740
So it's just been good that--

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.485
in a roundabout bad way, but
I don't have to explain that--

00:31:38.485 --> 00:31:40.900
but since the tragedies that
have gone on in our lives,

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.560
my dad has really stepped up
to the plate and become softer.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.350
Become a great dad--

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.460
the one that I knew was there,
but in a more visual way.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.130
I can see it.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.144
And the kids can see it.

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.560
And it's testament
to him, really.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.020
And I mean, even
the little things.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.911
I see my sisters,
who are like 16--

00:31:58.911 --> 00:31:59.410
twins.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.812
They sometimes answer
my dad back with--

00:32:01.812 --> 00:32:03.020
or roll their eyes at things.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.720
And I think, whoa,
you are lucky.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.546
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:05.546 --> 00:32:08.260
Because that wouldn't
happen in my time.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.530
So he's softened a
lot, in the right way.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.190
MATT BRITTIN: It strikes me, a
lot of what you talk about now,

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.695
and you write about, and comes
through in the documentary

00:32:17.695 --> 00:32:19.170
is about men.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.650
And how we are.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.680
And how we maybe should be.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.150
Have you got a bigger
conclusion on that?

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.400
You think about all of
the locker room stuff,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.180
and the training, and the
way you were as a sportsman,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.087
surrounded by men all striving
to be brilliant at something.

00:32:35.087 --> 00:32:36.670
There's something
bigger here going on

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:41.419
about men, maybe in Britain,
or maybe in the world.

00:32:41.419 --> 00:32:42.460
RIO FERDINAND: It's hard.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.001
Someone else asked
this me this year.

00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:46.420
But then it's hard to
answer it without knowing

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.290
the answer here.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:51.640
Because I always think
if I was a little less

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:58.000
intense, could come home and
detach myself from the game,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.420
and be more chilled
out about it,

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.660
be more emotionally open in
and around the training ground

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.450
or at home, would
that been a negative

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.880
on me being successful
as a football player?

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.750
And I grew up
believing it would.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.040
So I was scared to do that.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.970
I wouldn't do it.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.590
Because all I wanted
was to win trophies.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.160
Whether it would be
playing for Man United

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.410
or winning table tennis
against one of the other boys,

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.170
I had to win.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.910
So it's weird.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:26.930
Obsessive, maybe.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.562
But I think balance is the key.

00:33:29.562 --> 00:33:31.270
I think you have to
find a right balance.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.590
And I think towards the end--

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.500
when I had children I
probably had a better balance.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.440
Because at the beginning,
if I had lost a game,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.440
and friends would
come up from London,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.414
I'd just say, pfft, I'm
staying in the room.

00:33:44.414 --> 00:33:46.080
You can do what you
guys want, but I'm--

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.000
MATT BRITTIN: In the
book you actually say

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.670
that people will come up to
go out for a meal with you.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.972
You'd lose, and you'd
just lock yourself away

00:33:50.972 --> 00:33:52.055
until 4:00 in the morning.

00:33:52.055 --> 00:33:52.340
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.970
MATT BRITTIN: Is that
really what you'd do?

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:54.180
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.150
So they'd come up,
expecting a great night

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.120
out, and some lovely
food somewhere in town.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.010
And we'd lose, or
I'd played rubbish--

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:01.820
not often, but--

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.060
And then I'd go, and I'd just
walk in, and they'd just know.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.310
Rebecca would have told them
already, on the way home.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.159
They've lost, pfft, he
ain't gonna go out anywhere.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.455
And I'd just go in the
room, and just sit there,

00:34:12.455 --> 00:34:14.270
and just look at the telly.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:18.150
And she'd walk in,
and I'd just go, ah.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.239
And it's just the way it was.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.030
I couldn't help it.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.639
And it wasn't really until I
had kids that you-- you come in,

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.760
put your key in the door,
and you've got a kid there.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.260
And you have to
change a little bit.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.540
You've got to soften up
a little bit, but still.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.280
The good thing about football
is that there was a game three,

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.130
four days later.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.030
So it would only last
a couple of days--

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.870
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.400
RIO FERDINAND:
--that crazy feeling

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.230
of walking down the school path.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.743
Or you would go into the local
newsagent's to buy a paper,

00:34:42.743 --> 00:34:44.659
and you're looking at
the man behind the till,

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:46.283
thinking you'd better
not say anything.

00:34:46.283 --> 00:34:47.519
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:48.560
I know you're a City fan.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.630
Don't speak, please.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.199
And then you get the
next game, you win,

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.720
and that emotion is gone.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.470
MATT BRITTIN: And
what's been the reaction

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.670
from football fans to
this private side of you

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.870
that they've now seen?

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.203
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, it's
broken down a lot of barriers.

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.620
I mean, especially
on social media.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:11.010
You might be a Manc, I hate
you, but you're all right.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.200
I saw the documentary.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.255
I'm a Liverpool fan.

00:35:13.255 --> 00:35:14.360
Put that aside.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.410
You're not bad.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.130
So it's broken
down a lot of that.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.790
Because football's so tribal.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.810
And it's taken something
like this to maybe--

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.410
people to see a
different side of me.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.122
But I understand
that, listen, I didn't

00:35:28.122 --> 00:35:29.330
like Liverpool when I played.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.246
I didn't like Chelsea.

00:35:30.246 --> 00:35:32.126
I didn't like Man City.

00:35:32.126 --> 00:35:33.140
I could go on, really.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.490
There's a lot of
teams I didn't like.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:35.726
MATT BRITTIN: Yes, we could
list every team, but OK.

00:35:35.726 --> 00:35:36.580
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.079
MATT BRITTIN: But last chance
for questions, if anybody does

00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:39.750
want to come.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.050
What about now?

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:44.120
What what's driving you,
motivating you today?

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.700
You've got this whole
new track of being

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.430
that sort of go-to guy for
men should have more emotions,

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:53.750
and grief, and all of the stuff
that's contained in the book.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:57.740
But you're also-- you've got
a very successful TV career.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.790
And you're doing other
sporting stuff as well.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.280
So what's driving you today?

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.449
What's next for you?

00:36:04.449 --> 00:36:05.740
RIO FERDINAND: Just to be busy.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.580
I think it was a bit of a
defense mechanism at first.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.120
I said to my management company,
listen, make sure I'm busy--

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.580
I'm working hard to keep my mind
off of the negative thoughts.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.370
I've kind of got
through that stage now,

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.890
but I still want to remain
focused, and stay busy

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:22.380
in the things I like to do.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.175
And obviously the TV stuff
is great, being a pundit.

00:36:27.175 --> 00:36:29.190
Running the YouTube
channel is great as well.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.800
But I just like being busy.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.016
And I like doing fun things,
and stuff that I enjoy.

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:36.390
And I'm lucky that I'm in a
position where I can do stuff

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.510
that I want to do.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.732
I'm not forced to have to
do things I don't enjoy.

00:36:39.732 --> 00:36:40.440
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.080
And we might come back at
the end and talk about one

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.965
of those things.

00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:45.400
Henry's here with a question.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.108
AUDIENCE: Rio, many
thanks for coming in.

00:36:47.108 --> 00:36:49.420
A slight change of
direction, if I may.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.420
Obviously, you were in a
highly successful team,

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.570
and you had also a highly
successful boss in Fergie.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.250
And that perhaps
wasn't quite the case

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.010
in terms of your England career.

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:00.864
Obviously we never won any
silverware for a good while.

00:37:00.864 --> 00:37:03.030
What's your point of view
on the England team today,

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.404
and the boss, and
looking forward

00:37:04.404 --> 00:37:06.152
to next year's World Cup?

00:37:06.152 --> 00:37:08.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.268
MATT BRITTIN: Change of tone.

00:37:11.268 --> 00:37:14.250
RIO FERDINAND: All right.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.620
The England team.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.970
Listen, I was talking to
Steven Gerrard the other day.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.665
I work with him on telly.

00:37:19.665 --> 00:37:21.040
Who I didn't like
for many years.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.959
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:21.959 --> 00:37:23.500
MATT BRITTIN: He's
kind of all right.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.122
RIO FERDINAND: He's
all right now, yeah.

00:37:26.122 --> 00:37:27.580
And we were saying,
I'd love to get

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.540
a hold of this England team.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.650
If I was a manager now.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.140
You've got all the rough
tools of a decent team.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:38.110
You've got pace, youth,
hunger, aggression.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.630
They're tools you'd love to
start with and work with.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.444
But it's about the manager
putting it all together.

00:37:43.444 --> 00:37:44.860
I'm from an area
where they called

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.690
us the golden generation.

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:50.440
And on paper we probably had
the best collection of players,

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.620
on paper.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.250
But we weren't put
together right.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.010
We didn't produce the
performances, either.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.447
And we never won anything.

00:37:58.447 --> 00:38:00.280
I think it's too early
for this England team

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.330
to be considered
tournament winners.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.740
But in years to come, with
what's coming underneath--

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.110
in the younger teams, that
are winning tournaments now,

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.130
I think there is--

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.530
with the right guidance,
there is an opportunity for us

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.750
to become a bit more
successful than we've been.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.390
MATT BRITTIN: That's
quite diplomatic.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:17.700
RIO FERDINAND: Yes,
this is life, isn't it?

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.200
So--

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:18.974
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.260
MATT BRITTIN: Another question.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:21.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rio.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.680
RIO FERDINAND: Hi.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.150
AUDIENCE: Going back to dealing
with grief, and the friends

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:28.270
and family around you, my
daughter's best friend's

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.920
father died recently of
cancer, after struggling

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.372
with it for a year.

00:38:33.372 --> 00:38:36.730
And I'm finding it difficult
to relate to her friend again.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.150
To know my position as,
you know-- because she

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.540
comes for sleepovers.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.880
And how do I behave?

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.320
Do I remind her of her dad?

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.330
Does that make her unhappy?

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.510
Should I step back?

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.890
Do you have any sort of
advice for the friends,

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.630
and the parents of
friends of your kids,

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.250
that you've seen work well?

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.980
And what's actually
helped your kids?

00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.710
MATT BRITTIN: Great question.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.210
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah, that's
a good question, actually.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.070
I think it's important
that you don't--

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.647
when her name comes up,
you don't stand like this,

00:39:08.647 --> 00:39:09.980
like a rabbit in the headlights.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.771
I think you've got to
be as calm, and cool,

00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:14.110
and collected you can
around the subject.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:18.970
But like I said before, I think
talking in an upbeat jovial way

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.320
is key.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.820
And funny memories are
probably a good starting point.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.240
What I used to like to do--
what we used to do [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.698
you're doing
something, and you can

00:39:28.698 --> 00:39:30.910
remember that their parent
used to do that as well.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.987
What about when mummy or
daddy used to do this?

00:39:32.987 --> 00:39:35.320
I think it's so much easier
than rather than saying, oh,

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.349
how are you?

00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:38.140
Kids get scared of
things like that, often.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.190
They clam up, and close up.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.660
And they think, well, who
are you asking me that?

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.180
What are you asking me that for?

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:46.980
And so I just think that kids
talking about their parents,

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.730
I think, is something
that is needed.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.220
It's just picking
the right time,

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.219
and making sure you do
it in the right tone.

00:39:53.219 --> 00:39:54.510
MATT BRITTIN: Right, thank you.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.850
RIO FERDINAND: Cheers.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.698
MATT BRITTIN: Another question.

00:39:56.698 --> 00:39:57.450
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rio.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:57.900
RIO FERDINAND: Hi.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.399
AUDIENCE: I just had a question
about the world of football.

00:40:00.399 --> 00:40:03.230
Because obviously
it's been your life.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.510
But it's also-- a lot's said
about how it's a man's world,

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.970
and it's quite a
tough place where

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.600
people don't show emotions.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.240
How was the world
of football for you

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.785
during the whole experience?

00:40:13.785 --> 00:40:14.400
Did it help?

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.190
Did it not help?

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.060
And do you think
it needs to change?

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:21.810
It needs to be more
about sharing emotions?

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.910
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah
well, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.156
the manager, and
probably [INAUDIBLE],,

00:40:27.156 --> 00:40:28.905
and Bobby [INAUDIBLE],,
when I was at QPR,

00:40:28.905 --> 00:40:29.820
were the only people that knew.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.330
Bobby actually traveling
with every day,

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:32.538
so he'd hear me on the phone.

00:40:32.538 --> 00:40:35.030
So I had to tell him I
was talking about, really.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.290
Because he probably
worked it out himself.

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.050
And [INAUDIBLE],, we used to
have saunas and stuff together.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:41.080
It sounds really weird.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.746
But we used to--

00:40:41.746 --> 00:40:42.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:45.180
--in a controlled environment
at the training ground,

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.490
used to just have
saunas, and we'd talk.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:48.450
So I told him.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.340
But the managers
obviously had to know.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.389
But I used to find
the training ground,

00:40:52.389 --> 00:40:53.930
and being in the
football club, a bit

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.175
of a place of where it
was respite, really.

00:40:56.175 --> 00:40:58.760
It was a place of release,
where I wasn't being

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.334
looked at with any sympathy.

00:41:00.334 --> 00:41:01.500
I didn't want that sympathy.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.166
I didn't want people
to be thinking, oh,

00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:04.510
is he all right, type thing.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.240
Because that
becomes a strain, on

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.179
not only myself, but everyone.

00:41:08.179 --> 00:41:09.720
So I wanted to keep
that to one side.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.594
And it was a place where
I could go and relax

00:41:11.594 --> 00:41:13.471
a little bit for that
hour or two in the day.

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:15.720
And because Rebecca wanted
me to keep going every day,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.960
to make sure things seemed
normal for the children,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.010
it was a blessing
really, in that sense.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.970
But like I said before,
it's the balance.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:28.080
You want people to be able to
share emotions as human beings,

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.700
but if it's at the detriment
of you winning trophies,

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.270
then there's the balance.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.070
And said I always
wanted to win trophies,

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.830
so I don't know if I'd
have changed the way I was,

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.622
if it meant I wasn't
going to win trophies.

00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:41.913
MATT BRITTIN: And let's come
back to that balance then.

00:41:41.913 --> 00:41:44.790
We've just got, really, just one
minute left on this livestream.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.940
So defender to contender.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.440
This is a way that
you're channeling

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.606
some of your aggression now.

00:41:50.606 --> 00:41:51.930
Just tell us a bit about that.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.270
The world of boxing,
is that next for you?

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.790
RIO FERDINAND:
Yeah, weird, I know.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.612
But my management just had
a phone call to say, listen,

00:41:59.612 --> 00:42:01.320
would Rio accept this
challenge of trying

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.910
to become a professional boxer?

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.750
And when they asked me, I was
like, you know what, let's go.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.599
And everyone I spoke
to said, you're mad.

00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:09.390
What are you doing?

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.980
But I missed competing.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.200
I missed that
one-to-one challenge.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.170
I lived all my life kind of
competing, me against you.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.940
Number nine, number
10, whoever you are,

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.610
me fighting against you to win.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.260
And training the same
thing every day, for years.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.840
And I've missed
that competition.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.370
I miss it.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:27.141
And for three years
I've not had it.

00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:29.640
I've been offered to walk up
mountains, and stuff like that,

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.450
but that's not the man-to-man
one-to-one challenge

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.370
that I miss.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.910
So I'm happy to get involved.

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.020
And mentally, as well.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:37.619
Can you do it?

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:38.910
And I'm an armchair boxing fan.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.650
I'll sit there saying,
I'd knock him out.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:42.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.670
There's no way.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:44.942
That looks so easy.

00:42:44.942 --> 00:42:46.650
But now I'm going to
have the opportunity

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.170
to find out how hard it
is mentally, physically.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.810
Can you get up at 5:00 AM
every morning, go on runs,

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:52.734
and take pounding?

00:42:52.734 --> 00:42:54.900
MATT BRITTIN: It's a personal
challenge, rather than

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.274
the next great
career, you think?

00:42:56.274 --> 00:42:57.132
RIO FERDINAND: Yeah.

00:42:57.132 --> 00:42:59.340
I'm 38 years old, I'm not
going to be sticking around

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.202
for ages trying to be a boxer.

00:43:02.202 --> 00:43:03.660
But my kids are
probably the people

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.810
that are putting the
most pressure on.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.380
Because my boy said,
when I told him,

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.585
oh, that's a sick idea,
dad, wicked brilliant.

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.460
And the other one said,
yeah, but don't lose,

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.751
because it's embarrassing, dad.

00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:12.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:13.594 --> 00:43:14.760
MATT BRITTIN: Rio, I guess--

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.190
I think your kids are probably
incredibly proud of you

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.552
in so many ways.

00:43:18.552 --> 00:43:20.010
And not just in
the sporting arena.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.468
I want to say a huge thank you
for coming, and writing what

00:43:22.468 --> 00:43:24.093
is an amazing, amazing book.

00:43:24.093 --> 00:43:25.801
And thanks for sharing
your time with us.

00:43:25.801 --> 00:43:26.260
RIO FERDINAND: Thank you.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.426
MATT BRITTIN: Rio Ferdinand.

00:43:27.426 --> 00:43:29.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:32.342
RIO FERDINAND: Thank you.

00:43:32.342 --> 00:43:32.943
Cheers.

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:33.818
MATT BRITTIN: Thanks.

00:43:33.818 --> 00:43:34.310
RIO FERDINAND: You're welcome.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:35.786
MATT BRITTIN: Thank
you very much.

00:43:35.786 --> 00:43:36.770
RIO FERDINAND: Cheers.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.597
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:37.597 --> 00:43:39.722
MATT BRITTIN: Let's take
a photograph before we go.

00:43:39.722 --> 00:43:40.706
A photograph for everybody.

00:43:40.706 --> 00:43:41.198
Not me.

00:43:41.198 --> 00:43:42.198
RIO FERDINAND: With you.

00:43:42.198 --> 00:43:44.150
MATT BRITTIN: Just you.

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.303
RIO FERDINAND:
Thank you, cheers.

00:43:46.303 --> 00:43:47.594
MATT BRITTIN: Thanks very much.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:52.650
Thank you.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.800
Thanks, everyone.
