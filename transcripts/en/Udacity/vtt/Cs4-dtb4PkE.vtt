So, the real issue,
I think, is on Nexus 7,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.682
we didn't have enough width and that's--
&gt;&gt; Can you just hold this for a second?

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:05.523
Thanks.

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt; Hey guys, talking about Sunshine?

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're brainstorming all
the things we need to cover and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.140
what we need to do and
it seems there's kind of a lot,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.420
so I was thinking we would each
do one improvement per lesson.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.120
&gt;&gt; All right.
So, where do we begin?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.130
&gt;&gt; Well, you were assigned
all those arrow cases, right?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.542
So I think you should start with those.

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:22.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
a solid base is always a great idea.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.230
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.790
Solid base, then improve from there.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.570
I like it.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.790
And I'll keep you
apprised on my progress?

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.400
&gt;&gt; We are just so
excited to see what you do.
