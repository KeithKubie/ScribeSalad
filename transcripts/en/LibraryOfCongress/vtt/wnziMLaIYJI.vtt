00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:41.184
&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE LIBRARY OF

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:46.358
CONGRESS'S TOKEN NERD TO DO ALL
THESE WELCOMES WHEN IT COMES TO

00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:51.319
OUR SUPERHERO EVENTS.
GOOD EVENING, I AM THE CHIEF

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:53.768
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER AND
WELCOME TO THE LIBRARY OF

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:55.814
CONGRESS.
WE'RE HERE TO CELEBRATE A VERY

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.869
SPECIAL BIRTHDAY.
THIS MAY, WE ARE CELEBRATING THE

00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:03.932
80th ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAN OF

00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:07.011
STEEL HIMSELF, SUPERMAN.
YEAH.

00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:09.684
YOU CAN CLAP.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:16.246
IN 80 YEARS, HE HAS RESCUED LOIS
LANE COUNTLESS OF TIMES, SAVED

00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:20.351
THE UNIVERSE, BRAINIAC AND
DOOMSDAY MORE THAN I CAN

00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:22.798
REMEMBER.
HAS DIED, RETURNED AND HAS BEEN

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:24.852
BORN.
HE'S PART OF THE AMERICAN FABRIC

00:07:24.853 --> 00:07:29.153
AS MUCH AS APPLE PIE AND
BASEBALL, JUST LOOK AT THE SET.

00:07:29.154 --> 00:07:31.154
WE'VE OUTDID OURSELVES TONIGHT.

00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:35.938
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME MY
PARENTS BOUGHT ME MY FIRST BATCH

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.939
OF DC COMIC BOOKS.

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:43.249
IT INCLUDED THE BATMAN FAMILY,
AND ACTION COMICS FEATURING

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.564
SUPERMAN.
AS A KID AS MOST OF YOU KNOW YOU

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.802
WERE EITHER A DC READER OR A

00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:53.983
MARVEL READER.
SUPERMAN, BATMAN, WONDER WOMAN,

00:07:57.694 --> 00:07:59.346
AQUA MAN, GREEN LAN EARN, I
COULD GO ON AND ON BUT AS FAR AS

00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:03.686
I'M CONCERNED, MY LOYALTY WAS
WITH ANYONE SUPERMAN WAS FRIENDS

00:08:03.687 --> 00:08:05.971
WITH.
I REMEMBER WATCHING RERUNS OF

00:08:09.464 --> 00:08:11.087
OLD EPISODES OF THE ADVENTURES
OF SUPERMAN STARTING GEORGE

00:08:11.088 --> 00:08:13.327
REEVES.
I PRACTICALLY MEMBER RIDES EVERY

00:08:13.328 --> 00:08:18.205
EPISODE OF THE CARTOON ANIMATED
SERIES SUPER FRIENDS SO WHEN THE

00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:23.465
FIRST EVER SUPERHERO BLOCKBUSTER
MOVIE SUPERMAN STARRING

00:08:24.586 --> 00:08:26.628
CHRISTOPHER REEVE WAS OUT, I WAS
FLYING HIGH JUST LIKE THE MAN OF

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:28.887
STEEL HIMSELF.
SINCE THEN I THINK I'VE SEEN

00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:32.767
EVERY VERSION OF SUPERMAN ON THE
SMALL AND BIG SCREEN, FROM

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:37.229
SMALLVILLE TO SUPERGIRL, FROM

00:08:38.281 --> 00:08:40.281
CHRISTOPHER REEVE TO HENRY
CAVILL.

00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:43.602
IT'S SAFE TO SAY I GREW UP WITH
SUPERMAN AND CLEARLY DRANK THE

00:08:43.603 --> 00:08:47.491
DC COMICS COOL AID.
WORKING HERE HAS BROUGHT ME TO A

00:08:51.608 --> 00:08:54.105
NEW LEVEL OF MY SIP NERDINESS.
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HAS ONE

00:08:57.555 --> 00:08:59.617

COLLECTIONS IN THE WORLD, IN THE

00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:03.747

INAUGURAL ADDRESS.

MY DAD'S IN THE AUDIENCE, AS
WELL.

00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:55.129
ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHARACTER
WE'LL TALK ABOUT SUPERMAN, WHO

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.190
GOES BY MANY NAMES, THE MAN OF

00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:02.476
STEEL, KALEL, CLARK JOSEPH KENT.
HE GOES BY A LOT OF THINGS BUT

00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:05.780
THIS IS THE CHARACTER, THIS
CURRENT ERA WE'RE SEEING WHERE

00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:08.034
COMIC BOOK CULTURE HAS TAKEN
OVER SO MUCH OF THE

00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:11.972
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, WE FIND
IT IN LIVE ACTION TELEVISION,

00:12:11.973 --> 00:12:16.074
MOVIES, ANIMATION, YOU NAME IT.
THAT ALL GETS A START BECAUSE OF

00:12:16.075 --> 00:12:19.380
THE CREATION OF THIS CHARACTER
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

00:12:19.381 --> 00:12:24.511
VERY HONORED TO BE HERE BESIDE
PAUL LEVITZ, FORMER EDITOR --

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.574
I'M SORRY, FORMER PRESIDENT AND

00:12:29.628 --> 00:12:31.628
PUBLISHER OF DC COMICS AND DAN

00:12:33.116 --> 00:12:34.142
JURGENS, A WRITER AND ARTIST WHO
PROBABLY IS MOST KNOWN FOR BEING

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:37.488
THE MAN THAT KILLED SUPERMAN.
I REMEMBER --

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.544
[ LAUGHTER ]
FONDLY BEING 12 YEARS OLD AND

00:12:39.545 --> 00:12:41.545
READING THAT ISSUE, THAT LAST

00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:46.471
PANEL, WHERE LOIS IS HOLDING HIM

00:12:49.264 --> 00:12:50.689
AND SHE BASICALLY RELIES ON HIS
ARM.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.690
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

00:12:53.809 --> 00:12:55.809
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU GUYS
HERE.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.850
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

00:12:57.936 --> 00:12:59.575
&gt;&gt; PAUL, I WANT TO START WITH
YOU.

00:12:59.576 --> 00:13:00.801
DO YOU THINK IT SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE CONTINUED RELEVANCE OF

00:13:00.802 --> 00:13:04.473
SUPERMAN THAT A SERIES CREATED
SO LONG AGO IS NOT ONLY STILL

00:13:04.474 --> 00:13:07.788
AROUND, BUT HAS MANAGED TO REACH
IN THE COMIC BOOK INDUSTRY IN

00:13:07.789 --> 00:13:13.405
TERMS OF PUBLISHING A VERY
ICONIC 1000th ISSUE?

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:16.839
&gt;&gt; THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT WAS

00:13:17.888 --> 00:13:20.328
CULTURALLY RELEVANT IN 1938
THAT'S STILL CULTURALLY RELEVANT

00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:24.019
TODAY.
THERE A FEW THINGS WE LOOK BACK

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.124
ON AS SORT OF WONDERFUL
ARTIFACTS OF THE TIME.

00:13:29.382 --> 00:13:31.441
JUDY GARLAND WIZARD OF OZ MOVIES
IS ABOUT A MINUTE AFTER THAT,

00:13:31.442 --> 00:13:36.162
BUT HERE'S SOMETHING THAT WAS
CREATED THEN THAT IS STILL A

00:13:38.607 --> 00:13:40.607
LIVING, GROWING, CHANGING PART

00:13:42.027 --> 00:13:44.027
OF THE CULTURE.
DAN'S WRITING IT AGAIN, NEW

00:13:45.838 --> 00:13:47.838
MOVIES ARE BEING MADE, NEW

00:13:49.131 --> 00:13:51.179
TELEVISION SERIES, KRYPTON
STARTED A WEEK AGO, LOOKING AT A

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.180
DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE
CHARACTER'S LIFE.

00:13:54.857 --> 00:13:56.914
THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THING IN
A CULTURE THAT HAS THE ATTENTION

00:13:56.915 --> 00:14:02.246
SPAN OF A MAYFLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:07.112
AND WE'VE SEEN THROUGH THOSE 80

00:14:10.107 --> 00:14:12.107
YEARS THAT WHERE BEING
DISTRACTED CONSTANTLY BY THE

00:14:14.902 --> 00:14:16.902
NEW, THE EXCITING.

00:14:18.383 --> 00:14:19.627
YOU HAVE SO MANY THOUSANDS OF
OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND NEW THINGS

00:14:19.628 --> 00:14:21.628
WHETHER IT'S NEW TELEVISION

00:14:25.491 --> 00:14:27.767
SHOWS, NEW COMIC SERIES, NEW
LITTLE SELF-PUBLISHED BOOKS THAT

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.975
TURN INTO 50 SHADES OF GREY, TO
HAVE SOMETHING BE CONSISTENTLY

00:14:33.976 --> 00:14:36.223
IMPORTANT TO THE CULTURE THROUGH

00:14:40.101 --> 00:14:42.372
ALL THAT TIME IS JUST ANT
ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE PHENOMENON.

00:14:42.373 --> 00:14:47.132
&gt;&gt; DAN, WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR YOU
TO BE A PART OF THE ACTION

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:50.400
COMICS LEGACY NOW?
A LOT OF US I KNOW FROM MY YOUTH

00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:52.401
I REMEMBER YOU AND YOUR TIME ON

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.632
THE SUPERMAN TITLE, BUT YOU'RE
CURRENTLY WRITING ACTION COMICS.

00:14:58.633 --> 00:15:02.974
YOUR RUN WILL COME TO AN END
WITH THE STAND ALONE STORY IN

00:15:02.975 --> 00:15:05.237
ISSUE 1,000.
YOU'VE BEEN LEADING THE MARCH TO

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.923
THE 1000th ISSUE.
BACK WHEN YOU WERE DOING

00:15:10.598 --> 00:15:12.094
SUPERMAN IN THE 90s, THE DEATH
AND RETURN OF SUPERMAN, THAT'S

00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:15.782
AROUND THE TIME WHERE ACTION WAS
HOVERING AROUND 700 ISSUES.

00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:19.221
COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED BACK
THEN IN THE EARLY '90s THAT

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.007
YOU'D BE HERE IN 2018?
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, THERE'S NO WAY.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.059
SO MUCH OF IT IS WHEN YOU'RE
INVOLVED WITH TRYING TO PRODUCE

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.610
STORY, YOU ARE TRYING TO PRODUCE
STORY AND IT'S JUST TRYING TO

00:15:31.611 --> 00:15:37.000
FASHION A GOOD STORY TO GET IT
DONE, TO SEE IT GET TO THE POINT

00:15:37.001 --> 00:15:41.530
WHERE IT'S PRINTED AND ON THE
STAND AND AS A WRITER OFTEN YOU

00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:43.596
BUILD STORY IN TERMS OF ART, SO

00:15:49.184 --> 00:15:51.184
YOU'RE PLANNING 5, 8, 10 OR 12
ISSUES AHEAD.

00:15:52.455 --> 00:15:54.455
AT LEAST I'M NOT AND I DON'T
KNOW ANYBODY WHO IS WHO IS

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:58.470
THINKING 20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD
OR 30, AND THE COMIC BOOK

00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:01.931
NUMBERING SYSTEM IT JUST SEAMS
SO FAR OFF.

00:16:02.174 --> 00:16:04.174
IT'S LIKE NO, WE NEVER TALKED
ABOUT ACTION 1,000 NOR DID I

00:16:06.093 --> 00:16:08.093
THINK WE EVER REALLY GAVE IT ANY
THOUGHT.

00:16:09.356 --> 00:16:11.356
&gt;&gt; I'LL SAY I VERY NERDILY GAVE
IT SOME THOUGHT.

00:16:12.877 --> 00:16:14.734
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER BUYING
ACTION COMIC 700 AND TRYING TO

00:16:14.735 --> 00:16:17.809
CALCULATE AND ENDED UP BEING A
WRITER SO MATH WASN'T A STRONG

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.288
POINT.
I REMEMBER TRYING TO THINK WOW,

00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:22.559
WHAT YEAR WILL 1,000 COME OUT.
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CLOSE?

00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:25.584
DID YOU HAVE IT?

00:16:27.912 --> 00:16:32.620
&gt;&gt; I WAS OFF BY A LITTLE BIT.
&gt;&gt; AS TOO FORMER PUBLISHER AND

00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:34.621
PRESIDENT OF DC COMICS WHAT DO

00:16:37.568 --> 00:16:39.608
YOU SAY TO THE NOTION THAT
SUPERMAN IS TOO HARD OF A STORY?

00:16:39.609 --> 00:16:43.722
IS THE KEY TO A GOOD STORY A
VILLAIN AS POWERFUL AS DOOMSDAY

00:16:43.723 --> 00:16:46.977
OR DARK SIDE?
OR IS PART OF WHAT MAKES PEOPLE

00:16:46.978 --> 00:16:50.476
COME BACK IS THE FACT HE HAS A
HUMAN SIDE, HAVING GROWN UP IN

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:55.034
KANSAS, BEING DOWN TO EARTH
DESPITE BEING SO POWERFUL?

00:16:59.558 --> 00:17:01.558
&gt;&gt; TO TO ME THE STRONGEST PART
OF SUPERMAN HAS BEEN THE

00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:04.051
EMOTIONAL PART AND HIS
REPRESENTATION AS AN ICONIC

00:17:08.884 --> 00:17:11.141
MORAL FIGURE THAT THIS IS
SOMEONE WHO HAS THESE INCREDIBLE

00:17:11.142 --> 00:17:13.142
GIFTS AND IS USING THEM FOR THE
RIGHT CAUSES.

00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:18.061
SOME YEARS AGO WE HAD A GROUP OF
ARAB EDITORIAL CARTOONISTS COME

00:17:18.062 --> 00:17:21.926
TO VISIT DC, MOSTLY THEY WANT TO
SEE THE M.A.D. MAGAZINE GUYS AND

00:17:21.927 --> 00:17:23.927
SAY, THEY DON'T PUT YOU IN JAIL

00:17:26.832 --> 00:17:29.708
FOR DOING THIS?
BUT THEY MADE THE POINT, THEY

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:32.379
SAID, ISN'T THE SUPERHERO IDEA A

00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:37.861
REFLECTION OF THE AMERICAN

00:17:39.795 --> 00:17:41.795
BELIEF THAT MIGHT MAKES RIGHT?
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:43.722
MOMENT OR TWO AND I SAID I CAN
SEE WHERE YOU SEE THAT IN THE

00:17:43.723 --> 00:17:46.376
SUPER HEAR ROWS BUT I DON'T
THINK THAT'S THE CASE.

00:17:48.055 --> 00:17:50.498
I THINK WHAT THE SUPERHEROS AND
CERTAINLY IN PARTICULAR SUPERMAN

00:17:54.377 --> 00:17:56.259
SAYS TO US IS THAT WE'RE ALL
BORN WITH CERTAIN GIFTS AND IT'S

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.356
WHAT WE DO WITH THEM, HOW WE
CHOOSE TO USE THEM THAT

00:18:01.821 --> 00:18:03.255
DETERMINES HOW THE WORLD GROWS,
HOW THE WORLD CHANGES, AND WHO

00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:05.256
WE ARE.
I THINK THOSE ARE THE GREAT

00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:07.734
STORIES.

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:11.876
YOU SEE SUPERMAN USING HIS POWER
IN A WAY THAT CHANGES AN

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:15.158
INDIVIDUAL PERSON'S LIFE.

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:18.460
&gt;&gt; DAN, I SAVED A VERY SERIOUS
QUESTION FOR YOU, THE TRUNKS.

00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:22.940
&gt;&gt; I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:18:24.565 --> 00:18:25.719
&gt;&gt; AS SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT ONLY
WRITTEN BUT ILLUSTRATED SUPERMAN

00:18:30.628 --> 00:18:32.628
AS WELL, NOW, I REMEMBER NEW 52,
THE TRUNKS GO AWAY.

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:37.167
IT WAS KIND OF ALIGNED WITH

00:18:38.658 --> 00:18:40.658
HENRY CATTLE'S DEBUT AS THE MAN
OF SPIT.

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:42.541
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU MAY
HAVE YOUNG KIDS DISCOVERING THIS

00:18:42.542 --> 00:18:45.194
CHARACTER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND
IF THEY WANT TO JUMP TO THE

00:18:46.832 --> 00:18:48.832
COMICS YOU WANT IT TO LOOK AS

00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:52.411
SIMILAR AS POSSIBLE BUT IT WAS A
CONTROVERSIAL DECISION.

00:18:52.691 --> 00:18:54.552
ONE OF THE BIG GUEST THINGS
CELEBRATED WITH ACTION 1,000,

00:18:54.553 --> 00:18:58.221
BOTH THIS 80th ANNIVERSARY
EDITION AND YOUR PERIODICAL

00:18:59.656 --> 00:19:01.276
EDITION IS THE FACT THE TRUNKS
ARE BACK.

00:19:01.277 --> 00:19:03.277
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS DRAWN
SUPERMAN, AND YOU'VE BEEN

00:19:04.158 --> 00:19:06.609
DRAWING HIM TRUNKLESS IN ACTION
LEADING UP TO THIS POINT.

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:09.833
&gt;&gt; CAREFUL HOW YOU PHRASE THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:19:12.435 --> 00:19:15.085
I MEAN, COME ON.
&gt;&gt; DID YOU EVER HAVE MUSCLE

00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.311
MEMORY MOMENTS WHEN YOU WERE
DRAWING HIM FULLY CLOTHED

00:19:18.773 --> 00:19:20.773
WITHOUT THE TRUNKS?
&gt;&gt; ALL THE TIME.

00:19:20.823 --> 00:19:22.823
IF YOU WERE TO SEE THE
UNDERDRAWING THAT WAS THERE,

00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:25.465
BECAUSE THE WAY I WORK IS FIRST
I SKETCH THINGS OUT.

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:29.832
THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE.
THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE, AND IT'S

00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:31.833
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE MATE SAY

00:19:35.784 --> 00:19:37.842
IT'S BECAUSE I DREW SO MUCH OF
SUPERMAN WHEN HE HAS THEM.

00:19:39.869 --> 00:19:41.929
OTHERS SAY IT FITS WELL, THE
APPEARANCE OF THE CHARACTER.

00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:44.979
I'VE ALWAYS SAID A COUPLE OF
THINGS.

00:19:45.021 --> 00:19:47.082
ONE, WE ALWAYS SAW THE TRUNKS AS
PART OF THE UNIFORM AS THOUGH IT

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:50.775
WAS ALL ONE PIECE AND NOT
NECESSARILY SOMETHING HE PUT ON

00:19:50.776 --> 00:19:54.653
THE OUTSIDE BUT THE OTHER PART
IS I THINK IT'S THE YELLOW BELT

00:19:54.654 --> 00:19:58.944
AND EVEN WHEN THEY WENT WITHOUT
THE TRUNKS WE PLAYED AROUND WITH

00:19:58.945 --> 00:20:03.716
A YELLOW S SHIELD FOR A BELT
BUCKLE OR A WAY TO GET A LITTLE

00:20:03.717 --> 00:20:06.986
YELLOW IN THE MID RANGE BECAUSE
THAT HELPED HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:20:08.413 --> 00:20:10.413
BRILLIANT TRIANGULAR SHE SAID

00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:13.334
WITH THE S IN IT AND ULTIMATELY
I THINK THAT'S WHY THE TRUNKS

00:20:13.335 --> 00:20:17.072
ARE NEEDED IS MORE BECAUSE OF
THE YELLOW BELT BECAUSE THAT

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.520
PULLS THE WHOLE UNIFORM TOGETHER
FOR ME.

00:20:20.557 --> 00:20:22.557
&gt;&gt; PAUL, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHT
ON THE TRUNKS?

00:20:22.823 --> 00:20:24.823
WOULD YOU HAVE GONE WITH THAT
DECISION?

00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:27.875
&gt;&gt; I'M A PRO-TRUNKS GUY IN ALL
OF THIS.

00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:32.845
[ LAUGHTER ]
PLEASE DULY NOTE TRUNKS DID NOT

00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:36.949
DISAPPEAR UNTIL AFTER I WAS AWAY
FROM THE EXECUTIVE DESK AND IF

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.209
WE GO OFF THE MIC LATER I CAN
TELL YOU WHO GOT THE TRUNKS OFF,

00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:45.292
AND IT'S NOT WHO YOU THINK.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:20:47.178 --> 00:20:49.178
&gt;&gt; AND THE TRUNKS ARE BACK.
IT IS HASHTAG THE TRUNKS ARE

00:20:49.637 --> 00:20:51.277
BACK, RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO, IT'S TRENDING

00:20:51.278 --> 00:20:54.946
FOR SURE.
PAUL, IN THIS EDITION THAT

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.275
YOU'VE EDITED THE 80th
ANNIVERSARY EDITION YOU WORKED

00:21:02.733 --> 00:21:04.804
WITH MAR IF WOLFMAN ON THIS
ININDIVIDUALIBLE STORY OF

00:21:06.852 --> 00:21:08.852
UNPUBLISHED STORY, THE CREATORS
OF SUPERMAN.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.763
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS
LIKE, FIRST FINDING OUT ABOUT

00:21:10.764 --> 00:21:15.854
THAT AND THEN WORKING WITH IT?
&gt;&gt; WELL, THE GUYS AT DC ASKED ME

00:21:15.855 --> 00:21:20.423
TO PUT TOGETHER THIS CELEBRATORY
HARD COVER, AND GAVE ME SOME

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.906
TOOLS TO WORK WITH THAT THEY
DON'T USUALLY OFFER EDITORS OF

00:21:24.907 --> 00:21:26.907
REPRINT TITLES SO I WAS ABLE TO

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.871
REACH OUT TO A NUMBER OF UNUSUAL
PEOPLE TO ADD THEIR COMMENTS AND

00:21:31.872 --> 00:21:34.347
THEIR THOUGHTS, WHICH WAS GREAT
FUN.

00:21:36.177 --> 00:21:38.824
THERE'S A PIECE IN HERE BY LAURA
SIEGEL LARSON, JERRY SIEGEL'S

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:42.267
DAUGHTER, TALKING ABOUT HER DAD
AND HIS MEMORIES OF CREATION OF

00:21:42.268 --> 00:21:45.563
SUPERMAN AND HIS ATTITUDES
TOWARDS IT THAT WAS A REALLY

00:21:48.017 --> 00:21:50.465
WONDERFUL THING FOR ME, BECAUSE
IT'S NO SECRET THERE WERE MANY

00:21:53.748 --> 00:21:55.748
YEARS OF LEGAL BATTLES BETWEEN

00:21:56.862 --> 00:21:58.862
SIEGEL AND SCHUSTER AND AND DC
THAT HAVE GOTTEN RESOLVED AT

00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:02.407
THIS POINT AND REALLY TO BE ABLE
TO HAVE LAURA IN HERE WAS A WAY

00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:05.077
OF CLOSURE IN SOME FASHION.

00:22:08.153 --> 00:22:10.433
JULES PHIFER, WHO'S REALLY AN
AMERICAN TREASURE, ONE OF THE

00:22:10.434 --> 00:22:15.154
FEW PEOPLE WHO'S WON A PULITZER,
AN OSCAR, AN OBIE, I THINK

00:22:17.195 --> 00:22:19.247
EVERYTHING BUT THE LOTTERY.
AND HE'S ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE HIS

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:23.739
MEMORIES OF ACTION ONE, AS A KID
WHO BOUGHT THEM, AND WENT ON TO

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.439
BE THIS GREAT CARTOONIST IN HIS
OWN RIGHT.

00:22:29.529 --> 00:22:31.819
BUT AS I WAS ASSEMBLING THE
BOOK, I REMEMBERED THAT MARV

00:22:34.065 --> 00:22:36.710
WOLFMAN, WHO'S A DEAR FRIEND OF
MANY, MANY YEARS, HAD SALVAGED

00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:40.393
A SIEGEL AND SCHUSTER STORY THAT
DC WAS GOING TO THROW OUT

00:22:42.043 --> 00:22:44.293
UNPUBLISHED WHEN HE WAS A KID.
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU CAME UP

00:22:44.294 --> 00:22:48.609
TO DC OFFICES, ORIGINAL ART
WASN'T PERCEIVED TO BE WORTH

00:22:49.022 --> 00:22:51.022
ANYTHING.
I'M SORRY, DAN.

00:22:51.064 --> 00:22:52.712
[ LAUGHTER ]
THOUGH THIS IS BEFORE ANY OF IT

00:22:52.713 --> 00:22:54.713
WAS YOURS.
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, YEAH.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.380
&gt;&gt; AND THEY WOULD, YOU KNOW,

00:22:58.465 --> 00:23:00.745
LIKE IT WAS TRICK OR TREAT.
HERE LITTLE BOY, YOU CAME UP FOR

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:03.193
A TOUR.
WOULD YOU LIKE A PAGE OF ART?

00:23:03.194 --> 00:23:06.685
THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES COULDN'T
GET THE ARTWORK BACK BECAUSE IT

00:23:06.686 --> 00:23:09.960
WAS PRESUMED THEY WOULD SOMEHOW
GO SELL IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO

00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:12.399
BE PUBLISHED.
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT WAS

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.485
SUPPOSED TO WORK BUT IF YOU WERE
A KID TOURING YOU COULD GET IT,

00:23:16.486 --> 00:23:20.025
AND MARV ON ONE OCCASION
SALVAGED THIS STORY THAT WAS

00:23:21.877 --> 00:23:24.562
ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED AND HE'D
HAD IT IN HIS HOUSE, AND I SPOKE

00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:28.842
TO HIM AND SAID:  SO THE STORY
YOU'VE HAD HIDDEN AWAY ALL THESE

00:23:28.843 --> 00:23:31.691
YEARS, WOULD YOU MIND HAVING IT
PUBLISHED?

00:23:32.916 --> 00:23:35.365
DO YOU THINK THAT WILL DECREASE
THE VALUE OF IT, OR INCREASE THE

00:23:35.366 --> 00:23:37.405
VALUE OF IT?
DO YOU WANT TO CHECK THAT WITH

00:23:37.406 --> 00:23:40.684
AN ART DEALER BEFORE WE GO
AHEAD?

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:43.961
AND HE SAID:  NO, NO, I'M HAPPY
TO HAVE IT PUBLISHED, HAPPY TO

00:23:43.962 --> 00:23:48.054
TELL THE STORY OF HOW I SAVED
SUPERMAN, IS HOW HE PHRASED IT

00:23:48.055 --> 00:23:53.214
IN HIS TEXT PIECE HERE.
IT'S NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY

00:23:53.215 --> 00:23:56.496
IN BEING, LIKE, THE GREAT
CLASSIC SUPERMAN STORY.

00:23:58.147 --> 00:23:59.598
THERE'S A REASON THEY WEREN'T
ABOUT TO PUBLISH IT THAT DAY.

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:02.690
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ARTIFACT

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.691
TO BE ABLE TO SEE SORT OF THE

00:24:08.263 --> 00:24:10.263
WORK IN PROGRESS, AND IT'S
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE END OF

00:24:11.963 --> 00:24:14.063
JERRY'S WRITING OF SUPERMAN,
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE END OF WHEN

00:24:14.064 --> 00:24:17.348
THE SCHUSTER STUDIO WAS CREATING
THE MATERIAL AND YOU REALLY SEE

00:24:17.349 --> 00:24:20.634
WHAT THE PROCESS WAS LIKE, AND
WE REPRODUCED THAT IN BLACK AND

00:24:24.718 --> 00:24:26.548
WHITE, SO IT DOESN'T HAVE THE
ADVANTAGES AND THE MASKING OF

00:24:30.437 --> 00:24:32.505
COLOR ON TOP OF IT SO IT FEELS
MORE LIKE AN ARTIFACT.

00:24:33.944 --> 00:24:36.212
&gt;&gt; DAN, YOUR RUN ON ACTION
COMICS COMES TO AN END WITH THE

00:24:36.213 --> 00:24:38.213
1000th ISSUE.

00:24:40.918 --> 00:24:42.918
THAT WILL BE OUT IN APRIL.
&gt;&gt; FOR NOW.

00:24:45.258 --> 00:24:47.710
I'VE COME BACK BEFORE.
&gt;&gt; WAS RETURNING TO SUPERMAN IN

00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:49.711
THIS NEW ERA OF COMICS WHAT YOU

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:53.852
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, HOW DID YOU
FEEL WRAPPING UP THIS CURRENT

00:24:53.853 --> 00:24:57.740
STORY LINE IN ACTION COMICS?
AND MOST OF US KNOW HERE, BRIAN

00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:00.819
MICHAEL BENNETT WILL BE TAKING
OVER WITH 1001.

00:25:02.448 --> 00:25:04.448
ARE YOU EXCITED FOR THAT?
&gt;&gt; YEAH, DEFINITELY.

00:25:05.305 --> 00:25:07.967
I'VE TALKED TO BRIAN A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT WHAT HE HAS IN STORY

00:25:07.968 --> 00:25:10.240
AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
GOOD.

00:25:12.488 --> 00:25:13.910
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT AS A 
READER.

00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:15.911
AS FOR WINDING IT UP, I THINK TO
COME BACK TO IT A COUPLE OF

00:25:16.774 --> 00:25:18.593
YEARS AGO AND BE ABLE TO WRITE
IT AS A BOOK THAT WAS COMING OUT

00:25:18.594 --> 00:25:22.286
TWICE A MONTH WAS A LOT OF FUN,
BECAUSE AT THAT POINT YOU CAN

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:25.766
PLAY AROUND WITH STORYTELLING
TECHNIQUE A LITTLE BIT.

00:25:28.044 --> 00:25:30.044
NORMALLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS
PUT AN ISSUE OUT THERE AND

00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:32.927
ANTICIPATE SOMEONE REMEMBERING
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 30

00:25:32.928 --> 00:25:34.986
DAYS LATER.
AND WHEN YOU HAD A BOOK THAT

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.060
CAME OUT TWICE A MONTH, YOU
COULD PLAY AROUND WITH SOME

00:25:39.917 --> 00:25:41.917
IDEAS A LITTLE MORE AND YOU
COULD DIG A LITTLE DEEPER IN

00:25:42.783 --> 00:25:44.213
SOME THINGS, JUST KNOWING THAT
THE READERS WOULD HAVE A MORE

00:25:44.214 --> 00:25:46.214
FRESH MEMORY OF WHAT YOU JUST
DID.

00:25:47.708 --> 00:25:50.355
SO IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO DO
IT THAT WAY.

00:25:52.006 --> 00:25:54.006
&gt;&gt; TALKING ABOUT SUPERMAN THIS
WHOLE TIME.

00:25:54.454 --> 00:25:56.297
LET'S TALK ABOUT CLARK KENT FOR
A SECOND.

00:25:56.298 --> 00:25:57.998
THERE'S THIS NOTION THAT POPS UP
EVERY NOW AND THEN THAT CLARK

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:02.520
KENT IS JUST WHO SUPERMAN
PRETENDS TO BE WHEN HE WANTS TO

00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:04.777
NOT BE BOTHERED.
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE OPINION

00:26:08.675 --> 00:26:10.526
OF YOUR HARD CORE FAN, WE ALL
KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:13.206
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; IN THE COMICS, HE'S CLARK

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.933
FROM THE MOMENT HE LANDS IN
KANSAS IN THE SHIP.

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:19.591
WHEN CRAFTING STORIES FOR
SUPERMAN, THIS IS A QUESTION FOR

00:26:19.592 --> 00:26:23.257
BOTH OF YOU, IS IT IMPORTANT TO
REMEMBER THE MAN HE WAS, CLARK

00:26:23.258 --> 00:26:27.219
KENT, WHO WAS AROUND LONG BEFORE
ANYONE EVER STARTED CALLING HIM

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.220
SUPERMAN?
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.

00:26:30.282 --> 00:26:32.326
I MEAN, I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN THAT
AS THE CORE OF WHO SUPERMAN

00:26:35.632 --> 00:26:38.551
REALLY IS, THAT -- THIS GETS
INTO THE WHOLE IDEA OF PEOPLE

00:26:38.552 --> 00:26:40.622
SOMETIMES ASK:  WAS HE SUPERMAN
FIRST?

00:26:42.266 --> 00:26:43.484
OR WAS HE CLARK KENT FIRST?
I'M NOT SURE YOU DIFFERENTIATE

00:26:43.485 --> 00:26:48.192
BETWEEN THE TWO.
HE IS CLARK KENT, AND IN A LOT

00:26:48.193 --> 00:26:50.193
OF WAYS, WHAT HE DOES AS CLARK

00:26:53.334 --> 00:26:54.962
KENT, OR IT'S THE SAME FOR LOIS
LANE, IS THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE

00:26:54.963 --> 00:26:58.466
THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE IN WHAT
THEY DO THROUGH THEIR JOBS,

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:00.931
THROUGH THEIR CAREERS.
AND I THINK THERE'S A REASON HE

00:27:00.932 --> 00:27:02.932
CHOSE THAT FOR A CAREER.

00:27:05.439 --> 00:27:07.079
AND BY THE SAME WAY OF THINKING,
I THINK THEN BEING SUPERMAN IS

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.756
SORT OF AN EXTENSION OF THAT
INTENT.

00:27:13.418 --> 00:27:15.418
SO IT'S NO DIFFERENT IN SOME
WAYS THAN IF YOUR NEXT-DOOR

00:27:17.564 --> 00:27:19.564
NEIGHBOR WAS A POLICE OFFICER OR
FIREFIGHTER.

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:21.799
THEY'RE NOT TWO DIFFERENT
PEOPLE.

00:27:22.481 --> 00:27:23.705
IT IS, THIS IS WHAT I DO WHEN
I'M AT HOME, AND THIS IS WHAT I

00:27:23.706 --> 00:27:26.352
DO WHEN I GO DO THIS OTHER
THING.

00:27:27.784 --> 00:27:29.611
THAT'S HOW I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IT.
&gt;&gt; AND I THINK THE OTHER PIECE

00:27:29.612 --> 00:27:32.689
WHERE CLARK IS IMPORTANT IS IN
SOME WAYS CLARK IS

00:27:35.155 --> 00:27:37.417
REPRESENTATIVE OF US.
WE HAVE THE INSECURITIES OF

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.680
BEING CLARK, AND WE WISH THAT

00:27:43.998 --> 00:27:45.998
OUR LOVED ONES WOULD USE THEIR
VISION TO SEE THROUGH THOSE

00:27:46.657 --> 00:27:48.292
INSECURITIES TO OUR GOOD
QUALITIES.

00:27:48.293 --> 00:27:50.293
I THINK THAT'S REALLY A

00:27:51.966 --> 00:27:53.966
FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE SUPERMAN
MYTH.

00:27:58.171 --> 00:27:59.342
JERRY VERY MUCH PUT HIMSELF INTO
THE CHARACTER THAT WAY AND HE

00:27:59.343 --> 00:28:02.216
CAPTURED SOMETHING IN ALL OF US.
WE ALL HAVE THOSE KIND OF

00:28:03.021 --> 00:28:04.234
INSECURE MOMENTS.
&gt;&gt; WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT THAT,

00:28:07.337 --> 00:28:09.005
I THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE RIGHT
HERE OF MAN OF STEEL FANTASTIC

00:28:12.266 --> 00:28:14.266
MINI SERIES WRITTEN AND DRAWN BY
JOHN BERN.

00:28:14.558 --> 00:28:15.786
I REMEMBER THERE WAS A SCENE IN
THERE WHERE ONE OF HIS PARENTS,

00:28:15.787 --> 00:28:20.318
I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS MA OR
PA, BUT THEY SAID TO SUPERMAN,

00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:23.203
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
WEARING A MASK, PEOPLE AREN'T

00:28:23.204 --> 00:28:25.239
GOING TO THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO HIDE.

00:28:26.262 --> 00:28:27.912
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FACT
THAT, YES, EVEN WHEN YOU PUT THE

00:28:27.913 --> 00:28:29.913
GLASSES ON, YOU STILL LOOK

00:28:32.827 --> 00:28:34.052
EXACTLY THE SAME, BECAUSE NO ONE
IS GOING TO BE THINKING SUPERMAN

00:28:34.053 --> 00:28:37.730
IS TRYING TO HIDE BECAUSE HIS
FACE IS NOT COVERED.

00:28:42.419 --> 00:28:45.382
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT
SUPERMAN HAS A SON NOW WITH LOIS

00:28:45.383 --> 00:28:47.447
LANE, JONATHAN KENT, WHO IS

00:28:50.544 --> 00:28:51.980
CURRENTLY SUPER-BOY.
CHARACTERS LIKE SUPERMAN FOR A

00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:55.062
LONG TIME CHILDREN WERE NEVER
REALLY IN THE EQUATION WHEN IT

00:28:55.063 --> 00:28:58.154
COMES TO CONTINUITY.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:29:00.595 --> 00:29:02.595
SUPERMAN BEING A FATHER, YES, I

00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:06.125
DO KNOW BATMAN HAS A KID NOW.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:29:07.013 --> 00:29:09.013
SUPERMAN BEING A FATHER AS
SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN PART OF

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.975
TELLING JONATHAN'S STORY?
AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS FROM AN

00:29:12.976 --> 00:29:16.692
ERA WHERE THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE
BEEN TRIED, WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:29:20.379 --> 00:29:22.379
ABOUT THAT?
&gt;&gt; AS THE YEARS GO ON, THE

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:27.388
CONTINUITIES GET MORE COMPLEX
AND THERE'S MORE ROOM TO DO

00:29:28.823 --> 00:29:30.823
DIFFERENT KINDS OF STORIES.

00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:34.387
THE SUPERMAN OF MY TIME HADN'T
GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF HAVING

00:29:34.388 --> 00:29:36.648
KIDS.
THERE WERE LOTS OF IMAGINARY

00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:41.725
STORIES THAT I READ WHEN I WAS A
CHILD THAT IMAGINED WHAT IT

00:29:42.378 --> 00:29:44.378
WOULD BE LIKE WHEN SUPERMAN

00:29:45.835 --> 00:29:48.355
MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN.
IT WAS REALLY FUN WHEN I WAS 7,

00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:51.479
8, 9 YEARS OLD, SO I CAN
CERTAINLY IMAGINE THAT THE

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.777
STORIES TODAY ARE FUN FOR PEOPLE
TO READ.

00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:02.925
IT'S NOT MY MOMENT.
WE GET FROZEN IN THE CHARACTERS,

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.107
AS WE LOVE THEM BEST, AND WHEN I
WANT THE CHARACTER AS I LOVED

00:30:09.108 --> 00:30:12.223
HIM BEST, I GO BACK TO THE STUFF
I WAS READING WHEN I WAS 10 OR

00:30:12.224 --> 00:30:14.689
12.
DOESN'T MAKE IT BETTER THAN

00:30:15.493 --> 00:30:17.545
WHAT'S BEING DONE NOW.
JUST IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT CANDY

00:30:17.546 --> 00:30:19.546
STORE I WAS IN WHEN I FOUND THAT

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.402
ISSUE, OR WHERE I WAS AT CAMP
AND REACTING TO IT.

00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:31.495
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE POWER
OF THE COMIC BOOK FORM.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.950
SO I'M GOING TO STICK TO SORT OF
MY MEMORIES AS THE HEART AND

00:30:38.007 --> 00:30:40.007
SOUL OF IT, AND NOT PASS

00:30:41.462 --> 00:30:43.288
JUDGMENT FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL ON
WHAT'S BEING DONE FOR A LATER

00:30:43.289 --> 00:30:45.289
GENERATION.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.250
&gt;&gt; YEARS AGO, WHEN CLARK AND
LOIS FINALLY GOT ENGAGED, AND

00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:55.157
THEN GOT MARRIED, WE TALKED A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT:  WOULD WE EVER

00:30:55.158 --> 00:30:57.158
DO STORIES WHERE THEY BECOME
PARENTS?

00:30:58.883 --> 00:31:00.907
AND WE SAID:  WELL, IT TOOK THEM
50 YEARS TO GET MARRIED, SO 50

00:31:00.908 --> 00:31:03.352
YEARS FROM NOW, WE'LL GET TO IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:08.296
I THINK WITH THIS ONE, THE IDEA
WAS THAT IT ALLOWS US TO TELL A

00:31:08.297 --> 00:31:10.297
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT KIND

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:14.838
OF A STORY WITH SUPERMAN, THAT

00:31:16.303 --> 00:31:19.205
IF SUPERMAN IS OUT THERE SERVING
IN TERMS OF A BEACON OF HOPE AND

00:31:23.145 --> 00:31:25.625
INSPIRATION, AND SUDDENLY TRYING
TO GUIDE THOSE AROUND HIM, WOULD

00:31:25.626 --> 00:31:29.086
IT BE FUN TO DO STORIES WHERE WE
SEE HIM TRYING TO DO THAT AS A

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:31.552
PARENT?
IS THERE SOME KIND OF DUALITY

00:31:31.553 --> 00:31:33.553
THERE?
BECAUSE IDEALLY AS A PARENT,

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.030
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE EXACT
SAME THING, RIGHT?

00:31:37.698 --> 00:31:39.548
YOU'RE TRYING TO SET AN EXAMPLE,
SET A STANDARD, AND HOPE THAT

00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:42.435
PEOPLE FOLLOW YOU.
SO I KNOW WHEN WE FIRST TALKED

00:31:42.436 --> 00:31:45.324
ABOUT IT, I SAID, IN A WAY THIS
CAN KIND OF REPRESENT SOME OF

00:31:45.325 --> 00:31:47.325
THAT.
IT CAN KIND OF REPRESENT

00:31:48.999 --> 00:31:50.232
SOMETHING OF THE FUTURE AND I
THINK THERE ARE NEW STORIES TO

00:31:50.233 --> 00:31:53.327
TELL WITH IT.
SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT AND HAD IT

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:55.328
DONE.
I HAD GREAT FUN WITH IT.

00:31:56.002 --> 00:31:58.002
I THINK IT'S WORKED WELL.
&gt;&gt; YOU ENJOY WRITING WITH

00:31:58.308 --> 00:32:00.985
JONATHAN?
&gt;&gt; I ENJOY WRITING FOR JONATHAN

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:02.986
BECAUSE I THINK TWO THINGS
HAPPEN.

00:32:04.864 --> 00:32:06.864
THERE WAS A FEEL THAT SUPERMAN
WOULD INSTANTLY FEEL OLD AND

00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:10.161
STODGY.
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS FEAR ABOUT

00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:12.220
SUPERMAN FEELING OLD AND STODGY
ANYWAY.

00:32:14.257 --> 00:32:15.676
SO I SAID LET'S EMBRACE IT AND
MAKE THE BEST OF IT, WHILE AT

00:32:15.677 --> 00:32:18.958
THE SAME TIME HAVING THAT FUN
SENSE OF YOUTH WHICH I THINK IS

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:21.647
JON.
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT VERSION OF

00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.492
SUPER BOY IN A WAY.
IT'S A SUPER BOY FOR THE NOW.

00:32:24.493 --> 00:32:27.983
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT,
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS

00:32:32.294 --> 00:32:34.780
OF ACTION 1,000, THE CELEBRATORY
COMMEMORATIVE EDITION YOU PUT

00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:36.836
TOGETHER, AND ALSO THE
PERIODICAL WHICH YOU'VE BEEN

00:32:38.067 --> 00:32:40.067
WRITING THE LAST FEW YEARS.
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.960
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO?
AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE WORKING ON

00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:48.118
THEM FOR BOTH OF YOU?
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:58.208
I THINK DAN HAD THE

00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:00.581
MORE CLASSIC
OPPORTUNITY IN THE SENSE THAT HE

00:33:00.582 --> 00:33:05.737
WAS GETTING TO DO ACTION 1,000.
WHEN THAT ISSUE COMES OUT IT HAS

00:33:05.738 --> 00:33:08.609
HIS NAME ON IT AND THAT'S
SERIOUSLY COOL.

00:33:13.724 --> 00:33:15.724
WHAT I GOT TO DO WAS TO BE A
HISTORIAN.

00:33:15.767 --> 00:33:17.186
BE SOMEONE WHO COULD USE
KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE CHARACTER

00:33:21.474 --> 00:33:23.108
HAD EVOLVED, USE KNOWLEDGE OF
WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WHO WOULD

00:33:23.109 --> 00:33:27.000
HAVE INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY
ABOUT THE CHARACTER, AND BRING

00:33:27.001 --> 00:33:29.041
THEM TOGETHER FOR THAT
CELEBRATION.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.170
I GOT TO THROW THE PARTY TO
CELEBRATE WHAT HE WAS DOING.

00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:40.642
&gt;&gt; IT WAS A GREAT PARTY.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:33:41.939 --> 00:33:43.939
WE GOT SOME PRETTY COOL PEOPLE
AT THE PARTY AND THEY LOOKED

00:33:44.603 --> 00:33:46.046
BACK AND THEY PUT THE PIECES
TOGETHER, AND WE EXAMINED THE

00:33:46.047 --> 00:33:48.047
DIFFERENT ERAS AND REPRESENTED

00:33:51.432 --> 00:33:52.663
THE DIFFERENT THINGS IN CONTEXT
AND IT'S TERRIFIC TO BE ABLE TO

00:33:52.664 --> 00:33:57.564
DO THAT KIND OF CELEBRATION.
I'M UTTERLY JEALOUS OF ACTUALLY

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.938
GETTING TO DO THE STORY ITSELF,
BUT IT'S GREAT JUST TO BE ABLE

00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:07.040
TO THROW THE PARTY.
&gt;&gt; AND, DAN, FOR YOU, WITH THE

00:34:13.636 --> 00:34:15.636
1000th ISSUE, YOURS WRAPS IT
SELF UP WITH ISSUE 999.

00:34:17.152 --> 00:34:18.790
BUT GETTING TO THAT 1000th
ISSUE WHICH HAS MANY

00:34:18.791 --> 00:34:20.207
CONTRIBUTORS.
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF?

00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:23.275
OKAY, I HAVE ONE LITTLE PIECE OF
THIS HISTORIC COMIC.

00:34:24.292 --> 00:34:26.342
SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED
BEFORE, A COMIC REACHING 1,000

00:34:26.343 --> 00:34:27.980
ISSUES.
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF YOU

00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:31.701
WANTED TO PUT IN YOUR STORY?
&gt;&gt; I THINK I WANTED TO FIND A

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.180
WAY TO SAY "THANK YOU" IN A WAY.
WAY BACK WHEN, WHEN MAY KIDS

00:34:38.866 --> 00:34:41.122
WERE REALLY LITTLE, I TAUGHT
THEM TO SAY SOMETHING WHICH

00:34:43.427 --> 00:34:45.461
BASICALLY WENT THIS WAY, WHAT IS
SUPERMAN'S GREATEST POWER?

00:34:46.932 --> 00:34:47.758
I'D GET THEM TO SAY:  HE PAYS
THE MORTGAGE.

00:34:47.759 --> 00:34:49.759
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.220
HAVING HAD AN ASSOCIATION WITH A

00:34:54.518 --> 00:34:56.174
CHARACTER LIKE SUPERMAN THAT
LONG, THAT I STARTED TO THINK

00:34:56.175 --> 00:34:59.845
ALONG THE LINES OF, YOU KNOW,
HOW DO YOU SAY "THANK YOU"?

00:35:03.089 --> 00:35:05.332
AND IN MY STORY, IT'S REALLY
WHAT METROPOLIS DOES, IS THEIR

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:08.785
WAY OF THANKING SUPERMAN.
YOU CAN'T GO OUT AND BUY HIM A

00:35:08.786 --> 00:35:12.478
NEW CAR OR GIVE HIM A CARIBBEAN
VACATION.

00:35:14.754 --> 00:35:16.611
IT'S -- I WANTED TO WRITE
SOMETHING FROM THE HEART AND

00:35:16.612 --> 00:35:18.612
EXPRESS THAT THROUGH THE
CITIZENS OF METROPOLIS AND

00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:22.276
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING FOR,

00:35:24.691 --> 00:35:27.340
BECAUSE ACTION 1000 IS AN ICONIC
ISSUE AND THE STORIES I'VE READ

00:35:27.341 --> 00:35:30.419
IN IT ARE TREMENDOUS AND IT'S
BEEN FUN TO SEE IT COME

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.286
TOGETHER.
I THINK IT REALLY IS A VERY

00:35:33.689 --> 00:35:35.131
SPECIAL BOOK.
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THE NUMBER 1,000

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.580
MEAN TO BOTH OF YOU?
WE'RE IN A REALLY DIFFERENT ERA

00:35:37.581 --> 00:35:40.251
IN THE COMIC BOOK INDUSTRY WHERE
THINGS KEEP REFRESHING AND

00:35:42.105 --> 00:35:44.105
NUMBER-ONE ISSUE, THAT'S THE BIG
THING NOW TO HAVE A NEW

00:35:45.597 --> 00:35:47.859
NUMBER-ONE ISSUE, TO START OVER.
I REMEMBER ONCE TALKING TO TODD

00:35:51.141 --> 00:35:53.616
McFARLAND, WHO, A FORMER DC
MARVEL ARTIST CREATOR OF SPAWN,

00:35:53.617 --> 00:35:56.880
HE ONCE TOLD ME HE NEVER THOUGHT
THAT HIS SPAWN COMIC WOULD BE

00:35:56.881 --> 00:36:00.615
ONE OF THE HEYEST NUMBERED
COMICS IN THE INDUSTRY, JUST

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.060
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THINGS HAVE
CHANGED.

00:36:07.816 --> 00:36:09.816
WHEN WHEN NEW 52 CAME OUT AND DC
WENT TO NEW NUMBERING.

00:36:10.884 --> 00:36:11.704
DOES THE NUMBER 1,000 BECAUSE
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN

00:36:11.705 --> 00:36:14.569
COMICS, DOES IT HAVE A SPECIAL
SIGNIFICANCE?

00:36:16.427 --> 00:36:18.049
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU GUYS?
&gt;&gt; I WAS A COMIC BOOK COLLECTOR

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.575
BEFORE I WAS A COMIC BOOK
PROFESSIONAL, AND TO BE ABLE TO

00:36:22.576 --> 00:36:26.275
HAVE A 100 ISSUE RUN OF ANYTHING
WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING IN

00:36:26.276 --> 00:36:28.276
THOSE DAYS.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.484
THERE WERE VERY FEW COMICS, A
DOZEN, TWO DOZEN, MAYBE, THAT

00:36:33.485 --> 00:36:37.808
HAD HAD RUNS WHERE YOU COULD
HAVE 100-ISSUE RUN THAT YOU

00:36:38.643 --> 00:36:40.692
COULD POSSIBLY COLLECT.
THE IDEA OF SOMETHING YOU COULD

00:36:40.693 --> 00:36:45.067
HAVE 1,000 ISSUES IN A ROW OF,
JUST IS UTTERLY UNIMAGINABLE TO

00:36:45.068 --> 00:36:50.225
THAT INNER KID IN ME.
AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY

00:36:51.857 --> 00:36:53.312
EXCITING.
&gt;&gt; I'D ALSO ADD THAT WHEN I WAS

00:36:53.313 --> 00:36:57.172
A KID, AND I'D BE AT A GENERAL
NEWS STAND -- THIS IS BEFORE

00:36:58.834 --> 00:37:00.834
COMIC SHOPS, SO IT'S JUST

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:04.157
GENERAL NEWSSTAND -- AND I COULD

00:37:05.653 --> 00:37:07.653
HOLD UP AN ISSUE OF SPIDERMAN 63

00:37:09.132 --> 00:37:11.132
AND BATMAN I DON'T KNOW 215,
SAY, I JUST FIGURED ANYTHING

00:37:11.984 --> 00:37:13.984
THAT MADE IT TO 200 ISSUES MUST
BE BETTER.

00:37:14.044 --> 00:37:16.728
I THOUGHT THE HIGHER NUMBER
MEANT MORE QUALITY, I REALLY

00:37:16.937 --> 00:37:19.616
DID.
SO 1,000 MUST BE PRETTY GOOD.

00:37:19.617 --> 00:37:23.728
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; DAN, I HATE TO KEEP BRINGING

00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:27.409
THIS BACK TO DEATH OF SUPERMAN
BUT THAT'S A HUGE REASON WHY I'M

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.254
HERE ON THIS STAGE RIGHT NOW IS
BECAUSE IT'S HOW MUCH THAT STORY

00:37:30.255 --> 00:37:34.359
LINE IMPACTED ME IN TERMS OF NOT
JUST BEING A KID WHO WENT TO 7

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.081
ELEVEN AND GRABBED THE COPPIC TO
DRAW STUFF BUT ACTUALLY WANTED

00:37:38.082 --> 00:37:43.212
TO READ A CONTINUING STORY.
IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME,

00:37:44.432 --> 00:37:46.432
THERE'S ONE COMIC BOOK MOMENT
THAT WOULD PROBABLY NEVER BE

00:37:47.337 --> 00:37:49.618
ADAPTED TO LIVE ACTION FILM, I
WOULD SAY IT WAS KILLING

00:37:50.032 --> 00:37:52.918
SUPERMAN.
BUT WE ACTUALLY GOT TO SEE IT

00:37:52.919 --> 00:37:57.809
HAPPEN, AND WHETHER YOU LIKED IT
OR NOT BATMAN VERSUS SUPERMAN,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:02.154
DAWN OF JUSTICE.
NOW, I REMEMBER, BECAUSE I LIKE

00:38:02.155 --> 00:38:04.822
TO PRIDE MYSELF ON THINKING I
CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING TO

00:38:04.823 --> 00:38:06.823
HAPPEN IN A MOVIE BECAUSE I READ
THE BOOKS.

00:38:08.095 --> 00:38:10.095
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.
BUT EVEN WHEN THEY SHOWED

00:38:11.171 --> 00:38:13.216
DOOMSDAY IN THE TRAILER, I SAID
OH, THAT'S COOL, BUT THEY'RE NOT

00:38:13.217 --> 00:38:15.254
GONNA KILL HIM, AND THEY DID IT.

00:38:18.323 --> 00:38:21.170
THINK TO YOURSELF AND
SAY:  WOW, I WASN'T EXPECTING

00:38:21.171 --> 00:38:23.443
THAT TO EVER BE ADAPTED INTO A
MOVIE?

00:38:25.669 --> 00:38:28.172
&gt;&gt; I THINK IN THE BACK OF MY
HEAD, BECAUSE RIGHT AWAY, THERE

00:38:28.173 --> 00:38:31.645
WERE -- THERE WAS BOTH A
NOVELIZATION.

00:38:34.113 --> 00:38:36.113
THEY ALSO DID AUDIO BOOKS OF IT
THAT I THOUGHT WE WOULD

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.205
EVENTUALLY GET THERE, ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE IT HAD COME UP EARLIER

00:38:39.206 --> 00:38:42.691
ANYWAY WITH THE TIM BURTON FILM.
THEN THEY DID IT AS AN ANIMATED

00:38:42.692 --> 00:38:44.692
MOVIE SO I THOUGHT YEAH, WE MATE

00:38:47.814 --> 00:38:49.265
JUST GET THERE AT SOME POINT SO
WHAT WAS -- IT WAS COOL TO SEE

00:38:49.266 --> 00:38:52.944
IT DONE BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY
HIT ME AS I WAS SITTING IN THE

00:38:52.945 --> 00:38:56.628
MOVIE WAS THIS NOTION THAT NOT
ONLY DID THEY USE DOOMSDAY OR

00:38:56.629 --> 00:39:01.784
THE STORY MATERIAL, OR THE STORY
IDEA, BUT THEY ACTUALLY TRIED TO

00:39:01.785 --> 00:39:04.869
REPLICATE SOME OF THE STUFF THAT
I HAD DRAWN ON FILM.

00:39:06.504 --> 00:39:08.504
AND THAT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE THAT I

00:39:08.775 --> 00:39:11.251
HADN'T REALLY SEEN BEFORE.
AND TO SEE THEM TRY AND

00:39:13.106 --> 00:39:15.166
REPRODUCE SOMETHING ON FILM THAT
I HAD DRAWN, ALMOST LIKE

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.850
VERBATIM A LITTLE BIT, THAT WAS
A THRILL.

00:39:20.928 --> 00:39:22.928
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOT TO BE COOL.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:39:22.982 --> 00:39:24.982
&gt;&gt; FOR THE RECORD THE ONLY THING
I WAS UPSET ABOUT IS THAT HE

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:27.887
DIDN'T COME BACK IN THE BLACK
SUIT.

00:39:27.888 --> 00:39:29.925
&gt;&gt; ME, TOO.
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE HENRY TWEETED OUT THE

00:39:29.926 --> 00:39:32.786
IMAGE OF THE BLACK SUIT.
IT'S LIKE OH, THEY'RE GOING TO

00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.862
DO BLACK --
&gt;&gt; I'M WITH YOU.

00:39:36.515 --> 00:39:38.147
I'M YOU.
&gt;&gt; SORRY.

00:39:38.148 --> 00:39:40.148
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; WAIT FOR THE REMAKE.

00:39:40.416 --> 00:39:43.286
&gt;&gt; THERE WE GO.
CAN YOU GUYS TELL US ABOUT YOUR

00:39:43.287 --> 00:39:45.780
FIRST -- CAN YOU REMEMBER YOUR
FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

00:39:47.257 --> 00:39:49.517
CHARACTER, WHEN YOU FIRST
DISCOVERED HIM?

00:39:51.758 --> 00:39:53.758
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT WAS WATCHING THE
GEORGE REEVES SHOWS ON THE

00:39:55.045 --> 00:39:57.045
LITTLE BLACK AND WHITE TV AT
HOME.

00:39:58.767 --> 00:40:01.451
THE COMIC COMES INTO MY LIFE,
LIKE MOST COMICS, IN BOXES THAT

00:40:01.452 --> 00:40:05.727
OLDER KIDS ON THE BLOCK HAD OF
THEIR COMICS, AND I'D SEE ALL

00:40:05.728 --> 00:40:07.728
THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS, BUT

00:40:09.812 --> 00:40:12.070
THE FIRST COMIC THAT WAS MINE
WAS ACTION 300, WHICH A

00:40:14.106 --> 00:40:16.106
BABYSITTER BROUGHT TO SHUT ME UP
ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS ABOUT 5

00:40:17.369 --> 00:40:19.369
YEARS OLD, AND IT HAD A
SUBSCRIPTION AD WHERE FOR A

00:40:19.627 --> 00:40:21.627
DOLLAR YOU COULD GET A
SUBSCRIPTION FOR A YEAR.

00:40:22.476 --> 00:40:24.106
AND I SOMEHOW CONNED MY PARENTS
INTO SENDING IN THE DOLLAR FOR

00:40:24.107 --> 00:40:26.371
IT.
AND I WAS A SUBSCRIBER TO ACTION

00:40:26.372 --> 00:40:29.263
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER
THAT.

00:40:31.318 --> 00:40:32.738
&gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT A DOLLAR WELL
SPENT.

00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:34.739
[ LAUGHTER ]
&gt;&gt; IT SORT OF PAID OFF

00:40:35.221 --> 00:40:37.221
ULTIMATELY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.331
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YEAH.
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME I EVER BOUGHT

00:40:39.332 --> 00:40:42.817
WAS A SUPERMAN COMIC, IT WAS
SUPERMAN 89.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.730
IT HAD SUPERMAN ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE COVER AND CRYPTOWAS

00:40:48.155 --> 00:40:50.155
BARKING AT HIM AND WEARING THE
CAPE.

00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:52.221
HE DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPE ON.
SUPERMAN IS SAYING OR THINKING,

00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:55.683
BECAUSE THEY DID THOUGHT
BALLOONS IN THOSE DAYS, SAID

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.765
EVEN MY DOG CRYPTO DOESN'T
RECOGNIZE ME WHICH IF YOU'RE A

00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:02.443
KID, ALL RIGHT, I'LL BUY THAT.
LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:41:05.542 --> 00:41:07.542
SO MY FIRST COMIC WAS A SUPERMAN
COMIC.

00:41:08.198 --> 00:41:10.651
&gt;&gt; FOR THE RECORD MY FIRST WAS
WHEN HE REVEALED HIS IDENTITY TO

00:41:10.652 --> 00:41:12.883
LOIS.
WHICH WAS IN ACTION COMICS.

00:41:13.893 --> 00:41:15.314
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS A POINT OF SOME
DISCUSSION, BECAUSE WHEN THAT

00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:18.377
STORY WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED,
AND WE HAD A GROUP OF WRITERS IN

00:41:18.378 --> 00:41:21.864
THE ROOM THAT TALKED ABOUT IT
AND SET IT UP, THAT WASN'T

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.352
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
THEY WERE GOING TO GET ENGAGED

00:41:25.353 --> 00:41:28.875
AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF
PUTTING THE STORY TOGETHER, A

00:41:28.876 --> 00:41:32.568
COUPLE OF THE GUYS CALLED ME UP
ALONG WITH OUR EDITOR AT THE

00:41:34.852 --> 00:41:36.852
TIME, MIKE CARLIN AND SAID WE
JUST REALIZED, IF SUPERMAN

00:41:38.371 --> 00:41:41.274
PROPOSES TO LOIS LANE AND SHE
SAYS YES AND HE DOESN'T ADMIT

00:41:41.275 --> 00:41:44.776
THAT CLARK KENT ADMIT HE'S
SUPERMAN HE'S LYING TO HER AND

00:41:44.777 --> 00:41:47.447
THAT WOULD BE WRONG SO WE TALKED
ABOUT IT AT THE TIME AND THAT'S

00:41:47.448 --> 00:41:53.228
HOW WE KIND OF RECONFIGURED THAT
SCENE, SO IT DID PLAY OUT THAT

00:41:53.229 --> 00:41:56.503
WAY.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME,

00:41:56.504 --> 00:42:01.015
ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE TIME FOR
Q &amp; A WITH THE AUDIENCE?

00:42:03.057 --> 00:42:07.761
OKAY.
OKAY, THERE YOU GO, SIR, AND

00:42:11.788 --> 00:42:13.788
THEN I'LL GET YOU IN THE BACK.
THE MIC IS COMING.

00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:18.260
THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
[ OFF MICROPHONE ]

00:42:20.297 --> 00:42:22.356
&gt;&gt; SO WHEN I WAS READING COMICS
AS A KID, I THOUGHT THEY WERE

00:42:22.357 --> 00:42:24.621
GEARED FOR KIDS.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GEARED FOR

00:42:24.622 --> 00:42:29.170
THE 7-YEAR-OLD.
THESE COMICS THESE DAYS DON'T

00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:31.856
SEEM TO BE GEARED FOR THAT
AUDIENCE.

00:42:35.158 --> 00:42:37.158
HOW DO YOU KEEP KIDS IN IT TO

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:40.869
GET MORE PEOPLE TURNING INTO THE

00:42:42.505 --> 00:42:47.114
INDUSTRY, AS READERS?
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GIGANTIC BUSINESS

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.230
QUESTION IN THE 1980s WHEN THE

00:42:55.565 --> 00:42:57.565
COMIC SHOP BECAME THE NEW HOME

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.289
OF THE FIELD WHEN THE NEWS STAND
WAS DRYING UP, BECAUSE PREPARE

00:43:03.592 --> 00:43:06.043
TO THE 1980s, IN AMERICA, IF
YOU WERE A KID, COMICS WERE THE

00:43:06.044 --> 00:43:09.559
FIRST THING YOU BOUGHT OTHER
THAN MAYBE CHEWING GUM.

00:43:16.165 --> 00:43:18.165
AND YOU PROGRESSED FROM READING

00:43:19.234 --> 00:43:21.873
DISNEY OR LOONY TUNES ON UP TO
GETTING THE SUPER HEROES AND

00:43:23.503 --> 00:43:24.734
THEN YOU DISCOVERED THE OPPOSITE
SEX OR SPORTS OR SOMETHING, AND

00:43:29.234 --> 00:43:31.297
YOU GAVE IT UP AND YOU MOVED ON.
THE MODEL CHANGED, AND FOR A FEW

00:43:31.298 --> 00:43:34.167
YEARS THERE WE WERE PETRIFIED
THAT WE'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE

00:43:34.168 --> 00:43:38.339
NEW KIDS, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
THE NEWSSTANDS TO RECRUIT THEM

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.801
WITH.
TURNED OUT THAT, IN FACT, YOU

00:43:40.802 --> 00:43:45.096
CAN RECRUIT PEOPLE TO START
READING COMICS AT A LATER AGE,

00:43:49.001 --> 00:43:51.001
AND STARTING IN THE LATE '80s
AND VERY HEAVILY THROUGH THE

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.173
'90s, WE BEGAN TO SEE WAVES OF
KIDS COMING INTO THE MEDIUM IN

00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:58.049
HIGH SCHOOL AND IN COLLEGE
YEARS, WITH THE MATERIAL THAT WE

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:01.970
WERE DOING FOR OLDER PEOPLE.
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, THERE'S

00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:06.107
BEEN A WONDERFUL RESURGENCE IN
COMICS FOR KIDS.

00:44:07.747 --> 00:44:10.403
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GRAPHIC
NOVEL OF THE LAST FEW YEARS IS

00:44:14.243 --> 00:44:17.179
THE WORK OF RENA TELGEMEYER,
WHICH CLEARLY REACHES PROBABLY

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.103
AT ITS HEART 8 TO 10-YEAR-OLDS
AND GOES OUT AT PRINT RUNS

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.780
LARGER THAN, SADLY, ANY ISSUE OF
SUPERMAN.

00:44:27.851 --> 00:44:29.298
AND THOSE ARE KIDS WHO ARE
COMING INTO COMICS THROUGH THAT.

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:31.299
NOT ALL OF THEM WILL BE
INTERESTED IN SUPERMAN

00:44:31.553 --> 00:44:33.553
AFTERWARDS.
BUT SOME OF THEM WILL BE.

00:44:34.601 --> 00:44:36.601
SOME OF THEM WILL MOVE THROUGH
IT.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.476
AND I'M REALLY COMFORTABLE AT
THIS POINT THAT WE'RE RECRUITING

00:44:38.477 --> 00:44:42.782
A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES
TO COME INTO THE COMICS, AND

00:44:44.235 --> 00:44:46.312
THEY'RE JUST COMING IN THROUGH
VERY DIVERSE PATHS, NOT THE SAME

00:44:46.313 --> 00:44:48.574
EXACT PATH THAT MY GENERATION
CAME IN.

00:44:49.798 --> 00:44:52.469
IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME.
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS I SEE THAT

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.915
HAS DEFINITELY INCREASED OVER

00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:02.937
THE YEARS IS, IT'S VERY OFTEN
I'LL HEAR SOMEONE YOUR AGE WILL

00:45:06.022 --> 00:45:07.644
SAY THIS IS MY FAVORITE COMIC.
SOMEONE WILL PUT DOWN A TRADE

00:45:07.645 --> 00:45:11.592
PAPERBACK AND SAY THIS WAS MY
FIRST COMIC AND ONE OF THE

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:15.243
BARRIERS I THINK WAS ALWAYS
THERE WAS THIS IDEA THEY

00:45:16.527 --> 00:45:17.956
COULDN'T NECESSARILY GET THAT 7
YEAR-OLD COULDN'T GET THE ENTIRE

00:45:17.957 --> 00:45:21.443
STORY IN AN ISSUE BECAUSE IT
MIGHT BE PART 3 OF A 6 PART

00:45:22.039 --> 00:45:23.676
STORY.
NOW WHEN THEY PUT DOWN THE TRADE

00:45:23.677 --> 00:45:26.543
PAPERBACK THEY HAVE THE WHOLE
STORY AND THAT'S WHAT I SEE MORE

00:45:26.544 --> 00:45:29.267
AND MORE.
THEY'RE GIVING ME A BOOK.

00:45:31.467 --> 00:45:33.467
&gt;&gt; DC ALSO HAS A GREAT GATEWAY

00:45:34.592 --> 00:45:36.592
AND THE TEEN TITANS GIRL CARTOON

00:45:37.656 --> 00:45:38.886
WHICH IS A PHENOMENAL WAY TO GET
KIDS INTERESTED IN CHARACTERS.

00:45:42.626 --> 00:45:44.626
NEXT QUESTION?
RIGHT HERE?

00:45:57.907 --> 00:45:59.907
&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING.
THERE WE GO.

00:46:00.882 --> 00:46:01.944
JUST WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING
THANK YOU TO YOU BOTH FOR TAKING

00:46:01.945 --> 00:46:05.871
THE TIME TO DO THIS.
I THINK IT'S A VERY COOL AND I'M

00:46:05.872 --> 00:46:08.528
SURE EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE
APPRECIATES YOU TOOK THE TIME TO

00:46:08.529 --> 00:46:11.407
DO IT.
SO THANK YOU TO YOU BOTH.

00:46:13.658 --> 00:46:15.711
THE QUESTION I HAVE IS ACTUALLY
ABOUT LEX LUTHOR AND IT TIES

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.380
BACK INTO AN EARLIER QUESTION
BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE THOUGHT

00:46:20.919 --> 00:46:23.600
PROCESS THAT SUPERMAN IS TOO
POWERFUL, THAT HE'S BORING

00:46:25.644 --> 00:46:27.929
BECAUSE THERE'S NO THREAT TO HIM
BUT, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN I MAKE

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.837
THE COMPARISON TO THE MODERN DAY
INTERPRETATION OF LEX VERSUS THE

00:46:31.838 --> 00:46:33.838
FILMS, WHEN I'M READING OF LEX

00:46:36.425 --> 00:46:38.883
IN THE MODERN DAY COMIC BOOKS,
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST THAT

00:46:41.007 --> 00:46:43.666
HUMANITY HAS TO OFFER IN THE
INTELLECT, THE PROWESS, THE WILL

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:46.519
AND THAT'S WHY SUPERMAN TAKES
HIM SO SERIOUSLY BECAUSE HE

00:46:48.173 --> 00:46:49.395
RECOGNIZES THAT AND HE KNOWS
THIS GUY IS COMMITTED TO TAKING

00:46:49.396 --> 00:46:51.883
HIM DOWN.
BUT THEN WHEN I LOOK AT THE

00:46:53.118 --> 00:46:55.159
FILM, EVEN GOING BACK TO
SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, THERE'S AN

00:46:58.217 --> 00:47:00.217
ELEMENT OF KIND OF OVER THE

00:47:01.717 --> 00:47:03.717
TOPNESS, AND HAMMINESS THAT THE
LEX LUTHOR CHARACTER IS PRO

00:47:06.644 --> 00:47:09.555
TRAYED AND IT'S HARD THEIRTIVELY
TO PORTRAY THEM TO THE AUDIENCE

00:47:09.556 --> 00:47:12.827
AND THINK THAT'S A CHARACTER
SUPERMAN WILL TAKE SERIOUSLY AS

00:47:12.828 --> 00:47:16.101
A THREAT.
UNLIKE THE JOKER WHERE HIS OVER

00:47:16.102 --> 00:47:19.177
THE TOPNESS PLAYS INTO THE
PSYCHOTIC NATURE AND MAKES IT

00:47:19.178 --> 00:47:22.248
MORE THREATENING, I THINK THAT
DOESN'T NECESSARILY PLAY WITH

00:47:22.249 --> 00:47:25.530
THE CHARACTER LEX LUTHOR IN
REGARDS TO HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:47:25.531 --> 00:47:27.988
SUPERMAN.
SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY YOU

00:47:27.989 --> 00:47:30.877
THINK THAT ELEMENT KEEPS MAKING

00:47:34.596 --> 00:47:35.818
ITS WAY INTO THE FILM, THEN NOT
NECESSARILY TAKING THE CUES FROM

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:38.901
THE MODERN DAY INTERPRETATION OF
LEX LUTHOR?

00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:42.595
&gt;&gt; I THINK IN SOME WAYS, YOU
KNOW, LEX MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHOSEN

00:47:45.676 --> 00:47:47.104
FOR THE FILM AND PORTRAYED THOSE
WAYS BECAUSE HE WAS FAMILIAR,

00:47:47.105 --> 00:47:51.830
BUT TO BACKTRACK A LITTLE BIT ON
YOUR QUESTION, WHICH IS, IS IT

00:47:51.831 --> 00:47:54.720
HARD TO WRITE FOR SUPERMAN
BECAUSE OF THE POWER LEVEL?

00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:58.181
AND ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO
LEX LUTHOR, BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:04.556
HAVE THAT LEVEL OF POWER?
I THINK YOU WRITE A GOOD STORY

00:48:04.557 --> 00:48:07.835
BY TESTING CHARACTER AND THAT'S
WHAT YOU FIND OUT WITH A

00:48:09.463 --> 00:48:11.463
SUPERMAN STORY AND I DON'T FIND
THAT HARD TO WRITE FOR.

00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:14.125
YOU TEST SUPERMAN'S CHARACTER

00:48:16.225 --> 00:48:18.225
SOMEHOW AND IF YOU TAKE SOMEONE
LIKE LEKS LUTHOR, WHO IS SO

00:48:21.394 --> 00:48:22.815
DEVIOUS AND INTELLIGENT AND
CRAFTY THERE SHOULD BE MANY WAYS

00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:24.816
FOR HIM TO TEST SUPERMAN
SOMEHOW.

00:48:26.547 --> 00:48:28.607
EVEN IF HE STANDS INSIDE LEX'S
OFFICE WHERE HE COULD USE HIS

00:48:28.608 --> 00:48:32.904
X-RAY VISION TO LOOK AT ANY DATA
OR LISTEN TO ANY CONVERSATION

00:48:32.905 --> 00:48:35.536
THAT NONE OF THAT APPEARS IN THE
OFFICE BECAUSE LEX IS TOO SMART

00:48:35.537 --> 00:48:39.089
SO THERE ARE ALWAYS GOOD WAYS TO
DO THAT KIND OF A STORY AND I

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:42.980
THINK THE FACT THAT LEX DOESN'T
HAVE SUPER-POWERS WHEN PITTED

00:48:42.981 --> 00:48:46.407
AGAINST SUPERMAN IS PART OF WHAT
MAKES THAT DYNAMIC SO

00:48:47.018 --> 00:48:48.700
INTERESTING.
&gt;&gt; I RECALL THAT ONE OF THE I

00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:51.351
THINK MAYBE THE BEST
EXPLANATIONS I EVER SAW WAS I

00:48:51.352 --> 00:48:56.875
THINK IT WAS A JUSTICE LEAGUE
COMIC, BUT A CHARACTER WITH

00:48:58.318 --> 00:49:00.318
ACTION SUPERMAN, WHY ARE YOU SO
WORRIED ABOUT HIM?

00:49:02.227 --> 00:49:04.227
HE SAYS, I CAN'T SEE WHAT HE'S
THINKING AND HE'S ALWAYS

00:49:04.281 --> 00:49:06.281
THINKING.

00:49:07.385 --> 00:49:09.385
SO I JUST, THE SERIOUSNESS OF
THAT CHARACTER NOT COMING

00:49:10.669 --> 00:49:12.669
THROUGH IN THE FILMS, I WONDER
WHY THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:16.846
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S ALSO, THE GUYS
ASKED ME TO DO A LITTLE SUPERMAN

00:49:16.847 --> 00:49:20.362
AND LEX STORY THAT'S INCLUDED IN
THE HARDCOVER, WHICH I HAD THE

00:49:20.363 --> 00:49:24.063
PLEASURE OF HAVING WORKING WITH
KNEEL ADAMS ON.

00:49:26.131 --> 00:49:28.131
IT'S AMAZING -- NEIL ADAMS ON.
IT'S AMAZING.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:32.470
AND THE STORY CENTERS AROUND THE

00:49:36.022 --> 00:49:37.459
IDEA THAT BECAUSE LEX IS SUCH A
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT IS STRONG

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:41.775
IN THE HUMAN RACE, AS WELL AS
WHAT WENT WRONG, SUPERMAN

00:49:43.207 --> 00:49:46.059
DOESN'T WANT TO DEFEAT HIM.
HE WANTS TO WIN HIM OVER ON SOME

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.943
LEVEL.
AND IT'S JUST A LITTLE STORY OF

00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:52.217
SUPERMAN GOING TO PLAY CHESS
WITH LEX LUTHOR, BECAUSE HE

00:49:53.645 --> 00:49:55.912
KEEPS HOPING THAT IF HE JUST
SITS DOWN AND SHOWS LEX THE

00:49:57.557 --> 00:49:58.991
RIGHT WAY TO THINK, THAT THERE
WILL BE SOME WAY TO GET THROUGH

00:49:58.992 --> 00:50:00.992
TO HIM, CONVINCE HIM THAT

00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:06.874
SUPERMAN IS NOT A BAD THING FOR
THE WORLD, BUT ALSO HAVE LEX BE

00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:10.393
A GOOD PART OF THE WORLD, AND
LIKE SUPERMAN, MAKE THE CHOICE

00:50:10.394 --> 00:50:13.692
TO USE HIS PERSONAL GIFTS, HIS
PERSONAL ABILITIES, FOR THE

00:50:16.353 --> 00:50:18.353
RIGHT CAUSES.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:50:18.626 --> 00:50:20.626
&gt;&gt; DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK OUT

00:50:23.066 --> 00:50:26.252
AS SUPERMAN INTENDED.
&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME.

00:50:27.263 --> 00:50:29.760
THANKS A LOT.
I REALLY CAN'T SAY HOW MUCH I'VE

00:50:29.761 --> 00:50:32.441
ENJOYED BOTH OF YOUR WORK OVER
THE YEARS.

00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:37.819
AND IN PARTICULAR, MR. LEVITZ,
THE GREAT DARKNESS SAGA.

00:50:39.247 --> 00:50:40.277
I'M GEEING OUT.
I WAS IN COLLEGE AT THE TIME.

00:50:40.278 --> 00:50:43.565
IT WAS SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO
TAKE 20 MINUTES AND GET A BREAK

00:50:43.566 --> 00:50:46.648
FROM COLLEGE TO GO INTO A WHOLE
OTHER DIFFERENT WORLD.

00:50:48.718 --> 00:50:50.369
THAT SAID, I GUESS IN A FEW DAYS
IS THE 60th ANNIVERSARY OF THE

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:55.343
LEGION OF SUPERHEROS AND I'M
JUST CURIOUS, ONE OF THE WAYS

00:50:55.344 --> 00:50:57.814
I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED SUPERMAN IS
THE INTERACTION WITH OTHER

00:50:59.652 --> 00:51:01.652
CHARACTERS AND I DON'T KNOW IF
EITHER OF YOU HAVE SOMETHING

00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:06.182
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE ABOUT THAT.
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S ALWAYS FUN.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.120
PART OF IT IS THAT WHENEVER WE
PUT CHARACTERS LIKE THAT

00:51:15.274 --> 00:51:16.304
TOGETHER, WE FIND OUT WHAT MAKES
THEM GIVEN FROM ONE ANOTHER AND

00:51:16.305 --> 00:51:18.305
IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO SEE THAT
CHARACTER MIX.

00:51:20.687 --> 00:51:22.687
AND SOME OF THEM CAN BE QUITE
SPECIAL.

00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:25.167
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE SUPERMAN-BATMAN DYNAMIC.

00:51:26.643 --> 00:51:28.088
MORE RECENTLY THE
SUPERMAN-WONDER WOMAN DYNAMIC.

00:51:28.089 --> 00:51:32.832
CERTAINLY WITH THE LEGION, WHERE
SUPERBOY WAS FLAT-OUT

00:51:34.481 --> 00:51:35.958
INSPIRATION FOR THEM TO EXIST,
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THE ULTIMATE

00:51:39.475 --> 00:51:41.119
COMBINATION OF CHARACTERS THERE.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST STUFF WE GOT

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.120
TO DO TOGETHER.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:51:43.594 --> 00:51:45.594
&gt;&gt; TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR
CAREER AS AN ARTIST, RIGHT?

00:51:48.774 --> 00:51:50.605
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM, YEP.
&gt;&gt; I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH WHAT

00:51:50.606 --> 00:51:53.679
DAN SAID.
THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT'S

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.026
KEY ON THAT IS WHEN YOU PUT
SUPERMAN AMONG THE OTHER HEROES,

00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:03.309
YOU REALLY SEE HIS ICONIC

00:52:04.376 --> 00:52:05.214
NATURE, BECAUSE HE'S
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:52:05.215 --> 00:52:08.539
REST OF THEM.
THERE ARE MANY OTHER HEROES THAT

00:52:12.238 --> 00:52:15.121
HAVE INCREDIBLE POWERS, BUT IN
THIS MYTHOLOGY, HE'S THE PRIMAL

00:52:15.122 --> 00:52:18.197
FIGURE, AND YOU SEE PEOPLE
REACTING TO HIM THAT WAY, AND

00:52:18.198 --> 00:52:21.716
IT'S KIND OF, IF THOMAS
JEFFERSON SHOWED UP HERE AND

00:52:22.944 --> 00:52:25.034
WANTED TO GO DIGGING THROUGH
SOME OF THE BOOKS IN THE

00:52:26.263 --> 00:52:29.176
LIBRARY, IT WOULD BE A VERY
DIFFERENT REACTION THAN THE MOST

00:52:29.177 --> 00:52:32.441
IMPRESSIVE POLITICIAN THAT YOU
COULD POSSIBLY FIND IN

00:52:34.314 --> 00:52:36.314
WASHINGTON TODAY SHOWING UP AND

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.893
WANTING TO DO THAT RESEARCH.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:52:42.962 --> 00:52:45.027
&gt;&gt; I THANK YOU BOTH.
THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY AWESOME

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:50.395
EVENT.
I LOVE SUPERMAN A LOT AND IT'S

00:52:50.396 --> 00:52:52.396
AWESOME TO TALK ABOUT THE MAN OF
STEEL.

00:52:53.682 --> 00:52:55.682
I ACTUALLY WANT TO DIG A LITTLE

00:52:57.587 --> 00:52:59.587
DEEPER INTO THE BATMAN-SUPERMAN
RELATIONSHIP SPECIFICALLY.

00:53:00.282 --> 00:53:01.939
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS BASED

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.993
ON, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN FIND
SOMETHING WHERE THEY'RE FLAT-OUT

00:53:04.994 --> 00:53:07.047
ENEMIES.
YOU CAN FIND THINGS WHERE

00:53:11.168 --> 00:53:12.399
THEY'RE FRENEMIES, YOU CAN FIND
THINGS WHERE THEY'RE THE BEST OF

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.284
FRIENDS, THERE'S A TRUST BUT
VERIFY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

00:53:15.285 --> 00:53:18.173
TWO OF THEM.
I'M INTERESTED, HOW DO YOU BOTH

00:53:18.174 --> 00:53:21.473
VIEW THAT RELATIONSHIP?
SHOULD THERE BE SOME ANTAGONISM,

00:53:21.474 --> 00:53:24.768
SHOULD THERE BE SOME TENSION?
OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:53:26.644 --> 00:53:29.361
ALMOST LIKE A RELIC AND SHOULD
THAT BE DISPOSED OF TO TELL NEW

00:53:29.362 --> 00:53:33.481
STORIES ABOUT BATMAN AND
SUPERMAN IN THAT RELATIONSHIP?

00:53:33.482 --> 00:53:36.748
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NEVER APPROACHED IT AS
THOUGH THEY'RE THE BEST OF

00:53:37.986 --> 00:53:39.986
BUDDIES.

00:53:41.348 --> 00:53:43.409
I THINK THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF MUTUAL RESPECT ON BOTH

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.123
SIDES, BUT FUNDAMENTALLY, I
THINK THEY OPERATE IN VERY

00:53:47.712 --> 00:53:50.034
DIFFERENT WAYS.
AND BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN VERY

00:53:50.035 --> 00:53:52.728
DIFFERENT WAYS, IT'S NOT AS

00:53:55.824 --> 00:53:57.824
THOUGH SUPERMAN CATEGORICALLY
APPROVES.

00:53:58.091 --> 00:54:00.356
DOESN'T MEAN HE DISAPPROVES.
BUT I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS -- I

00:54:00.357 --> 00:54:03.067
THINK IT'S BETTER WHEN THERE'S
SOME TENSION THERE.

00:54:04.709 --> 00:54:06.709
YOU KNOW, BATMAN IS A CREATURE
OF THE NIGHT.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:09.370
SUPERMAN IS OF THE SUN.
BATMAN WEARS THE MASK.

00:54:09.645 --> 00:54:11.645
SUPERMAN DOES NOT.

00:54:12.911 --> 00:54:14.911
ALL THAT STUFF, IT'S THERE AS A
DIFFERENCE, BUT THOSE

00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:18.471
DIFFERENCES MEAN SOMETHING, AND
I ALWAYS THINK IT'S BEEN A

00:54:20.381 --> 00:54:22.215
LITTLE FORCED JUST TO SAY
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN A TITLE FOR

00:54:22.216 --> 00:54:25.152
SO LONG THAT WAS IN THE WORLD'S
FINEST COMICS THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:54:25.153 --> 00:54:27.840
BE THE BEST OF BUDDIES.
THEY SEEM TOO DIFFERENT THAN

00:54:28.482 --> 00:54:30.714
THAT TO ME.
AND YEAH, OPPOSITES ATTRACT BUT

00:54:30.715 --> 00:54:33.389
I STILL THINK THEY'RE TOO
DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.

00:54:35.231 --> 00:54:37.231
&gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, DAN.

00:54:37.712 --> 00:54:39.712
I JUST DON'T THINK THEY'D BE
COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER.

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:40.995
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; THERE'S GOT TO BE A PART OF

00:54:40.996 --> 00:54:45.111
BATMAN THAT LOOKS AND SAYS: 
JESUS, IF I HAD THOSE POWERS, I

00:54:48.162 --> 00:54:50.162
WOULD JUST DESTROY EVERY GUN IN
GOTHAM CITY IN ONE NIGHT.

00:54:50.895 --> 00:54:52.933
I'D RUN FROM BUILDING TO
BUILDING TO BUILDING DOING THIS.

00:54:52.934 --> 00:54:56.912
THE THINGS I WOULD BE ABLE TO
ACCOMPLISH WITH IT.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.829
AND SUPERMAN AT THE SAME TIME
WOULD LOOK AT THE METHODOLOGY

00:55:06.626 --> 00:55:09.321
BATMAN USES, THE EMPHASIS ON
FEAR, AND BE TURNED OFF.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.058
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING HE'D JUST
BE TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ON

00:55:17.612 --> 00:55:19.612
SOME VERY BASIC LEVEL.
IT'S CHALLENGING WRITING

00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:24.232
ANYTHING LIKE JUSTICE LEAGUE,
BECAUSE YOU BRING TOGETHER

00:55:25.654 --> 00:55:27.121
CHARACTERS WHO HAVE SUCH
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT POINTS

00:55:27.122 --> 00:55:28.780
OF VIEW.
ON ONE LEVEL, IT'S GREAT BECAUSE

00:55:28.781 --> 00:55:33.535
YOU REALLY AS DAN WAS SAYING,
YOU GET TO SHOW THE CONFLICT

00:55:35.802 --> 00:55:37.802
POINTS BETWEEN THEM THAT
HEIGHTEN THE RELATIONSHIPS.

00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:41.309
AND WE RECOGNIZE IT AS PEOPLE.
IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE

00:55:43.036 --> 00:55:45.718
RELATIONSHIPS WE SEE IN MEMBERS
OF A SPORTS TEAM WHO ARE BROUGHT

00:55:45.719 --> 00:55:49.621
TOGETHER FOR THE SAME GOAL, BUT
ONE OF THEM'S A SHOW-OFF AND THE

00:55:49.622 --> 00:55:52.918
OTHER ONE IS A GREAT TEAM PLAYER
AND ONE OF THEM'S ALWAYS

00:55:54.374 --> 00:55:55.805
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT
PLAY MIGHT BE AND TALKING TO THE

00:55:55.806 --> 00:56:00.591
COACH AND OUTTHINKING THEM.
SO IT'S VERY HUMAN AND

00:56:03.066 --> 00:56:04.911
RECOGNIZABLE.
BUT IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO PUT

00:56:04.912 --> 00:56:07.815
THAT TOGETHER AND SAY:  WOULD
THEY STAY TOGETHER?

00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:14.031
WOULD THEY PLAY NICELY TOGETHER?

00:56:16.369 --> 00:56:18.369
&gt;&gt; HEY, PROFESSOR.
HOW ARE YOU?

00:56:19.842 --> 00:56:22.086
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
IT'S ANDREW DAVIS.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.968
&gt;&gt; HELLO THERE.
&gt;&gt; SO MY QUESTION IS

00:56:26.995 --> 00:56:29.915
PIGGYBACKING OFF THE BATMAN
QUESTION THAT WAS JUST ASKED, SO

00:56:29.916 --> 00:56:33.834
NIGHTFALL CAME OUT AND SUPERMAN
CAME OUT RELATIVELY CLOSE TO

00:56:34.864 --> 00:56:36.915
EACH OTHER.
HOW WERE YOU TWO FEELING WHEN

00:56:36.916 --> 00:56:39.783
THOSE TWO BOOKS CAME OUT?
AND WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR

00:56:39.784 --> 00:56:43.681
HEAD ON THEM COMPETING WITH EACH
OTHER, OR NOT COMPETING WITH

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.509
EACH OTHER?
&gt;&gt; MY THOUGHT WAS, OH, MY GOD,

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:54.242
WE'RE SELLING SO MANY COMICS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:56:55.074 --> 00:56:56.949
&gt;&gt; THOSE WERE GOOD DAYS.
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A PERIOD THERE OF

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.333
ABOUT 6 MONTHS OR A YEAR WHERE
WE WERE HAVING WEEKLY MEETINGS

00:57:02.334 --> 00:57:04.823
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP SOME
OF THESE THINGS IN PRINT,

00:57:06.293 --> 00:57:09.162
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST MOVING
THROUGH SO QUICKLY.

00:57:13.311 --> 00:57:15.147
AND IT WAS A PHENOMENAL MOMENT.
YOU KNOW, THE SUCCESS OF DEATH

00:57:15.148 --> 00:57:19.093
OF SUPERMAN, WHICH WAS REALLY
THE EXTRAORDINARY THING,

00:57:20.775 --> 00:57:23.272
NIGHTFALL WAS SUCCESSFUL, BUT
NOWHERE NEAR IN THE SAME LEAGUE,

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:26.178
WAS NOT ANYTHING WE WERE
ANTICIPATING.

00:57:27.815 --> 00:57:29.649
WE'D KILLED SUPERMAN BEFORE.
WE'D KILLED HIM A COUPLE

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:31.499
DIFFERENT WAYS.
WE KILLED HIM DIFFERENT TIMES.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.994
THEY WERE NICE STORIES.
YOU CAN ARGUE THAT THE JERRY

00:57:36.217 --> 00:57:38.217
SIEGEL VERSION OF KILLING
SUPERMAN IN THE '60s WAS ONE

00:57:39.079 --> 00:57:41.769
OF THE BEST SUPERMAN STORIES OF
THE 1960s, BUT ULTIMATELY IN

00:57:43.851 --> 00:57:46.341
THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS
NOBODY CARED.

00:57:49.457 --> 00:57:51.113
THE RUN THAT DAN WORKED ON WITH
MIKE CARLIN AND THE WHOLE REST

00:57:51.114 --> 00:57:56.084
OF THE TEAM, WHETHER IT WAS
BECAUSE IT FIRST HIT -- THE NEWS

00:57:56.085 --> 00:58:00.195
OF IT FIRST HIT ON A SLOW NEWS
DAY OR THE ZEITGEIST OF THE

00:58:02.077 --> 00:58:04.982
WORLD HAD CHANGED, A BUNCH OF
THINGS CAME TOGETHER, AND WE

00:58:06.645 --> 00:58:09.357
WERE JUST STANDING THERE WITH A
BASKET CATCHING MANNA FROM

00:58:11.827 --> 00:58:14.336
HEAVEN FOR A WHILE.
THIS WAS A VERY EARLY DAYS OF

00:58:14.337 --> 00:58:18.255
DOING ANY KIND OF GRAPHIC NOVEL
FORMAT TRADE PAPERBACK OR

00:58:23.016 --> 00:58:25.871
ANYTHING, AND WE WANTED TO DO A
ONE-VOLUME EDITION OF THE FIRST

00:58:25.872 --> 00:58:29.794
DEATH STORY.
WE HAD SOLD SO MANY COPIES OF

00:58:29.795 --> 00:58:33.877
THE INDIVIDUAL, SO MANY
PRINTINGS, I REMEMBER VERY

00:58:35.499 --> 00:58:37.499
VIVIDLY, THE GUYS WHO HANDLED
THE NEWS STAND SIDE OF OUR

00:58:38.478 --> 00:58:40.738
BUSINESS, THE MASS MARKET
DISTRIBUTION, COMING IN AND THEY

00:58:40.739 --> 00:58:44.869
WANTED COPIES OF THIS ONE-VOLUME
TRADE PAPERBACK WE WERE DOING.

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.721
WELL, THAT WAS A RETURNABLE
BUSINESS, SO THE MORE COPIES YOU

00:58:47.722 --> 00:58:50.606
PRINTED FOR IT, THE MORE RISK
YOU WERE TAKING.

00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:54.079
AND THE NORMAL PRINT RUN THAT
YOU WOULD DO FOR SENDING

00:58:55.782 --> 00:58:57.899
SOMETHING TO THE NEWSSTAND IN
COMICS AT THAT POINT MIGHT HAVE

00:59:02.202 --> 00:59:04.202
BEEN 50,000 OR 100,000 COPIES,
AT MOST, OF SOMETHING.

00:59:05.099 --> 00:59:07.099
AND USUALLY IT WAS A COMIC BOOK

00:59:08.193 --> 00:59:10.193
THAT WAS A PROBABLY AT THAT TIME

00:59:11.289 --> 00:59:13.289
A DOLLAR COMIC OR A 75-CENT

00:59:14.416 --> 00:59:16.416
COMIC, SO THE COST TO PRINT
WASN'T VERY MUCH.

00:59:17.274 --> 00:59:19.274
IT WASN'T AN ENORMOUS RISK TO
PUT IT OUT THERE.

00:59:20.521 --> 00:59:22.551
WE SAID ALL RIGHT, LOOK AND SEE
HOW MANY YOU THINK WE CAN MOVE

00:59:22.552 --> 00:59:25.602
THROUGH THE NEWSSTANDS.
THEY CAME BACK AND SAID:  OKAY,

00:59:25.603 --> 00:59:29.306
WE NEED 650,000.
AND THIS WAS $3.95 I THINK FOR

00:59:29.307 --> 00:59:31.976
THE FIRST VERSION.
&gt;&gt; $4.95.

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.866
AND RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS TOO,
RIGHT?

00:59:35.867 --> 00:59:37.867
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WAS REALLY A

00:59:39.399 --> 00:59:41.275
MIRACLE IS THE SPEED WITH WHICH
YOU PULLED IT TOGETHER.

00:59:41.276 --> 00:59:43.331
&gt;&gt; NORMALLY SPEAKING, YOU'D
EXPECT IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL

00:59:43.332 --> 00:59:46.832
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SELL
HALF OF THE COPIES YOU SHIPPED,

00:59:46.833 --> 00:59:50.523
MAYBE 1/3 OF THE COPIES AND THE
REST WOULD COME BACK AND BE DEAD

00:59:50.524 --> 00:59:54.240
TREES.
AND -- BUT YOU ALSO MIGHT GET

00:59:54.241 --> 00:59:58.570
ALL OF THEM BACK AND WE HADN'T
SENT OUT 600,000 OF ANYTHING TO

01:00:01.884 --> 01:00:03.884
THE NEWSSTAND FOR, GOD, 20 YEARS
AT THAT POINT.

01:00:06.008 --> 01:00:07.646
BUT WE HAD MADE ENOUGH MONEY OFF
THE PERIODICAL COPIES THAT WE

01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:11.898
SAID:  OKAY, WE CAN AFFORD TO
GAMBLE THIS THIS YEAR AND WE

01:00:13.962 --> 01:00:15.962
PRINTED THE 650,000, OR WHATEVER
IT WAS, AND WE SENT IT OUT.

01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:20.683
AND THEY ALL SOLD.
IT WAS AN AMAZING YEAR.

01:00:22.714 --> 01:00:25.583
&gt;&gt; GOT TIME FOR ONE MORE
QUESTION.

01:00:27.426 --> 01:00:29.426
IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY GOOD.
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:00:34.342 --> 01:00:36.342
&gt;&gt; DO YOU GET TO PICK DOOMSDAY

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.601
WHO GOT THE DEATH TO SUPERMAN?

01:00:41.252 --> 01:00:43.252
OR DID DC PICK?
&gt;&gt; HELP ME OUT.

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:45.533
WHAT ABOUT PICKING THE DEATH OF
SUPERMAN?

01:00:45.534 --> 01:00:47.560
DID WE...
&gt;&gt; DID YOU GET TO PICK DOOMSDAY?

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:51.418
OR DID DC PICK DOOMSDAY?
&gt;&gt; WELL, WE DECIDED TO DO THE

01:00:51.419 --> 01:00:53.419
DEATH OF SUPERMAN, RIGHT?

01:00:55.708 --> 01:00:57.767
AND ACTUALLY, I HAD TWO STORIES
WRITTEN -- OR TWO IDEAS WRITTEN

01:00:57.768 --> 01:01:01.058
ON A YELLOW LEGAL PAD.
ONE WAS DEATH OF SUPERMAN.

01:01:04.587 --> 01:01:06.587
AND THE OTHER ONE WAS MONSTER
TRASHES METROPOLIS.

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:09.490
ON ANOTHER SHEET RIGHT UNDER
THAT ONE I HAD A SKETCH OF A

01:01:10.565 --> 01:01:12.565
MONSTER WITH SOME BONES SORT OF
STICKING OUT OF HIM.

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:16.282
THIS WAS ON A YELLOW LEGAL PAD.
WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT A STORY

01:01:16.283 --> 01:01:18.555
CALLED THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN.
WE WERE SEVERAL WRITERS AND

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:22.706
ARTISTS AND OUR EDITORIAL TEAM
ALL IN THE ROOM TOGETHER, AND WE

01:01:22.707 --> 01:01:25.164
STARTED TO FOCUS ON IT AND
THOUGHT THAT WOULD WORK OUT.

01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:28.610
BUT WE STILL DIDN'T HAVE A NAME
FOR THE MONSTER OR ANYTHING

01:01:29.872 --> 01:01:31.749
ELSE, AND OUR EDITOR WROTE: 
DOOMSDAY FOR SUPERMAN AT THE TOP

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:35.460
OF THE BOARD.
AND WE THEN SAID:  WAIT!

01:01:36.886 --> 01:01:38.886
BECAUSE BACK THEN EVERYBODY HAD
CRAZY NAMES.

01:01:40.586 --> 01:01:42.586
IT WAS BLOOD THIS AND BLOOD THAT
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

01:01:44.071 --> 01:01:46.351
AND I THINK IT WAS ME BUT I'M
NOT 100% SURE SAID:  IS THERE

01:01:46.352 --> 01:01:49.786
ANYBODY CALLED DOOMSDAY?
AND WE ALL START, DOOMSDAY?

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.144
NO, THERE'S NOT SO THAT'S HOW HE
GOT THE NAME DOOMSDAY AND I HAD

01:01:53.145 --> 01:01:56.842
A LITTLE SKETCH RIGHT THERE, SO
WE SORT OF PICKED IT BUT THEN

01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:59.504
BECAUSE WE HAD AN EDITOR IN THE
ROOM, DC WENT FOR IT.

01:02:00.527 --> 01:02:02.527
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:07.445
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; WAS THAT HARRY?

01:02:09.965 --> 01:02:11.817
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT CAME LATER.
THAT WAS A MEETING OR TWO LATER

01:02:11.818 --> 01:02:13.870
I THINK.
&gt;&gt; THE TWO OF YOU WERE NICE

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.415
ENOUGH, TO AWACHTLY HAVE ONE OF
THE FIRST COPIES OF THE

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:23.128
CELEBRATION OF 80 YEARS ACTION
COMICS.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.071
THIS ISN'T THE PERIODICAL, THIS
IS ACTUALLY THE COLLECTION THAT

01:02:25.072 --> 01:02:27.720
