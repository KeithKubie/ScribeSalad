I think that's you know you look at the
 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
I think that's you know you look at the

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 align:start position:0%
know the strategy is always just when
 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
know the strategy is always just when
