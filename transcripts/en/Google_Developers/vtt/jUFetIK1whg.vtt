TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.680
Timothy Jordan here for
one last interview--

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.540
this one with Francoise,
a principal scientist

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.347
here at Google.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:14.680
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: Hi, Timothy.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
[LAUGHS] How are you?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.870
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS:
Very good, and you?

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
I'm doing so good.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.124
The festival has been
amazing, and we've

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:23.040
had the opportunity to
talk to a lot of people

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.130
about what they do.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.880
And that's why I'm
excited for this moment

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.930
here because you do
some really cool stuff.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.450
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: All right!

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.390
Yeah, it is cool!

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.238
I agree!

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:32.154
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So why
don't we give everybody

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:35.070
just an introduction to the
work that you do around machine

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.070
learning and the input.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.720
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: Yeah, so
I work on speech recognition,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.540
and I work on keyboard input.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.810
So speech recognition, you
all know what it's about.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.900
Sundar has been talking about
our progress in Voice and how

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.260
we've lowered our word-error
rate quite a bit--

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.540
Google Home and all that.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.580
And I've been working on
speech for the last 12 years

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.527
at Google.

00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:01.860
And then, more recently, maybe
the last two-three years,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.209
I've been working
on keyboard input.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.340
And when people think
of their keyboard,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.180
they think it's
something very simple,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.750
where they just take the
mobile keyboard on their phone

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.350
and they just tap the letters
of what they want to spell.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.700
But in reality, if you
want a good keyboard that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.620
really understands you
and corrects your mistakes

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.050
and predicts the next word
that you're going to type,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.269
it's pretty complicated.

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:28.810
And there's a lot
of machine learning

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.515
that goes into
keyboards as well.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:32.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, that's
one of the things when

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.590
you were talking
about this earlier,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.220
is that it's a
common misconception

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.810
that machine learning
wouldn't apply to the keyboard

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.710
because you're just
hitting buttons.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.210
But that's actually
not true at all.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.230
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: No,
it's not true at all.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.450
And a keyboard is very
interesting, because it's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.106
such a complex
product in itself,

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:51.230
because you can do a lot
of things with a keyboard.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.420
You can tap on the keys, you can
swipe what you want to write,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.444
and then you can even
click on the microphone,

00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:01.610
and then you can speak to
your keyboard, too, right?

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.430
So the two modalities
come together there.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.550
But doing a good job at
correcting your typos,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.370
yet letting you type new
words that the keyboard maybe

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.930
doesn't know about,
and then learn

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.550
those words and those
phrases for you,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.840
and then being able to
predict the next word

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.890
or the next phrases that you're
going to type so that you don't

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.806
have to type them, you
can just say, oh, yeah,

00:02:23.806 --> 00:02:25.000
that's what I meant, click--

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.401
that takes a lot of
machine learning.

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:28.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.156
One of the other
aspects of your work

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:31.530
that I find really
interesting is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.790
I end up talking to a lot of
machine learning researchers,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.290
and they're just
blazing new ground.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.665
It's really
interesting, but it's

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:38.340
like very theory
and theoretical.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.635
But what you do-- is
you have problems,

00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:43.010
and you've just found that
machine learning is a good way

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.010
to solve them.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.093
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: Right.

00:02:45.093 --> 00:02:48.200
So the way that I like to
think about these problems

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.775
is, I have a technology to
build, and it has many facets,

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.900
and there are many things
that we need to optimize.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.191
It can be the machine learning.

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:56.210
It could be the UI.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.220
It could be the
infrastructure that's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.620
behind it that nobody sees.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.750
And so what we're
really trying to do

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.180
is to understand the
pinpoints for the user--

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.475
where are the places where
our users are wasting time

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.440
and are getting frustrated?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.120
What are the places
that they enjoy instead?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.480
And then trying to
understand those problems,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.520
then we look at what
are the right solutions

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.730
for those problems.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.280
And sometimes, the solution
is just sweeping a parameter.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.750
And sometimes, it takes
like a really complex piece

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.120
of machine learning.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.900
So we're just picking
the technology

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.240
that matches the problem
that we have to solve,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.615
and we improve the technology
one step at a time.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
really interesting

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.960
to kind of have that
perspective of, its very

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.485
pragmatic about
machine learning.

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:42.860
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS:
Right, right.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.340
Exactly, exactly.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.670
And I think it's a good
approach because, once you

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.320
know exactly what--

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.670
the hardest part is
really figuring out

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.850
what is the problem that
you're trying to solve.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.390
And I think a lot of developers
are struggling exactly

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.690
with that same problem.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.710
It's, what is it that
I'm trying to solve?

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.410
How am I formalizing that?

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.980
And then, what is the best
tool to solve that problem?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.890
So there's another aspect of
your work I want to bring up--

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.157
it's the last one, I promise--

00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:09.490
which I find really interesting.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.532
And you call it deep
internationalization.

00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:12.740
Can you tell me what that is?

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.130
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: Yes,
so as you may guess,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.570
I'm not a native US
American speaker.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.740
I grew up in Belgium.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.280
Belgium is a country
with French, and German,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.150
and Flemish.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.560
I learned Italian when I came
here to the United States.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.610
So I care deeply
about languages.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.350
And we have found
developing those keyboards

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.120
that a lot of countries in the
world and a lot of languages

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.510
are not well represented
in mobile keyboards.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.020
What I mean by that is that
there are a lot of people

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.530
in the world, sometimes
tens of millions

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.660
of people, who speak a
language and would like

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.000
to write to their
friends in that language,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.860
but that language is not
supported on a keyboard.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.070
So what do they do?

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.050
Either they go back
to another language--

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.517
so maybe I can not
type in French.

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:03.100
I will go back to
English because it's

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.235
OK my friends
understand English too.

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:06.610
But that's not
what I want to do.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.150
I want to speak
French with my family.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.980
And if we happen to speak a
much more distant language that

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.830
is not well
represented, we wouldn't

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.880
have the luxury of
being able to talk

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.140
to each other in
our own language.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.690
So that brings us
into this space

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.070
where we think it's
not just about bringing

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.530
a few tens of languages
into our keyboards

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.040
and into Google
technology in general.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.890
It's about hundreds
of languages.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.930
It's about going
beyond 1,000 languages.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.160
There are in the
world 1,342 languages,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.710
according to linguists, that
has more than 100,000 speakers.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.810
So you can imagine.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.540
And if you go into
even the deeper end,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.970
it would be in the
6,000-7,000 languages.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.850
And so I really have a
passion for bringing as many

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.090
of those languages online as
possible and progressively

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.480
enabling technologies like
speech recognition and keyboard

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.007
input to more and
more languages.

00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:10.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
the way you design

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.280
an app is just a
little bit different

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.520
if you're trying to design
for all of them, right?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: Yes.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.260
So the app itself,
we try to keep

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.750
things as general as
possible because there's

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.220
no way you can scale to
hundreds of languages

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.620
if your infrastructure
is not general

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.500
and your modeling methodologies
are not as general

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.220
and scalable as possible.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.340
And that's where machine
learning actually is very

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.840
helpful to us because before we
had machine learning to solve

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.750
our problems, we would really
[? hurt ?] good things,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.160
and you would see pieces
of C++ code that would say,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.400
if language equal
German, do this, right?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.260
And that's not what you want.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.700
There is no way to scale that.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.500
With machine learning,
you essentially

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.440
have the algorithms that are
data independent and language

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.510
independent.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.050
And then the data
is the piece that

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.840
contains the knowledge
about the language.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.680
So now there's
this nice interface

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.580
between algorithmic
work and data work.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.420
And so once you have
the right to algorithms,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.780
it's just a question of bumping
data from different languages

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.830
into them to create a new
capability in those languages.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.340
And if you improve
your algorithms,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.440
all the languages
improve at the same time.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.100
So it's a really nice
synergy as long as you

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.890
can establish that boundary.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.070
And with machine learning,
that's very easy to do.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, and
it sounds very sort of,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.800
once you get the
right perspective,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.840
things start to fall into place.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.006
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: Exactly.

00:07:35.006 --> 00:07:37.370
You really want to
build from scratch

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.590
with this thinking of, how am
I going to internationalize

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.250
my product, my technology,
but not just to five languages

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.273
or just to hundreds
of languages.

00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:49.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.550
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS: Yeah.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I think
that's about all the time

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.880
that we have, but thank you
so much for joining with me

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.180
and talking about all this.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.110
Is there anything
else you'd like, say,

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.057
if you could see some developers
on the other end of this camera

00:08:00.057 --> 00:08:01.890
that would love to be
doing the kind of work

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.850
that you're doing now,
what's some of the stuff

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.630
that you'd tell them
to get started on?

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.364
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS:
I think the best work

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.780
that you do is
through when you're

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.010
passionate about the
thing that you're doing.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.280
So I would think
for each developer,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.250
if they are-- and I assume they
are-- passionate about what

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.390
it is that they're trying to
develop, dig deep into it.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.970
Just don't be satisfied
with something

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.550
that's average quality.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.140
Keep digging and digging to
try to understand your product

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.309
the best you can and what your
users want the best you can.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:34.840
And then keep
developing from there,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.341
and everything will go well.

00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:37.799
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Awesome, Francoise.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.110
Thank you so much.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.568
FRANCOISE BEAUFAYS:
You're welcome!

00:08:40.568 --> 00:08:41.690
Thank you!
