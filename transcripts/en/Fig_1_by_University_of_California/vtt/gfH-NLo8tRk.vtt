00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.870
I was always somebody that was into finding
the answers to things. And that's where the

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.410
archive became the perfect place for me because
my job is to find answers for research questions.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.730
There's all this cultural history and value
locked in this collection and what we try

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.340
to do in access is try to help people unlock
that. In a collection this large, you have

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.000
material on basically every major topic relevant
to the history of the 20th century. We have

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.110
over 300,000 holdings and a collection spans
from the dawn of cinema to the present. So

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.660
we have a lot of everything. When we talk
about film preservation, in the archival world

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.010
we're talking about saving film to 35mm safety
film. Digital formats are a constant moving

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.329
target and we really don't know how long the
current digital formats that are in vogue

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.470
are going to be viable. But we do know that
if we take this off the shelf in 60 years

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.190
and hold it up to the light that with safety
film that image is still going to be there.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.110
Some historians estimate that over 80-90%
of all silent film is just lost to time. So

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.780
we're very lucky that we have this large silent
film collection that's actually survived and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.780
the silent animation area of the collection
that's especially interesting. 'Bob's Electric

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.600
Theatre' is one of the first puppet, stop
motion films ever made. In the silent era,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.270
before color film stocks were even invented,
some films would be hand colored or hand stenciled

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.270
and it was a way to add another layer of vibrancy
and energy to film. Long, long before 'Who

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.780
Framed Roger Rabbit' -- 'A Pool Plunge' gives
you an example of combining live action with

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.000
animation. And of course live action was much
cheaper to shoot then animation, so the idea

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.030
of combining the two in some ways was kind
of a cost saving measure. But the novelty

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.170
of combining limited animation and live action
could produce a very entertaining and surreal

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.560
result. The pioneering stop motion animation
in 'The Lost World' by Willis O'Brien, who

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.470
did the special effects on King Kong a few
years later, really enchanted audiences when

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.310
it first came out. The realism was something
they had never seen before. It reportedly

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.909
startled viewers and was so exciting it made
the front page of The New York Times. 'The

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.909
Lost World' was not only 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:35.469
a great film, but the predecessor of today's
Hollywood, special effects filled blockbuster.
