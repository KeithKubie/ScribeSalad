00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:03.321
- [Voiceover] In the earlier
video on DNA replication,

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:04.691
we go into some detail

00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:07.129
about leading strands and lagging strands

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.639
and all of the different actors,

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.286
all of these different enzymatic actors.

00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:13.283
But I left out what is probably

00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:16.673
the most mind-boggling
aspect of all of this,

00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:19.239
and that's the speed and the precision

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.823
with which this is actually happening.

00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:23.036
As we talked about in that video,

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:24.735
it feels pretty complex.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.446
You have this topoisomerase
that's unwinding things,

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:30.675
the helicase is unzipping it.

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:32.602
Then you have the
polymerase that can only go

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:34.994
from the five prime to
three prime direction,

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:36.585
and needs a little primer to get started,

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.268
but then it starts adding the,

00:00:38.268 --> 00:00:40.311
it starts adding the nucleotides.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:41.705
On the lagging strand,

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:42.959
you have to have the R,

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.051
you get the RNA primer,

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:46.233
but then it's going from,

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:49.716
once again, from five
prime to three prime,

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.888
so you have these Okazaki fragments.

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:53.606
And all of this craziness
that's happening,

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.301
and remember, these
things don't have brains.

00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:56.217
These aren't computers.

00:00:56.217 --> 00:00:57.879
They don't know exactly where to go.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.864
It's all because of the chemistry.

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:01.815
They're all bumping into each other

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:03.649
and reacting in just the right way

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.070
to make this incredible thing happen.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.036
Now what I'm about to tell you

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:09.779
is really going to boggle your mind.

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:13.391
Because this is happening incredibly fast.

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:16.072
DNA polymerase has been clocked,

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:17.674
at least in E. coli,

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:22.204
has clocked at approaching
1,000 base pairs per second.

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:23.401
I think the number that I saw

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:26.518
was 700-something base pairs per second.

00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:28.286
So polymerase, let me write this down.

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:29.494
This is worth writing down,

00:01:29.494 --> 00:01:30.701
because it's mind-boggling.

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:34.509
Gives you a sense of just how amazing

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.783
what the machinery in your cells are.

00:01:37.783 --> 00:01:39.222
So it's been as high as,

00:01:39.222 --> 00:01:40.288
and it can change.

00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:41.768
It can speed up and slow down,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.600
and that's actually been observed.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.945
But polymerase as fast as,

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:46.778
as fast as

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:50.158
700-plus base pairs per,

00:01:52.803 --> 00:01:53.720
per second.

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:56.937
So if this, on this diagram,

00:01:56.937 --> 00:01:58.240
it, man, it's just zipping,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.403
it's just zipping along,

00:01:59.403 --> 00:02:02.243
at least from our perceptual
frame of reference.

00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:04.843
A second seems like a very
short amount of time to us,

00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:06.121
but on a molecular scale,

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:07.328
these things are just bouncing around

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:09.534
and just getting this stuff done.

00:02:09.534 --> 00:02:11.066
Now the second thing that
you might be wondering,

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.576
okay, this is happening fast,

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:14.886
but surely it has a lot of errors.

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:15.719
Well, the first thing you might say,

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:16.585
well, if it had a lot of errors,

00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:18.527
that would really not be good for biology,

00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:21.214
because you always have,
you have DNA replicating

00:02:21.214 --> 00:02:22.730
all throughout our lives.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.727
And at some point you
just have so many errors

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.573
that the cells wouldn't function any more.

00:02:26.573 --> 00:02:28.059
And so lucky for us

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.049
that this is actually a
fairly precise process.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.795
Even in the first pass of the polymerase,

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:35.582
you have one mistake,

00:02:35.582 --> 00:02:37.882
you have one mistake,
let me write this down,

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:39.519
'cause it's amazing.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.352
One mistake for every,

00:02:44.223 --> 00:02:47.723
for every approximately 10 to the seventh.

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:50.817
So this is 10 million,

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:53.093
10 million in nucleotides.

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:54.093
Nucleotides.

00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:57.458
And that might seem pretty accurate,

00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:58.410
but you gotta remember,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.893
we have billions of
nucleotides in our DNA.

00:03:01.893 --> 00:03:03.542
So this would still
introduce a lot of errors.

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:05.980
But then there's
proofreading that goes back

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.312
and makes sure that those
errors don't stick around.

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:11.634
And so once all the
proofreading takes place,

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:13.283
it actually becomes one mistake,

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:15.116
one mistake for every

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:19.669
approximately 10 to the ninth nucleotides.

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.743
So approximately, you can,

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.232
it would do this at an
incredibly fast pace,

00:03:24.232 --> 00:03:28.458
as fast as 700-plus approaching
1,000 base pairs per second.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:32.620
And you have one error
every billion nucleotides,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.237
especially after you go through
these proofreading steps.

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:38.025
And so it's incredibly fast,

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:40.324
and it's incredibly precise.

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:42.204
So hopefully that gives
you a better appreciation

00:03:42.204 --> 00:03:43.677
for just the magic that's literally,

00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:44.635
I would look at your hand,

00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:45.734
or just think about,

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:47.929
this is happening in all of the cells

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.762
or most of the cells of
your body as we speak.
