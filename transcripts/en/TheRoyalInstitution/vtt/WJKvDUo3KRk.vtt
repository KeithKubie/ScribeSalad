00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.170
 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.180
This is a protein crystal.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.640
It's pretty small, at just
1/10 of a millimetre thick,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.320
but the millions and millions
of protein molecules stacked

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.340
inside it are even smaller.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.160
This is Oxfordshire.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.480
It's about 50 kilometres in
diameter, somewhat larger

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.850
in comparison.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.310
But it's where scientists
from around the world come

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.510
to analyse their tiny
protein crystals.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.800
And that's because it's home to
this, the Diamond Light Source,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.550
a particle accelerator that
can generate beams of light 10

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.130
billion times
brighter than the sun.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.980
Compared to our crystals,
the Diamond Light Source

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.780
is absolutely gigantic.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.120
It's the most expensive
and sophisticated

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.950
scientific facility
ever built in the UK.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.870
The instrument in
this building can

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.210
produce x-ray beams
powerful enough

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.550
to peer right into the atomic
heart of all kinds of matter.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:18.620
 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.260
Diamond is used by scientists
in many different fields,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.550
but nearly half the users
are structural biologists

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.940
doing x-ray crystallography.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.700
This is a technique
that allows us

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.960
to look at the structure
of any biological molecule

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.120
that we can crystallise.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.490
The secret of success
is growing crystals,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.500
which form when
molecules pack together

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.680
into highly ordered structures.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.990
This ordering of
the molecules means

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.505
that when we fire
x-rays at a crystal,

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:51.970
it diffracts or
scatters the beam

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.860
into hundreds of intense rays.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.890
The resulting
diffraction pattern,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.310
detected as an
array of spots, is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.320
dependent on the internal
structure of the crystal.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.170
And by measuring the intensities
and positions of these spots,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.200
we can work back
to the structure

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.240
of the molecule it is made from.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.780
It's a method that has
opened our eyes to life

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.030
at the molecular level.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.470
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.530
X-ray crystallography isn't
a particularly new technique.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.080
In fact, it's been around
for about a century.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.010
In the early days,
crystallographers

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.540
used simpler x-ray generators
and photographic plates

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.550
like this one to record
their diffraction patterns.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.177
Back then x-ray generators
were much weaker,

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:44.760
and this tended to
limit the technique

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.570
to larger crystals,
which could usually only

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.820
be grown from smaller and
simpler protein molecules.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.640
 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.700
Even then, it could take
hours or sometimes days

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.510
to record all the
diffraction patterns needed

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.180
to solve the crystal
structure of a protein.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.360
But today, with synchrotrons
as powerful as Diamond,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.700
we can use much
smaller crystals,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.800
down to only 5,000th of
a millimetre in size,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.880
which is often what you have
to do if you're trying to study

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.040
larger and more
complex proteins.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:30.140
 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.940
Here at the core
of the synchrotron

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.330
is a particle
accelerator ring that

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.960
accelerates electrons to
close to the speed of light.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.920
The ring itself is around
560 metres in circumference,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.220
and dotted around it are
undulators like this one.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.110
Powerful electromagnets
within this pipe

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.840
force the electrons to
wiggle from side to side

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.430
as they pass through.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.920
And as they wiggle, they
produce an intense pulse

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.648
of electromagnetic radiation
in the form of x-rays.

00:04:01.648 --> 00:04:04.650
And that pulse of
x-rays shoots straight

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.596
into one of the lead-lined
experimental hatches

00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:09.440
where visiting
scientists carry out

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.768
their diffraction experiments.

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:23.770
 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.920
During the experiment,
the crystal,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.840
which is mounted on the
end of this little pin,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.950
is cooled by
ultra-cold nitrogen gas

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.330
from this nozzle to
help it withstand

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.380
the punishing radiation.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.140
This allows us to take much
longer exposures, which

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.800
are needed when working
with very small crystals.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.540
The x-rays from
behind emerge here

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.490
and are scattered by the crystal
into many different angles.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.260
The diffracted rays are
captured on this detector, which

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.080
can record up to
25 images a second,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.630
much faster than the
photographic plates

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.510
that we used to use.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.970
 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.450
So what do we do with
this information?

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.620
How do we convert these
diffraction patterns

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.630
into molecular structures?

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.130
Well I can see my
crystals down a microscope

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.770
like this fairly easily.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.025
What I'm doing here
is using lenses

00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:24.910
to make a magnified
image of a tiny object.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.940
And that works because the
lens can recombine or focus

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.610
the light scattered
from an object

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.190
to make an enlarged image.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.300
Because a molecule is much
smaller than the wavelength

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.650
of light, I'm never
going to be able to see

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.210
it using an
instrument like this.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.110
Instead, we use
x-rays, a form of light

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.660
that has a wavelength
about the size of an atom.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.640
But there are no
lenses to focus x-rays.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.660
So we use our
mathematical understanding

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.090
of how light scatters to do
the work of the lens for us.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.520
And that allows us to work
backwards from the diffraction

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.030
pattern to a
three-dimensional image

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.590
of the protein in the crystal.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.390
What we end up with are
three-dimensional maps,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.030
which plot the electron density
of the protein molecule.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.020
And this reveals its branched,
chain-like structure.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.330
The resolution of these maps
is dependent on the quality

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.070
of your crystal.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.560
The better they are,
the more accurate

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.100
your model is likely to be.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.210
Originally, crystallographers
would painstakingly

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.010
build these 3D models by hand.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.980
But now we rely on
computers to generate them.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.060
With good quality data, these
maps are stunningly detailed.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.360
You can see the lumps and bumps
of every atom, every twist

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.170
and turn of the protein chain.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:58.390
 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.340
Even after you've spent
your time at Diamond

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.270
and solved your
protein structure,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.880
you've really only
taken the first step

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.030
on a much longer journey towards
understanding how it works.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.550
But from these sorts
of investigations,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.520
we can learn how the biological
molecules of your body

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.590
interact with one
another, or how

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.170
to design drugs that
will bind to them more

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.310
effectively, or even
to design proteins

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.880
that nature never got
around to inventing.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.390
Even after 100 years, these
are still exciting times

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.570
to be working in
structural biology,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.450
thanks in no small part to
facilities like Diamond.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:08:14.742
