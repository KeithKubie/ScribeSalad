00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.819
Let's look more closely to these factor variables. For

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.906
now I want to draw your attention to the age.range variable

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:09.940
right here. Notice that it says that we have a

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.140
factor variable with seven different levels. We can examine the

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.820
levels of a variable, by typing in the command levels

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.320
and then putting it the variable right here. In the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.020
console we can see the seven levels of the age.range

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.660
variable. Now, instead of creating a table of the age.range

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.880
variable, let's create a plot that shows how many users

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.720
are in each bin. That is, we want to figure out how

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.020
many surveyed respondents are between the ages of 18 and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.450
24, 25 and 34, and so on. I'm going to create this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.200
plot using the ggplot2 package, and the qplot function that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.220
comes with it. Again, don't worry about understanding this code too

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.830
much, we'll have practice with this in the next lesson.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.280
When I run this code, I get my plot over here.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.140
Zooming in on this plot, I want you to notice

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.180
that the age groups appear to be in order. This is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.080
true for everyone except the survey takers who are under

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.140
the age of 18. Now, it would be really helpful if

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.250
this bar was really oriented over here. That way we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.900
could make comparisons across the groups more easily. Now this is

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.930
why we would want to have ordered factors. The variable age.range just

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.310
contains factors with seven levels, but these levels aren't arranged in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.730
any particular order. Sometimes you want to introduce order into our

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.840
data set. So that way we can make more readable plots.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.360
So, knowing a little bit about ordered factors, let's see

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.540
if you can answer this next question. If you haven't already

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.375
done so, download the Reddit survey data and look at

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.820
its structure. After you looked at the structure of the variables,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.790
try and answer this question. Which of these variables in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.130
the data set could also be converted to an ordered factor?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.090
Just like age.range.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.860
Check any of the variables that apply.
