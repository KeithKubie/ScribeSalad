00:00:06.588 --> 00:00:10.271
He was a powerful king whose
break with the church of Rome

00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:13.296
would forever change 
the course of English history.

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:16.671
But was he a charismatic reformer
or a bullying tyrant?

00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:21.614
Find out on History versus Henry VIII.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:25.461
Judge: Order, order. Now, who do we have
here? Looks like quite the dashing fellow.

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:28.773
Defense: Indeed, your honour. 
This is Henry VIII, the acclaimed king

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:31.225
who reformed England's
religion and government

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:34.269
and set it on course to becoming
a modern nation.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.394
Prosecutor: I beg to differ. This is a
cruel, impulsive, and extravagant king

00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:42.571
who had as little regard for his 
people as he did for his six wives.

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:44.021
Judge: Six wives?

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:47.067
Defense: Your honor, Henry's first 
marriage was arranged for him

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:48.865
when he was only a child.

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:53.107
He only married Catherine of Aragon to 
strengthen England’s alliance with Spain.

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:57.384
Prosecutor: An alliance he was willing to 
toss aside with no regard for the nation.

00:00:57.384 --> 00:00:59.878
Defense: Henry had every 
regard for the nation.

00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:04.512
It was imperative to secure the Tudor 
dynasty by producing a male heir –

00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:08.212
something Catherine failed to do in 
over twenty years of marriage.

00:01:08.212 --> 00:01:10.910
Prosecutor: It takes two to make an heir,
your honor.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.495
Defense: Ahem. Regardless, England needed
a new queen to ensure stability,

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:19.868
but the Pope refused to annul the union 
and let the king remarry.

00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:22.888
Judge: Sounds like quite a pickle. 
Can’t argue with the Pope.

00:01:22.888 --> 00:01:25.981
Prosecutor: And yet that’s exactly 
what the king decided to do.

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.262
He uprooted the country’s 
religious foundations

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:31.286
and broke the Church of England 
away from Rome,

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.166
leading to centuries of strife.

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:36.684
Defense: All Henry did was give the 
Church honest domestic leadership.

00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:40.256
He freed his subjects from the corrupt 
Roman Catholic establishment.

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:43.775
And by rejecting the more radical changes
of the Protestant reformation,

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:47.166
he allowed his people to preserve 
most of their religious traditions.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.782
Prosecutor: Objection! The Church had been
a beloved and popular institution

00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:53.672
that brought comfort and 
charity to the masses.

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:56.172
Thanks to Henry, church 
property was seized;

00:01:56.172 --> 00:02:00.982
hospitals closed, and precious monastic 
libraries lost forever,

00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:02.516
all to enrich the Crown.

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:05.383
Defense: Some of the funds 
were used to build new cathedrals

00:02:05.383 --> 00:02:07.187
and open secular schools.

00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:09.874
And it was necessary for England 
to bring its affairs

00:02:09.874 --> 00:02:12.964
under its own control rather than Rome’s.

00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:15.097
Prosecutor: You mean under 
Henry’s control.

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:19.048
Defense: Not true. All of the king’s 
major reforms went through Parliament.

00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:22.565
No other country of the time allowed
its people such a say in government.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:26.421
Prosecutor: He used Parliament as a rubber
stamp for his own personal will.

00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:31.761
Meanwhile he ruled like a tyrant, executing
those he suspected of disloyalty.

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.415
Among his victims were the great 
statesman and philosopher Thomas More

00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:37.498
– once his close friend and advisor –

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:42.832
and Anne Boleyn, the new queen 
Henry had torn the country apart to marry.

00:02:42.832 --> 00:02:45.263
Judge: He executed his own wife?

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:48.226
Defense: That…wasn’t 
King Henry’s initiative.

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:50.688
She was accused of treason
in a power struggle

00:02:50.688 --> 00:02:53.238
with the King’s minister, 
Thomas Cromwell.

00:02:53.238 --> 00:02:54.972
Prosecutor: The trial was a sham

00:02:54.972 --> 00:02:57.655
and she wouldn’t have been convicted
without Henry’s approval.

00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:00.168
Besides, he wasn’t too
upset by the outcome -

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:03.362
he married Jane Seymour 
just 11 days later!

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:06.840
Defense: A marriage that, I note,
succeeded in producing a male heir

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.369
and guaranteeing a stable succession…

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.130
though the new queen tragically
died in childbirth.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.968
Prosecutor: This tragedy didn’t deter him

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:17.678
from an ill conceived fourth 
marriage to Anne of Cleves,

00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:22.946
which Henry then annulled on a whim and 
used as an excuse to execute Cromwell.

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:25.856
As if that weren’t enough, he then 
married Catherine Howard

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:30.033
– a cousin of Anne Boleyn – 
before having her executed too.

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:33.356
Defense: She was engaged in adultery 
to which she confessed!

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:36.557
Regardless, Henry’s final marriage
to Catherine Parr

00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:38.214
was actually very successful.

00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:41.592
Prosecutor: His sixth! It only goes to
show he was an intemperate king

00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:45.095
who allowed faction and intrigue
to rule his court,

00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:48.836
concerned only with his own 
pleasure and grandiosity.

00:03:48.836 --> 00:03:52.915
Defense: That grandiosity was part of the 
king’s role as a model for his people.

00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:56.758
He was a learned scholar and musician
who generously patronized the arts,

00:03:56.758 --> 00:03:59.879
as well as being an imposing 
warrior and sportsman.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.759
And the lavish tournaments he hosted

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.930
enhanced England’s reputation
on the world stage.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.604
Prosecutor: And yet both his foreign and 
domestic policies were a disaster.

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:13.195
His campaigns in France and his brutal
invasion of Scotland drained the treasury,

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:18.233
and his attempt to pay for it by debasing 
the coinage led to constant inflation.

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:22.156
The lords and landowners responded 
by removing access to common pastures

00:04:22.156 --> 00:04:25.494
and turning the peasant 
population into beggars.

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:28.245
Defense: Beggars who would soon 
become yeomen farmers.

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:32.065
The enclosures made farming more 
efficient, and created a labor surplus

00:04:32.065 --> 00:04:35.561
that laid the foundation for
the Industrial Revolution.

00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.040
England would never have become the 
great power that it did without them

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.055
…and without Henry.

00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:42.885
Judge: Well, I think no matter what,

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:46.471
we can all agree he looks great 
in that portrait.

00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:49.257
A devout believer who broke 
with the Church.

00:04:49.257 --> 00:04:51.848
A man of learning who executed scholars.

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:54.222
A king who brought stability
to the throne,

00:04:54.222 --> 00:04:56.813
but used it to promote his own glory,

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:00.223
Henry VIII embodied all the contradictions
of monarchy

00:05:00.223 --> 00:05:02.691
on the verge of the modern era.

00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:07.972
But separating the ruler from the myth
is all part of putting history on trial.
