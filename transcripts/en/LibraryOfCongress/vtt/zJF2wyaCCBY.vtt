00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.960
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: Welcome to
the last presentation today

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.260
at the book festival.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.330
I'm so excited to be hear
talking with all of you.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.050
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.830
It was a busy exciting day, full
of authors and storytellers.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.160
And they invited me here to close
out the program talking about some

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.480
of the innovative work that the
Library of Congress is doing.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.840
So, I'm here today to talk to
you about this idea that we have

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.850
in libraries about using
collections as data.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.720
So, as we collect more
digital material,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.350
and as we digitize more paper and
tangible works, it's very easy

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.930
to put those up as exact digital
surrogates of the physical items.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.580
But we'd like to think creatively

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.550
about what other possibilities
are inherent in these things?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.310
And so, I'll tell you a short
story about using this concept

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.000
of using collections as data.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.300
Starting with some of our friends
the very handsome founding fathers,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.430
Alexander Hamilton
and James Madison.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.820
So, if you, those of you who have
seen Hamilton or remember anything

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.250
about high school may remember the,
may remember the Federalist Papers

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.290
which were cowritten by John Jay,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.530
Alexander Hamilton,
and James Madison.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.980
And they were published under
a pseudonym Publius and to try

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.420
to persuade colonial citizens
to ratify the constitution.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.070
And when changing public opinion
converted these documents magically

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.040
from anonymous trolling
to foundational documents

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.540
of the democracy, we started
to get a sense of authorship

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.360
of these papers, which founding
fathers wrote which ones.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.780
After the dust settled, there were
twelve that remained in dispute.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.940
Hamilton said that
Madison wrote them.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.830
Madison said that he didn't
have much to do with them.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.940
People generally thought
Madison did write them.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.210
And why was there so
much finger pointing?

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.990
Well, these were propaganda
pieces and sometimes authors,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.800
the authors took positions sort
of for the sake of argument

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.750
that they wouldn't have, different

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.490
from the positions
they had publicly.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.400
So, historical opinion over
the years swung back and forth

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.550 position:56%
about who wrote the papers depending
on who was in favor in time

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.300
and what pieces of historical
evidence were coming to light.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.370
But, in 1944, historian Douglass
Adair did a comprehensive review

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.770
of the historical document
and determined

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.560
that Madison probably wrote them.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.480
But he considered the
historical evidence modest.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.930
So, he sought another way
of making an analysis.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.590
I really love this quote.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.090
He, Douglass Adair talked
with two statisticians to see

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.780
if there was a computational way
to distinguish the authorship.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.340
So, Frederick Mosteller and David
Wallace were intrigued by this idea

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.020
and they decided to
take on the challenge.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.960
They, and this quote is from the
first paragraph of their book,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.200 position:56%
which I encourage you to read if
the story sounds interesting to you.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.290
It's very readable
and very interesting.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.720 position:56%
So, they decided to do, they decided
one way that they might be able

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.870
to distinguish authorship between
Hamilton and Madison would be

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.470
to count sentence length
and do an average.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.770
So, they did this.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.100
They took a set of known
Hamilton papers and a set

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.910
of known Madison papers and they
laboriously counted sentence length

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.240
and did some analysis.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.840
For example, they had to decide
whether quoted sentences counted

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.140
toward the average.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.290
And then they after this work
they came out with the answer,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.960
and average sentence length
of 34.5 words for Hamilton.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.780
And 34.6 words for Madison.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.970
So, that was a bust.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.820
And, next they tried
standard deviation.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.940
So, they thought, even if
the averages are the same,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.380
what if one author writes lots
of average length sentences,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.380
and the other writes lots
of teeny tiny sentences,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.850
and lots of really long sentences.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.490
So, they went back, and they
did all the counting again,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.920
crunch the numbers, and the
average standard deviation

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.200
for both authors was
nearly identical as well.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.500
And it turns out they both were
schooled in a certain style

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.140
of writing that was popular at
the time, so if they had talked

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.780
with Dorian about this maybe they
could have gotten a head start

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.080
on the research.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.320
But so that was kind of a bummer
and they shelved the project.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.840
A few years later, the original
historian reached back out to say

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.360
that he found a tool
that might be useful.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.120
He found that while
Hamilton uses the word while,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.450
Madison uses the word whilst.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.440
And that fact in itself is not
enough to discriminate authorship.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.370
The word does not appear often
enough, it doesn't even appear

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.100
in all the Federalist
Papers that were in dispute,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.700
but it gave them an idea
of somewhere to start.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:49.000
So, the statisticians in
their lab counted word usage

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.580
in a screening set of known
Hamilton and known Madison papers.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.810
And you can imagine how laborious

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.050
and exciting this would
be as a project.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.120
So, they had a screening set, they
counted, they listed all the words,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.420
they counted how often it came up.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.380
And then they compared who
used what words more often.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.730
And they determined which words
were predictable discriminators

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.980
against words which words they
called dangerously contextual

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.670
because they were associated
with the subject favored

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.230
by one author rather
than part of their usage.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.390
And they ended up with
117 to analyze.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.090
Using Bayesian analysis, raise your
hand if you're a fan of Tommy Bays.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.480
Who doesn't love Tommy Bayes?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.430
Using Bayesian analysis, they
determined the probability

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.170
of authorship based on the
number of times the words appear.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.510
And like I said, if
you're interested in any

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.300
of this, please read the book.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.230
It is a little bit heavy on
the statistics but it's fun

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.240
and readable and it's great.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.070
So, they concluded, quote "Our
data independently supplement those

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.370
of the historian.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.100
On the basis of our data alone,
Madison is extremely likely

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.570
in the sense of a degree of belief

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.210
to have written the
disputed Federalists."

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.220
And what I really like about this
is that none of this is digital.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.950
So, when we talk about
collections as data,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.280
it's really a concept that's
existed for a very long time.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.930
We've been using, we've been
analyzing collections materials

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.600
as if they were data
for a long time.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.110
But what's new now is that,

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.690
cheap and easy computing
democratizes this.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.840
So, this is available to
curious people in their home

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.990
or to journalists and not
just available to you know,

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.360
professors with large
labs who and grad students

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.180
who can help do counting.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.510
In this example, our heroes spent
years inventing this analysis.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.950
So, this type of analysis
had never been before.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.910
But a lot of that time was

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.390 position:56%
in laboriously counting word
frequencies and in hand calculating.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.070
And their data was
limited by human scale.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.470
And what I'd like for you to
do is imagine what we could do

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.660
if we had computation and
cheaper data, and faster analysis.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.230
So, to bring this story
around to Harry Potter,

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.110
which I think is important
to do in any talk.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.450
This sort of linguistic
analysis has gone

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.100
from cutting edge to
now very common.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.590
So, a few years ago, a computer
scientist Patrick Juola got a call

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.980
from a reporter who was reading the
new mystery writer Robin Galbraith,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.900
and got a tip that
might be Harry Potter.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.410
But he needed more evidence
to prove that that was true.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.020
So, he asked the computer scientist
to do the same kind of analysis.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.260
And the computer scientist
did and proved

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.040
that Robin Galbraith
was really Harry Potter,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.590
and he did that in a couple of
days instead of a series of years.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.150
And his code is now
available for anybody to use.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.390
And that brings us back to today.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.780
So, one of the things we're
exploring at the Library

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.060
of Congress is how we can
enable this sort of research

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.490
through the ways we're
providing collections,

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.840
through training, and
through events.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.760
And we've hosted a series of
symposiums for people to come

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.990
and talk about their work
and talk about the challenges

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.500
and opportunities inherent

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.500
in computational analysis
of collections.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.530
And if you're interested
you can Google that term

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.450
and you'll see the
summaries of those days

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.920
and also the talks are available.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.730
So, I want to talk a
little bit about my group,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.440
National Digital Initiatives.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.660
We're very inspired by our
new boss Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.280
She's leading the Library
very strongly in a direction

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.230
of opening up the collections.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.830
She talks about this place lovingly

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.010
like the American's
people treasure chest

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.880
that she's helping to crack open.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.150
And we, and DIC see it as our
duty make this happen for digital

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.590
and digitized collections.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.630
And I'd like to tell you about
a few things we're working on.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.240
The first is crowd-sourcing.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.390
So, we're working to expand
the Library's ability to learn

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.070
from our users to more
digital platforms.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.870
And this is a screenshot of a
project that was built by Tom Wong

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.420
who is a developer at the
Library of Congress while he was

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.010
on a fellowship at my team,
National Digital Initiatives.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.750
And this a tool, can we go back?

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.820
This is a tool that invites
the public to identify pictures

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.120
and cartoons in historic newspapers

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.530
and helps us caption
that, caption them.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.910
This will give us two things.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.730
Better findability, because
captions are historically do not,

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.930
optical character recognition
does not work very well on them,

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.750
but also will have a data set that
we can use to give to researchers.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.490
So, if researcher is
interested, for example,

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.470
in World War I era cartoons,
we'll be able to serve that.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.390
We're excited that we're going
to launch this in a couple

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.590
of weeks as a beta application.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.060
So, please stay tuned and hopefully
you'll be able to contribute.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.330
This isn't the only crowd-sourcing
project we're working on but some

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.840
of those details I'll
have to save for later.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.710
But there are other, this is going
to supplement the Library's program

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.210
of crowd-sourcing including
Flickr, the American Archive

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.130
of Public Broadcasting Game,
and efforts in the Law Library

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.530
and World Digital Library.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.550
Another thing we're working on
is a Congressional Data Contest.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.820
So, our CIO, Bud Barton
announced this years,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.090
at this year's legislative data
and transparency conference

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.970
that we'll be hosting a competition

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.060
for creative use of
legislative data.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.270
And we'll be announcing more of
the details in a couple of weeks.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.240
But, this will invite the
public to take legislative

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.690
and congressional information and
think of creative ways to analyze

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.990
or present that information.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.920
And we're hoping that it
spurs people to interact

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.800
with the information that
we're making available,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:54.510
an also with the legislative
and democratic process.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.200
I'm really excited to
announce this next thing.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.920
We are working to launch
labs.loc.gov in a few weeks,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.030
which we hope will
be a place for play

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.820 position:56%
and innovation with the collections.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.380
It will be our home, NDI's home,
so you'll be able to follow some

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.580
of our work if that's what
you're interested in there.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.240
And we'll host things like results

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.650
from our hack-a-thons
and fellowships.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.700
And this a particular image of one

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.890
of our hack-a-thons
which I really like.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.910
Are any of you programmers
in the audience?

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:29.570
So, for those of you who are not
programmers, you may watch movies

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.060
and programming looks like this.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.280
[typing noises] But in real
life, it looks mostly like this.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:42.180
And so, I think this is a very
good image of programmers at work.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.640
A few more things.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.760
I'd like to mention the Kluge
Fellowship in Digital Studies.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.660
So, if you are interested in
academic research and would

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.520
like to do that at the Library,
and you're specifically interested

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.280
in studying the impact of the
digital revolution on society,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.450
we invite you to apply
for a Kluge Fellowship.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.880
The applications are due December
6th, so you have some time

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.560
to get your materials in order.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.910
And more than one can
be awarded in a year,

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:16.470
so share it with your friends if
you think they might be interested.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.600
Lastly, I want to mention a
program NDI's been working

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.180
on to bring exciting people
to Library of Congress

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.970
for short term, high
impact projects.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.230
We call it the innovator
and residence program.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.840
We're wrapping up some details
on this year's fellowship

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.450
and we should have
more to announce soon.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.790
So, thank you for coming, and
thank you for listening to my talk

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.090
at the end of a very long day.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.820
It's lovely to see all
your smiling faces.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.150
It's just the cap on a
wonderful and exciting afternoon.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.570
If you're interested in
the work that we're doing

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:50.290 position:56%
in National Digital Initiatives,
please go to blogs.loc.gov/thesignal

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.160
and you can follow us there and
we'll be posting all of our new

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.570
and exciting projects
as we launch them.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.380
And I'd be pleased to take any
questions if anybody has any.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.180
Thank you.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:07.130
[ Applause ]

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.340
Ma'am

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.640
Yeah, so the question is, instead

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.870
of doing targeted sharing are we
doing anything at the higher level

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.720
so making the Library of Congress
collections more broadly available.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.060
And I think one of the
things I'm super excited

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.100
about with labs is we are having a
page on that called LC for Robots.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.650
And it's, it will be a
listing of all the APIs

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.670
and book data that's available
from the Library of Congress,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.460
along with contextual information.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.510
So, you'll understand, I think

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.190
from the outsider's perspective
we have Chronically America,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.170
which is this wonderful
website filled

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.010
with 12 million digitized
historic newspapers.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.840
And we have loc.gov where you
can get prints and photographs

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.140
and manuscript collections.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.080
And how do those two things
interrelate I think is very,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.410
it can be very intimidating.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.430
And also, it's hard for somebody
to get a comprehensive view.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.460
So, I hope you'll check that out
and make some good use of it.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.890
Does that answer your question?

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.040
Okay. Anybody else?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.340
Yes.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.520
&gt;&gt; What's your background?

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.820
&gt;&gt; Kate Zwaard: Oh, you know,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.710
I'm sorry I should have introduced
myself at the start of the talk.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.310
My name is Kate Zwaard,
I am the Chief

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.280
of National Digital Initiatives
at the Library of Congress.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.860
And I started here as a programmer.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.130 position:56%
And I ran the repository development
group for awhile until I,

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:33.830
this new team was started,
and they asked me to lead it.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.800
Anybody else?

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.010
Thank you so much.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.530
