adaptive you 280 and I'm now adding

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889
adaptive you 280 and I'm now adding
 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.070
adaptive you 280 and I'm now adding
accessibility support to it and so it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080
accessibility support to it and so it
 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.350
accessibility support to it and so it
works in the same fashion than lest view

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360
works in the same fashion than lest view
 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.249
works in the same fashion than lest view
in gridview so in each layout pass what

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259
in gridview so in each layout pass what
 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.740
in gridview so in each layout pass what
it does is it has to detach all the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750
it does is it has to detach all the
 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.719
it does is it has to detach all the
existing views in order to do all the

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729
existing views in order to do all the
 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.659
existing views in order to do all the
new recycling stuff ListView that's the

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669
new recycling stuff ListView that's the
 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.540
new recycling stuff ListView that's the
same thing but so in order to handle

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550
same thing but so in order to handle
 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.420
same thing but so in order to handle
focus when we really when we do the

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430
focus when we really when we do the
 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.159
focus when we really when we do the
relay out for input focus there there

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169
relay out for input focus there there
 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.339
relay out for input focus there there
are like public API that makes this very

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349
are like public API that makes this very
 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.560
are like public API that makes this very
simple to implement you have get focused

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570
simple to implement you have get focused
 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.189
simple to implement you have get focused
child save that recycle everything and

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199
child save that recycle everything and
 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.230
child save that recycle everything and
then you restore the focus wherever it

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240
then you restore the focus wherever it
 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.920
then you restore the focus wherever it
was if it makes sense to do so but for

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930
was if it makes sense to do so but for
 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.320
was if it makes sense to do so but for
accessibility focus which is something

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330
accessibility focus which is something
 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.330
accessibility focus which is something
more recent um in the platform as far as

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340

accessibility focus now and things like

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050
accessibility focus now and things like
 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.080
accessibility focus now and things like
do I have the accessibility for missing

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090
do I have the accessibility for missing
 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.129
do I have the accessibility for missing

then I want to know the accessibility

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
then I want to know the accessibility
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.180
then I want to know the accessibility
node info on it or the host view for the

node info on it or the host view for the
 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.719
node info on it or the host view for the
accessibility focus so do you guys know

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729
accessibility focus so do you guys know
 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.820
accessibility focus so do you guys know
of any public API to handle these things

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830
of any public API to handle these things
 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.520
of any public API to handle these things

great for you they are only using
private AP is that makes it very

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820
private AP is that makes it very
 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.580

good I know the support library has a

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260
good I know the support library has a
 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.670
good I know the support library has a
lot of accessibility resent a lot it has

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680
lot of accessibility resent a lot it has
 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.350
lot of accessibility resent a lot it has
a couple of classes in there which have

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360
a couple of classes in there which have
 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.300
a couple of classes in there which have
support versions of it sips of being

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310
support versions of it sips of being
 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.970
support versions of it sips of being
able to query accessibility service or

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980
able to query accessibility service or
 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.440
able to query accessibility service or
not to be able to send accessibility

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450
not to be able to send accessibility

so I can't really say it different I

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570
so I can't really say it different I
 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.700
so I can't really say it different I
thought it's going to help you or not

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710

summarizes the API there but I haven't

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520
summarizes the API there but I haven't
 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.330
summarizes the API there but I haven't
worked with it either so I use some of

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340
worked with it either so I use some of
 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.440
worked with it either so I use some of
the attributes but um and it's about it

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450
the attributes but um and it's about it
 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.650
the attributes but um and it's about it
yeah I'm kind of assuming that the

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660
yeah I'm kind of assuming that the
 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.660
yeah I'm kind of assuming that the
reason it's not public yet it's just

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670
reason it's not public yet it's just
 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.880
reason it's not public yet it's just
that you want it to mature a bit before

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890
that you want it to mature a bit before
 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.790
that you want it to mature a bit before
exposing it to everyone because there

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800
exposing it to everyone because there
 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.240
exposing it to everyone because there
are things that look very like very good

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250
are things that look very like very good
 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.670
are things that look very like very good
candidates for public API in the private

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680
candidates for public API in the private
 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.740
candidates for public API in the private
api I mean there are things like request

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750
api I mean there are things like request
 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.930
api I mean there are things like request
accessibility focus on the view class

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940
accessibility focus on the view class
 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.940
accessibility focus on the view class
right so this thing would be very

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950
right so this thing would be very
 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.130
right so this thing would be very
convenient Oh like if you're dealing

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140
convenient Oh like if you're dealing
 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.260
convenient Oh like if you're dealing
with things like view recycling and

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270
with things like view recycling and
 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.620
with things like view recycling and
stuff like that but and also things like

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.630
stuff like that but and also things like
 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.260
stuff like that but and also things like
you can guess you can query the hosts

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270
you can guess you can query the hosts
 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.170
you can guess you can query the hosts
view holding the accessibility focus at

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.180
view holding the accessibility focus at
 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.860
view holding the accessibility focus at
any point but by using very private

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870
any point but by using very private
 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.410
any point but by using very private
stuff there I like public methods with

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.420
stuff there I like public methods with
 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.420
stuff there I like public methods with
the hidden annotation yeah okay so this

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430
the hidden annotation yeah okay so this
 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.980
the hidden annotation yeah okay so this
is why I'm assuming it's just like

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990
is why I'm assuming it's just like
 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.800
is why I'm assuming it's just like
cooking like a bit more before exposing

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:49.810
cooking like a bit more before exposing
 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.700
cooking like a bit more before exposing
I don't think you're ready we have to be

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.710
I don't think you're ready we have to be
 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.260
I don't think you're ready we have to be
very careful what your daughter but yeah

very careful what your daughter but yeah
I can understand that it's just yeah

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:00.850
I can understand that it's just yeah
 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.990
I can understand that it's just yeah
it's just that like for now pretty much

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000
it's just that like for now pretty much
 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.020
it's just that like for now pretty much
so that the reason I'm asking is also

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.030
so that the reason I'm asking is also
 

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.180
so that the reason I'm asking is also
because it seems that the whole adaptive

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:09.190
because it seems that the whole adaptive
 

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.640
because it seems that the whole adaptive
view framework it's not really meant to

view framework it's not really meant to
 

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.260
view framework it's not really meant to
be extended at all like I have to like

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.270
be extended at all like I have to like
 

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.670
be extended at all like I have to like
replicate a lot of stuff that is in the

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680
replicate a lot of stuff that is in the
 

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.400
replicate a lot of stuff that is in the

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.490

really inconvenient

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500
really inconvenient
 

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.680

it's a nice evening out a support

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:25.690
it's a nice evening out a support
 

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.720
it's a nice evening out a support
library as chris says it's got the some

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:27.730

accessibility delegate methods in that

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.350
accessibility delegate methods in that
 

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.130
accessibility delegate methods in that
and i'm sending and receiving of

and i'm sending and receiving of
 

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.130

you put the device into accessibility

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.400
you put the device into accessibility
 

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.310
you put the device into accessibility
mode does your list swipe when you've

got um when you use two fingers so yeah
 

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.260
got um when you use two fingers so yeah
so I i implemented the whole action

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:46.270
so I i implemented the whole action
 

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.110
so I i implemented the whole action
accessibility action bits which is fine

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120
accessibility action bits which is fine
 

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.780
accessibility action bits which is fine
so this this is all done this is all

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:51.790
so this this is all done this is all
 

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.300
so this this is all done this is all
working fine what it what the problem

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:54.310
working fine what it what the problem
 

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.160
working fine what it what the problem
like this specific problem are talking

nine patch ask from David in Vienna and

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.050
 
 

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.860
 
yeah I think you should really think

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:06.870
yeah I think you should really think
 

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.420
yeah I think you should really think
about the reason why you need this

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:08.430
about the reason why you need this
 

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.320
about the reason why you need this
because the nine pitch is probably the

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:12.330
because the nine pitch is probably the
 

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.200
because the nine pitch is probably the
best you can do also I think also in

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.210
best you can do also I think also in
 

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.560
best you can do also I think also in

shadow layer um yeah meanie it was
intimidated and so you mentioned that it

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:33.029
intimidated and so you mentioned that it
 

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:36.140
intimidated and so you mentioned that it
is much harder isolation and that does

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.150
is much harder isolation and that does
 

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.450

originally I was done you can set the

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:38.460
originally I was done you can set the
 

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.420
originally I was done you can set the
layer type up to software so software

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:41.430
layer type up to software so software
 

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.190
layer type up to software so software
layer so you just disable harder

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200
layer so you just disable harder
 

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.570
layer so you just disable harder

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:44.580
acceleration and it should work again
 

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.660
acceleration and it should work again

ask not Mexicans I advised to do and you
 

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.020
ask not Mexicans I advised to do and you
can do it but you have to be extremely

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:53.030
can do it but you have to be extremely
 

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.240
can do it but you have to be extremely
careful basically if you're setting the

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:55.250
careful basically if you're setting the
 

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.100
careful basically if you're setting the
window background to milk you have to

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.110
window background to milk you have to
 

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.840
window background to milk you have to
ensure that every you know everything

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:58.850
ensure that every you know everything
 

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.580
ensure that every you know everything
you draw on screen has a background on

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:00.590
you draw on screen has a background on
 

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.040
you draw on screen has a background on
it you know if there is any component

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.050
it you know if there is any component
 

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.360
it you know if there is any component
you know like and we'll talk minutes

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:04.370
you know like and we'll talk minutes
 

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.830
you know like and we'll talk minutes
earlier like action bar tabs and so on

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840
earlier like action bar tabs and so on
 

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.390
earlier like action bar tabs and so on
which have a null background of

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:07.400
which have a null background of
 

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.860
which have a null background of
transplant background then you're going

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:08.870
transplant background then you're going
 

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.530
transplant background then you're going
to get unexpected behavior so while you

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:11.540
to get unexpected behavior so while you
 

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.470
to get unexpected behavior so while you
can set the window background to know if

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480
can set the window background to know if
 

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.780
can set the window background to know if
you know you're doing I'd advise you to

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:16.790
you know you're doing I'd advise you to
 

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:17.860
you know you're doing I'd advise you to
actually use the window background

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:17.870
actually use the window background
 

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.080
actually use the window background
there's a base color and you know remove

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.090
there's a base color and you know remove
 

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.700
there's a base color and you know remove
backgrounds from things on top of it

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:21.710
backgrounds from things on top of it
 

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.860
backgrounds from things on top of it
what if you can another thing to be

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:23.870
what if you can another thing to be
 

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.120
what if you can another thing to be
aware of is that when you're launching

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.130
aware of is that when you're launching
 

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.910
aware of is that when you're launching
your activity for the first time and in

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:27.920
your activity for the first time and in
 

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.020
your activity for the first time and in
order to get a very snappy performance

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.030
order to get a very snappy performance
 

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.330
order to get a very snappy performance
to have the app launch and Android is an

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:31.340
to have the app launch and Android is an
 

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.620
to have the app launch and Android is an
optimization where it will actually take

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:32.630
optimization where it will actually take
 

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.690
optimization where it will actually take
the background color of your window and

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:34.700
the background color of your window and
 

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.030
the background color of your window and
your action bar and and animate those

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.040
your action bar and and animate those
 

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.650
your action bar and and animate those
opening and then draw your app on top of

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:38.660
opening and then draw your app on top of
 

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.240
opening and then draw your app on top of
that to give this faster response time

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:40.250
that to give this faster response time
 

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.150
that to give this faster response time
and it's kind of a optimization or trick

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:43.160
and it's kind of a optimization or trick
 

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.980
and it's kind of a optimization or trick
and so if you're setting a null

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:44.990
and so if you're setting a null
 

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.810
and so if you're setting a null
background in your theme then we won't

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:46.820
background in your theme then we won't
 

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.250
background in your theme then we won't
be able to do that so you will get this

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:48.260
be able to do that so you will get this
 

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.060
be able to do that so you will get this
much slightly worse behavior

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.070
much slightly worse behavior
 

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.190
much slightly worse behavior
so for that reason I advise you to set

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200
so for that reason I advise you to set
 

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.840
so for that reason I advise you to set
set a background color in your window if

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:53.850
set a background color in your window if
 

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.880
set a background color in your window if
you can and reduce the overdraw on top

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:55.890
you can and reduce the overdraw on top
 

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.580
you can and reduce the overdraw on top
of the background wake up so you know by

00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:58.590
of the background wake up so you know by
 

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.710
of the background wake up so you know by
removing backgrounds on the views within

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720
removing backgrounds on the views within
 

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:06.320
removing backgrounds on the views within
the am that's my advice yeah it is

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:06.330
the am that's my advice yeah it is
 

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.000
the am that's my advice yeah it is
there's another question from Andrew

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.010
there's another question from Andrew
 

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.760
there's another question from Andrew
Kelly regarding window soft input mode

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:10.770
Kelly regarding window soft input mode
 

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.020
Kelly regarding window soft input mode
um he basically has the problem that

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.030
um he basically has the problem that
 

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.060
um he basically has the problem that
there's some problem on HTC devices and

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.070
there's some problem on HTC devices and
 

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:22.280
there's some problem on HTC devices and
you're asking for advice on what's best

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:22.290
you're asking for advice on what's best
 

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.000
you're asking for advice on what's best
way to handle those issues with

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.010
way to handle those issues with
 

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.020
way to handle those issues with
manufacturer or having problems on

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.030
manufacturer or having problems on
 

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.020
manufacturer or having problems on
different devices um I think they're

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.030
different devices um I think they're
 

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.810
different devices um I think they're
there's no easy way or no best practice

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820
there's no easy way or no best practice
 

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.750
there's no easy way or no best practice
to do it what I did in the past what I

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760
to do it what I did in the past what I
 

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.650
to do it what I did in the past what I
was using a factory I had this one

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:39.660
was using a factory I had this one
 

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.530
was using a factory I had this one
object and I was clearing it and it

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:42.540
object and I was clearing it and it
 

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.470
object and I was clearing it and it
would return me an object i'm going to

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480
would return me an object i'm going to
 

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.740
would return me an object i'm going to
add methods on that object in your case

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:48.750
add methods on that object in your case
 

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.390
add methods on that object in your case
it will be set window soft input mode or

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400
it will be set window soft input mode or
 

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.550
it will be set window soft input mode or
something and so you you could only

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:55.560
something and so you you could only
 

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.110
something and so you you could only
create a factory and use this one object

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120
create a factory and use this one object
 

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.730
create a factory and use this one object
and just call one method on object so if

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740
and just call one method on object so if
 

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.160
and just call one method on object so if
you have different vendors this is

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:04.170
you have different vendors this is
 

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.840
you have different vendors this is
pretty handy but it still only work

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:05.850
pretty handy but it still only work
 

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.630
pretty handy but it still only work
around so there's really no solution for

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640
around so there's really no solution for
 

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.250
around so there's really no solution for
these kinds of problems and they're hard

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260
these kinds of problems and they're hard
 

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.350
these kinds of problems and they're hard
to find an heart attack so but i would

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360
to find an heart attack so but i would
 

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.250
to find an heart attack so but i would
use a factory to do it one thing about

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260
use a factory to do it one thing about
 

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.490
use a factory to do it one thing about
Silas is try not to add checks for

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500
