00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.220
Long ago, some philosophers worked very hard
to separate myths from what they actually

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.690
knew about nature.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.179
Thales theorized that everything in the world
is made of water.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.519
Pythagoras was a mathematical-mystical vegetarian.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.910
And Democritus, we all know and love as the
Atom Guy…

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.780
Meet the Presocratics!

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:31.620
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.620
The Presocratics were named for their leader, Presocrates.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.520
That is a joke!

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.200
They were several different philosophers who
lived before Socrates.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.100
Why start with the Presocratics?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.940
Since people have systematically made knowledge
about the world for millennia, there’s no

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.440
single starting point.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.480
But a convenient place to get our footing
is ancient Greece.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.220
These Greeks were the cornerstone of scientific
inquiry in western Europe.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.160
Their theories had a terrific run.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.620
Can you imagine coming up with a question
about nature that puzzles people for more

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.940
than two thousand years?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.250
I can’t even decide what to have for breakfast.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.450
A more practical reason to put on our thinking
togas is that the ancient Greeks left behind

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.450
sources.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.210
Writing stuff down makes history possible
and here’s a Pro tip: if you want to be remembered

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.890
in two thousand years, keep a diary!

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.509
Preferably on vellum with metallic ink.

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.170
Also, get super famous so that your students
make plenty of copies.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.539
Not all of the people we think of as “ancient

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.770
Greeks” actually lived in Greece.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.490
Their culture stretched across a prosperous
region called called Ionia.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.350
And they weren’t as ancient as some even
ancient-er Greeks.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.009
We typically date ancient Greece as starting
around 800 BCE, after the fall of the Mycenaeans.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.799
Those are the dudes who burned
down troy because one of them got dumped.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.799
Zero Chill.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.289
“Ancient” Greece ends with the Roman conquest
in 146 BCE.

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.460
We’re focusing on a science-dense period
from aroud 600 to 400 BCE.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.380
These Greeks live in small towns and are very
comfy out at sea.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.130
They trade and fight with each other a lot,
and they sometimes have to deal with invading

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.130
Persians.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.399
They worship nature, but their land is deforested
and eroded.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.670
They love setting up new colonies all along
the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.280
There is no public support for anything like
modern science.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.850
There aren’t even schools in which to study
science…

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.320
The Greeks practiced natural philosophy, meaning

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.820
“self-conscious inquiry into nature.”

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.880
A lot of their philosophies were about answering
our first running question: What is stuff?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.000
I mean, really?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.190
If you watched our first episode you’ll
know that we can divide “science” into

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.160
both a “body of knowledge” and a “set
of methods.”

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.640
When you examine the work of these Presocratic
philosophers, you can see two important things:

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.520
first, they weren’t scientists in a modern
sense.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.710
They didn’t make detailed, accurate knowledge
of nature based on observation.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.830
But they did come up with theories that tried
to account for why stuff is the way it is.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.850
In their wonky-sounding theories, we still
find many of the themes that would drive centuries

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.410
of further inquiry: the divide between the
abstract and the material, or identifying

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.760
the smallest possible particle of stuff.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.240
Second, as these natural philosophers tried
their best to separate Myth from Truth, they

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.300
developed first drafts of many of the methods
we still use and value today.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.640
Natural philosophy became a quest for abstract
knowledge.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.920
This is important because it means the Presocratics
started making general claims about the real

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.060
world—laws that would apply in every situation,
not only specific instances.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.290
The Presocratics also developed “schools”
of thought that spread their ideas around

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.540
geographically and down the centuries.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.730
These weren’t physical schools, but groups
of teachers and students who thought about

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.730
the same problems.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.660
One of the reasons we know about these schools,
is because they operated as individuals, who

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.680
took credit for their ideas and whose names
were passed down.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.550
This practice differed from many other cultures
of inquiry, and became a foundation for how

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.910
Europeans later systematically made knowledge.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.960
But the big method, and the one we’re going
to focus on, was rational debate.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.310
Between all those schools and individuals
and abstract theories there was a lot of disagreement.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.280
To convince people they were right: a natural
philosopher had to use reason, logic, and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.610
observation to attack the wrong-seeming theories
of others and bolster his own awesomeness.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.060
In fact, some historians argue there’s a
link between rational debate about political

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.360
constitutionality, or how humans should govern
themselves, and rational debate about the

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.600
constitution of nature, or how the world governs
itself.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.530
There are more Presocratics than we could
possibly mention, so here are some highlights:

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.930
this is our rogue’s gallery of natural philosophers,
who all had their own theories, and argued...

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.720
they  rationally debated—themselves into
the history of science.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.420
The first European natural philosopher whose
ideas survived down to the present was Thales,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.159
the first individual known to have proved
a mathematical theorem—Thales’s theorem.

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.151
In fact, early historians attributed lots
of firsts to Thales, making it hard to tell

00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.199
exactly what he really accomplished.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.229
Regardless, being the first at a whole way
of doing thought is pretty unusual.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.909
Thales set the natural world off as separate
from the divine.

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.639
For him, the world was something comprehensible
by the powers of the human intellect: it became

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.780
an object, a thing, like other things.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.740
This meant leaving the gods out!

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.349
For example, Thales held that wind, not a
god, caused the Nile to flood.

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.830
This was a general, natural explanation for
a phenomenon.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.999
Thales was not, however, irreligious.

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.889
He believed that all things have a god, or
soul, within them.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.860
Thales was also the founder of the first European
“school” of philosophy, ---

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.039
The Milesian school was known for its theory
of matter; theory of stuff.

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.969
This theory held that water was the primary
substrate, or the most basic element.

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.199
The Earth floats on water like a ship.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.189
Earthquakes happen when the water rocks back
and forth.

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:51.969
The soul of things may not have been material,
but their stuffness was water.

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.280
We'll come back to this essential dualism
of soul versus matter in future episodes.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.479
Later, Plato and Aristotle were dismissive
of Thales, and part of their argument was

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.699
that Thales once predicted an upcoming harvest
to corner the market on olive oil, using his

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.830
philosophy for personal gain.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.250
Is that okay?

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.420
Depends on who you ask.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.940
Thales’s star student, was Anaximander.

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.689
He’s thought to have been the first European
philosopher to write down his own ideas.

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.880
Like Thales, Anaximander believed that nature
is ruled by discoverable laws.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.729
But Anaximander rejected Thales’s watery
universal substrate, proposing instead a formless

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.470
initial state called the apeiron.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.240
Anaximader proposed that this primal formlessness
would then devolve into opposite properties

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.310
that could be experienced—hot/cold, dry/wet,
heavy and light, etc.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.870
Anaximander worked in astronomy, geography,
and mathematics.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.100
One of his contributions was introducing the
gnomon, the part of the sundial that casts

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.360
a shadow, to Greece.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.939
These had already been used in China for two
millennia.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:55.000
The gnomon was good for more than just telling
time, it helped people better understand the

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.409
movement of the sun, and it helped Anaximander
develop a model of the cosmos that envisioned

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:04.009
heavenly wheels punctured by holes letting
light through.

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.800
One of our earliest examples of natural philosophers
trying to conquer the “Where are we” question.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.879
The last great thinker associated with the
Milesians was Empedocles.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.870
(He was probably also influenced by Pythagoras
and Parmenides.)

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.289
Almost every Greek philosopher had a book
called On Nature; it’s super confusing—In

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.569
Empedocles’s “On Nature” he put forward
the theory of the four classical elements:

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:29.580
earth, air, fire, and water, mixed by two
forces, Love and Strife.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.300
While this of course seems hopelessly misguided
now, remember that simply by asking “What

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.080
is Stuff?”, the Milesians were moving away
from mythology and toward modern physics.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.440
Probably the Presocratic philosopher most
well-known today is Pythagoras, that Triangle Guy.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.979
Pythagoras studied the philosophy of the Milesians,
but he was a more mystic thinker…

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:54.970
Which is a nice way of saying, Pythagoras
was a cult leader.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.979
He believed in reincarnation and outlawed
beans, seeing them as impure.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.979
Probably…

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:03.159
Historians love to debate the bean thing!

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.920
At least we’re pretty sure he was a vegetarian.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.690
How can you be a vegetarian without beans!?!?!?!

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.240
Pythagoras’s focus on the pure dovetails
with the fact that we think of him as having

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:20.180
introduced the notion of idealism to science:
idealists generated abstract models of perfect stuff.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.900
This was unlike the Milesians, who were materialists:
they started theorizing about actual stuff.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.430
In terms of math, Pythagoras’s idealism
meant a shift from practical arithmetic, inherited

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.560
from Egypt and Mesopotamia, to a new, pure
geometry.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.810
For Pythagoras, numbers were not just a way
of counting stuff.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.050
They were sacred.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.919
Pythagoras loved whole numbers.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.240
He hated irrational numbers, such as the square
root of two.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.339
He called the square root of two the alogon
or “unutterable.”

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:54.699
To even know that the irrational numbers existed,
you had to join the cult of the Pythagoreans

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.520
and work your way into the innermost circle.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.320
... this is so great!

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.200
For our purposes, the thing that Pythagoras
added to science is the role of the mathematical proof.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.680
Egyptians and Babylonians knew about Pythagorean
triplets—that is, whole number solutions

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.850
to the Pythagorean theorem.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:16.139
That was useful...a practical guide that could
be implemented by ancient engineers, but pythagoras

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:20.550
understood it (and proved it) in a purely
abstract, purely mathematical way.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.970
With Pythagoras, creating an elegant, abstract
proof became a model for justifying a new

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.970
claim to knowledge.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.230
Another major thread in Greek thought before

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:34.430
Socrates was atomism, the theory that the
world is made of particles you can’t divide

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.440
any further.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.360
This was associated with democritus, who made heavy use of rational debate through dialogues, our “wonder”

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360
of this period.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.230
For this, he’s the star of this week’s
ThoughtBubble:

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.060
Democritus held that everything is made of

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.060
atoms.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.509
Indestructible, uncreated, always in motion,
and infinite in number.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.470
And they came in all kinds of shapes and sizes.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.930
In his focus on matter, Democritus was a materialist
like the Milesians.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.720
He is even credited with holding a bottle
of air underwater to show that air is made

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.480
of stuff—thus giving rise to experiment
as a way to illustrate a theory.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.500
Still, Democritus had a lot to prove.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.319
He would ask “What is air?”

00:10:13.319 --> 00:10:15.750
And people would be like, “Nothing.”

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.490
And that’s when he’d say “That’s where
you’re wrong.”

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.970
Most famously, Democritus argued against other
theorists—Parmenides and Zeno—using something

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.460
that we call the void hypothesis.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.959
Democritus was like, “Everything is made
of little indivisible bits stuff, I call them

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:31.959
atoms.”

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:36.760
Then Zeno is all, “But, Democritus my friend, what is
between two atoms?”

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.540
Then Democritus says, “Nothing, between atoms there
is only a void.”

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.130
And then Zeno replies, "You’re caught in a paradox friend,
if everything is made of atoms, and the void

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:52.800
is a thing, then the void is made of atoms...but
then...what is between the atoms of the void?"

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.960
And then, presumably, Zeno dropped the 450
BCE equivalent of a mic and the crowd went

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960
wild.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.060
Thanks Thought Bubble,
This was rational debate, and this particular

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.100
debate would go on for centuries.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.579
But, more importantly, the structure of the
dialogue...the celebration of rational debate

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:15.279
as almost a sporting event for these nerds
was a new and valuable way to analyze our

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.279
universe.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:20.390
This debate is just one example of how the
presocratics elevated being curious about

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.529
the world into natural philosophy.

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:26.709
It’s important to remember that the natural
philosophers of ancient Greece lived in a

00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:31.870
very different world, both physically and
socially, from that of Jeopardy! and GitHub.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:38.540
But the way that this group of thinkers framed
problems about stuff, change, nothingness,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.399
mathematical elegance, perception, truth,
and the cosmos has echoed across the centuries.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:49.420
Next time—we’ll watch Plato and Aristotle
duke it out over idealism and empiricism.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.279
It’s gonna be a throw-down for the ages!

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:56.230
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.519
MT and It’s made with the help of all of
these nice people.

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:03.144
Our animation team is Thought Cafe and Crash
Course is made using Adobe Creative Cloud.

00:12:03.144 --> 00:12:04.160
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.750
