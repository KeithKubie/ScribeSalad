00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
Simplify 3 times the
principal root of 500x

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.325
to the third power.

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:08.700
So what we're
going to do here is

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.910
try to break up this stuff that
we have under the radical sign

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.145
into some things that
are perfect squares.

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.770
And then we can separately take
the square root of those things

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.025
and leave the left overs
inside of the radical sign.

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:20.650
And the other thing
we have to remember

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.440
is, principal square
root, this radical sign

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.215
here really means the positive
the square root of a number.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.840
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.214
So let's see if
we can break down

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:35.094
the 500x to the third into some
perfect squares and some things

00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:36.510
that maybe aren't
perfect squares.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.490
Because 500 is not a perfect
square, and x to the third

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.140
is not a perfect square
right from the get go.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.970
So when in doubt, we can just
start to prime factorize this,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.070
and maybe we'll discover
some perfect squares.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.230
So 500 is divisible by
5, and it's 5 times 100.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.930
And you probably
already recognized

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.710
that 100 is a perfect square.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.330
It is 10 times 10.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.410
But if you didn't know that,
you could keep factoring it.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.620
You could say, look,
100 is 2 times 50.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.710
50 is 2 times 25,
and 25 is 5 times 5.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.460
So you would see the
perfect squares here,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.220
because you would see two 2's.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.850
So you have a 2 times a 2,
and you have a 5 times a 5.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.450
So you could really just
say that 100 is 10 times 10,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.230
or you could say it's 2
squared times 5 squared.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.120
Either of those
things would allow

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.300
you to break this
down a little bit.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.440
And then x to the
third, that's clearly

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.001
just the same thing as
x squared times x, which

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
allows us to break it
down into a perfect square

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.230
and something that is
not a perfect square.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.930
So let's just
rewrite these numbers

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.090
under the principal root sign.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.480
So this is going to
be equal to 3 times--

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.960
and I'll save some
space here-- 3 times.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.980
The 500 I can rewrite
it as 100 times 5,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.200
and 100 I can rewrite
as 10 squared.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.159
So this right here I can
rewrite as 10 squared.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.241
I don't have to do all of
this business down here.

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:09.800
But this will help you recognize
that it's a perfect square.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.720
It's 4 times 25, both of
those are perfect squares.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.480
So that's 10 squared.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.000
So I'm going to write this
as 10 squared times 5.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.880
That's the 500 right over there.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.370
And then I can rewrite the x to
the third as x squared times x.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.050
And then let me extend
my principal root sign

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.380
right over here.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.740
And we know from basic
exponent properties,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.170
because that's really
what we're doing here,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.989
taking the square
root of something

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.530
is really the same
thing as taking it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.910
to a fractional exponent.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.535
So it's the same
properties that apply.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:52.180
This is the same thing as
3 times the principal root

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.990
of 10 squared times the
principal root-- let

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.420
me do it this way-- times
the principal root of 5

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.470
times the principal
root of x squared

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.200
times the principal root of x.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.890
And now we can
simplify these things.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.270
So the principal
root of 10 squared,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.260
or the principal root of 100,
is going to be positive 10.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.729
Negative 10 is
also equal to 100,

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.270
but when you take
the principal root,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.780
you only care about the
positive square root.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.460
So this right over
here is going to be 10.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.220
5 is not a perfect
square, so we'll just

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.080
leave this expression
as the square root of 5.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.960
Square root of x squared.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.320
So here you might
be tempted, and I've

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.700
seen this done many, many times.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.480
You're tempted to just say,
hey, that's just going to be x.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.590
The square root
of x squared is x.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.545
But what if what
if x is negative?

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.440
Let's say that x was negative 2.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.420
Then x squared would be 4.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.390
And the principal root of
4 is equal to positive 2.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.600
It's equal to the
positive square root.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.780
So you can't just say
that this thing over here

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.460
is going to be equal to
x, because in this case,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.770
it was equal to the
absolute value of x.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.100
And so that's what we do.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.420
We say that this is equal
to, regardless of whether x

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.950
is positive or negative, we
want the positive square root.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.340
So you would say it's equal
to the absolute value of x.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.520
That's what that principal
root does for us.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.690
And so now, if we
simplify it a little bit,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.824
remember with multiplication,
since we're just

00:04:32.824 --> 00:04:34.490
multiplying a bunch
of expressions here,

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.280
it doesn't matter
what order we do it.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.810
We can switch the order.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.840
So we have all the stuff
out of the radicals

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.570
multiplying times
each other first,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.290
and then we have the radicals.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.716
So we have 3 times 10 times
the absolute value of x.

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:50.140
3 times 10 is 30.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.800
So we have 30 times
the absolute value

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:04.750
of x times the square root of
5 times the square root of x.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.300
And you have the principal
or the square root of 5

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.070
and the square root of x, you
can actually rewrite this right

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.377
here as the square root of 5x.

00:05:13.377 --> 00:05:15.210
You're taking the product
of two things that

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.418
are raised to the same power.

00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:18.650
That's the same thing
as taking the product

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.740
and then raising them to
that fractional power.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.323
Or I guess another
way to think of it,

00:05:22.323 --> 00:05:23.910
and then taking the square root.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.670
So this all
simplifies to 30 times

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.725
the absolute value of x
times the square root of 5x.
