snapped this picture now the two
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.340
snapped this picture now the two
pictures are the same plant you can see

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350
pictures are the same plant you can see
 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.640

this little stick here so there's no

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
this little stick here so there's no
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.440
this little stick here so there's no
tricks going on it's the same plant but

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
tricks going on it's the same plant but
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.720
tricks going on it's the same plant but
of course it's in very different form at

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730
of course it's in very different form at
 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.400
of course it's in very different form at
2 p.m. and 6 p.m. all the blooms are are

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410
2 p.m. and 6 p.m. all the blooms are are
 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.280
2 p.m. and 6 p.m. all the blooms are are
tightly closed at 2 p.m. the plant

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
tightly closed at 2 p.m. the plant
 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.400
tightly closed at 2 p.m. the plant
looking very sad but at 6 p.m. it's in

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410
looking very sad but at 6 p.m. it's in
 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.080
looking very sad but at 6 p.m. it's in
full bloom ready for pollination so one

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090
full bloom ready for pollination so one
 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.700

of the things we know about this plant

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710
of the things we know about this plant
 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.160
of the things we know about this plant
is that it's pollinated by a hawk moth

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
is that it's pollinated by a hawk moth
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.780
is that it's pollinated by a hawk moth
which is a nocturnal insect and this is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
which is a nocturnal insect and this is
 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.670
which is a nocturnal insect and this is
a desert environment water is precious

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680
a desert environment water is precious
 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.570
a desert environment water is precious
in order to open these petals the petals

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580
in order to open these petals the petals
 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.870
in order to open these petals the petals
that form this these flowers water has

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880
that form this these flowers water has
 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.190
that form this these flowers water has
to be pumped out of the rest of the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200
to be pumped out of the rest of the
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.590
to be pumped out of the rest of the
plant and into the petals and of course

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600
plant and into the petals and of course
 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.460
plant and into the petals and of course
once once water leaves the rest of the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470
once once water leaves the rest of the
 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.590
once once water leaves the rest of the
plant and is put into the petals

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600
plant and is put into the petals
 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.380
plant and is put into the petals
transpiration will reduce the level of

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
transpiration will reduce the level of
 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.330
transpiration will reduce the level of
water in the plant so this is a costly

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340
water in the plant so this is a costly
 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.699
water in the plant so this is a costly
thing for the plant to do so we think

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709
thing for the plant to do so we think
 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.060
thing for the plant to do so we think
that the reason for this rhythm of bloom

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070
that the reason for this rhythm of bloom
 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.250
that the reason for this rhythm of bloom
opening and closing has to do with the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260
opening and closing has to do with the
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.190
opening and closing has to do with the
preservation esses airy preservation of

preservation esses airy preservation of
 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.699
preservation esses airy preservation of
water when possible but also making the

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709
water when possible but also making the
 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.130
water when possible but also making the
blooms available to that nocturnal moth

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140
blooms available to that nocturnal moth
 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.170
blooms available to that nocturnal moth
when the ma nocturnal when the moth is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180
when the ma nocturnal when the moth is

why keep your petals open if there's no

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810
why keep your petals open if there's no
 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.560
why keep your petals open if there's no
chance of being pollinated in the middle

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570

work in 1967 where he described two
 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.270
work in 1967 where he described two
different forms of communication about

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280
different forms of communication about
 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.090
different forms of communication about
the location and distance of food that

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100
the location and distance of food that
 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.150
the location and distance of food that
is produced by foraging bees when they

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160
is produced by foraging bees when they
 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.640
is produced by foraging bees when they
come back to the hive now what you have

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650
come back to the hive now what you have
 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.190
come back to the hive now what you have
to realize about a beehive in nature is

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200
to realize about a beehive in nature is
 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.910
to realize about a beehive in nature is
that the hive encloses a darkened inner

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920
that the hive encloses a darkened inner
 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.660
that the hive encloses a darkened inner
chamber which contains the comb which is

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670
chamber which contains the comb which is
 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.170
chamber which contains the comb which is
where the honey is stored in the the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180
where the honey is stored in the the
 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.320
where the honey is stored in the the
larvae and the foraging bees and those

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330
larvae and the foraging bees and those
 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.720
larvae and the foraging bees and those
following the foraging bees use that as

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730
following the foraging bees use that as
 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.280
following the foraging bees use that as
their dance form so it's a vertical

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290
their dance form so it's a vertical
 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.770

direction but it indicates the direction
 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.120
direction but it indicates the direction
in terms of the Sun so if the food

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130
in terms of the Sun so if the food
 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.370
in terms of the Sun so if the food
source is in a direct line with the Sun

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380
source is in a direct line with the Sun
 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.340

especially fascinated von Frisch what

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460
especially fascinated von Frisch what
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.930
especially fascinated von Frisch what
fascinates me is that these dances can

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940
fascinates me is that these dances can
 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.120
fascinates me is that these dances can
go on for hours inside that darkened

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.130
go on for hours inside that darkened
 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.100
go on for hours inside that darkened
hive and that forager the initial

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110
hive and that forager the initial
 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.940
hive and that forager the initial
forager doesn't go back out outside the

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:48.950
forager doesn't go back out outside the
 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.140
forager doesn't go back out outside the
hive and recheck the location of the Sun

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.150
hive and recheck the location of the Sun
 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.020
hive and recheck the location of the Sun
instead what happens is over time the

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.030
instead what happens is over time the
 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.960
instead what happens is over time the
forager slightly changes the orientation

00:07:59.960 --> 00:07:59.970
forager slightly changes the orientation
 

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.050
forager slightly changes the orientation
of its dance in such a way that over the

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060
of its dance in such a way that over the
 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.740
of its dance in such a way that over the
several hour period it accurately

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:05.750
several hour period it accurately
 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.960
several hour period it accurately
predicts the new location of the Sun so

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:08.970
predicts the new location of the Sun so
 

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.040
predicts the new location of the Sun so
it's giving a modified indication of the

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.050
it's giving a modified indication of the
 

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.810
it's giving a modified indication of the
location of the food but always

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:16.820
location of the food but always
 

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.340
location of the food but always
maintaining accuracy with the current

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.350
maintaining accuracy with the current
 

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.530
maintaining accuracy with the current

about what kinds of biology might I

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.150
about what kinds of biology might I
 

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.299
about what kinds of biology might I
study with all these new technologies

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:50.309
study with all these new technologies
 

00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:55.310
study with all these new technologies
I remembered the intriguing behavioral

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320
I remembered the intriguing behavioral
 

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.380
I remembered the intriguing behavioral
effects of the period mutations and

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:57.390
effects of the period mutations and
 

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.250
effects of the period mutations and
recognized that I had a weapon here that

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260
recognized that I had a weapon here that
 

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.560
recognized that I had a weapon here that
I could use to isolate that gene I had

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:03.570
I could use to isolate that gene I had
 

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.140
I could use to isolate that gene I had
this translocation that broke the gene

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.150
this translocation that broke the gene
 

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.530
this translocation that broke the gene
and I say that that represents a new

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:09.540
and I say that that represents a new
 

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.130
and I say that that represents a new
attack on a gene at the time when DNA

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140
attack on a gene at the time when DNA
 

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.410
attack on a gene at the time when DNA
sequencing had not really come into

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:15.420
sequencing had not really come into
 

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.900
sequencing had not really come into
being you could never find a nucleotide

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:17.910
being you could never find a nucleotide
 

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.600
being you could never find a nucleotide
chain change in a walk through several

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:20.610
chain change in a walk through several
 

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.060
chain change in a walk through several
thousand base pairs of DNA but you could

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.070
thousand base pairs of DNA but you could
 

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.760
thousand base pairs of DNA but you could
never miss a change from one chromosome

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:25.770
never miss a change from one chromosome
 

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.520
never miss a change from one chromosome
to another a chromosome breakpoint and

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:28.530
to another a chromosome breakpoint and
 

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.890
to another a chromosome breakpoint and

to study at the molecular level a gene

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160
to study at the molecular level a gene
 

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.210
to study at the molecular level a gene
that seemed to have a deep connection to

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220
that seemed to have a deep connection to
 

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.540
that seemed to have a deep connection to
circadian rhythmicity and over the first

00:18:59.540 --> 00:18:59.550
circadian rhythmicity and over the first
 

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.040

few years we learned a number of things

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.050
few years we learned a number of things
 

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.160

one of the big biggest surprises we had

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.170
one of the big biggest surprises we had
 

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.320
one of the big biggest surprises we had
was this gene was expressed in many

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.330
was this gene was expressed in many
 

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.020
was this gene was expressed in many
places outside the nervous system and of

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.030
places outside the nervous system and of
 

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.200
places outside the nervous system and of
course we were expecting activity in the

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:12.210
course we were expecting activity in the
 

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.810
course we were expecting activity in the
nervous system since these genes were

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820
nervous system since these genes were
 

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.090
nervous system since these genes were
controlling circadian behavior but we

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.100
controlling circadian behavior but we
 

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.590
controlling circadian behavior but we
were quite surprised to see gene

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600
were quite surprised to see gene
 

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.360
were quite surprised to see gene
expression outside the nervous system

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:20.370
expression outside the nervous system
 

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.940
expression outside the nervous system
and I'll say more about that later

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:21.950
and I'll say more about that later
 

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.740
and I'll say more about that later
another thing that was discovered in the

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:24.750
another thing that was discovered in the
 

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.200
another thing that was discovered in the
course of the next few years of work was

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.210
course of the next few years of work was
 

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.580
course of the next few years of work was
that the gene is expressed with the

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:28.590
that the gene is expressed with the
 

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.320
that the gene is expressed with the
circadian rhythm so it controls

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:30.330
circadian rhythm so it controls
 

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.330
circadian rhythm so it controls
behavioral rhythmicity but there's a

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340
behavioral rhythmicity but there's a
 

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.060
behavioral rhythmicity but there's a
molecular rhythm of its production in

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:35.070
molecular rhythm of its production in
 

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.990
molecular rhythm of its production in
addition so we thought of this in this

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000
addition so we thought of this in this
 

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.150
addition so we thought of this in this
particular experiment we did something

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160
particular experiment we did something
 

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.520
particular experiment we did something
that was a little akin to the original

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:43.530
that was a little akin to the original
 

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.340
that was a little akin to the original
SCN surgical experiments where you

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:46.350
SCN surgical experiments where you
 

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.940
SCN surgical experiments where you
remove an SCM from one organism and

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:48.950
remove an SCM from one organism and

experiment

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:54.970
experiment
 

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.720
experiment
to prove that we had the gene was to

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:57.730
to prove that we had the gene was to
 

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.810
to prove that we had the gene was to
begin with a mutant that had no period

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:00.820
begin with a mutant that had no period
 

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.990
begin with a mutant that had no period
gene and we took a wild-type period gene

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000
gene and we took a wild-type period gene
 

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.409
gene and we took a wild-type period gene
micro injected it into embryos and

00:20:07.409 --> 00:20:07.419
micro injected it into embryos and
 

00:20:07.419 --> 00:20:09.120
micro injected it into embryos and
restored the behavior the rhythmic

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.130
restored the behavior the rhythmic
 

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.840
restored the behavior the rhythmic
behavior of developing embryos from that

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:12.850
behavior of developing embryos from that
 

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.870
behavior of developing embryos from that
transplant that genetic transplantation

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880
transplant that genetic transplantation
 

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.240
transplant that genetic transplantation
so in a sense we took this from

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.250
so in a sense we took this from
 

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.600
so in a sense we took this from
identifying the anatomy others had

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:21.610
identifying the anatomy others had
 

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.490
identifying the anatomy others had
identified the anatomy and now here we

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:23.500
identified the anatomy and now here we
 

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.750
identified the anatomy and now here we
were dealing with a gene that could

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760
were dealing with a gene that could
 

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.350
were dealing with a gene that could
confer rhythmicity or a rhythmicity in

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360
confer rhythmicity or a rhythmicity in
 

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.500
confer rhythmicity or a rhythmicity in
the system so we we realized pretty

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:34.510
the system so we we realized pretty
 

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.870
the system so we we realized pretty
early on that there were intriguing

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880
early on that there were intriguing
 

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.789
early on that there were intriguing
features of this gene but we could never

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799
features of this gene but we could never
 

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:41.760
features of this gene but we could never
really understand how a clock works from

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:41.770
really understand how a clock works from
 

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.940
really understand how a clock works from
just investigating a single gene we also

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:44.950
just investigating a single gene we also
 

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.360
just investigating a single gene we also
knew that Ron Konopka had screened only

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:48.370
knew that Ron Konopka had screened only
 

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.240
knew that Ron Konopka had screened only

of flies to find his first clock mutant
and so we thought well let's just do

00:20:57.299 --> 00:20:57.309
and so we thought well let's just do
 

00:20:57.309 --> 00:20:59.460
and so we thought well let's just do
some more genetic screening so we

00:20:59.460 --> 00:20:59.470
some more genetic screening so we
 

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.940
some more genetic screening so we
weren't as lucky as as Ron in fact two

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:02.950
weren't as lucky as as Ron in fact two
 

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.000
weren't as lucky as as Ron in fact two

we ask what's the middle of the night

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740
we ask what's the middle of the night
 

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.370
we ask what's the middle of the night
what

nighttime sleep they generally fall at
 

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:44.640
nighttime sleep they generally fall at
about 4:00 4:30 at night whereas the

about 4:00 4:30 at night whereas the
 

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:47.490
about 4:00 4:30 at night whereas the

carriers have mid sleep points at about
 

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.520
carriers have mid sleep points at about
6:30 about two and a half hours later so

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:50.530
6:30 about two and a half hours later so
 

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:52.070
6:30 about two and a half hours later so
there's a very clear difference between

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:52.080
there's a very clear difference between
 

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.230
there's a very clear difference between
most of the non carriers and most of the

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240
most of the non carriers and most of the

we also noticed a second phenotype and

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960
we also noticed a second phenotype and
 

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.800
we also noticed a second phenotype and
we just refer to these as fragmented

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:03.810
we just refer to these as fragmented
 

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.360
we just refer to these as fragmented
sleepers or Nappers they identify their

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:06.370
sleepers or Nappers they identify their

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:09.970
first nap of many as their major episode
 

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.930
first nap of many as their major episode
of sleep each evening so this certainly

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:12.940
of sleep each evening so this certainly
 

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:17.000

confirms that carrying this mutation

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.010
confirms that carrying this mutation
 

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:20.880
confirms that carrying this mutation
indicates that dspd is likely to be a

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:20.890
indicates that dspd is likely to be a
 

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.760
indicates that dspd is likely to be a
part of your phenotype so let me just

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:23.770
part of your phenotype so let me just
 

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:27.720
part of your phenotype so let me just
summarize what I've said in studies of a

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:27.730
summarize what I've said in studies of a
 

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.060
summarize what I've said in studies of a
number of unrelated families the

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:30.070

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:34.080
presence of this variant form of cry
predicted the dspd

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.090
predicted the dspd
 

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.930
predicted the dspd
so the penetrance and frequency of this

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:36.940
so the penetrance and frequency of this
 

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.990
so the penetrance and frequency of this
allele suggest that this is a major

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:44.470
the polymorphisms you can make educated
 

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.310

finally we all know that sleep has been
 

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:18.750
finally we all know that sleep has been
associated with a variety of metabolic

in a casual fashion but what we'd really
 

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:26.460
in a casual fashion but what we'd really
like to understand is whether there's a

like to understand is whether there's a
 

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.160
like to understand is whether there's a
causal relationship between disordered

sleep and some of these problems but if

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:31.780
sleep and some of these problems but if

we have large numbers of subjects to

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000
we have large numbers of subjects to
 

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.980
we have large numbers of subjects to
work with and we have different families

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:37.990
work with and we have different families
 

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:40.740
work with and we have different families
all of which share a single genetic

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:40.750
all of which share a single genetic
 

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:43.200
all of which share a single genetic
variation that affects sleep in a

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:43.210
variation that affects sleep in a
 

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:45.420
variation that affects sleep in a
particular fashion we should be able to

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:45.430
particular fashion we should be able to
 

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:47.280
particular fashion we should be able to
test those same families for other

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:47.290
test those same families for other
 

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.850
test those same families for other
aspects of health and determine what

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:50.860
aspects of health and determine what
 

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.850
aspects of health and determine what
other comorbidities might align with

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:53.860
other comorbidities might align with
 

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.730
other comorbidities might align with
disordered sleep so I think the

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.740
disordered sleep so I think the
 

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.930
disordered sleep so I think the

circadian rhythmicity because there

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640
circadian rhythmicity because there
 

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.520
circadian rhythmicity because there
there really are two components of sleep

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:40.530
there really are two components of sleep
 

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:43.130
there really are two components of sleep
there's the regulation of sleep timing

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140
there's the regulation of sleep timing
 

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.440
there's the regulation of sleep timing
which is a circadian question but

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:45.450
which is a circadian question but
 

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.329
which is a circadian question but
there's also the regulation of sleep

01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339
there's also the regulation of sleep
 

01:02:47.339 --> 01:02:51.280
there's also the regulation of sleep
duration there's a sleep homie

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:51.290

we've been working to isolate mutants

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:57.270
we've been working to isolate mutants
 

01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:00.890
we've been working to isolate mutants
using fruit flies again Drosophila to to

try to isolate mutations that change the
 

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.099
try to isolate mutations that change the
duration of sleep in the animal and so

01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:07.109
duration of sleep in the animal and so
 

01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:10.760

that we wanted to take this approach is

01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299
that we wanted to take this approach is
 

01:03:51.299 --> 01:03:52.970
that we wanted to take this approach is
because we don't know what sleep is for

01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980
because we don't know what sleep is for
 

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.860
because we don't know what sleep is for
there's been much speculation

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:55.870
there's been much speculation
 

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:58.530
there's been much speculation
and I won't repeat the the nature of the

the many hypotheses about the role of
 

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:06.360
the many hypotheses about the role of

what sleep is for in a very unbiased

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:32.230
what sleep is for in a very unbiased
 

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:34.530
what sleep is for in a very unbiased
fashion and one of the things that we

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:34.540
fashion and one of the things that we
 

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.500
fashion and one of the things that we
found is that there is one aspect of

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:37.510
found is that there is one aspect of
 

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.360
found is that there is one aspect of
uniformity and that is all of these

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:39.370
uniformity and that is all of these
 

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:42.720

mutants that shorten sleep similar short
 

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:47.370
mutants that shorten sleep similar short
similarly shortened lifespan so a loss

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:47.380
similarly shortened lifespan so a loss
 

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:51.630
similarly shortened lifespan so a loss
of 30 to 35 percent of sleep duration in

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640
of 30 to 35 percent of sleep duration in
 

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.760
of 30 to 35 percent of sleep duration in
a fly will produce about a 50% reduction

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:53.770
a fly will produce about a 50% reduction
 

01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:56.460
a fly will produce about a 50% reduction
in lifespan and that's routine across

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:56.470
in lifespan and that's routine across
 

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:58.650

the different genes so already we know

01:04:58.650 --> 01:04:58.660
the different genes so already we know
 

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.590
the different genes so already we know
that the animals are sicker and what

that the animals are sicker and what
 

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.240
that the animals are sicker and what
we're trying to understand now is why

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:03.250
we're trying to understand now is why
 

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.860
we're trying to understand now is why
are they sick or why are their they

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:04.870
are they sick or why are their they
 

01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:08.100
are they sick or why are their they
dying is there or is it a multitude of

dying is there or is it a multitude of
 

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:11.130
dying is there or is it a multitude of
problems or is there a centrality and

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:11.140
problems or is there a centrality and
 

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.800
problems or is there a centrality and
and we don't know yet but it does

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:13.810
and we don't know yet but it does
 

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.680
and we don't know yet but it does
suggest that we should all pay attention

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:15.690
suggest that we should all pay attention
 

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.360
suggest that we should all pay attention
not only did the timing asleep but to

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:18.370
not only did the timing asleep but to
 

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:22.260
not only did the timing asleep but to

experiments was to isolate tissues

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:56.670
experiments was to isolate tissues
 

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:59.250
experiments was to isolate tissues
isolate tissues at the same time of day

01:05:59.250 --> 01:05:59.260
isolate tissues at the same time of day
 

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.350
isolate tissues at the same time of day

those different environmental paradigms
 

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.749
those different environmental paradigms
so the same animal you're testing the

01:06:11.749 --> 01:06:11.759
so the same animal you're testing the
 

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:13.819
so the same animal you're testing the
molecular at this site you isolate cells

01:06:13.819 --> 01:06:13.829
molecular at this site you isolate cells
 

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:15.859
molecular at this site you isolate cells
from the liver you isolate cells from

01:06:15.859 --> 01:06:15.869
from the liver you isolate cells from
 

01:06:15.869 --> 01:06:17.809
from the liver you isolate cells from
the brain you isolate cells from the

01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819
the brain you isolate cells from the
 

01:06:17.819 --> 01:06:22.210
the brain you isolate cells from the
skeletal muscle from the lung you you

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:22.220
skeletal muscle from the lung you you
 

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.299
skeletal muscle from the lung you you
can then so you you you have several

01:06:26.299 --> 01:06:26.309
can then so you you you have several
 

01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:28.670
can then so you you you have several
animals that are taking it that where

01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680
animals that are taking it that where
 

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.230
animals that are taking it that where
you're taking tissue samples at

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240
you're taking tissue samples at
 

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.970
you're taking tissue samples at
different times of day and you're

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980
different times of day and you're
 

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:35.900
different times of day and you're
looking and you produce an a a map of

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:35.910
looking and you produce an a a map of
 

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:38.930
looking and you produce an a a map of
the oscillation of the key genes in each

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940
the oscillation of the key genes in each
 

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.059
the oscillation of the key genes in each
of those tissues over the course of the

of those tissues over the course of the
 

01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:43.430
of those tissues over the course of the
24-hour day that way you see what the

01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440
24-hour day that way you see what the
 

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.099
24-hour day that way you see what the
lung is doing you see what the liver is

01:06:46.099 --> 01:06:46.109
lung is doing you see what the liver is
 

01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:47.870
lung is doing you see what the liver is
doing you see what the skin is doing and

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880
doing you see what the skin is doing and
 

01:06:47.880 --> 01:07:03.230
doing you see what the skin is doing and
so forth during a day well so for

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240
so forth during a day well so for
 

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.670
so forth during a day well so for
example the liver has a robust circadian

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680
example the liver has a robust circadian
 

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.700

the another another feature to point out
 

01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:35.359
the another another feature to point out
is that if we make mutations where we

01:07:35.359 --> 01:07:35.369
is that if we make mutations where we
 

01:07:35.369 --> 01:07:37.910
is that if we make mutations where we
block the function of the clock in a

animal will develop diabetes because it
 

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.339
animal will develop diabetes because it
doesn't have a clock in its pancreas if

doesn't have a clock in its pancreas if
 

01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:51.140
doesn't have a clock in its pancreas if
you do the same experiment and eliminate

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:51.150
you do the same experiment and eliminate
 

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:54.559
you do the same experiment and eliminate
the clock function and liver and have

get a metabolic syndrome in that animal
so so we have many different ways of

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:01.470
so so we have many different ways of
 

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:04.400
so so we have many different ways of
looking at the the critical function of

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:04.410
looking at the the critical function of
 

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:05.930
looking at the the critical function of

I think we have more questions but the

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:17.130
I think we have more questions but the
 

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.280
I think we have more questions but the
next time each one have one question

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:19.290
next time each one have one question
 

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:21.920
next time each one have one question
so give more a chance for individuals

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:21.930
so give more a chance for individuals
 

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:28.939
so give more a chance for individuals
okay just one question from the slide

understand what's the difference why why
 

01:08:45.239 --> 01:08:47.860
understand what's the difference why why
it does why has like two different rows

01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:47.870
it does why has like two different rows

well this is just this is just so that

01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839
well this is just this is just so that
 

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:57.050
well this is just this is just so that
you can understand that a particular

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060
you can understand that a particular
 

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.470
you can understand that a particular
allele a variant allele is represented

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480
allele a variant allele is represented
 

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.030
allele a variant allele is represented
at a different frequency in different

at a different frequency in different
 

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.760
at a different frequency in different
populations so for example you may have

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:04.770
populations so for example you may have
 

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:08.840
populations so for example you may have
noticed that East Asians that allele is

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:08.850
noticed that East Asians that allele is
 

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:12.769
noticed that East Asians that allele is
very very rare in Europeans it's it's

01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779
very very rare in Europeans it's it's
 

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.630
very very rare in Europeans it's it's
much more common I think what it

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640
much more common I think what it
 

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.820
much more common I think what it
reflects so it's added information from

collect from paying attention to
 

01:09:18.239 --> 01:09:19.610
collect from paying attention to
different populations because it

01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620
different populations because it
 

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.229
different populations because it
suggests that that mutation arose

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239
suggests that that mutation arose
 

01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:28.579
suggests that that mutation arose
somewhere near Europe and as is high

01:09:28.579 --> 01:09:28.589
somewhere near Europe and as is high
 

01:09:28.589 --> 01:09:31.459
somewhere near Europe and as is high
near the the locus of origin and has

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:31.469
near the the locus of origin and has
 

01:09:31.469 --> 01:09:34.370
near the the locus of origin and has
been carried by migration to other parts

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380
been carried by migration to other parts
 

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.170
been carried by migration to other parts
of the world but it's a it's additional

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:36.180
of the world but it's a it's additional
 

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.979
of the world but it's a it's additional
information about the way genes travel

01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:38.989
information about the way genes travel
 

01:09:38.989 --> 01:09:42.200
information about the way genes travel
from the site of their origin or

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:42.210
from the site of their origin or
 

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:45.410
from the site of their origin or
particular variation 'z travel from the

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420
particular variation 'z travel from the

01:09:47.670 --> 01:10:02.540
site of their origin through other parts
of the world right well I think I think

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:02.550
of the world right well I think I think
 

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.850
of the world right well I think I think
that's because the finns didn't come

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860
that's because the finns didn't come
 

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:09.880
that's because the finns didn't come
from europe they're from farther east

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:09.890
from europe they're from farther east
 

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:13.310
from europe they're from farther east
and so you have you have populations

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320
and so you have you have populations
 

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.990
and so you have you have populations
that have come into too much of europe

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000
that have come into too much of europe
 

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.790
that have come into too much of europe
from from different locations and now

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800
from from different locations and now
 

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.140
from from different locations and now
we're you know with these kinds of

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:21.150
we're you know with these kinds of
 

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.990
we're you know with these kinds of
methods you begin to see this so even

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000
methods you begin to see this so even
 

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.720
methods you begin to see this so even
though you don't have a written history

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:25.730
though you don't have a written history
 

01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:29.009
though you don't have a written history
to tell you this you can see it from

01:10:29.009 --> 01:10:29.019
to tell you this you can see it from
 

01:10:29.019 --> 01:10:32.100
to tell you this you can see it from
from the from the genetics it's left

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:32.110
from the from the genetics it's left
 

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:39.659
from the from the genetics it's left
behind so since you mentioned about

01:10:39.659 --> 01:10:39.669
behind so since you mentioned about
 

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:42.359
behind so since you mentioned about
there's kind of sleep disorder that is

01:10:42.359 --> 01:10:42.369
there's kind of sleep disorder that is
 

01:10:42.369 --> 01:10:44.939
there's kind of sleep disorder that is
the shorten not the sleep duration so I

01:10:44.939 --> 01:10:44.949
the shorten not the sleep duration so I
 

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:49.500
the shorten not the sleep duration so I
wonder this dspd mmm because from the

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:49.510
wonder this dspd mmm because from the
 

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:51.959
wonder this dspd mmm because from the
actogram and I didn't notice that have a

01:10:51.959 --> 01:10:51.969
actogram and I didn't notice that have a
 

01:10:51.969 --> 01:10:54.779
actogram and I didn't notice that have a
shortened the sleep duration so whether

01:10:54.779 --> 01:10:54.789
shortened the sleep duration so whether
 

01:10:54.789 --> 01:10:57.569
shortened the sleep duration so whether
this is a for what a reason it is called

01:10:57.569 --> 01:10:57.579
this is a for what a reason it is called
 

01:10:57.579 --> 01:11:00.149
this is a for what a reason it is called
a sleep disorder for this dspd phenotype

01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159
a sleep disorder for this dspd phenotype
 

01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:02.699
a sleep disorder for this dspd phenotype
so this is the first question and second

01:11:02.699 --> 01:11:02.709
so this is the first question and second
 

01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:06.839
so this is the first question and second
one is in this a human gene mutation

01:11:06.839 --> 01:11:06.849
one is in this a human gene mutation
 

01:11:06.849 --> 01:11:10.379
one is in this a human gene mutation
that are related to the dspd so we know

01:11:10.379 --> 01:11:10.389
that are related to the dspd so we know
 

01:11:10.389 --> 01:11:12.989
that are related to the dspd so we know
that circadian rhythm and sleep-wake

01:11:12.989 --> 01:11:12.999
that circadian rhythm and sleep-wake
 

01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:15.870
that circadian rhythm and sleep-wake
cycle are covered so whether this

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:15.880
cycle are covered so whether this
 

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.600
cycle are covered so whether this
phenotype is due to the lensing of the

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:18.610
phenotype is due to the lensing of the
 

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:22.620
phenotype is due to the lensing of the
period or due to the effect on the

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:22.630
period or due to the effect on the
 

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:30.899
period or due to the effect on the
sleep/wake cycle so this is so I'll deal

01:11:30.899 --> 01:11:30.909
sleep/wake cycle so this is so I'll deal
 

01:11:30.909 --> 01:11:33.270
sleep/wake cycle so this is so I'll deal
with a second question first which is

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280
with a second question first which is
 

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.250
with a second question first which is
you know we clearly have a mutation in a

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:35.260
you know we clearly have a mutation in a
 

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.020
you know we clearly have a mutation in a
gene that we understand has a role in

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:37.030
gene that we understand has a role in
 

01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:41.879
gene that we understand has a role in
producing the circadian clock and the

01:11:41.879 --> 01:11:41.889
producing the circadian clock and the
 

01:11:41.889 --> 01:11:45.540
producing the circadian clock and the
nature of that mutation from our cell

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:45.550
nature of that mutation from our cell
 

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:48.270
nature of that mutation from our cell
cell to cell transplant of the gene

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280
cell to cell transplant of the gene
 

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.330
cell to cell transplant of the gene
shows us that that gene will change the

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:51.340
shows us that that gene will change the
 

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.239
shows us that that gene will change the
period of that molecular cycle and

01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:54.249
period of that molecular cycle and
 

01:11:54.249 --> 01:11:56.310
period of that molecular cycle and
therefore the rhythmicity of all the

01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320
therefore the rhythmicity of all the
 

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.709
therefore the rhythmicity of all the
gene expression that goes on in cells

01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719
gene expression that goes on in cells

there's a fairly simple quantitative

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960
there's a fairly simple quantitative
 

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.770
there's a fairly simple quantitative
relationship which is that for every

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:50.780
relationship which is that for every
 

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.400
relationship which is that for every
hour change in period you get about a

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:54.410
hour change in period you get about a
 

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:56.860
hour change in period you get about a
five hour change in phase whether it's

01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:56.870
five hour change in phase whether it's
 

01:12:56.870 --> 01:13:02.410
five hour change in phase whether it's
an advance or a sleep delay so so it's

01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:02.420
an advance or a sleep delay so so it's
 

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.760
an advance or a sleep delay so so it's
quite it's quite consistent with with

what's known in Prior human data to
 

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:10.960
what's known in Prior human data to
think that a half an hour change in

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:10.970
think that a half an hour change in
 

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:15.250
think that a half an hour change in
period will produce a sleep-wake cycle

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:15.260
period will produce a sleep-wake cycle
 

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:20.610
period will produce a sleep-wake cycle
change of of two and a half hours so the

01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:20.620
change of of two and a half hours so the
 

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.170
change of of two and a half hours so the
we would tend to think that this is a

01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:23.180
we would tend to think that this is a
 

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:25.300
we would tend to think that this is a
circadian change that you're driving the

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:25.310
circadian change that you're driving the
 

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:28.150
circadian change that you're driving the
pattern of sleep-wake cycle rather than

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:28.160
pattern of sleep-wake cycle rather than
 

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.490
pattern of sleep-wake cycle rather than
vice-versa because we found the variant

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:30.500
vice-versa because we found the variant
 

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.340
vice-versa because we found the variant
I think the another question was why do

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:33.350
I think the another question was why do
 

01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:38.260
I think the another question was why do
we call this a sleep disorder and there

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:38.270
we call this a sleep disorder and there
 

01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:40.360
we call this a sleep disorder and there
are two possible answers to that it

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:40.370
are two possible answers to that it
 

01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:42.130
are two possible answers to that it
should be called a sleep wake disorder

01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:42.140
should be called a sleep wake disorder
 

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.630
should be called a sleep wake disorder
because we're talking about a sleep

01:13:43.630 --> 01:13:43.640
because we're talking about a sleep
 

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:47.260
because we're talking about a sleep

this and
 

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:14.479
this and
gross or not yeah my missing part of

01:15:14.479 --> 01:15:14.489
gross or not yeah my missing part of
 

01:15:14.489 --> 01:15:16.220
gross or not yeah my missing part of
your question so you're asking about the

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:16.230
your question so you're asking about the
 

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:20.600
your question so you're asking about the
clock genes in plants yes so if if you

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:20.610
clock genes in plants yes so if if you
 

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:25.399
clock genes in plants yes so if if you
if you examine the the specific clock

01:15:25.399 --> 01:15:25.409
if you examine the the specific clock
 

01:15:25.409 --> 01:15:27.140
if you examine the the specific clock
genes in plants this has been done for

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:27.150
genes in plants this has been done for

considerable detail you find a mechanism

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420
considerable detail you find a mechanism
 

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.629
considerable detail you find a mechanism
that looks a lot like what are described

01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639
that looks a lot like what are described
 

01:15:35.639 --> 01:15:37.399
that looks a lot like what are described
in animals but there are different

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:37.409
in animals but there are different
 

01:15:37.409 --> 01:15:40.459
in animals but there are different
proteins and different genes the the

01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:40.469
proteins and different genes the the
 

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:42.819
proteins and different genes the the
strategy is much the same where you have

01:15:42.819 --> 01:15:42.829
strategy is much the same where you have
 

01:15:42.829 --> 01:15:45.919
strategy is much the same where you have
activators and inhibitors and and a

01:15:45.919 --> 01:15:45.929
activators and inhibitors and and a
 

01:15:45.929 --> 01:15:48.379
activators and inhibitors and and a
transcription based clock where you're

01:15:48.379 --> 01:15:48.389
transcription based clock where you're
 

01:15:48.389 --> 01:15:50.569
transcription based clock where you're
switching genes on and switching genes

01:15:50.569 --> 01:15:50.579
switching genes on and switching genes
 

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:53.899
switching genes on and switching genes
off with a circadian rhythm but the the

01:15:53.899 --> 01:15:53.909
off with a circadian rhythm but the the
 

01:15:53.909 --> 01:15:56.750
off with a circadian rhythm but the the
specifics of the genes and proteins

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760
specifics of the genes and proteins
 

01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.800
specifics of the genes and proteins
involved they're unrecognizable from the

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:00.810
involved they're unrecognizable from the
 

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.470
involved they're unrecognizable from the
animal kingdom but throughout the animal

01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480
animal kingdom but throughout the animal
 

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.290
animal kingdom but throughout the animal
kingdom you have genes and proteins that

01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300
kingdom you have genes and proteins that
 

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.629
kingdom you have genes and proteins that
look very much the same whether you're

01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639
look very much the same whether you're
 

01:16:08.639 --> 01:16:10.879
look very much the same whether you're
talking about Drosophila so it's one

01:16:10.879 --> 01:16:10.889
talking about Drosophila so it's one
 

01:16:10.889 --> 01:16:12.589
talking about Drosophila so it's one
questions as I mentioned okay alright

01:16:12.589 --> 01:16:12.599
questions as I mentioned okay alright
 

01:16:12.599 --> 01:16:16.149
questions as I mentioned okay alright
you can stop here thank you

01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159
you can stop here thank you
 

01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:20.629
you can stop here thank you
you have one question every gene is the

01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639
you have one question every gene is the
 

01:16:20.639 --> 01:16:25.790
you have one question every gene is the
tissue specific so if the genes which

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800
tissue specific so if the genes which
 

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.510
tissue specific so if the genes which
are related to the sleep disorder then

01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520
are related to the sleep disorder then
 

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.930
are related to the sleep disorder then
they should be the express in all the

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940
they should be the express in all the
 

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.660
they should be the express in all the
tissue are in specific tissues of the

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:35.670
tissue are in specific tissues of the
 

01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:40.939
tissue are in specific tissues of the
body so yeah this is an important point

01:16:40.939 --> 01:16:40.949
body so yeah this is an important point
 

01:16:40.949 --> 01:16:43.700
body so yeah this is an important point
so the clock this this simple molecular

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:43.710
so the clock this this simple molecular
 

01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:47.810
so the clock this this simple molecular
mechanism winds up regulating different

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820
mechanism winds up regulating different
 

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.660
mechanism winds up regulating different
genes in different tissues always with a

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:50.670
genes in different tissues always with a
 

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:52.850
genes in different tissues always with a
circadian rhythm of one sort or another

01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:52.860
circadian rhythm of one sort or another
 

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.760
circadian rhythm of one sort or another
but the targets can be different so for

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:55.770
but the targets can be different so for
 

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:57.770
but the targets can be different so for
example if you're dealing with a

01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780
example if you're dealing with a
 

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:01.640
example if you're dealing with a
a set of targets in a in a cell that

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:01.650
a set of targets in a in a cell that
 

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:05.230
a set of targets in a in a cell that
responds to say glucocorticoid

01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:05.240

glucocorticoid will directly interact

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500
glucocorticoid will directly interact
 

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:11.450
glucocorticoid will directly interact
with cryptochrome and produce cyclicals

01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460

receptor that differ from cells that

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:16.470
receptor that differ from cells that
 

01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:19.220
receptor that differ from cells that
don't have Bucca corticoid receptor and

this happens in almost all the tissues

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:24.930
this happens in almost all the tissues
 

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:27.290
this happens in almost all the tissues
but what you do see is if you isolate a

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:27.300
but what you do see is if you isolate a
 

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.080
but what you do see is if you isolate a
given tissue like liver and compare that

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:30.090

to skin for example you see different

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:32.730
to skin for example you see different
 

01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:36.170
to skin for example you see different
genes that are oscillating in those two

01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:36.180
genes that are oscillating in those two
 

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.320
genes that are oscillating in those two
tissues in both cases you have to have a

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:39.330
tissues in both cases you have to have a
 

01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:42.260
tissues in both cases you have to have a
clock to get those oscillations and in

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:42.270
clock to get those oscillations and in
 

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.170
clock to get those oscillations and in
both cases the oscillation the clocks

01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:45.180
both cases the oscillation the clocks
 

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.690
both cases the oscillation the clocks
look the same so the same clock

01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:47.700
look the same so the same clock
 

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.420
look the same so the same clock
mechanism is somehow able to drive

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:50.430
mechanism is somehow able to drive
 

01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:52.430
mechanism is somehow able to drive
different sets of genes in a cell

01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440
different sets of genes in a cell
 

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.740
different sets of genes in a cell
type-specific fashion so this is a

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:54.750
type-specific fashion so this is a
 

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:56.570
type-specific fashion so this is a

I take the transport the last questions
it's the only privilege I have okay so

it's the only privilege I have okay so
 

01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:10.940
it's the only privilege I have okay so

you dissociate those cells and they

01:18:59.420 --> 01:18:59.430
you dissociate those cells and they

you dissociate those cells and they
become they could become more less and

an animal in the dark for a very long

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260
an animal in the dark for a very long
 

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:16.189
an animal in the dark for a very long
time you'll see a dampening of the

01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199
time you'll see a dampening of the
 

01:19:16.199 --> 01:19:18.169
time you'll see a dampening of the
rhythm in many cases so I think this is

01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179
rhythm in many cases so I think this is
 

01:19:18.179 --> 01:19:21.129
rhythm in many cases so I think this is
a problem of synchrony and the primary

01:19:21.129 --> 01:19:21.139
a problem of synchrony and the primary
 

01:19:21.139 --> 01:19:24.020
a problem of synchrony and the primary
so you have an oscillator that is

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:24.030
so you have an oscillator that is
 

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:26.120
so you have an oscillator that is
running at the level is largely so

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:26.130
running at the level is largely so
 

01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:28.070
running at the level is largely so
autonomous there are signals going

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080

synchronizer are these environmental

01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840
synchronizer are these environmental
 

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.379
synchronizer are these environmental
external signals and again this is a

01:19:39.379 --> 01:19:39.389
external signals and again this is a
 

01:19:39.389 --> 01:19:42.709
external signals and again this is a

01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719
system that is evolved to help us deal
 

01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:45.470
system that is evolved to help us deal
with the outside world and so the the

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.780

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:47.790
system has not really been challenged to
 

01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:50.600

do it for short periods of time and of

01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020
do it for short periods of time and of
 

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.649
do it for short periods of time and of

signals are less and less robust and we

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:03.030
signals are less and less robust and we
 

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:05.870
signals are less and less robust and we
do see problems when we when we do that

01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880
do see problems when we when we do that
 

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:09.560
do see problems when we when we do that
but yeah I think synchrony synchrony is
