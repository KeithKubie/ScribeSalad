00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.910
- [Instructor] We are
told that triangle N'

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.232
is the image of triangle N

00:00:06.232 --> 00:00:08.159
under a dilation.

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.853
So this is N' in this red color,

00:00:10.853 --> 00:00:13.918
and then N is the original
N is in this blue color.

00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:16.936
What is the center of dilation?

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:18.864
And they give us some
choices here, choice A,

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:21.580
B, C, or D as the center of dilation.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.833
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:24.833
on your own.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.266
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.147
One way I like to just first think about,

00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:33.794
well what is the scale factor here?

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:36.090
So in our original N,
we have this side here,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.622
it has a length of two,

00:00:37.622 --> 00:00:40.107
and then once we dilated it by,

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:41.895
and used that scale factor,

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:45.262
the corresponding side
has a length of four.

00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:46.817
So we went from two to four.

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:49.163
So we can figure out our scale factor,

00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:51.580
scale factor is equal to two.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.873
Two times two is equal to four.

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.079
Now what about our center of dilation?

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.331
So one way to think about it is,

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.375
pick two corresponding points.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.999
So let's say we were to pick this point

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.042
and this point.

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.125
So the image,

00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:12.313
the corresponding point on N',

00:01:12.313 --> 00:01:14.751
is going to be the scale factor

00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:17.677
as far away from our center of dilation

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.140
as the original point.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.508
So in this example we know
the scale factor is two,

00:01:21.508 --> 00:01:23.783
so this is going to be twice as far

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:25.688
from our center of dilation

00:01:25.688 --> 00:01:28.520
as the corresponding point.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.890
Well you can immediately see,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.678
and it's going to be
in the same direction,

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:35.184
so actually if you just draw
a line connecting these two,

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:37.808
there's actually only one
choice that sits on that line,

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:40.989
and that is choice D right over here

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:43.428
as being the center of dilation.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:45.262
And you can also verify that notice,

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:48.699
this first point on the original triangle,

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:52.866
its change in x is two and
its change in y is three,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.220
two three, to go from
from point D to point

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.497
to that point.

00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:01.005
And then if you wanna go
to point D to its image,

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.002
well now you gotta go twice as far.

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.603
Your change in x is four,

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:08.389
and your change in y is six.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.643
You could use the Pythagorean Theorem

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:11.222
to calculate this distance

00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:12.963
and then the longer distance,

00:02:12.963 --> 00:02:14.519
but what you see is,

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.979
is that the corresponding
point is now twice as far

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.044
from your center of dilation.

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:22.460
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.432
One, if you connect corresponding points,

00:02:25.432 --> 00:02:27.778
your center of dilation
is going to be on a line

00:02:27.778 --> 00:02:30.285
that connects those two points.

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:33.583
And that the image should
be the scale factor

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:35.626
as far away from the center of dilation,

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:37.344
in this case it should be twice as far

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:39.388
from the center of dilation as the point

00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:41.388
that it is the image of.
