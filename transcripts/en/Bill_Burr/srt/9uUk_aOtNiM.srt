00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:29,470
It's eight 39. All right, so on the
other side, eight 30. You don't,

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,710
let's take those construction rules.

9
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:34,310
You can't hammer a nail
until 7:00 AM I can't yell.

10
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:38,780
I'm just checking in on you until,
uh, after eight 30 in the morning.

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,860
That's the deal that we have. All
right. Um, what's going on? How were,

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,010
how was your, your, um, your in
between Christmas and New Year's?

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,010
Do you guys get the time off?
You know,

14
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,040
I know the kids do kids on break,
you know,

15
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,440
just in time to fucking run into
that chick from high school,

16
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:02,330
you always try to beg, give it a
shot, right? Everybody else did.

17
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,120
You have to go to work on the 26th
and the 27th year right there.

18
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,060
You're right back.
It's the fucking worst.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Everybody should be off.

20
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,170
You shouldn't even be able to
buy food this time of year.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,240
Everything is fucking closed.
Everybody just sit down,

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,430
fucking relax. You know,
take a week for yourselves.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,140
We could this fucking country,
man, we gotta be more like Europe.

24
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,450
I don't know how they do it over there
with their fucking God damn skinny jeans.

25
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,860
You know they fucking legs are skinny
as their arms over there and those tall

26
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,320
people, countries, you know
the Scandinavian countries,

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,620
you know down in the Mediterranean,
these motherfuckers,

28
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:43,580
they get like six weeks vacation a year.
It's fucking incredible.

29
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:46,240
Why don't we do that?
Huh?

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,350
President to be Donald Trump.
You want to make this country great?

31
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,340
You can make this country what?

32
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:56,710
It never fucking had six
weeks of vacation every,

33
00:01:56,711 --> 00:02:01,070
you know fucking ah,
that would be good one.

34
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:05,930
How great would that be?
Every two months you just get a week off,

35
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,300
right? Then you work for seventh lucky
seven. You work for seven fucking weeks.

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,510
Then you get a week off and just sit
there and fucking chill out and start,

37
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:21,890
you know, let all the stress of
your job go fucking start over.

38
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,330
Everybody is off at the same time.
Cops,

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,880
pilots, you know, people who watch
the nuclear fucking facilities,

40
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,810
you just, you know, it's not
good. Not that's going to
happen. Right. What's this?

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,550
The Simpsons? It's fine.
Everybody just chill. Even a war.

42
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,840
That's it. Every fucking
seven weeks. Boom.

43
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,843
Right?

44
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,920
Several weeks you try to kill
each other and then, you know,

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,190
right when it hits the eighth week,
somebody stands up out of that trench.

46
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,850
[inaudible] oh really? I

47
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,390
oh,
Liz.

48
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,930
Oh right. He just fucking
chill up. This is it.

49
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,620
This is basically the deal.
I am mom really trying to,

50
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,690
uh, I think I'm going to
fucking talk to somebody.

51
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:19,860
I got to fucking get my
temper under control because
I don't want to be an angry

52
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:23,070
dad. Uh, I want to break this cycle.

53
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,600
Um, so somebody told me
yesterday, they go, well,

54
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:32,160
why don't you try metta meditation?
And I got the fuck out of here.

55
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:35,130
That works. And the person was like, yeah,

56
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,330
I do it twice a day for 20 minutes.
And uh,

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,960
like I'm going to have the time to do
that when I have a fucking kid. Uh,

58
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,070
twice a day for 20 minutes.
And um,

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,220
he said like, if you just
meditate, shut your brain off,

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,020
your body just starts getting rid
of stress. And I asked him, I said,

61
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:59,630
this has made you less angry.
He said much less angry.

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,890
So I'm going to give that a shot and
I'm going to talk to somebody, you know,

63
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,570
I've been cleaning up all my shit,

64
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:09,470
trying to get rid of a bunch of stuff
and I found this empty notebook and I was

65
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:12,380
like, all right, this is going to be
like my fucking angry journal, you know,

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,210
figure out, oh my God.
Yesterday I got the, you know,

67
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:19,370
the amount of shit that I just,
I just completely,

68
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:22,820
I go from zero to 9,000 fucking degrees.

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,260
Um,
you know,

70
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:30,880
yesterday I pulled up and there was
some guy fucking parked in the top of my

71
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:34,720
driveway cause yet another thing
was fucked up with my house.

72
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,830
They tell you guys the awning
fucking broke. It's just,

73
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:43,180
it just never fucking ends. It just
never this fucking house. It never rents.

74
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,900
I just find myself, I feel like I'm
a running in a giant circle that I'm,

75
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,520
once I get everything fucking
fixed, you know, 360 degrees,

76
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,510
rotisserie fucking, uh, uh,

77
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,970
whatever the fuck rebuild
of this fucking house.

78
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,700
The second I do the last thing,

79
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,480
the first thing I fixed is going to break
and it's just going to start all over

80
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:09,310
again. So, um, anyways, I'm
going to try to do that.

81
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,990
And um,
you know,

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,680
it's fucking hilarious is like when
I actually am calm and I am relaxed,

83
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,880
it actually makes my wife nervous
in a way. Like not like nervous,

84
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,760
like she's afraid I'm going to do
something. She's just like, she's like,

85
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:27,390
are you a everything okay
with you? Uh, what's,

86
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,700
what's going on with you? It's just like
nothing. I'm just quiet and relaxing.

87
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,150
She's this. Yeah. Are you okay.

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,770
So, um, I got to dial
it way the fuck down.

89
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,383
You know,

90
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,420
I think my average energy you ever played
like pickup whatever sport and there's

91
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:54,480
always that person taking it way too
seriously in before the game even starts.

92
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,190
They skate up next to you or are they
stand next a post up or whatever,

93
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,090
you can just feel their fucking
energy and you're just like, Oh God,

94
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,750
not this fucking guy. I hate to
admit it, but I think I'm that guy,

95
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,020
except I'm not playing a sport.
I'm just fucking walking around my house.

96
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,203
MMM.

97
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,390
I Dunno what the fuck it is, but uh,
I have to work on that shit. So, um,

98
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,450
as I've been mentioning, you guys have
been getting rid of a ton of shit.

99
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,113
MMM.

100
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,410
You know, selling stuff, having a
buddy mind sell it on craigslist,

101
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,140
trying to take as little as
I can to goodwill because
I really believe that they

102
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:36,340
just fill that fucking truck up with 90%
of the shit, just throw it in the ocean.

103
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:39,340
So I'm actually trying
to sell it to people. Um,

104
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,300
just the sheer amount of shit that
people bring down to goodwill.

105
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,890
Like people use goodwill,
you know what I mean?

106
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:51,610
Without ever addressing their fucking
consumerism. And I did it too,

107
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:56,200
like how much shit I bought and just
how every time you leave the house,

108
00:06:56,201 --> 00:07:00,640
she come home with something else in a
bag and then it's just in your fucking

109
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:04,390
house. Like when me and Nia first moved
in with two people in a fucking house,

110
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,320
I mean, it was like echo, echo, and
all of a sudden, five years later,

111
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,930
it's fucking filled up. I'm
like, what? What happened?

112
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,700
How did we become these
people? So Woo Woo. So I'm,

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,110
I'm, I'm getting rid of
like all of this clutter.

114
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,310
Uh,
you

115
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,600
know, like I have every fucking laptop
just about that I've ever fucking had.

116
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,080
I've always kept them because I dunno,
like I always hear that, you know,

117
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,040
they end up in junk yards and something
leaks out of him. And I'm like, well,

118
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,970
why don't I just leave it in my fucking
closet? It's not hurting anything.

119
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:40,390
It's just sitting there and then I
got to where there, then I got three,

120
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:41,720
then I got four.
So a,

121
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:46,150
I'm going to try to find a place
that recycles them responsibly. Um,

122
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,030
so anyways, throughout
all of this, people go,

123
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,540
you gotta check out this documentary,
these guys, the minimalists.

124
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,210
And um,
I started to watch it the other night and,

125
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,090
uh, I'm totally on
board. It's what I want.

126
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:02,350
And I'm watching it with the [inaudible].

127
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,830
It's fucking hilarious is I
can feel her getting annoyed.

128
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,760
And I'm like, yeah, you watching this
shit? She goes, yeah. She goes, you know,

129
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:12,880
I don't, you know, I like my stuff,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

130
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:17,650
And I kept poking at it to see what the
deal was. And she was finally just like,

131
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:17,831
yeah,

132
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,040
I just don't give a shit about a bunch
of white people that are all excited that

133
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,150
they're now living with like absolutely
nothing. You know, they, they, you know,

134
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,930
if they fucking fuck did she put it?
She goes,

135
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,840
there's a lot of people live in like
that not out of there wasn't a choice.

136
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,860
Right. And I was like, Oh, Jesus Christ,
we're going to go down that fucking road.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,090
We actually had a great
conversation. I was like, you know,

138
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,260
there's a certain kind of white person
that fucking annoys the shit out of you.

139
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,080
She goes, no, there it's
like, yeah, there is.

140
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:48,100
It's still white person that is not
happy in life. It is trying to, to,

141
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:53,101
to figure out what true
happiness is because the
stereotype of a white person is

142
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:58,020
that they just show in all their
dreams come true. All right.

143
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:01,950
These are just a group of people
that were living away certain way.

144
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,530
It wasn't making them happy.
They tried something new,

145
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,840
it made them happy and they
just want to share it with you.

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,430
And this is why my wife says
shit. She goes, hi. Now that
you put it that way, okay,

147
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,280
fair enough. I was being judgmental
but blah, blah blah. We came,

148
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,800
we came to a good place, but
it was fucking, she went,

149
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,440
I wish you guys could have heard she
went on one of her fucking epic rants.

150
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:23,580
I was dying laughing because I,
I heard the element of truth in it.

151
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,430
But um, I dunno if there is all of
that shit though. There is that,

152
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,270
that fuck it thing.
How every group of people is like defined.

153
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,560
Yeah.

154
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,030
You know, by a negative. And uh,

155
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,390
yeah.

156
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,950
You know, I guess with white
people is that, you know,

157
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:45,951
we have yachts and were raised by
the maid who's not white and uh,

158
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,920
whatever we want we get and then we screw
it up and then our parents come in and

159
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:53,730
save us cause they know the judge,
you know, and that's definitely,

160
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:56,010
that's an option as a white
person, but that's, you know,

161
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,260
you've really slicing off
the top of the ham there.

162
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,570
Anyways. Um, so

163
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,300
yeah,

164
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,120
this is going to be the new me,
you know, let's see how long,

165
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:15,560
who the fuck's kid who, let's see
a long, I can sustain this. Okay.

166
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,710
Because the reality is is
you are who the fuck you are.

167
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,090
And I am a wound up son of a bitch and um,

168
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm going to try to unwind as much as
I can for as long as I can before I go

169
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:34,151
back into that deep groove than I've
worn into how my brain is functioned.

170
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,180
A,
I'm going to try to fucking meditate.

171
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,650
I'm going to get rid of
all of this fucking shit

172
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,150
that I have accumulated.

173
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,973
MMM.

174
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,060
You know,

175
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,230
for years already I've gone to like
comedy events and stuff and they're always

176
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:57,830
giving you like this gift bag
of it's and it's shit shit.

177
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,320
It just, you know, I don't know
what the fuck I have to shit.

178
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:04,670
I don't even know what the fuck it is.

179
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,890
Little things that jelly beans with
the fucking festivals name on it,

180
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,240
some toiletries, some
travel bag shit, you know,

181
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:17,390
all in a little bag that has the logo,
the thing on it. And you're like,

182
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:18,680
I gotta keep this,
you know,

183
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:21,740
part of my scrapbook that I
don't fucking have and I just,

184
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,280
when I started to do is I just say no.
I say no.

185
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:27,770
And then if it gets weird and
they had this vibe of like, Hey,

186
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,350
I'm trying to give you a gift
here and you're turning it down.

187
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:34,730
I kind of feel insulted me a little bit.
Kind of insulted me a little bit here.

188
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,760
I will take the bag and then what I
do is I come home and then I just,

189
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,690
I give it to somebody. Hey, no, I
just did the stay of techie show.

190
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:49,220
You don't want it. Yeah. Take it,
take it, get it the fuck outta here.

191
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,620
And what's funny too is actually not
when you go out and you try and sell your

192
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:57,580
shit, you realize how little fucking
value it has. You know what I mean?

193
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,870
Um, I dunno. And I should tell you when,

194
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,690
as I sell this shit have an element of
guilt and I always think of that movie.

195
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,500
What about Bob? When that therapist's
pass Bob onto Richard Dreyfus,

196
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,620
that's what I feel like I'm doing with
my stuff is I'm selling it to these

197
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,270
people. I'm just looking at
him and say by, and I'm like,

198
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:18,220
you're not gonna fucking use that.
It's your problem now buddy.

199
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,350
Um, so anyways, that's what I've
been, uh, that's what I'm doing.

200
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,240
I got to a,
I have to chill way the fuck out,

201
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,080
um, for the next 18 to 22
years, evidently. And uh,

202
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,530
so I imagine I'll get some tweets.

203
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,800
Don't you think that's going to
hurt your comedy? No, I don't.

204
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,180
I've been fucking up my life
for almost half a century.

205
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,010
I have plenty of drawn and just the
fact of someone being his wound up as me

206
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,550
trying to walk around and act like,
you know,

207
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,380
wearing a sweater and laughing at small
talk is going to do it for me. Right.

208
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:58,330
Right there that there'll
be something in that. Right.

209
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,580
Well maybe you weren't thinking that.

210
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,100
Maybe that's what I'm worried about and
I'm saying that you're saying it so I

211
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:07,900
don't look like I'm on fucking
weak on some level. Um, so anyways.

212
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,100
All right. Jesus Christ's I've
just been fucking babbling.

213
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,380
Like some chick on one of these
fucking shows booked bill.

214
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,570
Maybe you got a little
fucking reality chicken.

215
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:21,280
You ever think that was fucking God
damn cough ever go away. I'm sorry.

216
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:24,670
Let's do that again. You know, I
find it really irritating that I uh,

217
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,380
took some medication for a cough a long
time ago, but a month ago and I haven't,

218
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,250
and not smoking cigars. I am getting
a good night's sleep and I just,

219
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:37,140
for some reason in order
to do this is my wife, uh,

220
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,640
is so pregnant right now that
she doesn't remotely get cold.

221
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,730
So the fucking heat has been
off in the house all day.

222
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,190
I walk around with like a sweatshirt
on. I just looked at, I go,

223
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:54,800
you're not cold at all.
Like my feet are fucking free.

224
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:58,090
Like we literally in the house, it's
like a log cabin. There's like no,

225
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,050
no heat on whatsoever.
Even hear it.

226
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,680
Now I've got around the background
cause she's fucking upstairs. Right. Um,

227
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:07,781
but like,
you know,

228
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,110
I got this old house and they got these
cool fucking old windows and I don't

229
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,060
want to get rid of them because they
don't make them like that anymore.

230
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,560
But the wind just fucking passes through.
Oh,

231
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,320
the wind just goes right through my
fucking house. I swear to Christ.

232
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:21,154
It's unbelievable.

233
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,210
Only thing missing is just like leaves
just blowing by when I'm in the fucking

234
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:28,270
living room. So I'm always
cranking up the fucking hate.

235
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,600
She starts looking like she's under
like 20 blankets. So I have to,

236
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,000
she know what the deal is. As a
guy, you're going to fucking lose.

237
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,420
You fucking lose. Why do I keep
trying to turn on my computer? Like,

238
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,840
like I actually have internet
connections down here. Um, all right,

239
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,870
let's get into the point where
I've got to read some of these. Uh,

240
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,080
some of these fucking reads here.

241
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,240
I've got a doctor's
appointment with my wife today.

242
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,040
Stupid fucking you've got to go to as

243
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,510
a guy and when he be there,
no one's going to fucking, uh,

244
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,620
no one's going to talk to
you at all. But uh, you know,

245
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,850

I haven't been to like the last two.

246

you know,

247
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,640
they just sort of check up things and
like she, she's the only everybody saying,

248
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:13,850
where's your husband?
Where's your husband?

249
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,580
We miss not talking to him when he's here.

250
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,960

00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:38,170
like order a pizza. Then I

00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,080
That's a true story. Um, all right,
where the fuck am I in this podcast?

337
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,270
20 fucking minutes.
And you know something,

338
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,660
some days it doesn't feel like
work in other days it does.

339
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:58,390
This is one of these days.
Um,

340
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,770
what do think Obama's thinking right now?
I always think like this time of year,

341
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,780
this time, like when a president is in
their second term, it's fucking December.

342
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,123
Okay,

343
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,510
you've got another couple of weeks before
the next fucking poor bastard comes in

344
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:16,130
there. You know, and I do meet bastard
cause it's always going to be a,

345
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,950
but it's always going to be a guide.
Ladies always going to be a guy.

346
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,510
All right?
That job is for a man.

347
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,290
There's certain things that men can't
do and there's certain things that women

348
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:33,080
can't do and women can do a bunch of
things, but running the country is,

349
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:35,830
is just not one of those things.

350
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,240
I mean people are gonna just gonna take
that clip and take all the fucking,

351
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,360
you know, I'm just fucking
around of it. Out of there.

352
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,120
Is he saying that women's,
um,

353
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,500
hey, what do you call those? Youtube
fucking stars, those fucking cunts.

354
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:55,980
You know like when like that guy punched
the kangaroo in the face and you want

355
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,010
to see it and you go to click on it.

356
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:02,580
And then this is just
this fucking high energy.

357
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:06,570
20 something Douche with the
Janet Jackson fucking microphone.

358
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,180
Can I take your order?
Please? Go on. Okay guys,

359
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,050
so you don't get to believe it's
okay. See this carrying a root. Okay.

360
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,050
We're all familiar with the kangaroo
and then they cut to some shit about

361
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:20,830
Kangaroos and they just take this
fucking, this fucking clip. It's,

362
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,840
it's like, it's like, dude,
I don't fucking need you.

363
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:27,350
I know what's going to happen to show
me the original clip and these fucking

364
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,180
cunts insert themselves into it.
And then they,

365
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,890
they making like 250 grand, a Goddamn
fucking video of some shit. You know,

366
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,720
they like the DJ's

367
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,133
of Youtube.

368
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,520
Yeah. Way Do, do, do,
do, do, do to do, to,

369
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,010
to do the same fucking thing they're
doing that they fucking remix in this shit

370
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,300
that take another people.

371
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,940
I don't even know what deejaying is.
I have no fucking idea.

372
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,500
I don't even know why I make fun of boy.
Yeah you do bill,

373
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,300
because you got to fuck in a half
hour to fill up here. Um, anyway,

374
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:03,250
so did I mention I was,
I've been trying to do the impossible.

375
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,290
I can't remember if I
already talked about this.

376
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:08,410
I'm trying to watch like every Bruin
game and every Celtic game this year

377
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,720
cause you got to choose you either a
basketball guy or a hockey guy and I been

378
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:17,110
trying to watch the other night I
watched a Bruins game and then a then a

379
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:19,350
fucking Celtic game.
I watched the um,

380
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,580
I don't know if I already talked about
this cause I fucked up the podcast and I

381
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,640
just started again. I don't give a shit.
I watch the Bruins lose four to three,

382
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,040
to the blue jackets and then I watch
the Celtics after that beat the uh,

383
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,420
Memphis Grizzlies. I believe I already
talked about this. I have no idea.

384
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,940
All I know is the fucking
NFL playoffs are coming up.

385
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,780
Does anything repeat anything go by faster

386
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,370
then the fucking
NFL regular season,

387
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,370
you know it goes by faster.
My fucking train of thought.

388
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:56,150
I was talking about
presidents this time of year.

389
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:01,151
You know how fucking site that would
be after eight fucking years of being

390
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:05,660
president. The stress of that,
the fucking stress of that.

391
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,850
All the bodies, all the people that died
because of the decisions that you made,

392
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:13,880
it's fucking inevitable.
Okay. Cause you answer,

393
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,590
you answered to the, the, the
reptilian people at the top.

394
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,990
You know,
and I don't mean shape shifters,

395
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:25,991
I just mean people who do not give a
fuck about anything but themselves and

396
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:33,320
their money and power. That's all they
care about. They don't care who suffers.

397
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,260
They don't give a shit.
They don't believe in God.

398
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,160
They believe that their God or
they believe that God is fucking,

399
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,073
you know,

400
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,150
bestowed them with this
great responsibility to run
the fucking world to try to

401
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:51,800
take over it or whatever.
Right. I always just think like,

402
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,860
as much as Obama doesn't
want to see Trump,

403
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,880
he has to be so fucking site.
You know,

404
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,940
like if I was a bomber right
now, I would just be like, dude,

405
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,790
I'm getting all the
fucking sports packages.

406
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,440
I'll get myself a pair of silk
fucking pajamas, you know,

407
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,140
with sheepskin fucking slippers

408
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,270
and I'm not doing shit. I am not going
to do fine, but they have to do shit.

409
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:20,000
You know why? Because the president
only makes 500 grand and fucking year.

410
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,870
So now what he has to do is now
for the rest of his fucking life,

411
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,620
he has to go out and give these
speeches. Okay. Which is, you know,

412
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,330
to the people that put him in office,

413
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,050
they pay him like six fucking figures
to get out there and tell his fucking

414
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:35,720
jokes and do his little song and dance.
And the reality is,

415
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,140
is that just washing their
fucking bribe money, you know,

416
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:42,020
so he would push through all the shit
that they wanted or as much of it as they

417
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:47,000
could while he was in office. And then
they also get to see like, yet, see,

418
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,230
we own this guy,
you know,

419
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:51,770
is it bringing new lizards into their
fucking dead to me? Like, see this,

420
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,370
we actually have former presidents come
here and do a little song and dance for

421
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:58,190
us. You know why? Because
we own this fucking guy.

422
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,810
We owned them before you even fucking went
in there. We own the fucking next guy.

423
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,550
You know, that's probably why, you know,

424
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,470
as much as the upper 1% probably did not
want to see Donald Trump get in there

425
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,720
because he's this fucking road guy and
all you fucking progressive lefties glow.

426
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,310
I got to say,
shut the fuck up.

427
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,150
They're actually gonna end up love in
that guy because it seems what he wants to

428
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:25,040
do is deregulate everything because
guys at his level of wealth,

429
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,580
this so fucking rich,
they find the government annoying.

430
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,550
I have to answer it. A Ho who's at
the door, the u s government, uh,

431
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,660
these fucking assholes. They
opened the door. What, what,

432
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,250
what now? Oh, you know, just

433
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,840
uh,
you know,

434
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:50,040
kind of appreciated for as the way the
u s government talks to that level of

435
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,510
wealth because they need them to get
into fucking office. Right. You know,

436
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,150
kind of appreciate if a, you know, you
wouldn't build that golf course, uh,

437
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,110
over that homeless shelter and those
native Americans, you know that,

438
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,090
you know what? I don't know. I'll think
about it. I'll think about it. All right.

439
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,670
Just fucking go fuck yourself.

440
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,390
I do what I want.

441
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,800
Yeah.

442
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,420
I'm making money off opiates.
Shut the fuck up.

443
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,330
I don't know. I'm a, I don't know. I don't
know what to tell you, but you know what?

444
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,650
I'm in fucking limbo right
now is where I am. Um,

445
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,480
I haven't been doing stand up. I can't
go out. I can't really leave the house.

446
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,110
I'm afraid to fucking leave
the house because you know, I,

447
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,780
I stay within like a
certain fucking radius.

448
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,730
So if my wife does not have our kid,
uh,

449
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,590
by January 2nd,

450
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,450
I am going to the rose bowl and I am
going to do the unspeakable at there.

451
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:52,120
I am going to be sober as a church mouse.

452
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,750
I won't even smoke a cigar because I have
to let those fucking things go because

453
00:27:57,851 --> 00:28:02,320
I have to get life insurance
and, uh, I don't want to pay the,

454
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,420
I'm a smoker and I don't
want to be a smoker.

455
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,130
You know what I'll fucking smoke like
for a year. That's what I think. Oh,

456
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,350
well I enjoy the fucking shit out
of those. Uh, yeah, dude, I'm,

457
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm getting to that point in my life. I'm
getting my affairs in order. You know?

458
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:19,960
It's actually,
it's,

459
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,540
you know what I've actually found going
through the whole process of getting

460
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:26,650
life insurance and putting together a
trust and a will and all of that Shit,

461
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,680
I've actually found that to be just as
enjoyable is getting rid of all this shit

462
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:36,820
in my life. All the clutter. It's the
same thing like this, you know, as a guy,

463
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:41,821
I think there's something like how we
just don't deal with our mortality and,

464
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,190
uh, so you don't want to think about it,
but I gotta tell you once, you just like,

465
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,610
you think you're like, yeah, okay. And
something happens to me. You get this,

466
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:53,410
you get debt. And I'm fucking out.
Right. And nobody is, you know,

467
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,070
nobody has to worry about anything. And
then they can't be like, you know what,

468
00:28:57,071 --> 00:29:01,600
that son of a bitch, I don't know what he
was doing a swimming with those sharks.

469
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:04,510
But uh, I gotta tell you he'd say
one thing about that guy, you know,

470
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,190
he had his affairs in order.

471
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,670
Yeah.

472
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,920
You got to be that guy. If you have
any sort of wife, children, anything,

473
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:15,650
you got it. You got to get your
fucking affairs in order. And um,

474
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,430
I haven't done it like a lot of my
friends didn't and none of them had their

475
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:24,720
affairs in order and a
number of them died. And uh,

476
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,840
that is just a fucking thing.
I'm telling you right now.

477
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,570
You do not want to put your
fucking family through that.

478
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:33,790
And I'm not going to be that guy,
so hopefully I won't die before. Uh,

479
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,470
I get everything all fucking
straight down here. But that is my,

480
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,010
that's my first thing
I'm going to do in the,

481
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,310
in 2017 I'm going to prepare my affairs.

482
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,340
May Affairs will be in order. Oh God,
this is gonna be so weird. You know,

483
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,490
so weird about getting life insurance
as you then give your partner motive.

484
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,530
You know, my wife doesn't
have fucking life insurance.

485
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,040
She doesn't even think about it. They
don't give a fuck about us. Right.

486
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:06,870
And you know, one, I don't want her
to have life insurance, you know,

487
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,170
because then I got to deal with
the cops. If something came, lol.

488
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,000
Didn't you make fucking six figures when
she fell down that flight of stairs?

489
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,070
I swear to God,
I was by myself.

490
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,790
I was playing drums in a rehearsal space.
You know,

491
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:28,230
I spent so much time alone every day
that I would never have a fucking alibi.

492
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,730
God forbid if something ever
happened. Can Anybody, uh,

493
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,310
can anybody vouch for you
that that's where you were at?

494
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:37,990
And then I would have to go into my head.

495
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,770
Who did I yell at on the way there or
the way back in a fucking car that I get

496
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:47,260
their license plate so I
can call them up and say,

497
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:51,760
do you remember that bald red
bearded asshole who screamed at you?

498
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,270
You know? Yeah. That you
remember that you can,

499
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,840
do you remember what time of day that was?
This is really critical for me.

500
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,680
Um, yeah, it's, it's a very bizarre
thing to go out and uh, it's,

501
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,590
it's, it's uh, makes you feel at
peace and then also, you know,

502
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,110
it makes you, you know, when
your wife, you know, brings
over, you're like some food,

503
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:19,670
you kind of looking at her,
then you're looking at the
food, you know, she gets up,

504
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:20,600
you switch plates.

505
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,660
I think I've watched too many of
those first 48, you know what I mean?

506
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,120
I love those guys to where they,
they fucking,

507
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:37,810
their first two wives die mysteriously
and then someone else fucking Mary's.

508
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,140
It's just like,
this is the fucking thing.

509
00:31:42,141 --> 00:31:46,370
You can marry somebody who
had one person die. Okay.

510
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:51,020
That happens. Unfortunately that
fucking happens. But once they're there,

511
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:55,840
they're at to get the fuck away
from that person. What are the,

512
00:31:55,841 --> 00:32:00,130
what are the fucking odds, you
know, you got married in both,

513
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:04,780
your husband's died, he
married twice. They, I'm a,
I'm a two time widower. We at,

514
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:08,650
well you're not going to be a three time
the fuck away from me. Check please.

515
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,850
Right. Gives that hacky fucking out
to every comedy scene. I'll just,

516
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,670
I'll have what she's having. Um, yeah
you gotta get the fuck out of there.

517
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,390
You know you can only have one spouse die.
And after that,

518
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,230
if I was running shit, if I was one of
the Lizard people and I was running shit,

519
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,480
this would be the rule. Anybody who
had two spouses die and you know,

520
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,340
we can't prove that you fucking did it.

521
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:35,860
You are only allowed to date
other people that had that,

522
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,490
that are already had two people
die. Okay. And then you know,

523
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:41,380
yeah

524
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,920
whoever dies in that who gives a shit
cause then you just got rid of one murder

525
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,730
in psycho and then you just keep having
them date each other and eventually then

526
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:52,570
there's only one and then you stick
that person in a giant like human,

527
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:56,620
like perky cage and like the scary,
it's there's the winter or this.

528
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:57,700
She is right.

529
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,380
All 48 of her husband's died
mysteriously can never prove it.

530
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,110
You know,
take it down and put her on Coney island.

531
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,430
Does that still exist?
That fucking rollercoaster.

532
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,770
You ever go to Coney island goal?
Net one, that fucking rollercoaster.

533
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,420
It's one of the scariest fucking rides
I've ever been on that because it's,

534
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,580
it's like a scary ride.

535
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:22,840
It's because the ride is so fucking old
and there's no padding in this seat.

536
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:24,310
I swear to God,
I got off that ride.

537
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:28,380
I felt like I was in a fucking
three car accident. You know,

538
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,230
my fucking back was killing me.
My shoulder was fucked up.

539
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,463
MMM.

540
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,090
I don't know.
You don't.

541
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,150
I'm probably fucking up my life right now
cause I'm trying to do too many things

542
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:41,840
at once as I always do. I'm going
to meditate. I'm going to do yoga.

543
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,870
I'm going to fucking eh, stop yelling. I'm
gonna, I'm gonna go to therapy and blah,

544
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,760
blah, blah, blah, blah. I think I'm
freaking out because I'm a fucking,

545
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,990
a volatile fucking loony
ticket and I don't want a,

546
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,180
I don't want to be that person.
You know? You know what?

547
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:58,910
I want to be able to be like fucking
Joe Pesci in casino. You know,

548
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,610
minus watching my brother getting
beaten to death in a Cornfield,

549
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,510
like not that part. The part where he's
making pancakes for his kid, you know,

550
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,050
despite the fact he squeezed somebody's
eyeball out in a vice like 20 minutes

551
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:12,830
earlier than he could come home, he could
shut it off. It was very inspirational.

552
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,340
Like, Hey, you want some more syrup?
I, you know, I love you. Right.

553
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,870
Kisses him on the head,
you know, and that's it.

554
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,080
Then he goes out and he fucking
kneecap somebody's, you know,

555
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,980
20 seconds after the bus drives away
with his kid. That's who I want to be.

556
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,120
All right, man. That's it.
That's the podcast. Um,

557
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,770
and I got to admit, you know,
it's been hard for me to watch a,

558
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,150
the Bruins this year, man. So I've
actually been watching more NBA hoop,

559
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:46,210
which I'm really fucking embarrassed to
say because I've always been a hockey

560
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:50,170
guy, but you know, I will
always be occupy, but it's also,

561
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:53,560
I can't ignore watching what Danny
Ainge is doing. It's fucking great.

562
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,660
There's so much fun to watch. Um, so
you know what, let's look up here.

563
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:03,340
Who Do we got next? I don't know who the
Celtics have next, but you guys here,

564
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:07,690
Aaron Kaufman is leaving fucking
gas monkey fast, fast and loud.

565
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,810
It's fucking brutal.
But the way a discovery talked about it,

566
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,270
it sounded like he was going to get
his own show, but it's just like,

567
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:19,830
what the fuck? I don't want to see
that. I want to see this spinoff.

568
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,943
You know

569
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,830
the Vernon Shirley were on happy days.
That was one of the,

570
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,850
one of the best times ever, and then
they got their own show wasn't as good.

571
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,600
It's like when a super group breaks up
and then the lead singer does their thing

572
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,760
and then the other bag gets a new,
since like Van Halen,

573
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,420
David Lee Roth was never better
than when he was in Van Halen.

574
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,740
Van Halen was never better than
when David Lee Roth was there.

575
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,710
You know what I mean? Sammy Hagar
was better when he was by himself.

576
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,290
What are you talking about, Bill? I don't
know. Just fucking talking. Oh, you know,

577
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:54,110
I'm just listening. All right, Bruins.
What do we got next? Duh, Duh, Duh,

578
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,210
Duh, Duh, Duh. To to, ah,
we got a home and all,

579
00:35:57,211 --> 00:36:00,750
I'm against the fucking buffalo sabers.
I never understood that home at home.

580
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:01,820
It's a home and an away.

581
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,350
Who is this fucking Hitler youth
that they got number 55 on defense?

582
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,270
Risto, Laney had, we're
still laden. Jesus Christ.

583
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,000
Tell me his grandfather doesn't
live down in fucking South America.

584
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,820
Ah, let's it all Nazi fucking
hundred joke. All right,
we're going to end on that.

585
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,740
Um, that's the podcast for this week.
Uh, um, just checking in on you.

586
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:32,520
That's all the fuck it was in. If
you guys want to, uh, you know,

587
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,390
keep listening to here.

588
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,820
We're going to play a little fucking
music and you're going to listen to some,

589
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,530
uh, some greatest hits from a podcast
gone by in a time. I can't remember.

590
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,650
All right. Have a great weekend. You
constant. I'll talk to you on Monday.

591
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,283
[inaudible]

592
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,000
Yay.
Go.

593
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,753
[inaudible]

594
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,140
oh,
just

595
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,273
[inaudible].

596
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,810
Um, new year's everybody. Here
we go. Dear Billy, ball drop.

597
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,780
I'm not going to ask you what you're
doing on New Year's cause I already know

598
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,170
you and your Rosebowl crew will be tap
dancing at the Wiltern over there. Uh,

599
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:49,630
I'm going to be there with
a girl. I'm 50% into. Okay,

600
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:53,350
well then that affects what you should
be buying her that night. He goes,

601
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:56,500
she's cool, she's hot and I don't
have any major complaints about her.

602
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,850
I'm also not in love with her and really
can't see anything beyond hooking up.

603
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,290
My plan is to laugh my ass off and see
what happens. All right, if we hook up,

604
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,700
that's great. If not, no big deal, dude.
You're in the zone. You're in the zone.

605
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:12,970
This is some Dimone shit. You don't
care if she comes, stays laser praise.

606
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:16,180
Now you've got the attitude. Um, I don't,

607
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:21,280
I told two friends and they boast,
advised against hooking up with her.

608
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,790
All right, well I don't know your friends
and I don't know what their motive is.

609
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,040
Let's see if you explained this.
Here he goes,

610
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,670
I would never let that decide
whether or not I would.

611
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:34,270
But the interesting thing is that they
both said independent of each other,

612
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,980
that hooking with a girl on

613
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,421
New Year's Eve,
Mike,

614
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:41,380
give her the wrong impression at t and
that she's going to be a leach afterwards.

615
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,610
Oh, that's fucking, that's just
fear mongering. That's bullshit.

616
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,540
What has your finger on is the ball drops.

617
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:53,140
All of a sudden you have a relationship.
I had a good time, had some laughs,

618
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,920
so like you don't want to go
to the farmer's market now.

619
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,820
I don't have something against
farmers markets. Not really.

620
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,080
Well do you want as you where
to go cause you know I don't,

621
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,480
I don't feel like going with you.

622
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:12,481
I don't feel like a spark your fucking
ass off for what being honest I have.

623
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,300
Fuck you there. It's, it's the end of
the relationship. Anyways, he goes,

624
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:21,301
I can't even fathom why New Year's Eve
would be be considered a special occasion

625
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,990
that would lead to her thinking that this
whole topic is ridiculous and I can't

626
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:29,410
even stand to waste time talking about it.
But I wanted to hear your opinion.

627
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,390
I think I just gave it to you. My question
to you is, do you agree with that?

628
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:35,831
And also,

629
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:40,420
do you think there are any days on the
calendar that would make a girl think you

630
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,050
were into her? Oh yeah. If you
took around on Valentine's Day.

631
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,090
Yeah, it's about it. Valentine's Day.

632
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,840
Valentine's Day that that would be
good. What else? What other day?

633
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,920
Saint Patrick's Day?

634
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,293
Yeah.

635
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,540
You know, you sitting there eating
a fucking meat pie next door,

636
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,070
hammered out of your mind with a green
plastic had on hi Vic. He really likes me.

637
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,610
Um,
the key and if I could,

638
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,640
if I could do my single life over again
is I would have been way less fearful to

639
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:18,750
be honest.
You know,

640
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,230
when relationships were starting,
you know,

641
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,530
uh, women are not as psycho is you think,

642
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
I mean, a lot of times when
you say that women are psycho,

643
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,340
it's because you were being
deceptive and uh, yeah.

644
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:40,220
Then they go fucking psycho.
Yeah, they definitely do. But you,

645
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:43,910
a lot of times creative if you just
tell them straight up front when they're

646
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:45,320
like, so what is this?
And just be like, look,

647
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:48,470
I'm not looking to get in a
relationship right now or like, listen,

648
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:51,290
I enjoy your company,
but I'm not feeling like this spark.

649
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,350
Like there's something to that next level.
I just feel like you should know that.

650
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,120
And you'd be surprised at
how well they take that.

651
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,120
You know, they, it's not
that always, you know,

652
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,490
if you say that the second you feel it,
it's usually pretty early on.

653
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,890
So there's no really deep feelings and
that's all people just don't want to get

654
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:16,430
hurt. Okay. Believe me, I heard a
lot of fucking people believe me.

655
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,830
And um, so that's what I
learned. I remember one, um,

656
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,140
Jesus Christ years ago

657
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,860
and I was just a lad living in New York.

658
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,980
I remember I hooked up with this, this
woman, and she was just like, you know,

659
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,240
so what is this? Where's this going? And
I was just like, uh, nowhere. I'm like,

660
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:42,890
fucking 12 was I 35? She was 23. I'm like,

661
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:47,000
I'm like 12 years old. And then you,
you know, by the time you took 30,

662
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,390
I'm going to be like 60.
What do you think it's going is?

663
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:54,080
She actually laughed and I was
just like, you know, she goes,

664
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:55,760
so what are we doing? But they're
just hanging out, having fun.

665
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,950
So whatever crazy thing you want to try,

666
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,310
but you don't want to do it with
your husband, do it with me.

667
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,880
And that was it. And she was
just like, all right, cool.

668
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,670
We had fun for a few weeks
and then that was fucking it.

669
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,260
And nobody got hurt and uh,
you know,

670
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:19,160
lost touch with her and that was it. No
harm, no foul. Had a great fucking time.

671
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,400
So there's no light,
but look,

672
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:26,480
you take them out on Valentine's Day
and you get them a rose and all of that

673
00:42:26,481 --> 00:42:31,210
shit. You start leading them on. So what
you're really talking to, I feel he's,

674
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,040
you're talking to younger
guys like me probably at that,

675
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,700
like meet like how I was, I mean,
how am I trying to say this?

676
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:41,210
You're talking to two guys who
had their age right now. I,

677
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,160
their skill level was what my skill level
was where they don't know how to set

678
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:48,590
it up. So they're sitting
there going, oh, don't do this.

679
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,810
Don't bring them out on this day.
Cause that makes them think this. Um,

680
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,470
oh that says to me is that they don't
know how to communicate what's going on.

681
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,930
So they feel like they,

682
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:02,690
and they're also in that thing where
they feel like they have to fucking throw

683
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:07,410
their jacket over a mud puddle and let
them walk on it in order to get fucked

684
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,920
that night. Which you don't.
You just have to be honest.

685
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,690
Because women enjoy sex too,

686
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,110
and they also enjoy you telling them
what the fucking deal is. All right,

687
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,530
so there you go.
So you don't have anything.

688
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,483
Don't worry about

689
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,533
[inaudible].

690
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,180
[inaudible] Hey, what's going on? It is,

691
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,610
and this is the Monday morning podcast.
Welcome.

692
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,630
Welcome. If you're new to it. I do
one of these every single Monday.

693
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:11,330
I answer questions.
People email me, questions

694
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,150
people send me in there. A
underrated, overrated lists,

695
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,740
things that they feel are underrated,

696
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:23,510
things that they feel are overrated
and a new year's resolution.

697
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,800
That's what we're doing this week,
Huh? That's what we're doing.

698
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,270
This is like the sixth time I've
tried to start doing this podcast.

699
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,110
I don't know what the fuck's going on
with me this week. It's 10 in the morning.

700
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,790
I think I started too early.
I don't know why I started so early.

701
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:46,791
I have the ability to hang up at
this point and I could just erase it,

702
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:50,610
but for some reason I'm just,
I'm plowing through on this one.

703
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,580
Holy Shit. He's had a dog fight, I think
two dogs and fighting. You hear that?

704
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,420
You get that shit.
The fuck is with that dog.

705
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,740
The owner doesn't do shit about it.
Let's see what this dog looks like.

706
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:17,550
Let's describe both people as
they come up the street. Okay.

707
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,210
That's kind of a fat person or
those people who wears that,

708
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:23,970
that you know those hats, like it looks
like you're going to be playing tennis,

709
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,000
but you're not.
She has the one of those hats.

710
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,340
She's got one of those
little fucking terriers,

711
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:34,910
miserable fucking dog and they're
getting into some sort of a,

712
00:45:34,911 --> 00:45:39,480
a little Volkswagen Gulf.
Wow.

713
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,200
That's a picture for
you, Huh? What or the,

714
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,360
where the fuck did those dreams
go off the road? I hate dogs,

715
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:50,160
man. I love him, but I fucking hate him.

716
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,250
I've been talking about how I'm going to
get a bulldog and now I don't know if I

717
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,980
can do it. I think just
as a man, you just,

718
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,740
they just look awesome and then I'm
watching youtube clips of them and they're

719
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,240
just a genetic fucking
mess. They, they, I,

720
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,750
I'm watching these, these youtube
videos, the dog snoring or

721
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,680
I can't deal with that.
That'd be like, you know,

722
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,820
my dad's used to snore like that and I,
I wanted to kill him.

723
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,520
He trying to watch the game and he would
like fall asleep and just start snoring.

724
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,190
And I literally would think about
taking off one of my, you know,

725
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,300
the eighties back when tube socks
were a lot longer. And I was like,

726
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:36,840
I can choke them with
this, you know, and, uh,

727
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:41,580
that's my own dad can have a
fucking dog with sleep apnea,

728
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,510
you know,
bulldogs when they sleep,

729
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:49,890
they sound like they used to
play offensive line in the NFL.

730
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,753
You know what I mean?
You have is

731
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,810
they got to sleep upright in a chair
that's not a fucking dog. It's like a,

732
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,880
it's just a blob. You
know, I got like 18 stairs.

733
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,620
You've got to climb up into my apartment.

734
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,010
Things are going to have a fucking heart
attack. And then what do I gotta do?

735
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:10,380
I gotta give them doggy fucking CPR.

736
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,060
Jesus Christ.
I just love the face.

737
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,960
Is there a fucking dog out
there that has that bulldog face

738
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,050
that can breathe
but can actually exist in an apartment?

739
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:28,830
I really liked boxers, but
they're just too big. I mean,

740
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:30,510
why don't I just live with a pony at that?

741
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,700
Oh God, what a fucking week I
had, man. What a fucking week.

742
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,620
I had just stayed home for the holidays.

743
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:42,310
I had the best and the best time
it was calling everybody up,

744
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:43,870
wishing everybody merry Christmas.

745
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,160
I was in the best fucking
mood because I was home.

746
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,960
You know, I didn't have to fly anywhere.
And I'm telling you people out there,

747
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,850
don't let your parents guilt you any more
into the fact that you have to go home

748
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:01,630
for the holidays. You
don't, you don't visit them,

749
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,790
visit them during different times of the
year when the whole world isn't flying

750
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:10,510
back to the east coast or out the fucking
Wisconsin or wherever the fuck you

751
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:11,740
going.
I'm telling you,

752
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:15,880
you don't have to put yourself through
it and then he can just sit there and

753
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:20,260
watch the news and you see those people
sleeping on the airport floor and you

754
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:25,261
can just laugh your ass off just knowing
that that could have been you and now

755
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:29,140
it isn't. And now someone
else is you and it's not you.

756
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:32,980
And you can laugh at you while not
feeling the pain. That makes sense.

757
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:33,814
I hope it did.

758
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,420
I'll tell you what doesn't make sense
as a fucking New England patriots or 11

759
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:42,150
and five and the San Diego
chargers are eight an eight

760
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:48,640
if fucking eight games better than, than
lions. And they are in the playoffs. Oh,

761
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:53,440
that's sad. Sack fucking organization.
They just can't buy a break. You know,

762
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,101
even though the,

763
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:57,070
they kill the Broncos and then at the
end of the game with Damion Thomas and

764
00:48:57,071 --> 00:49:02,050
still fucking engines themselves,
you know, I don't know.

765
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,880
I don't know where I'm
at with the charges.

766
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:07,060
I hated them a few years ago when they
blew that game and then they started

767
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:11,380
calling the patriots a
classless organization. You
know what I mean? It's like, oh,

768
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,350
really? You guys with your
fucking convicted steroid user?

769
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:17,080
Who does is taunting dance
the entire fucking game.

770
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,110
Then he'd get mad cause
our players taunt him back

771
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,520
in know Jesus Christ and just
fucking babies. You know,

772
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,670
you fucking net poor excuse for
a football stadium. You have, uh,

773
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:32,530
that left over concrete from the
highway that they molded into a stadium

774
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,170
back when Jimmy Carter was in office.
And he just fucking annoy me.

775
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,500
They annoy me and, uh, I don't know. Okay.

776
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:46,320
This is my big sleeper pick for
the, uh, for the NFL. I think, uh,

777
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,760
the Carolina Panthers are going to
surprise people. I like Jake alone.

778
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:53,050
I remember how that guy played in the
Superbowl years ago against the Patriots.

779
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,090
And I think they got enough.

780
00:49:55,810 --> 00:50:00,100
I think they got enough to go
deep into the playoffs. And,

781
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,660
um, I dunno about the giants.
Giants looked great, but
it's just so hard to repeat.

782
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:10,720
Um, I dunno how you guys
doing in Dallas, Huh?

783
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:15,640
Jesus Christ. That was a raping.
That really was no loop either.

784
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,560
That was just fucking, I was done. I was
brutal and it was really brutal. I Dunno.

785
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,200
I Dunno about that Tony Romo. Um, anyway,

786
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,650
let's plow ahead here.
You want to something,

787
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,590
I'm actually in a great mood
despite the fact that this happened,

788
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,230
I went to pink's hot dogs.

789
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,550
Now for those of you who don't live in
Los Angeles and he never been to Los

790
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,540
Angeles, they got this fucking, ah,
they got this hotdog stand, okay.

791
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:46,490
That evidently has the greatest hotdogs
that you'll ever taste in your life.

792
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,750
But every time you drive by there,
there's literally, I mean, I'm not joking.

793
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,430
There's like 80 people in line.

794
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,160
I went there and when I first came out
here the first week and I literally stood

795
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:01,400
in line for like an hour for a hot dog.
So I was like,

796
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:05,270
well that was fucking stupid. I'm never
doing that again. And Lo and behold,

797
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,380
for some reason I went to go pick up my
lovely girlfriend from work and someone

798
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:12,230
at work had mentioned to
her about pink's hot dogs.

799
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,080
So she got a craving and she was like,
oh my God,

800
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,460
can you take me a pig's hotdogs?
I T I don't know if somebody dementia,

801
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:23,570
I just want, you don't want girls get like
that. And it would just look adorable.

802
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,080
And they deliberately act like they're
like a little kid and you just,

803
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,780
you just can't fucking resist it.
So I'm like, all right sweetie,

804
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:31,370
I'll take you over to get you a hot dog.

805
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,760
We pull up in the line is like two and
a half times longer than it usually is.

806
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:42,320
It's literally wrapped all the way around
this fucking tin shack, by the way.

807
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,470
It's a tin shack.
All right?

808
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,500
It's on Labrea in Melrose and I'm
giving you guys some great advice.

809
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:52,640
Don't ever fucking go there. All right?
So I'm like, you know, I just laugh.

810
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:56,000
I'm like, this is ridiculous.
I'm bill. I'm like, you know
what? It's the holidays.

811
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,790
I didn't fly.
I'm not sitting in an airport.

812
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,350
I'll stand in this fucking
line just to continue to,

813
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:05,720
to do the tradition of me standing in
fucking lines that I really don't need to

814
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:08,900
be standing in around Christmas.
So I stand in this fucking line

815
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:11,450
and this is the funny part.

816
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:15,200
We get their right standing in line and
as he's four Asian dudes in front of me

817
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:19,760
and was standing there for 15 minutes,
the line may be moved like six feet.

818
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,430
So finally one of the
agents, dudes, you know,

819
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,760
mumbles something in Cantonese or
whatever the hell he was talking and he

820
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:29,900
fucking walks up to the front of the
line and he comes back. And you know,

821
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,900
I don't know if you know this about me,
but I'm not bilingual.

822
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,460
And I certainly don't speak Chinese,

823
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:38,160
but I know what this kid said and
his hot talk, I thought, don't,

824
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,310
I'll fucking language. He just said,
dude, you gotta be shitting me. Fuck this.

825
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,640
This is just hot dogs. It's not
worth it. That's what he said.

826
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,910
What the honkytonks and his
language and I, I, you know,

827
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:52,820
I told them and they are the
other three Asian dudes laughed,

828
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,910
looked at each other,
nodded and made the smart move.

829
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,470
They got the fuck out of the line.

830
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,880
They got out of the line and
my dumb ass was like, oh great.

831
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,570
I get to move up another
half foot stupid bay. Right.

832
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,720
I stay on them for like another half hour.

833
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,460
We're freezing our ass off to the point.
My girl has to go to the car.

834
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:18,461
She gets to the car and somebody writing
us $145 a ticket because evidently it

835
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:24,791
became a toso after four o'clock so she
starts freaking out because we got to

836
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:31,290
move the car. She's like, forget
it, forget it. Let's just leave.

837
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,120
And at this point I'm stubborn. I'm
like, no, fuck that. I got $145 tickets.

838
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:38,610
Got Damn and I'm at least going to
get a fucking hot dog out of this.

839
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,290
So I had to pull the car into the lot.
I stand there for

840
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:46,500
like another hour and hour and a half.

841
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,500
I'm finally turning the corner to get
to the front of the Tin Shack for a

842
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:57,150
fucking hot dog. I can't feel my
toes. I'm jumping up and down.

843
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,700
I'm doing a little boo
ballistic fucking movement here.

844
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,630
Trying to keep the blood
in the extremities of my
body for fucking hot dog.

845
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,790
I'm already down 145 bucks,

846
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:09,480
but I'm going to see this thing through
and just when I thought it couldn't get

847
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:14,010
any worse, this we're right at the
corner of liberal, real Bria and Melrose.

848
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:19,011
So at every red light people are just
staring at us like we're in an exhibit of

849
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:24,870
fucking idiots looking at us the exact
way they should be looking at us.

850
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:28,470
Like, why would you stand in line for
two hours? It's a fucking hot dog.

851
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,330
You can buy packs of eight of them
at the grocery store. Take them home,

852
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,190
grill them up, and you know you
don't even have to stay on hold.

853
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:42,330
What are you doing? So this lady
basically rolls down the window.

854
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:48,410
It's alternative comedian looking fucking
twat sticks their head out the window

855
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:53,721
and starts dripping with sarcasm goes
you guys standing in line for hot dogs,

856
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,720
right? Just dripping with
sarcasm. There's nothing else.

857
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,780
There's nothing else on that corner that
we could be doing dripping with sarcasm

858
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:10,950
and the fucking democratic demographic
of shitheads that were in the line.

859
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,160
Do not hear the sarcasm and actually
answer her question like she was being

860
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:20,010
serious. This, this one guy's like, yeah.

861
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,510
So then she goes,
are they good?

862
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,460
Just dripping with sarcasm and this other
guy answers the question [inaudible]

863
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,330
nothing on Hassan choose the country.

864
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,100
And at that point I just hung my
head in defeat going, you know what?

865
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:41,970
I fucking deserve this. I really want
to get mad at that girl in the car,

866
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,300
but I can't. I can't.
She's absolutely right.

867
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,500
She's actually trying to help us right
now to let us know how fucking stupid is

868
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:51,330
what we're doing. And I, I just,

869
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:55,770
I just hung my head and I stood in
fucking line and I swear to God,

870
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,740
I ended up getting up there and I'm
looking at the hot dogs and you know what?

871
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,870
I forgot,
they don't even toast the Bun.

872
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,290
They don't even toast the fucking bun and
you just, they just stick it on there.

873
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:10,290
And if you have to cheese, they just
sprinkle some cheese on it. You Chile,

874
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:14,640
they just put Chili on it and then you
go into the shack and there's no heat.

875
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,020
So you still cold

876
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,890
and you eat basically a ballpark frank.

877
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,940
And you stood in line for two hours and
you know, I'm one of these fucking guys,

878
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:29,050
man. It just, I swear to God,
you know, that fool me once,

879
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,620
shame on you fool me
twice, shame on me. I,

880
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:36,310
you literally fool me like nine times
before I finally start picking up on it.

881
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:40,570
And now I finally, I
finally realized it. Okay,

882
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,130
if you come out here to Los Angeles and,
and you know, and you ask people, Hey,

883
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:48,550
what do you do out here?
And somebody suggest to you,
oh, you got to go to pinks.

884
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,090
You got to go to pinks and get a hot dog
man, or the best fucking hot dogs. No,

885
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,380
they say that shit just
slowly draw your right.

886
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,910
Let me maybe going to be a lefty.
Maybe lefthand.

887
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,830
I Dunno what drive back overhand.
Right. Overhand left. Right.

888
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,750
Right into their mouth.
Don't even hit that note.

889
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,210
Just put it right in their fucking mouth
because that's what I'm trying to say.

890
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:14,530
It's overrated. Okay. And those of
you who aren't new to my podcast,

891
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,250
I do underrated. Overrated. That is my
big overrated thing of the fucking week.

892
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,950
Alright. Pink's hot dogs and La
Sucks. A big bag of fucking elk dick.

893
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,080
I've walked into fucking four star
restaurants and they've been like, I go,

894
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:33,100
how long is the wait Deanna innovation
know how long is the way it's going to be?

895
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:36,910
About 45 minutes. And I always look
at the person I'm with and we'd go,

896
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:41,790
you know what? Fuck that. Fuck that. I'm
not doing that. I don't give a shit if,

897
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:45,660
if, if Mario Batali is cooking
the meal, I'm not standing.

898
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,400
I'm not here for 40 I'll go get a slice.
I don't give a shit.

899
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,640
And I stood in line for two hours for
Goddamn hotdog and got a $145 ticket.

900
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,250
Okay. All right, I got that out.
Alright, that's it. You know,

901
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,210
that's been my week and I'm still
actually in a decent mood despite the fact

902
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:07,300
that my 11 and five patriots are
not in the playoffs. All my God,

903
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:10,450
what a week of sports.
And then the Celtics lost to the Lakers,

904
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,100
which was actually a great game.

905
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:16,180
Hopefully foreshadowing
another great NBA finals.

906
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,650
But I gotta tell you something.

907
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,680
I don't think I've ever laughed harder
in my life than watching Pau Gasol,

908
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,980
whatever his fucking name is
that Kenny Loggins looking

909
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,070
Croatian Jackass fucking pump
hitting his fist off his chest.

910
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:37,810
Every time he hit a lay up, what the
fuck was he doing during that game?

911
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,680
I thought he's going to start
singing the theme of the titanic.

912
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,860
It's fucking running down
the court like Celine Dion.

913
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:48,580
Every time he hits the shot,
what the fuck did he really thought?

914
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,060
He proved something, didn't he? Yeah,
I guess you showed us, you know,

915
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,920
you disappeared during the finals and
didn't get a championship ring buoy.

916
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,010
Watch out for Pau Gasol during a
regular season game in December.

917
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,000
You know that that's what's wrong
with sports. You know what I mean?

918
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,160
Act like you've been there.
Okay.

919
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:09,240
Act like you've been there
and when you fucking winter,

920
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,430
regular season game after
choking in the NBA finals,

921
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,800
don't fucking start pounding your chest.

922
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,470
You know when this 50 games left in
the season, what a fucking moron.

923
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,540
But I that he did it,
him and that other guy with the,

924
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:27,800
with the hairdresser haircut, when he
hit that layup and he just starts fucking

925
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,680
pounding his chest, like he
said, Braveheart, you know,

926
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:38,681
like he just ran over a hill with blue
paint on his face and just defeated an

927
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:42,260
army twice the size of his in a lay up,

928
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,820
get back on defense jackass.
Ugh.

929
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,120
I really hope that that pissed the
Celtics off. I know it did. I know it did.

930
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:54,200
And that's only, it's only going to help
us out. That fucking, who is that guy?

931
00:59:54,201 --> 00:59:55,310
That guy with his hair cut.

932
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,880
They're talking about how he
just chose each other would even,

933
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:03,470
we agreed on Christmas. They
totally j hate this joke. Oh yeah,

934
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:06,830
I guess you showed them, you know, green,

935
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:09,560
you know is also a part of nature.
It's a part of Christmas.

936
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:12,380
It doesn't have to mean Celtics,
but if you want to ruin your holiday

937
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:18,860
and wear blue man. Um, but whatever
note, you know, my biggest thing is, uh,

938
01:00:18,861 --> 01:00:22,610
I liked, uh, what's his face there?
Andrew buying a man. That guy is the shit.

939
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:23,061
You know,

940
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:26,990
I didn't see any fucking chest pumping
from him and he could fucking put both of

941
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:30,680
those two other jackasses and fucking
snap him over his knee like a couple of

942
01:00:30,681 --> 01:00:34,910
number two pencils and he wasn't
thumping his chest. He scared me.

943
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:38,050
He had a quiet confidence about him.
Those other guys look like a cup.

944
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,710
You know what they look like.
You have to see,

945
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:43,820
like when the spazz in elementary school
finally decides to fight back, you know,

946
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:47,030
you've been flicking them in the back
of the year for like three periods in a

947
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:50,780
row and he finally decides to
fight and you want to respect him,

948
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:54,380
but you can't cause he's making those
spazz noises as he throws punches like,

949
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:58,190
and he's like half crying.

950
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:03,430
That's what those two jackasses look
like fucking pumping you goddamn fucking

951
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:07,340
just, I really wish I could
remember the titanic song.

952
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:11,480
I'd fucking start singing it now even
though I know I can't sing as I proved a

953
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:16,310
couple of podcasts ago. All right,
let's get into the podcast here. Um,

954
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,620
the new year's resolutions.
Okay.

955
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:22,040
Last week I talked about my new year's
resolution. If you new to my podcast,

956
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,010
my new year's resolution,
um,

957
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:28,820
for next year is I'm not going to
tip when I get bad service. Okay?

958
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,530
And at a, at a, at a restaurant,

959
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:35,330
I've been doing that religiously no
matter what the guilt that I always have,

960
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,360
I have to tip 20% no matter
if you actually drop my
piece of cheesecake on the

961
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:44,900
fucking floor, you know, and spit
on my fork. I still give you 20,

962
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:49,880
20% and I'm not doing it anymore. All
right? If you suck, I'm not tipping you.

963
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:55,250
I can't just like not tip, but you
know, you're not doing your fucking job.

964
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,820
You suck. All right, so here,
that's my new year's resolution.

965
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:01,580
If you give you give me a bad
service, I'm not tipping. Um,

966
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:04,730
that's when I always hate to like
in a like what's like celebrities?

967
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:08,090
Have you noticed that? Like
in like, um, and whatever.

968
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:12,490
Like I'm one of those, like those,
those, those celebrity blog things or,

969
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,760
or page six in New York
there'll be like lagoon.

970
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,610
Ted Danson was at a diner and evidently
his finances aren't looking too good,

971
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,160
is he tipped 4%.
You know,

972
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,820
at no point did they ever think
maybe that the, the service sucked.

973
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,710
Maybe ask for cheese and scrambled
eggs and they didn't give it to him.

974
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:36,060
And then he sent them back and then they
did what they did was took a cold piece

975
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,140
of cheese and just slapped it on top
and just gave it back to him that way.

976
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,440
And maybe he was a little bit miffed
and maybe that's why he didn't tip

977
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:48,420
immediately go, oh, he's
famous and he doesn't tip.
He's achieved. Fuck. You know,

978
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:52,130
cause I'm miserable
with my own life and um,

979
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,670
so I'm going to attack the celebrity.

980
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,210
I Dunno if Ted Danson never
got busted for not tipping,

981
01:02:57,211 --> 01:02:58,710
but you know what the fuck I'm saying.
So anyways,

982
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,330
here's people's New Year's resolutions.
All right. Um, New Year's resolutions.

983
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:07,320
I want to make a conscious effort to
connect with the people around me because

984
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:11,700
human relationships are vital and I've
been too quick to take them for granted

985
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,570
or dismiss them all together.
When I stopped to think about what,

986
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,930
of what I value most of my life,
it's all the memories,

987
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:23,040
good and bad with my friends and families.
That's what makes life worthwhile.

988
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,990
You know what?
That was actually really nice,

989
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:28,110
but because of my choppy
out loud reading skills,

990
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,810
that's why I could never host the 700
club because that fucking big headed

991
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:38,370
jackass could have read that email with
his eyes closed through the last third

992
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:41,640
of it are already getting ready to
be like, praise Jesus. Praise Jesus.

993
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,201
Let me see if I can do that.

994
01:03:43,201 --> 01:03:47,400
Like the guy on the 700 club and this one
here comes from Chattanooga, Tennessee.

995
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,410
Praise God, praise God for Chattanooga,
Tennessee and his new year's resolution.

996
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,970
Is this lowered.

997
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:58,050
I want to make the conscious effort to
connect with the people around me because

998
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:02,310
human relationships, Archie is
so, so vital to me and I lowered,

999
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:07,080
I apologize, I've been too quick to take
them for granted or just dimiss dismiss,

1000
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,540
then fuck,
dismiss them altogether.

1001
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:13,650
And when I stopped to think about
what I value most of my life, Jesus,

1002
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:18,150
it's all the memories, good and bad. Even
when you challenged me, it's still good.

1003
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:21,240
All the memories,
good and bad with my friends and family.

1004
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,210
That's what makes my life worthwhile.
You know?

1005
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:28,380
I think he made a very good point there.
I think a lot of times and laugh,

1006
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:32,490
we do forget things that are most vital
and everybody's talking about getting a

1007
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:37,050
new guitar hero or the latest iPhone.
Those are just gadgets. Paypal,

1008
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:41,100
if you really think about it,
did Jesus have any gadgets? Hey,

1009
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,550
he didn't even have any fucking shoes.
You didn't hear him bitching.

1010
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,940
He was too busy putting
his hands on a leper. Okay?

1011
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,360
So I want you all to put your hands on
the TV screen right now. Pray with me,

1012
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,980
probably of me. Just pray with me right
now. Please. Lower gees class my savior.

1013
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:03,990
Please help me to remember relationships
in my life. They're so, so very vital,

1014
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,800
okay? And how I have a pot to piss
in. And even though the bankers,

1015
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,650
she is still three cores. If $1
trillion, I don't give a fuck.

1016
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,120
I'm just happy because some day when I
die and I'm in the ground and the worms

1017
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:16,440
are eating in my eye sockets,

1018
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,780
I'm going have a couple of wings and I'm
gonna be flying around in the clouds.

1019
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,341
Praise Jesus.

1020
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:25,530
And please seem your contributions
to the 700 club so I can get the,

1021
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,860
the crow's feet taken off my face
cause I spent half the show squinting.

1022
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:35,320
All right. See I can read out
loud. I can read out loud.

1023
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:38,830
I just have to get into praise Jesus. All
right, new year's resolution number two.

1024
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,100
Um,
number two,

1025
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:46,540
I am going to stop dwelling on all the
garbage of the past and look forward to

1026
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:50,430
the garbage of the future.
All right, that's uplifting.

1027
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,170
Um, I really thought I was going
to get more new year's resolutions.

1028
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:59,050
I guess people didn't wait.
I have one other one in there.

1029
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:01,720
I thought I did somebody saying that they
weren't going to do the hacky going to

1030
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:05,740
the gym thing. That's the worst. Oh
look at me. I'm clicking on that.

1031
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:09,040
I'm clicking on the computer again. We
did find out what the clicking noise was.

1032
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:13,450
That was me doing that. I'm going to
stop doing that because it bugs people.

1033
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,490
Although somebody was so miserable,

1034
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:18,940
told me to keep doing it because he
enjoys when I annoyed people. Um,

1035
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,830
last week I talked about going to the
movie milk and saying I really enjoyed it,

1036
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:26,830
but I actually was avoiding the movie
because of all my straight friends kept

1037
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:27,910
saying it's a great movie,

1038
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,630
but I gotta warn you there's a
lot of male kissing in it. And um,

1039
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,820
I was just talking about how,
you know,

1040
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,690
that was something that was actually
pushing me away from that movie.

1041
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:41,170
And I was like, does that make
me homophobic? I don't think so.

1042
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,690
I just think,
you know,

1043
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,230
I don't think it's anything wrong for
another man and another man to lock lips.

1044
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:51,970
I personally just don't want to look at
it and I certainly don't want to pay $10

1045
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:56,590
to see it. Um, so this guy says, ah,
this guy I think put me straight here.

1046
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:57,011
He said,

1047
01:06:57,011 --> 01:07:00,820
I understand that the sight of two men
kissing makes you slightly uncomfortable.

1048
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:05,140
I feel the same way. The reason for
this is that you are heterosexual.

1049
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:06,550
That being said,

1050
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:10,630
I think you may be taking it a bit far
to let it stand in your way of enjoying a

1051
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:13,540
movie. Just because something
is uncomfortable to watch.

1052
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,130
Doesn't mean it ruins the movie.

1053
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:18,700
I find it marginally uncomfortable
to see someone get tortured.

1054
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:23,050
But I'm not going to write off a whole
movie because of that and the porn

1055
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:26,800
analogy. That's actually a
great point because yeah,

1056
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,380
I would never want to get tortured,
but I've seen a bunch of movies where,

1057
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:34,240
you know, guys get tortured and that type
of thing. But uh, but you know something,

1058
01:07:34,241 --> 01:07:36,160
I can actually argue that point because,
you know,

1059
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:39,910
when I watched lethal weapon and
I watch Mel Gibson, you know,

1060
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,670
dislocated his shoulder,
I know that it's not real.

1061
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,660
He's not really dislocating
his is a shoulder.

1062
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,480
But when you go to see milk,
um,

1063
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:53,590
that guy's really kissing
that other guy really,

1064
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:58,270
really kissing that other guy.
All right,

1065
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:01,840
so, but I understand what he's saying.
He is right on a certain, I don't know.

1066
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,620
I don't know. I don't know if
this is the whole fucking Oprah.

1067
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,770
Let's turn guys into a puddle of Mush.

1068
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:13,330
You think John Wayne would go see milk?
You know,

1069
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:16,610
I'm not going to go see another
guy fucking another man. See?

1070
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:23,000
Oh God. That was a terrible impression.
All right, here's the second half of his,

1071
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:26,960
uh, his analogy and the porn
analogy you made while hilarious,

1072
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:29,900
was somewhat inaccurate.
Okay.

1073
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:34,130
Gotta be open to this criticism.
I'm not going to lose my temper. Um,

1074
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,220
he says when I watch
porn, I jack off. However,

1075
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:41,270
I do not check off every time a man
and a woman kisses on screen during a

1076
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:45,890
regular film. In fact, I
usually go boneless. God dammit.

1077
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,270
That's a good point.
Likewise,

1078
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:51,080
I imagine gay men Jack off
while watching gay porn,

1079
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:54,140
but not necessarily in the
middle of Brokeback mountain.

1080
01:08:56,090 --> 01:09:00,080
Um, I'm going to argue with you on
that one. I'm going to argue with,

1081
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,560
don't let me do on that one. I bet. Um,

1082
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,870
I bet a lot of gay guys did jerk off
to that even though I didn't watch that

1083
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:09,350
movie once again because I didn't
want to watch two guys fucking a 10th.

1084
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,630
Um, and not even that, even if it
was a man and a woman fucking intent,

1085
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,010
I wouldn't go see it because it's
basically a chick flick and I really don't

1086
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:23,110
care about watching two people
make a relationship work. Um,

1087
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,260
speaking of which,

1088
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,920
have you guys seen that new movie coming
out with Leonardo Dicaprio and that fat

1089
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:31,700
chick from the titanic?
That's so mean. Um,

1090
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:35,570
that little fullback with the
big head from uh, the titanic.

1091
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:39,260
I'm really being mean during
the holiday season. Um,

1092
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,380
have you seen the thing
like, I guess, you know,

1093
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:46,730
they had two people with dreams and then
they moved out to the suburbs and then

1094
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:50,750
they have a kid and then they just start
yelling at each other about how awful

1095
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:55,550
their life sucks and they have all this
dramatic music and that's another movie

1096
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:57,770
I'm not going to be able
to see because the entire,

1097
01:09:57,771 --> 01:10:00,890
I can't go see it in public because I'm
going to ruin it for the people around

1098
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:05,540
me because the entire time I'm just
going to be yelling at the screen,

1099
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,980
you know, why don't you
just move, sell your house,

1100
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:14,230
go back to the city. It's a free
country. You're able to do that. Hello?

1101
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,010
I mean I'm, what am I going to watch 90
minutes of them yelling at each other.

1102
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,390
I even want Tupperware honey.
Okay.

1103
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:29,180
He wanted an Ottoman,
not me. Feel wanted it

1104
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:33,500
and him fucking punching a
cupboard right near her head.

1105
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:39,940
And I just, you know, move,
get divorced. You know, I,

1106
01:10:39,941 --> 01:10:41,570
I've really learned that about anger is,

1107
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:46,870
is that's when a lot of anger is when
you feel powerless in the situation and

1108
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:47,774
you're not powerless.

1109
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:52,160
You have the intelligence to make the
decision to get out of a bag. I mean,

1110
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:55,340
I know it's not that easy, but
you know, but anyways, you know,

1111
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:57,230
I want to come in that guy
who sent in all that stuff,

1112
01:10:57,231 --> 01:11:01,010
he really made some great
points. Um, you know,

1113
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:05,700
I think you made some good
points, but like, ah, yeah,

1114
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,060
there's a big part of me while I still
feel like I'm right. I mean, I don't know.

1115
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:14,010
Do I want to get comfortable
watching two guys out? We'll go,

1116
01:11:14,011 --> 01:11:18,270
let's see. What am I afraid of? The
obvious. Then I'm going to watch that.

1117
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:22,890
It's going to turn me gay. Stupid.
All right. You know what Mike Flynn,

1118
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:27,090
you're fucking right. Okay. You're right.
You're God that you're absolutely right.

1119
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:31,860
And, uh, you said Ts. Fuck the Bruins.
Well, you can say that all you want to,

1120
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:36,840
they're like fucking 27 five.
All right, which one's your team?

1121
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:42,030
Exactly. Let you sit there
and deal with that. All right.

1122
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:49,230
Um, what do we got next? Movie
reviews. Movie reviews. No,

1123
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:52,290
I did this last week.
Jesus Christ.

1124
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,710
This is why you always see the clicking
sound because I'm not organized.

1125
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,520
Okay, here we go.
Underrated. Overrated. Okay.

1126
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:04,470
I think you guys know not to go to
pink's hot dogs at Labrea and Melrose.

1127
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,410
Do not go there and feel free to make
fun of the people who stand in line at

1128
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:13,290
pink's hot dogs because evidently
we don't understand sarcasm.

1129
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,610
So you know,
do anything you want.

1130
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,280
Stick your head out the window and just
be as sarcastic as you want and they

1131
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:22,800
will just answer your questions.
You know what?

1132
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:26,160
That's the big thing that you should
just drive by and heckle the people at

1133
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:28,350
Pink's hot dogs.
I think I'm going to do that next time,

1134
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,260
which is very hypocritical
because I stood in line last week.

1135
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:36,210
I want to go down there and protest them.
Just have a sign and just be like,

1136
01:12:36,211 --> 01:12:38,850
you know, it's, they're not
that good or it's not worth it.

1137
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:42,750
Or maybe I'll just yell out obvious
shit just to hear people answer it,

1138
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:47,040
aren't you called?
Yeah.

1139
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:53,190
Um, all right. Overweighted
if we go over rated,

1140
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:54,990
this person says this week overrated.

1141
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:59,610
Owen Wilson over 1 billion
in box office. But, but the,

1142
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:03,240
but uh, Jesus Christ, I can't read
out loud. This is actually funny.

1143
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:07,650
Let me go back to the beginning to
restart the comedy momentum. Okay.

1144
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,430
Overrated.
Owen Wilson over 1 billion in box office,

1145
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:14,160
but does this Douche bag
really make anyone laugh?

1146
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,690
This guy makes cute movies like
wedding crashers and Rushmore. Both.

1147
01:13:18,691 --> 01:13:20,340
Cute but not funny.

1148
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:24,960
I will never bust a gut laughing
watching this crooked nose. No talent.

1149
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,690
And why do they always pucker
his lips in every promo shot?

1150
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:33,090
I'll leave that to your imagination.
Wow.

1151
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:37,320
He's going after Owen Wilson didn't that
guy just tried to kill himself a few

1152
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,100
months ago. You know, I think he tried to
kill himself because he, he keeps making,

1153
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:45,990
yeah, he makes these cute little movies.
Remember that you, me and dupree,

1154
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:49,950
I mean that the, the, the fucking
title or that movie alone,

1155
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:55,410
you know it's going to
suck. And you know, he's,

1156
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:58,170
he's got another one of those coming out.
None of those kind of movies.

1157
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:02,760
You mean to pre meet you and Magoo? He
just, he just know they're going to suck.

1158
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:07,230
You're going to Improv and the crew's
going to be laughing cause they're afraid

1159
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,900
not to laugh because you're
famous after each take.

1160
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:13,360
I think he popped his lips so
maybe you don't look at his nose.

1161
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,620
I think that that's what he does.

1162
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:20,110
Or maybe he's like coming to the
realization that he's actually in a movie

1163
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:24,970
called you, me and dupree. It rhymes.

1164
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,520
That'll get them, you know
what? I bet you I, you know,

1165
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,640
I don't even know how to
look up box office numbers.
I bet. I bet it did. Great.

1166
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:34,440
You know, I, this is, I
know what I think why,

1167
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:38,260
like guys like that ended up killing
themselves because I think you've very

1168
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:43,261
subtly get taken off track
in this business and you
forget who you are and why

1169
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:47,110
you ever even gotten this business.

1170
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:52,170
And I actually had that feeling last
night when I was watching one of those,

1171
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:57,310
uh, cooking shows. I basically
watched football all day,

1172
01:14:57,311 --> 01:15:02,311
watch my patriots do what they had
to do and then I want you to fucking

1173
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:04,420
fumbling, bumbling, stumbling jets,

1174
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,280
kill my fucking post season.
Um,

1175
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:14,650
so yeah, I watched eight
hours of football, so at that
point it my girls, so like,

1176
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:15,550
okay,
it's my turn.

1177
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:20,551
So she puts on the cooking network and
I'm watching one of those iron chef shows

1178
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:25,690
and some, some sort of throw down.
I don't know what the fuck it was,

1179
01:15:25,691 --> 01:15:30,430
but I'm watching Bobby flay and a,
you know,

1180
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:36,420
pretty famous Goddamn chef with his
own TV show already and all his own

1181
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:41,560
restaurants. Any standing there
getting judged by these jackasses,

1182
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,280
just regular people going, you
know, I thought the falafel,

1183
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:50,050
the outside was a little too greasy
while the inside was a little too flaky.

1184
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,230
And I'm just sitting there looking at
the expression on his face and he really,

1185
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:57,040
it really comes one of those moments like,
what the fuck am I doing?

1186
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,270
I don't need to do this.

1187
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:02,770
Why did I get into this business I got
in this business because I love to cook.

1188
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:05,260
I like to cook. I like
to make people, you know,

1189
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:08,260
make a little money off the
shit and make people happy.

1190
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:12,790
Just eat my food and shut the
fuck up. Why am I, what am I,

1191
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,510
why am I standing here is
just construction worker.

1192
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:21,630
Is His fucking critiquing my
falafels you don't, it was,

1193
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,473
it was,
uh,

1194
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:27,370
John Starks from the Knicks
was critiquing. Actually,

1195
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:30,280
he liked his flat. I don't know who
the fuck it wants. Some Queen Latifa.

1196
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:33,100
I don't know the fuck it was, but
it was almost feels like, dude,

1197
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,390
you didn't have to go through this
fucking humiliation. You already made it,

1198
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,320
you know, and you're standing
here on TV and that they're,

1199
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,360
they're filming your fucking humiliation.

1200
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:45,700
And I think that that's what
happens to guys like Owen Wilson.

1201
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:49,060
He got into this business.
No one gets in this business to be in me,

1202
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:51,580
you and dupree you want
to make on the waterfront.

1203
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:54,910
You want to be in the next
Godfather, whatever you want,
you want to do that shit.

1204
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,840
But what happens? You've got a mortgage
payment. He got shit you have to do,

1205
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,370
you know, all your relatives and
third cousins know you're famous.

1206
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:07,150
So the very least you got to buy them all
iPods for Christmas. That costs money.

1207
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,580
And next thing you know you're,
yeah, you're in me, you and Magoo.

1208
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:13,370
And that's still only about
he can have on your face,

1209
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:17,660
sort of put puckering up your lips.
Like, it's not like, you know,

1210
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:21,740
do you want to kiss me?
And so like, Ooh, Ooh,

1211
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:25,490
they guess this one's gonna suck. Sorry
about this one guys. I swear to God,

1212
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:29,120
the next one's going to be a
little more artistic, you know,

1213
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,943
and then you look,

1214
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:34,070
somebody asked for an hour and a half
and somehow that ends up in the paper and

1215
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:36,620
they call you the butterscotch stallion.
And the next thing you know,

1216
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:42,120
I don't know. I don't fucking
know. I don't even know what,

1217
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,430
I don't even know what any of
that even meant. But uh, yeah,

1218
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,320
I wouldn't say that.
That guy's overrated.

1219
01:17:48,321 --> 01:17:52,640
I think you know he's a actually is
because this will just keep making money.

1220
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:56,630
I think he's a good actor, but he doesn't
make good movies. All right. Underrated.

1221
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,240
Um, this guy says the
movie, the last dragon,

1222
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,660
anything with two lead
characters named shown enough.

1223
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:07,660
The shogun of Harlem and
Bruce Leroy has my attention,

1224
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:12,260
my ads or admiration. Once again.
What's your, what the fucking guy wrote?

1225
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:13,130
I mean,
you know what I mean?

1226
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:16,070
You guys are going to have to start
getting like leaving me voicemail messages

1227
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:19,340
and then I'll just press play cause I
cannot read out loud to save my life.

1228
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,530
Alright, overrated. Um,

1229
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,790
find my space bitches sending you
invites to join them at clubs,

1230
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:30,950
record release parties or New Year's
events. I'm not really gonna meet them.

1231
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:33,470
And what am I going to say if
I do meet them? Like good boy,

1232
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:37,280
you put my mind space Dan coming.
Oh we you exactly.

1233
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,630
You might as well go stand in line for a
fucking hot dog at pink's. Um, you don't,

1234
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:44,240
half the time it's not even,
it's not even the person you know,

1235
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:50,460
choose usually some fucking fat bald guy
who just takes some random picture of a

1236
01:18:51,051 --> 01:18:54,800
girl with a bikini, you know? All
right, here's another underrated guy.

1237
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,550
I liked this one. Somebody said,
Billy squire is underrated.

1238
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,170
It gets no client. His music gets
no classic rock radio play anymore.

1239
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,950
But tell me that. Don't
say no, doesn't kick ass.

1240
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:13,490
And I don't know.
I don't know about Billy squire squire.

1241
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:17,870
He's kind of like drew Bledsoe. You
know, he sorta has hall of fame numbers,

1242
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:22,010
but he never, he never won a
ring. You know, I don't know.

1243
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,480
Let's, let's see. He further defense and
let's see what else he has to say. Said,

1244
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:30,770
admittedly it's not as in the
same league as back in black. Yes,

1245
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,723
exactly.

1246
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:36,530
But when lonely in the night or the stroke
or mind kind of love or unexpectedly

1247
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:40,370
do get radio airplay,
you blast the car stereo.

1248
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,290
All right. I gotta tell you
something. When the stroke comes on,

1249
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,060
I actually turn it down a little bit.

1250
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,990
I'd have to be in the middle of the
Berkshires somewhere in the middle of

1251
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:54,080
nowhere to actually turn that song.
It just,

1252
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,720
I don't know that song.
Uh,

1253
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:02,600
I think if you're in seventh grade,
that's song holds up, you know,

1254
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:06,150
and in that hand, yeah. Heard

1255
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,670
stroke mi stroke me. I mean,
eat guys, he's a rock star.

1256
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:14,910
He really still just getting the hand
jobs and I don't get it. Um, I bought,

1257
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:18,990
I got to say the drummer and Billy
Squire's band did the best John Bonam

1258
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,700
impersonation I ever heard.

1259
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:23,780
And I actually looked him
up one time on the Internet.

1260
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:26,340
I found out that he actually
passed away. So, uh,

1261
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,710
arrest and peace drummer from Billy
squire. All right, here's his,

1262
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,530
yeah. Isn't that Nice during the
holidays? All right, Bill. No.

1263
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:37,380
What's really underrated. I
like this one. How do she,

1264
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:40,380
someone comes off when they say
they liked the foreign film.

1265
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:44,580
All right,
here's his story.

1266
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:49,350
This guy I work with who likes to try
and sound cultured cause he sees these,

1267
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,310
these uh,

1268
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:55,340
these independent Philly's foreign movies
that won best picture at the Albanian

1269
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:58,050
film festival if some shit like that.

1270
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:01,260
And everyone he talks and
every time he talks up a movie,

1271
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:04,110
it just sounds like a moving
only a douche bag would enjoy.

1272
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,860
But what makes it worse
is what he'll totally is.

1273
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,940
That'll totally dismiss any movie
that sounds that anyone else likes.

1274
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,740
I recently saw the wrestler with Mickey
work and I was telling someone at work

1275
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:17,280
that it was,

1276
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,750
it was pretty good and right
away this douche chimes in going,

1277
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,840
you went to see a movie about wrestling.

1278
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,860
This comment from a guy who watched the
three hour movie about some old man who

1279
01:21:28,861 --> 01:21:33,120
likes to make pottery and he had to
read the whole thing because it was,

1280
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:37,050
the dialogue was in Turkish by
the way. It goes. See Wrestling.

1281
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:41,250
You don't have to like wrestling to
appreciate the story. Exactly. Um,

1282
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:45,450
all right. First of all, just because
it's a foreign film and you have to,

1283
01:21:45,451 --> 01:21:47,730
you know,
read subtitles doesn't mean it's sucks,

1284
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:49,680
but that also doesn't
mean that it's great.

1285
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:53,520
And just because of movies about wrestling
doesn't mean it's sucks because this

1286
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,830
guy is absolutely right.
I saw the wrestler to fuck,

1287
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,690
I think it's a really good
movie and Mickey Workers.
Great. And um, I don't know.

1288
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,140
Go see it back. Come on,
let's make you Brooke.

1289
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:07,890
What did the guy put on 40 pounds
of muscle? Wink, wink. You know,

1290
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:12,660
anybody else out there? Work out. How
much protein do you have to ingest? Wink,

1291
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:16,080
wink to put on 40 pounds of muscle.
But then again,

1292
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,030
those wrestlers put on 40 pounds of muscle
muscle. Wink, wink. So he did the same.

1293
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:25,680
He was method acting. He did what he
had to do to put on 40 pounds of muscle.

1294
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,670
And I looked pretty good in the
tights. They're all right. Uh,

1295
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:32,940
here's a question or the weekend and
I'm going to wrap up this podcast just

1296
01:22:32,941 --> 01:22:33,780
because,
um,

1297
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:37,680
I listened to last week's podcast is I
was fixing some things on my page and I

1298
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:40,950
thought it went along way too long.
I think somewhere

1299
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,420
around a half hours, a good
amount of time. All right.

1300
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,620
[inaudible] question
number one, Bill. As a,

1301
01:22:46,621 --> 01:22:51,621
a former member of planet fitness and
having a moral obligation a few weeks ago,

1302
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:56,540
I had no choice but to quit planets.
Uh,

1303
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,880
what am I doing here is just overrated,
underrated.

1304
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:06,950
See, I, I just, I'm just disorganized.
All right. I started reading it tonight.

1305
01:23:06,951 --> 01:23:10,210
I have to read it. What is this? Planet
fitness disappoints me on several levels.

1306
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:14,560
First off, all their franchises,
branch branches, paint. Most,

1307
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:18,370
if not all the floor equipment.
Uh, gay, purple and yellow color.

1308
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,980
Oh, this is a guy trying to say
that all gyms are gay now. And,

1309
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:27,540
uh, um, is there a question
at the end of this? Okay.

1310
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:31,840
What ever happened to real gyms? Okay.
Yeah. The equipment is painted a gay,

1311
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:35,680
purple and yellow color.
Yeah, just like the Lakers.

1312
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:41,350
Oh to comfort sensitive people that
are intimidated by muscle heads and or

1313
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:44,920
fitness clubs or reality in general.

1314
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:48,220
And that is gay.
I think by gay he means stupid.

1315
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,730
And what is even more gay is the fact
that you're not allowed to have a barbell

1316
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:57,460
on the floor.
That means no dead lifts,

1317
01:23:57,461 --> 01:23:59,590
free standing squats and separate that.

1318
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,370
Doesn't that mean don't leave the bar
there? Cause they don't want to be sued?

1319
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:08,560
I Dunno. And it's not like
when others I work out with,

1320
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:11,140
we are intentionally trying
to intimidate people.

1321
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,660
We're not acting like Hulk Hogan did back
in the day to excite a crowd before a

1322
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:19,900
match. I'm five eight 160
pounds of scared white meat.

1323
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:24,340
I had to quit because I don't want to
be converted anymore into a pussy by

1324
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:27,310
conforming to their lame rules.
I didn't know what the fuck.

1325
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:30,190
You know what half of this is might
me not being able to read out loud

1326
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:35,170
as corporate America's comforting.
Most Mormons in this country,

1327
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:39,820
they are also eradicating conventional
wisdom in American culture to increase

1328
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:41,830
their revenue regardless of repercussion.

1329
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:46,360
La Fitness sucks balls to actually see,
I don't know what,

1330
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:49,020
what am I having to the real
gems. There's this question. Ah,

1331
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:54,030
there are real gyms and you go there
and you lay on the floor to do a fucking

1332
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:57,070
setups. In the next day
you have some sort of rash,

1333
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,070
like you're on the ultimate
fighter and then they have them.

1334
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:03,850
They don't mop down there. Fucking
Matt's enough. I'm number two.

1335
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:06,250
I'm sorry I butchered that whole thing.
I apologize.

1336
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:09,480
I'll send you a refrigerator magnet
or something. All right, Bill. Um,

1337
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:13,360
you occasionally mentioned
having a girlfriend and you
recently went on a hockey

1338
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:16,480
trip. Uh, yeah, I did. I
went on a three day trip.

1339
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:19,030
I went to a home game
of the Calgary flames,

1340
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:23,230
Edmonton Oilers and the Vancouver
Canucks. He, she, he goes,

1341
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:25,030
I assume she did not go along.

1342
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:28,120
What kind of obstacles did you
have to hurdle to avoid a hearing?

1343
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:30,640
A bunch of stupid girl
complaints about that trip.

1344
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:32,560
I didn't have to hurdle any of them.

1345
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:37,590
I have a great relationship because I
fought the battles I needed to fight so

1346
01:25:39,161 --> 01:25:42,790
that when I say I'm going on a
hockey trip, they can't be like,

1347
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:46,680
oh see what does that me,
you don't care about me.

1348
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:50,020
No, that's not what it means.
Is that what it means at all?

1349
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:53,970
It means I like hockey and I want to
go on a trip. That's all it means.

1350
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,460
See you on Monday. Yeah. No,
earlier in my, my dating career,

1351
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:02,190
I used to have to go through shit
like that. But you know, you just,

1352
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,420
you just have to have the
battles and you don't get,

1353
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:10,280
don't scream and yell if you just
say in a very nice way. Listen,

1354
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:14,840
I worked very hard this
year. You know, I've, I've,

1355
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,010
uh, you know, done.

1356
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,210
I'm not going to get until the intimate
details of shit that I've done. Okay.

1357
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:23,120
I've earned the right.
Okay. I'm coming back.

1358
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:27,020
I'm not going to go up there
and fucking bang an Eskimo.

1359
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:31,250
I'm just going up there with, you know,
with some friends to go on a hockey trip.

1360
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,470
There's no problems.
Okay.

1361
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:36,680
Stop making me feel guilty
for doing something fun

1362
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,450
and uh, that pretty much
ends it. In other words,

1363
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:44,660
grow with Dick and your fucking
relationship and a, yeah, don't,

1364
01:26:44,661 --> 01:26:45,560
don't paint yourself.

1365
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:47,930
If you're in a relationship right
now where you're not allowed to go do

1366
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:50,540
something fun with somebody other
than the person you're dating,

1367
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:53,030
you're not in a relationship,
you are actually a hostage.

1368
01:26:53,031 --> 01:26:57,350
And you need to get out of that situation.
You know, make a youtube video, blink,

1369
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:59,420
SOS,
do whatever the fuck you have to do,

1370
01:26:59,421 --> 01:27:03,830
but get out of that relationship because
just get out of it because it's not

1371
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:06,740
going to get better once you've given
up that territory. You know what I mean?

1372
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,710
It's like all these Mexicans you
see protesting about, you know,

1373
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:14,150
getting Texas back. You're not
getting it back. You know, it's over.

1374
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,990
It's fucking done. You know, you
need to pick up a gun to get it back.

1375
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:22,190
So put down your signs cause it's fucking
over. All right. Question number three,

1376
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,980
uh, Bill podcast, quite a
podcast. What's the, okay.

1377
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:29,330
One of my favorite things to do every
month is flipped a flipped to the back of

1378
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:33,800
vanity fair to see if an artist,
I like his answer,

1379
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:38,790
answering the Proust questionnaire.
Um,

1380
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:41,120
whatever the fuck that is.
There are. Okay. Basically,

1381
01:27:41,121 --> 01:27:45,410
there are a slew of questions and I would
love to hear how you would answer all

1382
01:27:45,411 --> 01:27:49,700
of them. But for the purpose of this
email, I will only specifically ask,

1383
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,530
what are your favorite favorite qualities
in a man and what are your favorite

1384
01:27:54,531 --> 01:27:58,580
qualities in a woman? Oh, okay. So this
is obviously a questionnaire where they,

1385
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:02,060
they ask celebrities what
they're looking for in a mate.

1386
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:06,680
What am I favorite qualities in a man?
Um,

1387
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:11,360
he's not a Douche.
Uh,

1388
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:13,040
he adheres to Guy Code,

1389
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:16,880
which I'm not going to tell you what
that is because only men should know what

1390
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:19,280
that is.
Um,

1391
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:23,210
has a strong jaw orders for
me when I go out to dinner,

1392
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:28,070
holds the door, act like a gentleman,
but isn't afraid of my opinions.

1393
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:35,720
Um, yeah, I don't know. What am
I favorite qualities in a man?

1394
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:40,100
Uh, I don't know. He eats
with his mouth closed.

1395
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:45,890
You know, I don't like those fucking a
crow, like fucking half a caveman guys.

1396
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:50,330
You know what I mean? Like those
guys like, uh, like morons.

1397
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:55,040
I don't like hanging around with
dumb people, men or women and uh,

1398
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:57,440
yeah, I, you know,

1399
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:01,410
I like to be hanging out with the guy
who's in a relationship that he's happy to

1400
01:29:01,411 --> 01:29:04,710
be in so I don't have to listen to them
bitch about it or pretend to be happy in

1401
01:29:04,711 --> 01:29:09,060
it. Common sense stuff. And one of
my favorite qualities in a woman, um,

1402
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:13,580
I like a woman who's, who's a neat
one of my biggest turn off of women's,

1403
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:15,730
a women's. I don't, we don't,

1404
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:20,550
I don't like about the women's is when
the bitches be messy. No, seriously.

1405
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:24,810
A woman who's Messi is one of the biggest
turnoffs ever. You know what I mean?

1406
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,890
That's like a guy who can't pick
up something heavy. You know,

1407
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,800
if you're like a woman, you know, like,
oh, can you give me a hand with this?

1408
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:34,500
And he like breaks a nail.
Like when that turn you off,

1409
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:38,670
that's like ground zero of being a man
is you should actually have some sort of

1410
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:41,460
physical strength and what the woman is,

1411
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:45,300
they should know how to keep
the house clean. That's right.

1412
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:48,810
I just said that and I don't
think that is sexist. All right.

1413
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,720
I think that's one of the fucking
great things that a woman does,

1414
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,990
teaches you how not to
live like a fucking animal.

1415
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:58,500
It's one of the things that they're
allegedly naturally good at.

1416
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:03,960
Although I find a lot of women to
be pretty fucking messy and I'm,

1417
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:04,320
yeah,

1418
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:09,210
I'm old school women who can cook
and clean and all that type of stuff,

1419
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:12,540
you know? Um, I'm not saying
that I'm going to walk,

1420
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,320
walk in like a cave man with mud on my
shoes and you should have to sweep up

1421
01:30:16,321 --> 01:30:16,831
behind me,

1422
01:30:16,831 --> 01:30:20,880
but like the same way women still want
guys to know how to be handy around the

1423
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:23,550
house. Yeah. Women who
can cook or the shit.

1424
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,720
Women with a sense of humor woman who
actually are into sports a little bit.

1425
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:32,040
I understand. Most of you
think it's retarded. Yeah.
That type of Shit, you know,

1426
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:37,020
and uh, I don't like
horse. I like classy women.

1427
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:41,190
Women who live around. Yeah.
Classically beautiful. Yeah,

1428
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,280
I dunno that type of shit and see,
know it's none of your fucking business.

1429
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,970
All right.
After that was,

1430
01:30:47,971 --> 01:30:51,780
I just felt bad divulging
all that personal information
and I just felt like I

1431
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:55,410
was opening up too much. I
got a little scared. Okay.

1432
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:59,090
The very least in this podcast question,
you know, you got to listen to,

1433
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:03,560
to doing there. My impression of the 700
club. All right, question number four. Um,

1434
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,110
do you believe in God? If so,
how can you be so fucking stupid?

1435
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:11,760
Um, you know, I actually
understand what you're saying that,

1436
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:13,800
but I definitely do
believe in a higher power,

1437
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:17,280
but I don't believe in it within
the context of organized religion.

1438
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:22,980
Um, if that makes any sense. I definitely
believe in a higher power, something,

1439
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:27,330
whatever it is. Like, I mean,

1440
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:32,250
how the fuck did all this stuff get made?
But it's just so crazy.

1441
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,520
I think that there's this big
thing that that made all of it in.

1442
01:31:36,521 --> 01:31:38,520
Where was he when he made it or

1443
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,240
did he have to be in something
that had to be created?

1444
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,620
I don't know what the fuck's going on,

1445
01:31:43,621 --> 01:31:46,200
but I know the answers are
not in organized religion.

1446
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:49,920
That is just basically
an updated version of,

1447
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:54,420
of cavemen paintings on the
walls. And uh, you know,

1448
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,690
when people get really religious,
super, super religious,

1449
01:31:57,691 --> 01:32:01,240
they somehow get really angry and
they get violent and it leads towards,

1450
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:04,960
and uh, yeah, I don't believe in
it, but I definitely, you know,

1451
01:32:04,961 --> 01:32:06,520
when I contemplate my own death,

1452
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:10,390
I do get scared that I'm not a member
of any organized religion, you know,

1453
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,680
so, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I, you know,

1454
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,210
I don't fucking know. I, I
believe in a higher power,

1455
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:22,990
but I don't believe in it within organized
religion. Okay. The final question,

1456
01:32:22,991 --> 01:32:24,570
here we go. Number five, Bill,

1457
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,870
is there any way to listen to on
the uninformed show you do on Xm?

1458
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:32,680
I don't have an, an,
an an XM subscription,

1459
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:36,610
but I did enjoy the live version you did
on opie and Anthony a couple of weeks

1460
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:39,610
back while the one we did on opie.
And Anthony was on Xm, wasn't it?

1461
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,840
Um, no, there's no way to
listen to it without that.

1462
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:48,670
And we don't have the
money in the budget to, uh,

1463
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,800
I dunno.
I Dunno what we have to do with that.

1464
01:32:50,801 --> 01:32:53,740
That's something that's one of my New
Year's resolutions to somehow get it up on

1465
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:55,690
the Internet.
For those of you new to the podcast,

1466
01:32:55,691 --> 01:32:59,140
I do this radio show on informed.
It's on Xm. I do it with Joe de Rosa.

1467
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:01,660
We do a once a month or lately,

1468
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:05,050
once every other month because shit
has been fucking weird. But anyways,

1469
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,660
that is the end of the podcast.
Um,

1470
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,050
I appreciate you guys all this year.
You know,

1471
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,520
I just want to say thanks to everybody
for everybody sending in your questions

1472
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:16,600
and uh,
you know,

1473
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:20,620
your contributions to the podcasts are
the reasons why that it's now 50 minutes

1474
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:22,810
long as opposed to the back in the day.

1475
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:26,080
Remember back in the day when I used to
do it in a one room shack and I could

1476
01:33:26,081 --> 01:33:29,710
only talk for eight minutes and then
I'd have to hang up. Well thanks to you.

1477
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:33,340
It works for all of us to build burn
Monday morning podcast. All right,

1478
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:37,360
you guys have a very happy new year
and um, oh, there's one for you.

1479
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:42,170
That's what I think is fucking
overrated is new years. It's,

1480
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,380
it's,
it's the dumbest fucking thing ever.

1481
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:48,430
I'm actually going to walk out and make
a peanut butter sandwich while I talk

1482
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:52,630
about how overrated fucking new
years is this. This is bonus time.

1483
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:53,860
You guys didn't have to listen to this.

1484
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,230
This is like after the
game when you know who won

1485
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,000
and you're listening to the postgame
analysis and there's really no reason to

1486
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:01,834
fucking do that.

1487
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,800
This is what this part of the podcast
is seen on obligated to listen to any of

1488
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:10,720
that as I make a fucking peanut
butter sandwich. MMM. Look at that.

1489
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:15,130
Does the parking tickets from a tank
sweat on my refrigerator? Just mocking me.

1490
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:20,440
Huh? Mocking me and the awful
fucking hot dog that I done. Yeah.

1491
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,370
You don't need to go out on new
years. You know, I've actually been,

1492
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,090
cause I'm finally taking new years off.
I'm looking at all these regular bars,

1493
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:29,441
you know,

1494
01:34:29,441 --> 01:34:32,620
of course my girl wants to go someplace
fancy so she has a place to where her

1495
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:34,990
new year's dress,
which I totally understand,

1496
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:38,740
but now all of these regular bars that
have like a fucking $10 cover charge,

1497
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,450
it's all 40 bucks,

1498
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:45,810
50 75 some places are leaving
even like 150 bucks to do what?

1499
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,270
Go out and drink,

1500
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:53,350
which you can do at home for free and
now he's standing next to fucking day was

1501
01:34:53,351 --> 01:34:57,000
jam packed. It's hot.
People with plastic hats,

1502
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,500
those stupid fucking horns
blowing it in your ear.

1503
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:02,090
That's how you really want
to bring in the new year,

1504
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:07,820
getting completely overcharged for some
shit to stand with a bunch of other

1505
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:11,940
douche bags. Three, two, one,

1506
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:16,950
you know that's all overrated and all
you fucking scared whores out there whose

1507
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:18,950
dads didn't stick around.

1508
01:35:18,951 --> 01:35:23,420
So you have low self esteem and you
drink too much and then you go into that

1509
01:35:23,421 --> 01:35:28,160
panic way like, oh my God, I, it's
new year's. I need someone to kiss.

1510
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:33,980
I have to have someone to kiss. You
don't, don't give into peer pressure.

1511
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,780
You know,
sweetheart,

1512
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:39,560
if you want to wonder why you always end
up in the bathroom on your knees in the

1513
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:44,120
stall. It's because you given to herd
mentality. You don't have to do that.

1514
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:49,640
You don't, you don't need somebody to
kiss, but you need to do is contemplate,

1515
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:50,600
you know,

1516
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,040
the fact that you don't have someone to
kiss and that that's okay and that you

1517
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:58,940
should hold out for someone who's going
to treat you good rather than drag you

1518
01:35:58,941 --> 01:36:03,941
in it into the fucking bathroom
at 1201 to make you fucking,

1519
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,113
you know,

1520
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:10,300
so you can suck your first deck of 2009
2000 oh nine 2009 you know what I mean?

1521
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,220
I don't know.
You don't actually put jelly on it.

1522
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,750
I've been trying to just do the protein,

1523
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,750
but I had to put jelly on a
sandwich because you know,

1524
01:36:20,751 --> 01:36:23,320
you try to eat a peanut
butter sandwich and you know,

1525
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:26,180
you dislocate your job by the time
you'd done shoe and all of it.

1526
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:28,190
It's just a fucking pain in the ass.
So anyways,

1527
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,170
thanks for listening to the podcast.
Everybody.

1528
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:33,530
Please keep the questions coming and
it's not too late to send in your New

1529
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,940
Year's resolutions.
And you know what?

1530
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,610
I liked that a lot of people didn't
send any new year's resolutions.

1531
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,210
You didn't follow the
fucking pack and make one.

1532
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:45,620
You could make one anytime of
the year. And uh, that's it.

1533
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:48,750
I'm in my little breasts, breakfast
Nook, and the sun is shining it

1534
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,840
then I feel special.
Talk to you next week.
