00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.005
SPEAKER: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.260
It's my pleasure to introduce
our next speaker in the series

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.086
of Talks at Google.

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:18.580
So several months ago,
I had the opportunity

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.840
to go on a volunteer
trip to Uganda

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.370
with eight ladies, most of
whom I hadn't met before.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.072
But one of those
ladies stood out

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:30.535
because of her professional
background and the fact

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:34.210
that she was an athlete, but
also because she just brought

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.830
a lot of energy to the group.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.192
RAHA MOHARRAK: And
the the big hair.

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:39.900
SPEAKER: Brought a
lot of energy, brought

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.760
a lot of excitement, and
also really very passionate

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.110
in working with the
children in Uganda.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.730
So that person is Raha Moharrak.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.182
She's most known for
her athletic feats.

00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:56.313
She's the first female
Saudi to climb Mt.

00:00:56.313 --> 00:00:57.260
Everest.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.200
And she's also the youngest
Arab to climb the seven summits.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.523
And we're super thrilled
to have her here today

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:04.890
and to hear her story.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.789
It's very inspirational,
and I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:09.830
Before she starts, we'll
just watch a quick video

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.045
of her greatest climb.

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:14.338
RAHA MOHARRAK: Thank you
all for coming, by the way.

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:15.310
I know it's a Thursday.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.893
Hang in there.

00:01:15.893 --> 00:01:17.226
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:18.226
I'll make it worthwhile.

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:20.670
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.281
Why do I climb mountains?

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:25.530
Because I was told I couldn't.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.744
No one believed I could do it.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.190
But I'm not the type
that gives up easily.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.577
Being the first Saudi
woman and youngest

00:01:41.577 --> 00:01:47.340
Arab to climb Everest was so
far from what people expect.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.743
I completely shattered
that stereotype.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.055
The memory and the feeling
of that accomplishment

00:01:59.055 --> 00:02:03.965
lives on beyond the mountain.

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:06.328
I felt like I belonged.

00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:06.911
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:08.384
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:09.366
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:12.220
SPEAKER: Give her an
an even bigger round

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.780
of applause, because she
actually just completed

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.280
that last--

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.891
RAHA MOHARRAK: I
finished the summit.

00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.276
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:21.661
It's the first time
I see that tape.

00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.619
I get a little bit
emotional when I watch that,

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.190
because it's the first time
I see it since I actually

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.810
finished the seven summits,
which is less than a week--

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.640
three weeks ago?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.240
I still have really ugly toes.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.460
Don't tell my mom.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.609
But yeah, I can't
believe it, but I finally

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:35.400
finished the seven.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.350
And I always struggle
with starting my story.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.225
Because when you
hear Saudi women,

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:42.350
that's not what you expect.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.490
I mean, I know.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.940
It's a bit shocking.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.980
So I'm going to start
from the beginning.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.790
And I would love to give
you a cool reason why

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.630
I started climbing.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.440
Because I was trying
to find myself,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.890
or whatever would make
me sound like a badass.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.110
But the truth is, it
started with the word "no."

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.100
Just "no."

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.260
Such a small
two-letter word that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.010
has the power to enrage a
spirit and kill the soul.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.245
It's a two-edged sword can
either hurt you or heal you.

00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:12.215
The best thing
anyone has ever told

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:15.420
me once was a very quiet "no."

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.437
It was almost a whisper.

00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:20.020
I'm going to start
from the beginning.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.460
I was born in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.481
to a father who always taught
me to reach for the stars,

00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.230
and to a mother, whose
spirit I inherited.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.438
According to my father, you
and your mom, copy-paste.

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:30.240
Same [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.760
So we have the
same kind of spark.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.040
People call it a headache.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.620
We call it "character."

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.600
So from as long, as teeny-weeny
as I could remember,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.350
I was different.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.760
I knew I was different.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.525
They knew I was an
awkward little child.

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:45.108
I didn't do the typical things
most little girls, for example,

00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:46.002
did.

00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:50.100
And although I felt
a bit of an oddball,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.860
my family never
asked me to change.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.010
My family never made
me question who I was.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.910
But I did feel like
I was different.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.140
So for the longest
time, I tried to stay

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.666
inside this little box of
what a Saudi girl should be,

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:03.665
the typical Saudi girl.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:07.138
I really, really tried to copy
my girlfriends that I grew up

00:04:07.138 --> 00:04:08.960
with, but I couldn't
fit in that box,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.040
no matter how much I tried
to conform to the norms.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.459
And as I grew--

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.690
remember, being a little
girl is not the same

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.561
as being a woman in Saudi.

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.852
So as I grew, so did the
walls my gender imposed on me.

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:25.226
Because when I was a little
girl who liked sports and was

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:26.410
boyish, it was kind of cute.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.540
But when I was a woman and
I was being more boyish

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.690
and I wanted to play
with my brother's friends

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.166
rather than my
sister and dolls, it

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:34.550
started to become uncomfortable.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.716
And I couldn't fit.

00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:40.280
And I said, I will never try
to be anything other than who

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.530
I really was, even back then.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.590
So I was at a
crossroads in my life.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.930
I knew I had two choices.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.602
Option one is go
behind this thing that

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:51.900
drove me since I was a child.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.330
I knew I was destined for more
than just what they expected.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.280
Or option two, which is more
the traditional lifestyle

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.750
of going from
wedding to wedding,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.291
waiting for Prince Charming to
come and sweep me off my feet.

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.040
Ladies, I mean no insult. A
lot of people dream of this,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.200
especially in my culture.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.622
It's like the ultimate goal.

00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:10.580
But it was never meant
to be the path I walked.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.692
I speak my heart.

00:05:11.692 --> 00:05:13.316
I wasn't actually
meant to walk a path.

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:15.230
I was meant to climb one.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.993
So I finally reached
this conclusion,

00:05:16.993 --> 00:05:19.070
and I said I'm going
to find this thing.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.290
I'm going to find the
answer to this thing.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.225
I didn't even know
what the question was.

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:25.310
So I was searching.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.740
I was so confused,
but I never gave up,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.310
because I knew that there was
something out there for me.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.902
That's a lesson I taught myself.

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:33.360
Even if you're
sometimes lost, even

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.090
if you're sometimes confused,
don't settle for normal.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.140
Don't settle for just
being comfortable.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.460
Live it.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.750
I almost gave up.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.080
I thought, maybe they're right.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.704
Maybe I should go back to Saudi
Arabia and wait for [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:47.050
to come and--

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.640
But randomly one day--

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.645
I kept my heart
and my mind open.

00:05:51.645 --> 00:05:54.020
Randomly one day, we were
sitting with a group of people,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.970
and this woman I
didn't even know

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.528
said "I'm climbing Kilimanjaro
over the Eid holiday."

00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:01.910
As soon as she said that,
I looked at her and I said

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.748
"You're doing what?"

00:06:02.748 --> 00:06:04.373
She says, "Oh, I'm
climbing a mountain.

00:06:04.373 --> 00:06:06.312
It's the highest
peak in Africa."

00:06:06.312 --> 00:06:09.210
And this little fire in my
heart, this little thing

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.118
just ignited.

00:06:10.118 --> 00:06:11.826
And I said, "You're
climbing a mountain."

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:13.212
She said, "Yeah."

00:06:13.212 --> 00:06:14.810
And she started
to talk about it.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.205
And the more she talked about
it, the more I was like,

00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:18.120
it's sporty.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.400
It's outdoorsy.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.970
It's dangerous.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.550
It's as far away from
Saudi as possible.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.634
I found it.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.540
This is exactly what I'm going
to do to piss my family off

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.580
and to also change my point
of view of myself, right?

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.031
I was still nervous
about booking everything,

00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:35.572
so I started telling
people I'm going

00:06:35.572 --> 00:06:37.450
to climb Kilimanjaro in Africa.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.135
And everybody was like, you're
Saudi, and you're a woman.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:45.035
Everybody was just giving me
this really annoying answer

00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:46.134
like, "What?

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:46.634
No, no.

00:06:46.634 --> 00:06:48.140
You can't do this."

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.340
And that was the final push.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.480
I was hesitant.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.264
I wasn't sure.

00:06:51.264 --> 00:06:52.680
But when people
started telling me

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.726
I couldn't climb a mountain
because of the color

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:57.450
of my passport, I was insulted.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.600
I looked at myself
and I found nothing

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.920
lacking in my capability.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.850
I have two legs.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.930
I have a brain.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.295
Why am I less than anyone else?

00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:05.620
And that was it.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.530
It cemented my idea.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.950
Of course, it's not
enough to have an idea.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.330
I'm a Saudi woman, after all.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.780
So I still had to have the
courage to actually confront

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.544
my family with it.

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:21.190
It wasn't enough to just say
I'm going to climb a mountain.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.109
I still had to confront
my poor father.

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:25.775
So for the second
time I almost gave up,

00:07:25.775 --> 00:07:27.990
and I said, "Oh, maybe
this is too much.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.977
Maybe they're not going
to like the idea."

00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:33.910
But still, that little
thing in my heart pulled me.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.330
And I said, "You know
what?"-- my love of adventure

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.336
far exceeded my
fear of rejection.

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:41.140
I said, "I'm going to call him."

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.206
Thank God I was in Dubai.

00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:44.580
He was in Saudi at the time,
so it wasn't a face-to-face.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.246
So I called him.

00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:48.842
As soon as I said, "Hi,
Daddy," him knowing me so well,

00:07:48.842 --> 00:07:50.092
he was like, "What did you do?

00:07:50.092 --> 00:07:50.575
What did you break?

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:51.060
What's wrong?

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.810
Do you want money?

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.555
What's up?"

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.160
And I said, "Nothing.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.027
I just, you know, since
I have some time off now,

00:07:57.027 --> 00:07:59.110
I've decided to climb the
highest peak in Africa."

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.110
As you can see, I
speak really fast.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.680
I just went, "It's this high
and it takes this long."

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.900
I was like a broken
Wikipedia page.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.210
And the man didn't have
a chance to say a word.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.732
And in reality, I was too
scared to hear his answers.

00:08:11.732 --> 00:08:12.440
And I just went--

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.273
[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

00:08:13.273 --> 00:08:18.577
When I stopped, he said, "No."

00:08:18.577 --> 00:08:20.480
He just said no.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.994
And it was so loud.

00:08:21.994 --> 00:08:23.410
I'm telling you,
it was a whisper.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.745
It was so loud in my mind.

00:08:25.745 --> 00:08:28.380
He just said, "No."

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.040
Not wanting to
insult him, I was so

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.860
upset, I hung up
because I was really,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.490
really aggravated by his answer.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.409
I hung up, and I went
home and could not sleep.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.210
I couldn't let it go.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.650
That small, trivial word
grew in my mind till it was--

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.984
it had claws and it was
grabbing at my soul.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.470
I'm like, "How could
he say no to me?"

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.140
So I decided to write
this long email.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.300
And I'm severely dyslexic,
so I was writing like this.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.910
And the sun came
up by the time I

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.530
was done writing my phone book.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.170
It was a long, long email.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.769
And I threw every single thing
he taught me straight at him.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:05.733
You're the one that taught
me that I'm [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.415
You're the one that taught me
that I can reach for the stars.

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:07.850
You, you, you!

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.100
You're the one that made
me believe I could do this.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.578
How are you giving
me a ceiling now?

00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:14.072
How are you giving
me a leash now?

00:09:14.072 --> 00:09:15.720
How could he do this to me?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.575
And I tried to be as
politically correct as possible.

00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:20.240
Because, again, Saudi, you know.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.390
Dad, you can't really just
say, "I'll do what I want."

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.020
And I spell-checked and checked.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.460
And I had my finger
on the send button.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.700
Now, I've been on 14
expeditions, seven continents,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.080
including a mountain that
tried to kill me twice.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.055
And that was the top four
scariest moment of my life.

00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:41.925
And I took a deep
breath, and I sent it.

00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:43.800
I would love to tell
you that I went to sleep

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.280
and everything was
fine, but the reality

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.571
was, I ran around [? myself ?]
like a headless chicken.

00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:49.070
Thinking, "Oh my god.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.637
What did I do?

00:09:50.637 --> 00:09:52.060
My dad's going to
send my brother

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.851
to put me in a box with
a bow, and my mom's

00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:55.008
going to go [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:55.008 --> 00:09:56.008
Anyone, anyone take her.

00:09:56.008 --> 00:09:57.920
Anyone marry her."

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.120
I was thinking [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.480
But I was thinking I could
hear the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.620
I was like, "OK, I shot
myself in the foot."

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.735
And to add to the
drama, my dad, who

00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:10.630
speaks to me almost every day--
yeah, I know it's embarrassing,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.130
but he does.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.480
He calls me almost
everyday-- ignored me.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.817
We always dispute
how long it was.

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.150
I say it was, like, three weeks.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.216
He says it was three days.

00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:22.560
But it depends on who you ask.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.980
And he ignore me.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.140
And throughout this--

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.990
I call it the Silent Days.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.330
Throughout the Silent
Days, I was afraid.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.285
I was emotional.

00:10:31.285 --> 00:10:32.160
My tummy was hurting.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.050
I couldn't sleep.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.966
I was every single emotion
you could think of.

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:37.397
I was a walking,
talking Pandora box.

00:10:37.397 --> 00:10:40.890
But the only feeling I
did not feel is regret.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.006
Not once did I regret
sending that email.

00:10:43.006 --> 00:10:44.750
And that's when I knew.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.840
I was terrified, but it
meant the world to me.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.790
I knew how much
this meant to me.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.450
I would also call my mom, and
my mom's on the inside now.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.390
[WHISPERING] She's like, "I
don't know what you told him,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.840
but he's not talking very well."

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.390
At the end of the three days,
few weeks, whatever it is,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.390
he replied one sentence.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.390
He said, "You're crazy.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:04.890
I love you.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.890
Go for it."

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.760
That one line.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.012
I sent him a full book.

00:11:08.012 --> 00:11:10.245
He sent me that one line.

00:11:10.245 --> 00:11:12.650
And neither him
nor I nor the world

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.806
would imagine where I'd end up
after sending that the line.

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:17.264
Of course, I called
him and I said,

00:11:17.264 --> 00:11:19.904
"I need a verbal confirmation."

00:11:19.904 --> 00:11:21.320
And I got approval
from my family.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.240
A few weeks later,
maybe a month later, I

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.070
find myself standing
on Africa's roof.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.740
I was very hypothermic.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.220
I had snow blindness,
nearly snow blindness.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:39.920
I couldn't feel half of my
limbs, but I was so alive.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.641
I don't understand
how going to a place

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:46.390
that I've never been
felt like going home.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.473
It felt so familiar to me.

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:52.780
It felt so real, so my
own that I was addicted.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.690
I knew that would not be the
last time I stood on a summit.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.960
I knew that would not be
the last time I tasted what

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.192
it feels like at the summit.

00:12:01.192 --> 00:12:04.030
And as soon as I came
back down, my parents,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.170
I walked into the house,
wind-burned and everything,

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.450
I looked like a six-month-old
[INAUDIBLE] and I was so happy,

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.780
and they looked at each
other, and they said, "Uh-oh."

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.238
They knew that
there was a problem.

00:12:14.238 --> 00:12:15.460
And they were right.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.070
I could not stop climbing.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.090
I kept climbing one
mountain after the other.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.253
I kept hiking and kept doing--

00:12:21.253 --> 00:12:23.086
anything you can imagine
that I could climb,

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:24.730
I kept trying to do.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.640
Until I thought I
reached my limits.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.860
I thought I reached
my ultimate goal,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.429
until I saw that beautiful
mountain for the first time

00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:33.767
with my own eyes.

00:12:33.767 --> 00:12:35.140
And I was in love.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.171
My mom always says,
"You know this one?

00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:39.712
I wish one day you
will look at a man

00:12:39.712 --> 00:12:43.340
the same way you
look at a mountain.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.736
She looks so happy."

00:12:44.736 --> 00:12:46.610
She always says that
when we have aunts over.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.652
She says, "You look at
it like it's your love."

00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:50.718
I'm like, "Yeah, but
I love mountains."

00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:54.310
So I saw that beautiful
mountain, and I was infatuated.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:13:01.236
I remember prior to seeing
it, I had done one mountain.

00:13:01.236 --> 00:13:03.160
I had done one, Kilimanjaro.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.290
And I saw it, and I
said, "You know what?

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.760
I'm going to climb
Everest in a year."

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.037
I gave myself a year.

00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:10.870
I said, "In one year,
I'm going to come back

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.040
and I'm going to
climb that mountain."

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.510
It's a bit arrogant.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.490
I don't know what I was
thinking, but I came back,

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.550
and in the span of a year
I did eight mountains,

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.352
a lot of emails back and
forth between my dad.

00:13:25.352 --> 00:13:27.310
Because every time I came
back, they were like,

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.640
"It is last one, yes?

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.700
Raha, it is finished.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.612
Please, leave.

00:13:30.612 --> 00:13:31.463
Finish."

00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:33.004
Two weeks later,
I'm like, "You know,

00:13:33.004 --> 00:13:35.290
Dad, here's a mountain
I thought of climbing."

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:40.310
So a year and eight months-- a
year and eight mountains later,

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.402
I was on the Hillary
Step, and I was taking--

00:13:43.402 --> 00:13:45.485
the Hillary Step, for those
of you who don't know,

00:13:45.485 --> 00:13:48.100
it's a pathway
that everyone needs

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.174
to pass if you're climbing
Everest from the east side.

00:13:52.174 --> 00:13:55.274
It's named after Edmund Hillary,
who is the first man that

00:13:55.274 --> 00:13:55.940
climbed Everest.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.230
So me, a Saudi girl
from Jeddah, was

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.350
standing in this
little walkway about

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.670
to reach the highest
mountain in the world.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.950
And I can't explain to
you how that meant to me.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.180
It didn't matter that I was
a woman or Saudi or brown.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.100
It didn't matter.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.940
I was doing what I loved.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.210
And I was living it.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.324
I had men shoulder to shoulder.

00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:19.490
My teammates were all with
me, and it didn't matter.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.865
Because I was
doing what I loved.

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:24.702
I was doing what people
told me I could never do.

00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:29.304
And honestly, I often worried
that climbing this mountain

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:31.345
would be a selfish act,
more than a selfless one.

00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:32.992
Climbing is a selfish sport.

00:14:32.992 --> 00:14:33.854
It's very difficult.
It's dangerous.

00:14:33.854 --> 00:14:34.930
It takes a lot of time.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.603
But all my worries
melted away the day

00:14:37.603 --> 00:14:39.235
a little girl came
up to me and said

00:14:39.235 --> 00:14:43.784
she decided to ask her father to
ride a bicycle because she read

00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:44.420
my story.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.370
And for those of you who
don't know, riding a bicycle

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.200
was outlawed for
women up to 2013.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.770
I had to learn how to ride
a bicycle two years ago,

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.420
because we were never
allowed to ride bicycles.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.820
So this little girl
came up to me and said--

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.650
well, actually, we were
communicating online.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.340
And she said she decided to
climb a mountain, and to me,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.907
that is an honor.

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:09.240
And if at the end of the day
you walk out and completely

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.990
forget about this crazy Saudi
woman who's climbing mountains,

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.960
I want you to remember that
at some point in time, me,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.300
who's standing here, who
grew up here in the desert,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.680
from Jeddah, I stood
on top of the world.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.420
A Saudi woman touched the sky.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.024
What are you capable of doing?

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:27.732
If I could do it, then your
dreams are not far from reach.

00:15:27.732 --> 00:15:29.534
Thank you.

00:15:29.534 --> 00:15:31.919
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:32.873 --> 00:15:33.827
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.440
SPEAKER: So we have some
time for Q&amp;A. And just to get

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.365
started--

00:15:42.365 --> 00:15:43.490
think about your questions.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.823
But just to get started, so
you mentioned the importance

00:15:45.823 --> 00:15:48.185
of your family and
the way that they

00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:52.161
raised you to be able
to conquer your fears

00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:55.087
and do whatever you want.

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:57.628
But not everyone has the luxury
of having a family like that.

00:15:57.628 --> 00:15:59.622
So what would be
your advice to people

00:15:59.622 --> 00:16:01.550
who don't necessarily
have that confidence,

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.996
have that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:02.996 --> 00:16:05.900
RAHA MOHARRAK: I think the
majority of-- especially

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.110
the region, of people,
and especially women,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.600
are afraid of failure.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.825
They're afraid of failing.

00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:14.475
So they're afraid of
hearing the word "no."

00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:16.520
If you're hearing the
word "yes" too much,

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.696
you're not doing
something that's worth it.

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:19.634
You're not doing something
that's moving you.

00:16:19.634 --> 00:16:21.310
So don't be afraid to hear "no."

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.006
Don't be afraid to be put down.

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:24.660
Think of it as an invitation.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.535
They say "no," you tell
them, "You know what?

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:27.700
I don't agree."

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.536
Always have that openness
with your family.

00:16:30.536 --> 00:16:31.910
And especially in
the Arab world,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.076
it's really hard sometimes
to sit them down and say,

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.701
"I know this is what
you want me to do.

00:16:35.701 --> 00:16:38.075
I know this is what you believe
is the right thing to do,

00:16:38.075 --> 00:16:39.360
but here's my point of view."

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.930
It's very hard
for us to do that.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.430
So always have an
open conversation,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.996
and never be afraid of failing.

00:16:45.996 --> 00:16:48.484
SPEAKER: And was that the
mentality that you took into--

00:16:48.484 --> 00:16:49.400
RAHA MOHARRAK: Oh, no.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:49.916
I'm sorry.

00:16:49.916 --> 00:16:51.082
SPEAKER: Or going to Denali.

00:16:51.082 --> 00:16:52.780
RAHA MOHARRAK: Denali.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.150
So long story
short, that mountain

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.187
really nearly killed me.

00:16:56.187 --> 00:16:57.187
And not just physically.

00:16:57.187 --> 00:16:59.930
Emotionally, mentally,
it took me a year

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.351
to be able to put
my gear back on.

00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:03.880
My jacket and my boots.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.599
I would get--

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.599
I had some PTSD.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.800
I couldn't put my gear on.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.322
And I had to work really
hard to get over this,

00:17:13.322 --> 00:17:15.050
the fear of the mountain.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.900
But then I realized
my fear of giving up

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.290
is bigger than the mountain.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:25.060
So I killed myself
training for the last year.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.099
I didn't end up finding
a sponsor, which

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.780
was a big letdown.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.100
I thought I can find a
sponsor at least for the--

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.160
I mean, I don't mean
to care about records,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.480
but you'd think I'd get
a little bit of backing.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.320
I didn't even get that.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.815
But in the end, my
father was the one

00:17:40.815 --> 00:17:43.370
that said you need to
get-- basically set

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.130
it up to go back to Denali.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:45.732
Him, who was--

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:46.940
SPEAKER: He came back around.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.340
RAHA MOHARRAK: He was the one
that pushed me in the end,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.835
and he was the one that
sponsored the last climb.

00:17:51.835 --> 00:17:53.747
Because he knew that I
would probably wake up

00:17:53.747 --> 00:17:56.246
a few years down the line and
think "I regret doing Denali."

00:17:56.246 --> 00:17:58.402
Because it was my last one.

00:17:58.402 --> 00:17:59.344
And I hate giving up.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:02.975
So yeah, I can't believe
I did it, actually.

00:18:02.975 --> 00:18:05.655
SPEAKER: So considering that was
your supposed last one, what's

00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:06.390
next for you?

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:12.530
RAHA MOHARRAK: Lots of beach
time for the next three weeks.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.530
I always have been and I
always will be a person

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.810
that strives to be happy.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.587
So whether it's climbing,
or hiking, or hopefully

00:18:21.587 --> 00:18:23.420
down the line, I really
want to help people.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.760
I was explaining it earlier.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.150
I want to represent a cause or
to champion a cause, hopefully.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.600
And just to live happy.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.460
I have a big thing on my bucket
list, which is actually a book.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.980
But it's a hidden, a big thank
you message to my parents

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.830
for not killing me years go.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.630
So it's my memoir,
but it's-- honestly,

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:52.250
it's commemorating my mom and
my dad for being honestly such

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.560
amazing parents.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.980
Even though they
stood in my way,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.175
they really have changed
what it means to be

00:18:59.175 --> 00:19:00.664
a Saudi parent in this day.

00:19:00.664 --> 00:19:03.210
Because we didn't
lose each other.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.670
And it was hard
for them socially.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.940
They kept getting a
lot of negativity.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.810
Every time.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.440
Every time I go to a
wedding and you see it.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.990
So Saudi weddings
are segregated.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.305
I'm a bit taller than Saudi.

00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:18.200
So I walk in like a [ARABIC].

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.222
You know, I walk in with my mom,
and then you'd hear them, "Oh,

00:19:22.222 --> 00:19:23.940
who's this [ARABIC]?"

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.315
[WHISPERING]

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:28.690
I'm here.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.120
I'm not deaf.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.593
I'm athletic.

00:19:31.593 --> 00:19:34.900
It's not-- so there's
stigma, and my parents

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.830
had to endure this.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.250
I can endure it because I
don't care what anyone thinks.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.012
But they had to endure it, so
it's a big thank you to them.

00:19:41.012 --> 00:19:42.386
SPEAKER: That's
a lot of the work

00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:43.760
that you're doing right now is--

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.676
RAHA MOHARRAK: To
change the mentality.

00:19:44.676 --> 00:19:46.700
SPEAKER: To encourage,
to change the mentality.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.230
RAHA MOHARRAK: If I exist,
you can't tell the other girls

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.236
like me [INAUDIBLE] don't exist.

00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:54.701
Yeah, so hopefully.

00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:58.152
AUDIENCE: So how much of
it is actually physical

00:19:58.152 --> 00:20:00.260
and how much of it
is like a mind game?

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.760
RAHA MOHARRAK: I
love this question.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.998
I've climbed with triathletes.

00:20:03.998 --> 00:20:07.190
I've climbed with overweight
people a little bit.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.620
I've climbed with smokers.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.042
I've climbed with psychopaths.

00:20:11.042 --> 00:20:12.940
I've climbed with narcissists.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.841
I've climbed with
beautiful people.

00:20:14.841 --> 00:20:16.950
I've climbed with so
many different people.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.030
It doesn't matter.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.670
If you don't have the right
mind, your body doesn't matter.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.690
Your body's enough to
get to the mountain.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.450
Your body is enough to arrive,
but what keeps you going

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.960
and what keeps you
alive is your mind.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.610
I once saw a guy triple my
height cry like a little baby

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.868
because he had a blister.

00:20:38.868 --> 00:20:40.976
It's difficult, but a blister?

00:20:40.976 --> 00:20:42.695
Patch it up, suck it up, and go.

00:20:42.695 --> 00:20:46.280
But because he's been
climbing for three or four

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:52.010
weeks, and a majority of
men have higher muscle mass

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.585
than women.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.085
So what happens
when you're climbing

00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:57.320
with less oxygen for
a month to your body

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.840
if you are mostly muscle?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.070
You deflate.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.376
Muscle survives on
oxygen. So these machos, I

00:21:03.376 --> 00:21:04.790
call them "the roosters."

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:11.682
These machos that show up
with the glasses and [ARABIC]

00:21:11.682 --> 00:21:13.140
There's a lovely
word in Lebanese--

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.330
[LEBANESE]

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.171
OK, you know?

00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:17.670
Thank you.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.406
They show up.

00:21:20.406 --> 00:21:23.400
Yeah, I need this right now.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:30.030
These guys show up, and
then a month down the line--

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.020
so mentally they break.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.470
And I've seen them.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.845
They're not as
fast as they were.

00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:35.960
They don't sleep well.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.350
And their mind just goes--

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.870
So if you don't
have a strong mind--

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.700
and I've climbed with
a guy who had one leg.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.230
And this guy was an ex-military.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.670
He had one leg.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.940
He carried the same
weight we all carried.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.510
And I did not hear
him complain once.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.480
He would arrive at camp.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.635
I know I'm sidestepping, but
I saw this with my own eyes.

00:22:01.635 --> 00:22:02.635
He would arrive at camp.

00:22:02.635 --> 00:22:05.670
Because they would duct
tape his prosthetic leg

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:06.670
so that it stays.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.670
He would arrive at camp.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.170
They'd cut the duct tape.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.880
They'd take off
the prosthetic leg,

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.770
and then he'd shove the stump
into the snow, and you see--

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.097
because it's so hot.

00:22:17.097 --> 00:22:17.930
He never complained.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.471
And on the high
side, there was a guy

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.140
complaining about a blister.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.200
So mind.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.960
Body gets you there,
body gets you moving.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.960
What keeps you alive and
surviving is your mind.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.252
I mean, I'm not a
very big person.

00:22:29.252 --> 00:22:31.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.530
AUDIENCE: How much physical
training did you need to do?

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.155
RAHA MOHARRAK: So
for Denali, because I

00:22:35.155 --> 00:22:39.200
was so nervous about Denali,
I trained for two months.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.554
In two months straight, I had
eight days off in two months.

00:22:42.554 --> 00:22:44.470
AUDIENCE: And what does
that training require?

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.850
RAHA MOHARRAK: It's
every-- it's cardio.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.650
It's cardio endurance, strength
and conditioning, and stamina.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.820
So training would be two hours,
two hours, two hours a day.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.440
Or four hours, one shot.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.650
Or actually twice
I did six hours.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.230
So I was in the
gym for six hours.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.720
Thank god for Netflix, because
I was going to shoot myself.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.630
So I had my iPad and I
was carrying 25 kilos.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.450
And it's called conditioning.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.014
And you don't have [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.520
AUDIENCE: Who was
the lady who told you

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.510
she would climb Kilimanjaro
and inspired you?

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.340
RAHA MOHARRAK: She wasn't a
very close friend of mine.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.550
AUDIENCE: But she was Saudi?

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.790
RAHA MOHARRAK: No, she
was Palestinian-Iraqi?

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.075
She wasn't even my group.

00:23:32.075 --> 00:23:33.950
She wasn't even someone
that was close to me.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.908
She was just someone who
was in the right place

00:23:35.908 --> 00:23:36.979
at the right time.

00:23:36.979 --> 00:23:38.520
AUDIENCE: And you
know which complex?

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.853
Did you meet her in [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:42.520
RAHA MOHARRAK: No, you know in
Ramadan tents a lot of people

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.136
pass by.

00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:45.564
AUDIENCE: My first question is--

00:23:45.564 --> 00:23:46.992
RAHA MOHARRAK: You
have to do sit-ups.

00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:49.200
AUDIENCE: --now that you've
done Everest, do you have

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.504
another job that you're eyeing?

00:23:50.504 --> 00:23:51.920
RAHA MOHARRAK: I
just finished it.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.235
Now I'm eyeing the beach.

00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:53.946
[? The train. ?]

00:23:53.946 --> 00:23:55.612
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and
the second question,

00:23:55.612 --> 00:23:58.020
I think you were the Lipton
brand ambassador, right?

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:58.260
RAHA MOHARRAK: Yes.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.038
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so do you feel
people recognize you now more

00:24:01.038 --> 00:24:02.427
or they know who you are?

00:24:02.427 --> 00:24:04.880
How was your experience
after Everest?

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.356
Like, people seeing you.

00:24:06.356 --> 00:24:06.848
RAHA MOHARRAK: Refreshing.

00:24:06.848 --> 00:24:08.514
AUDIENCE: "Are you
the lady from that ad

00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:10.750
and did you really
climb Everest?"

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.375
RAHA MOHARRAK: So I
was really, really,

00:24:12.375 --> 00:24:16.060
really nervous when
Lipton approached.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:21.470
Lipton is huge is Saudi, and I
was just like, "I'm not sure,

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.630
but I really need this
to climb the mountain."

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.140
I wasn't really sure, but
I give them so much credit

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.451
for having the guts to back me.

00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:30.450
They've never done that.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.020
They've never had
a female Saudi--

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.130
a female, period,
to back the brand.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.372
And as soon as it
launched, I was like--

00:24:39.372 --> 00:24:43.340
I had my hand in my heart.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.943
But as soon as my dad called
and said, "This is amazing!

00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:47.678
I want to send it to everybody!"

00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:49.052
I was like, "It's
gotten approval

00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:51.160
from the Saudi people."

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.539
Because I worked really
hard to make it authentic.

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:54.830
I don't know if you've seen it.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.960
It's here.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.231
And I didn't show anything.

00:24:57.231 --> 00:24:57.730
It was--

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.600
[THUD]

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.357
What was that?

00:24:59.357 --> 00:25:00.700
SPEAKER: Sorry.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.374
RAHA MOHARRAK: And we shot
in Austria in December.

00:25:05.374 --> 00:25:08.235
Not very [INAUDIBLE]
Actually, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:08.235 --> 00:25:09.070
So it's this.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.280
And I've noticed so many
girls come up to me and say,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.610
[SPEAKING ARABIC].

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.170
It's really cute.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:19.595
And I always for two seconds
when people say, "Are you

00:25:19.595 --> 00:25:23.640
the girl?," I'm always
like, "I don't know

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.980
what they're going to say."

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.850
But let's say half-half
I get "oh, this is great"

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.790
or "this is stupid."

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.260
One of my favorite stories
is, I had an event in Riyadh.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.007
24 hours I have my bag.

00:25:37.007 --> 00:25:37.590
Did the event.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.710
I'm flying back.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.690
I forgot my lucky Swiss
Army knife in the bag.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.680
And this knife has been
with me all the continents

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.250
and all the climbs.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.240
And the guy was refusing to let
me go on the plane with this.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.683
And they were about
to close check-in,

00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:53.370
and I don't have a check-in bag.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.130
And I made such a big hoopla.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.022
It's this big.

00:25:56.022 --> 00:25:58.500
And if you want to laugh,
I'll show you the video,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.050
because I was taking the video.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:00.270
It's this big.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.103
And I was like, "I'm
not going on the plane.

00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:03.500
I want--" I crossed check-in.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.740
So they called the biggest
guy, the police man,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.295
because I made a big deal.

00:26:07.295 --> 00:26:07.870
I'm like, "I'm not throwing it.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.190
Get me out.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.450
I'll wait another flight,
but I'm not throwing this."

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.877
So this head guy with, I
don't know, 20,000 stripes

00:26:12.877 --> 00:26:13.460
came up to me.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.898
And he's like, in Arabic,
[SPEAKING ARABIC]..

00:26:15.898 --> 00:26:17.360
He's like, "What's the problem?

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:17.540
Why?

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.050
Why does this mean
so much to you?"

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.200
I held it.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.340
I'm like, "This
thing saved my life.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.791
I had it with me in
seven continents.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:27.165
And I climbed the highest
mountains in the world with it.

00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:28.124
I'm not letting it go."

00:26:28.124 --> 00:26:28.873
He was very proud.

00:26:28.873 --> 00:26:29.820
He looked at me.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.385
He said, "We only have
one mountain climber,

00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:34.000
and you're not her."

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.980
I'm like, "Really?

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.756
What's her name?"

00:26:35.756 --> 00:26:36.756
He said "Raha Moharrak."

00:26:36.756 --> 00:26:37.506
I'm like, "Really?

00:26:37.506 --> 00:26:38.839
Open the passport in your hand."

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:39.650
He had my passport.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.646
"Open it."

00:26:40.646 --> 00:26:41.578
He opened it.

00:26:41.578 --> 00:26:42.484
He's like, "Whoa!

00:26:42.484 --> 00:26:43.442
Taller than I thought."

00:26:43.442 --> 00:26:44.840
He goes, "Oh, let her pass.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.020
Let's go!"

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.740
And he made me princessa.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.589
So I do get negativity, but
the positivity washes it away.

00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:54.130
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.690
RAHA MOHARRAK: It's just,
I'm very, very lucky.

00:26:59.267 --> 00:27:00.850
AUDIENCE: After the
beach, because you

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:05.990
seem pretty adamant on getting
more woman to not just do

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.452
these things and have the
bravery to do these things

00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:11.810
but also give themselves
the chance to discover--

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.310
[THUD]

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.300
SPEAKER: Sorry.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.349
I'm not trying to draw
attention to myself.

00:27:15.349 --> 00:27:16.765
RAHA MOHARRAK:
[? Nadia, ?] you're

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:17.890
taking away my [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.240
Joking.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.852
Sorry.

00:27:21.852 --> 00:27:22.939
AUDIENCE: Where was I?

00:27:22.939 --> 00:27:24.272
RAHA MOHARRAK: You were asking--

00:27:24.272 --> 00:27:26.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:29.112 --> 00:27:33.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so after
you're done with the beach,

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.060
because a big part of
it is not just women who

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.830
want to do different
things, it's

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.930
women giving themselves
the opportunity

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.140
to know that they want
to do different things--

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.290
you seem pretty adamant on
making sure that happens.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.200
RAHA MOHARRAK: So I try my
best to associate myself

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.010
with international
movements that are trying

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.040
to help women in the region.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.160
For example, I spoke on
behalf of Human Rights Watch

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.090
a few times in New York,
in Women in the World

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.320
and in Frankfurt for their gala.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.220
So by associating myself with
these people, who advocate,

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.360
I have a point.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.060
I'm not just standing
there on stage and talking.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.895
As fun as this is, my
message is, we need sports

00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:17.190
because it's a health problem.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.572
We have vitamin D deficiency.

00:28:18.572 --> 00:28:19.780
We have brittle bone problem.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.640
We have a lot of problems
in most of the generation

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.640
because they don't
do any sports.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.160
So I try as much as I
can to lead by example,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.850
and also to highlight this
issue, to try to go to schools.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.520
But like I said, they don't
really invite me much.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.020
AUDIENCE: You mean
outside of Saudi?

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.916
RAHA MOHARRAK: Outside of Saudi,
I think they're confused by me.

00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:42.400
I think they don't
know where to put me.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.425
No offense to anybody, but I'm
not a fashionista and I'm not

00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:48.600
a [? contour-bontour. ?]
Everybody's in love with--

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.020
I mean, everyone likes
a little bit of contour,

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.734
but it's not really my thing.

00:28:53.734 --> 00:28:55.622
Everyone likes a
little bit, especially

00:28:55.622 --> 00:28:58.260
with the light on my nose.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.500
Yeah, I admit it.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.170
But they don't know
where to place me.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.750
I tried to find an
agent many, many times,

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.490
and they don't know
what to do with me.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.480
So from my end,
I'm trying as much

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:16.022
as I can to associate myself
with the right advocacies,

00:29:16.022 --> 00:29:17.006
like I mentioned.

00:29:17.006 --> 00:29:18.992
It's really
difficult. Sometimes,

00:29:18.992 --> 00:29:20.450
I wish I was
[? contour-bontour. ?]

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.910
It's easier.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:22.600
No offense.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.990
You guys look great.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.380
SPEAKER: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.249
AUDIENCE: Back to the mountain.

00:29:29.249 --> 00:29:31.290
RAHA MOHARRAK: I'm surprised
that, yeah, not many

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.188
about mountains.

00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:34.628
AUDIENCE: So when you
were on the mountain,

00:29:34.628 --> 00:29:39.020
did you have any of your own
set of rituals or superstitions

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.460
or things that you
would do for yourself

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.570
to keep your mind in shape
during obviously some very

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.249
difficult times?

00:29:45.249 --> 00:29:46.790
RAHA MOHARRAK: Yeah,
I did, actually.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.380
I had a few rules I followed.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:53.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:54.316
I ate like an ogre.

00:29:54.316 --> 00:29:55.357
I peed like a race horse.

00:29:55.357 --> 00:29:56.854
I slept like a queen.

00:29:56.854 --> 00:29:59.090
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.380
It's essential.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.350
AUDIENCE: Mantra.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:02.640
RAHA MOHARRAK: It's essential.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.390
I'm not big, but you
have to feed yourself.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.780
Because a lot of people
go and they don't feed.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.290
Anything that they
put on my plate--

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.090
and I'm a picky eater--

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.620
I would eat.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.230
You have to.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.840
And then you have to
force yourself to relieve,

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.550
to go to the bathroom properly.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.867
I know it sounds
funny, but there's

00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:23.030
no such thing as toilet.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.710
You have to do a toilet break.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.310
And trust me, it's
uncomfortable when

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.494
you have a harness on
and boots and everything

00:30:28.494 --> 00:30:29.410
to go to the bathroom.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.750
So you have to learn
how to manage your body.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.990
And sleep is such
an important aspect,

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.470
because you can
be fittest person

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.358
and not be able to calm your
mind to sleep on the mountain

00:30:39.358 --> 00:30:40.309
and you're useless.

00:30:40.309 --> 00:30:41.600
And you're useless to the team.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.360
And when you're
useless to the team,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.130
you're not going to continue.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:49.440
The other thing is, I had a
very interesting relationship

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.460
with fear.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.870
A lot of people say,
"Well, you're not afraid."

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.626
I'm always afraid.

00:30:55.626 --> 00:30:57.590
Accept the fact that
you're going to be afraid.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.550
Don't say, "Oh, no.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.300
I'm not afraid."

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.890
Because that's when arrogance
comes out and that's

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.150
when mistakes happen.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.960
I'm always afraid, but I
managed what I was afraid about.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.800
I tried as much as I can
not to chase the rabbits

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.880
down the rabbit hole.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.830
These terms are all mine,
because I can't explain them.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.550
When you're climbing
for so long and you're

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.140
disconnected with
your family, things

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.983
start coming in your head.

00:31:17.983 --> 00:31:18.930
"Is my family OK?"

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.240
"My knee is hurting me."

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.250
"There's a sound
in my shoulder."

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.030
And you start feeding yourself
these doubts and these fears.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.145
So you really have
to manage them.

00:31:28.145 --> 00:31:29.644
One of my favorite
sayings-- and I'm

00:31:29.644 --> 00:31:31.126
going to watch it,
because I don't

00:31:31.126 --> 00:31:36.800
remember who said it-- they say
that if you have two wolves.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.870
One is fear and one is bravery.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.450
Which one will be stronger?

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.230
And the answer is,
the one you feed more.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.520
So as much as you can, try
to feed the positive side

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.780
of your brain.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.585
Stuff comes up.

00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:50.210
I remember sometimes
I was freaking out

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.296
that someone was sick or
I was getting injuries,

00:31:53.296 --> 00:31:55.960
but you really have to have a
healthy relationship with fear

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.160
and manage it, not
deny it completely.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.092
I think there was a hand.

00:32:03.092 --> 00:32:05.084
AUDIENCE: After the
beach, after relaxing,

00:32:05.084 --> 00:32:09.068
do you see yourself embarking
on another physical challenge?

00:32:09.068 --> 00:32:11.955
Do you see the next
set of mountain ranges?

00:32:11.955 --> 00:32:13.996
RAHA MOHARRAK: So if my
parents are watching, no.

00:32:13.996 --> 00:32:14.782
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:32:14.782 --> 00:32:15.740
RAHA MOHARRAK: Nothing.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:21.330
I think I will always have
an adventurous spirit.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:21.830
I love it.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.090
It's part of who I am.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.280
I mean, it doesn't
necessarily have

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.180
to be high altitude mountains
that want to kill me,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.930
but the world is so
vast and beautiful.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.556
I have such a long
list of things to do.

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:35.695
So I think I'm going to
continue to do these things

00:32:35.695 --> 00:32:40.080
and hopefully not give my
parents heart attacks, but just

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.880
a smaller level.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.681
Really, there's so many
ranges I want to do.

00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:47.680
I want to go back to
Antarctica, because I loved

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.585
that, the whole scene there.

00:32:49.585 --> 00:32:51.976
But I don't think I can stop.

00:32:51.976 --> 00:32:56.500
But I finished the big ones
I wanted, so now I can relax.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.670
I think there was one more.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:58.878
I don't want to leave anyone.

00:32:58.878 --> 00:33:00.564
AUDIENCE: Just very quick one.

00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:01.448
Do we have time?

00:33:01.448 --> 00:33:02.040
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040
AUDIENCE: So you
could argue that--

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.110
RAHA MOHARRAK: And you
also have a question?

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.570
SPEAKER: No.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.320
RAHA MOHARRAK: No?

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.847
OK.

00:33:06.847 --> 00:33:09.180
AUDIENCE: You could argue
that maybe one or two of these

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:13.225
are really, really long
difficult hikes as opposed

00:33:13.225 --> 00:33:14.876
to climbs.

00:33:14.876 --> 00:33:18.772
Which one would you say was
the most difficult technically?

00:33:18.772 --> 00:33:19.897
RAHA MOHARRAK: Technically?

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:20.843
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:20.843 --> 00:33:22.262
RAHA MOHARRAK: Denali.

00:33:22.262 --> 00:33:24.117
Denali.

00:33:24.117 --> 00:33:25.450
There is two types of mountains.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:28.670
There's an assisted mountain
and a non-assisted mountain.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.054
An assisted mountain is like
Kilimanjaro and Everest.

00:33:32.054 --> 00:33:33.553
Kilimanjaro being
a smaller version,

00:33:33.553 --> 00:33:36.011
because people help you porter
your stuff at their stations

00:33:36.011 --> 00:33:37.810
and you don't have
to carry everything.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:38.760
They are assisted.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.570
They are non-expedition.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.744
An expedition style,
which is Vinson

00:33:42.744 --> 00:33:48.120
in Antarctica and Denali,
you are a walking everything.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.490
Kitchen, house, everything.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.290
Bathroom.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.080
So you need to carry your
entire gear and entire food

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.800
for three weeks or
four weeks or whatever.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.390
So you start off with
a 25 kilo backpack.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.790
And attached to it
is a 25 kilo sled.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.310
And eight kilo worth of
rope and emergency gear.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.570
And I was 60 kilos at the time.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.489
And you're not
walking in [ARABIC]..

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:12.489
You're not walking
into the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:15.100
You are on inclines with--

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.850
I'm so happy I'm wearing
closed shoes today, by the way.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:18.850
Because they're purple.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.516
And not the cute
purple people paint on.

00:34:23.439 --> 00:34:24.480
You really jam your body.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.590
I had bruises on my collarbone.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.290
I had bruises on my hips.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.184
And you need to everyday
be able to carry that.

00:34:32.184 --> 00:34:34.684
And I'm surprised no one asked
about the bathroom situation.

00:34:34.684 --> 00:34:37.180
I'll tell you, because
it's really interesting.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.515
SPEAKER: That was one of the
first things I asked about

00:34:38.515 --> 00:34:39.114
in my email.

00:34:39.114 --> 00:34:40.780
RAHA MOHARRAK: Yeah,
she asked about it.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.238
So all the mountains
are different.

00:34:42.238 --> 00:34:43.710
Some mountains
have potty places,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.081
but the most
interesting is Alaska.

00:34:46.081 --> 00:34:50.074
Because Alaska, you have
something called a CMC can.

00:34:50.074 --> 00:34:51.115
We can't end on this now.

00:34:51.115 --> 00:34:52.600
Someone has to ask me a
nice question after this.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.950
It's called a CMC can.

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:54.685
It's green.

00:34:54.685 --> 00:34:57.895
And by law, you have to
go number two in the can.

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:59.020
You can't go anywhere else.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.280
You'll get a fine.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.683
Number one, there are
what we call pee wands.

00:35:03.683 --> 00:35:07.130
Which is basically a yellow
wand where you pee in.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:12.640
So number two, you
don't each get a bucket.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.900
You get a bucket for a team
or four buckets for a team.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.140
AUDIENCE: You have to carry it?

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.410
RAHA MOHARRAK: You need
to carry the shit bucket.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.532
And if it's your day to
carry the shit bucket,

00:35:23.532 --> 00:35:24.737
you don't give shit.

00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:26.570
You get the bucket and
you carry the bucket.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.340
Well, it's locked.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.080
It's not like
oozing or whatever.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.276
Thank god.

00:35:30.276 --> 00:35:32.108
It's locked.

00:35:32.108 --> 00:35:35.532
And thank god, it's
Alaska, so it's frozen.

00:35:35.532 --> 00:35:37.842
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:39.228 --> 00:35:40.305
But someone was asking.

00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:41.930
A guy once told me
and said, "So what?"

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.565
And I was so angry
in that event.

00:35:43.565 --> 00:35:45.740
You guys are lovely,
but that event

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.412
was not a very positive vibe.

00:35:47.412 --> 00:35:48.162
And I look at him.

00:35:48.162 --> 00:35:49.578
I'm like, "Let me
see how you feel

00:35:49.578 --> 00:35:51.893
carrying a shit bucket
for three weeks,

00:35:51.893 --> 00:35:53.849
and then tell me this is easy!"

00:35:53.849 --> 00:35:55.530
So you literally
have to carry it,

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.470
because by law you
cannot dispose of it.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.580
Because it's a national park.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.400
So on the expedition, you
have to carry everything.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.081
The stoves, the tents.

00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:04.580
It's a lot.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.816
It's a big load.

00:36:05.816 --> 00:36:08.100
AUDIENCE: So how do you
get rid of the bucket?

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.619
RAHA MOHARRAK: So you carry--

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:11.276
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:11.276 --> 00:36:11.984
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:36:11.984 --> 00:36:14.062
You really want to know?

00:36:14.062 --> 00:36:15.770
RAHA MOHARRAK: There
are different areas.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.410
If you are below
a certain point,

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:21.080
you lock it and
you carry it down.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.455
Because you're already
past the point.

00:36:23.455 --> 00:36:24.996
If you're above a
certain point, they

00:36:24.996 --> 00:36:26.996
have very big crevasses
that you can dump it in.

00:36:26.996 --> 00:36:30.901
And that's an allocated one, but
it's only maybe one in every I

00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:32.040
don't know how many meters.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.190
So technically you're
carrying the poop bucket.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.380
AUDIENCE: It's with
you the whole way?

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.610
RAHA MOHARRAK: You pretty
much have to carry it.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.948
It depends on the company.

00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:43.590
Some companies, the
guides carry the bucket.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.340
Thank god.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.423
Like, the last time, the
guide carried the bucket.

00:36:46.423 --> 00:36:49.740
But the one I did before,
you carried the poop bucket.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.590
And everybody was just
like, "You do what?"

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.496
And I told my mother
and she nearly fainted.

00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:56.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.920
My mom studied in Egypt.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.288
She's like [SPEAKING ARABIC]
"You're doing what?"

00:37:00.288 --> 00:37:02.810
She had this horror
face, but it's

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.510
a lot of-- it's extremely
difficult to climb

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.830
expedition style.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.740
And if, like I said, you're
a team, and if you're not

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.215
a good team, they'll catch you.

00:37:10.215 --> 00:37:10.970
They'll put you down.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:11.790
They'll let you go down.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.352
They will not allow
you to get to it.

00:37:13.352 --> 00:37:15.566
SPEAKER: And a typical
time for an expedition is?

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:17.690
RAHA MOHARRAK: Oh, all the
mountains are different.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.833
The smallest one is a few days.

00:37:19.833 --> 00:37:22.850
The longest one, which was
Everest, was two months.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:23.605
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:37:23.605 --> 00:37:26.936
RAHA MOHARRAK: Yeah, so my
record of not showering--

00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:28.555
again, sorry, Mom--

00:37:28.555 --> 00:37:33.452
was 22 days of not a
single drop in my hair.

00:37:33.452 --> 00:37:35.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.970
And if you're all curious,
I just posted all about my--

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.140
I'm not going to show
you the poop bucket.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.450
But on Instagram,
the last three weeks

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:45.864
was my day-to-day of Denali.

00:37:45.864 --> 00:37:47.280
So If you're
curious, have a look.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.488
It's so embarrassing, but
it gives you a good insight

00:37:49.488 --> 00:37:50.890
about my climbing.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.098
We need a good
question before we go.

00:37:53.098 --> 00:37:55.771
I can't end on a
poop bucket note.

00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:57.562
AUDIENCE: Just wondering,
how many calories

00:37:57.562 --> 00:37:58.554
did you eat a day?

00:37:58.554 --> 00:38:00.910
And you had to carry all
this on your back, so--

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.724
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:02.724 --> 00:38:04.682
RAHA MOHARRAK: I've been
asked that many times.

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:07.190
You know, I've never
actually calculated, but I--

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.486
AUDIENCE: I imagine like 3,000?

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:09.350
4,000?

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.274
RAHA MOHARRAK: I once won
the eating competition

00:38:12.274 --> 00:38:13.630
in Antarctica.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.910
It was me and 14
Marines, and I won.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.210
Yeah, so you eat a lot.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.593
I don't know the exact number.

00:38:21.593 --> 00:38:24.320
A question that's not
related to pooing or pooping?

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.720
AUDIENCE: Did you
plan your food?

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.815
RAHA MOHARRAK: Yeah.

00:38:27.815 --> 00:38:32.660
The climbing company is in
charge of managing your food.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.720
I'm milk-intolerant
and I don't eat pork.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.440
So this company I
had was amazing.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.595
So they had-- some people
are gluten-intolerant,

00:38:40.595 --> 00:38:44.275
which is incredible, yeah.

00:38:44.275 --> 00:38:47.269
But I [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:47.269 --> 00:38:48.766
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.270
RAHA MOHARRAK: Yeah.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.875
I answer myself, by the way.

00:38:51.875 --> 00:38:53.250
If you have any
random questions,

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.320
I answer myself myself.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.618
Hence the bad spelling,
but yes, I answer myself.

00:38:58.618 --> 00:39:01.540
AUDIENCE: I was always
hearing that sometimes

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:06.410
when people go for expeditions
and somehow they feel--

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.332
some of them leave.

00:39:09.332 --> 00:39:13.739
Others need to go back
to camp and so on.

00:39:13.739 --> 00:39:17.218
I heard that the first
time you tried to climb--

00:39:17.218 --> 00:39:18.212
RAHA MOHARRAK: Denali?

00:39:18.212 --> 00:39:19.206
AUDIENCE: Denali?

00:39:19.206 --> 00:39:21.194
You couldn't do it.

00:39:21.194 --> 00:39:26.550
When did you feel that your mind
was stronger than your body?

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.338
And how did you know you
should stop, not go further?

00:39:31.172 --> 00:39:33.088
RAHA MOHARRAK: What's
the most dangerous thing

00:39:33.088 --> 00:39:34.040
on the mountain?

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.718
What would you assume?

00:39:36.718 --> 00:39:37.912
AUDIENCE: Not going back.

00:39:37.912 --> 00:39:39.203
RAHA MOHARRAK: Give me answers.

00:39:39.203 --> 00:39:40.694
What do you think?

00:39:40.694 --> 00:39:42.682
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:42.682 --> 00:39:43.690
AUDIENCE: Oxygen.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.568
RAHA MOHARRAK: Your arrogance--

00:39:45.568 --> 00:39:46.516
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:39:46.516 --> 00:39:49.020
RAHA MOHARRAK: --is the number
one killer on the mountain.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.838
I've seen so many--
and quote me.

00:39:51.838 --> 00:39:57.200
I've seen so many people die.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.670
Yeah, like bodies.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.956
Of course, there are a lot
of [INAUDIBLE] avalanches.

00:40:02.956 --> 00:40:03.630
Things happen.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.588
Something breaks a lot.

00:40:04.588 --> 00:40:06.835
But I saw with my own eyes.

00:40:06.835 --> 00:40:08.210
Because before I
went to Everest,

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.986
I was like, "How
can someone die?"

00:40:09.986 --> 00:40:11.550
I was like, "How
can this happen?"

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.620
And then when I was climbing
Everest, and I was on the way

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.820
down, because I was very
fast on the way down,

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.826
there will people
coming up crawling.

00:40:19.826 --> 00:40:22.973
Crawling in ice.

00:40:22.973 --> 00:40:25.180
Why would you do that?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:30.010
Why on earth would
you crawl to anywhere?

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.700
And they were crawling.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.570
And most of them, if
they don't get help, die.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:40.027
So in my case,
Denali was a simple--

00:40:40.027 --> 00:40:40.860
the weather was bad.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.590
The team was weak.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.622
It's a mountain.

00:40:43.622 --> 00:40:44.730
Come back another day.

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.020
It broke-- it almost broke me.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.710
It took so much for
me to accept that,

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.002
but I lived to see another day.

00:40:50.002 --> 00:40:50.940
Why would you do that?

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.648
So the number one
thing that kills people

00:40:52.648 --> 00:40:54.730
is arrogance and lack of--

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:55.896
I've seen it.

00:40:55.896 --> 00:40:57.560
I've seen people
like, "Let's do it.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.752
Superman."

00:40:58.752 --> 00:41:00.210
And then you see
them crying later.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:00.672
Why?

00:41:00.672 --> 00:41:01.134
[SPEAKING ARABIC]

00:41:01.134 --> 00:41:02.230
The mountain is dangerous.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.570
The mountain is perilous.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.680
Anything can happen.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.624
And then after that,
you're being arrogant?

00:41:07.624 --> 00:41:09.630
And that's why I get
very annoyed when

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.656
people say "conquered Everest."

00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:13.702
I didn't conquer anything.

00:41:13.702 --> 00:41:16.259
I was a little flea on a
giant's back, and he was asleep,

00:41:16.259 --> 00:41:18.217
and I had a chance to go
up and look in his eye

00:41:18.217 --> 00:41:19.396
and come back down.

00:41:19.396 --> 00:41:20.604
You don't conquer a mountain.

00:41:20.604 --> 00:41:22.710
You're just lucky
to have a shot.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:26.550
There's a great writer
called Jon Krakauer.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.720
He wrote "Into Thin Air."

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.788
If anyone knows this book, don't
read it you're on the mountain.

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:33.038
AUDIENCE: Did you read it
before or after you climbed?

00:41:33.038 --> 00:41:34.515
RAHA MOHARRAK: On the mountain.

00:41:34.515 --> 00:41:35.848
Yeah, I read it on the mountain.

00:41:35.848 --> 00:41:38.690
It's about the tragedy
that happened in '97.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.470
About 40 people died.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.422
And he says that we are humans.

00:41:44.422 --> 00:41:48.580
So yeah, what made me
come back is, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.665
Plus, the weather was bad.

00:41:49.665 --> 00:41:51.206
We had many things
to come back down,

00:41:51.206 --> 00:41:54.102
but I wouldn't even continue.

00:41:54.102 --> 00:41:55.560
SPEAKER: I think
that's a good end.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.310
RAHA MOHARRAK: Yeah,
it's a very good end.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.870
Don't ask me about poo again.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.710
But I'm here for a bit.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.190
Like I said, I do
answer my stuff.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.300
Don't make fun of my
spelling, but yes, I do.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.899
And if you have
anymore questions,

00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:07.940
it's honestly a pleasure.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.665
SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:42:08.665 --> 00:42:10.040
RAHA MOHARRAK: I took
some time to get me--

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.650
SPEAKER: Yeah, but we
finally made it happen.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:12.610
Thank you so much for coming.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.680
RAHA MOHARRAK: I'm
sorry I talk fast.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.305
SPEAKER: No, this
was really wonderful.

00:42:15.305 --> 00:42:16.070
Thank you so much.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.111
RAHA MOHARRAK: Thank you.

00:42:17.111 --> 00:42:19.720
[APPLAUSE]
