since we started in 2002 we grew from a

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100
since we started in 2002 we grew from a
 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.860
since we started in 2002 we grew from a
very small class of about eight

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870
very small class of about eight
 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.650
very small class of about eight
full-time students to now over 160

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
full-time students to now over 160
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.010
full-time students to now over 160
students full time part time masters and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020
students full time part time masters and
 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.720
students full time part time masters and
PhD program what I found interesting

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730
PhD program what I found interesting
 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.640
PhD program what I found interesting
about this particular program was that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650
about this particular program was that
 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.279
about this particular program was that
the quark classes were at a minimum and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289
the quark classes were at a minimum and
 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.159
the quark classes were at a minimum and
are the actual specialization that we

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169
are the actual specialization that we
 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.890
are the actual specialization that we
wanted to do was left up to us so we

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900
wanted to do was left up to us so we
 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.540
wanted to do was left up to us so we
could really explore several different

could really explore several different
 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.800
could really explore several different
areas and that really helped me in my

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810

career and I actually felt like I was
going to go back to school because of

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039
going to go back to school because of
 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.400
going to go back to school because of
the time and energy investment I really

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410
the time and energy investment I really
 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.020
the time and energy investment I really
wanted to make a difference in my career

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030

actually have the professor meet with

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959
actually have the professor meet with
 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.820
actually have the professor meet with
them on a weekly basis generally so they

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830
them on a weekly basis generally so they
 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.930
them on a weekly basis generally so they
get very close almost one-on-one

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940
get very close almost one-on-one
 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.720
get very close almost one-on-one
coaching from the faculty member and so

coaching from the faculty member and so
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.660
coaching from the faculty member and so
you get to practice in a safe setting

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
you get to practice in a safe setting
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.970
you get to practice in a safe setting
what it's like to actually negotiate

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
what it's like to actually negotiate
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.190
what it's like to actually negotiate
with your peers take different roles

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
with your peers take different roles
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.289
with your peers take different roles

accountable it's been fantastic to have
 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.039
accountable it's been fantastic to have
full-time students on campus and one of

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049
full-time students on campus and one of
 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.809
full-time students on campus and one of
the things that those students are able

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
the things that those students are able
 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.199
the things that those students are able
to do in addition to having these small

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
to do in addition to having these small
 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.619
to do in addition to having these small
classes is that they also in some cases

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629
classes is that they also in some cases
 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.360
classes is that they also in some cases
have the opportunity to do research

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370

have the opportunity to do research
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.120
have the opportunity to do research
while being a full-time student because

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
while being a full-time student because
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.650
while being a full-time student because
not only was I able to learn all of

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660
not only was I able to learn all of
 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.720
not only was I able to learn all of
these amazing concepts in class design

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
these amazing concepts in class design
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.150
these amazing concepts in class design
decisions etc but then I was also able

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160
decisions etc but then I was also able
 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.309
decisions etc but then I was also able
to apply them to a real-world project

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319
to apply them to a real-world project
 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.800
to apply them to a real-world project
into to my research into the research

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810
into to my research into the research
 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.020
into to my research into the research
assistantship I think there's a

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030
assistantship I think there's a
 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.629
assistantship I think there's a
community here and if it wasn't for this

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639
community here and if it wasn't for this
 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.460
community here and if it wasn't for this
program I can't say that I would have

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
program I can't say that I would have
 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.830
program I can't say that I would have
been introduced and exposed to a lot of

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
been introduced and exposed to a lot of
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.839
been introduced and exposed to a lot of
the individuals that I've met here I

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849
the individuals that I've met here I
 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.089
the individuals that I've met here I
think there's a tremendous amount of

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099
think there's a tremendous amount of
 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.550
think there's a tremendous amount of
networking value in being a part of the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
networking value in being a part of the
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.620
networking value in being a part of the
alumni community according to now and I

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
alumni community according to now and I
