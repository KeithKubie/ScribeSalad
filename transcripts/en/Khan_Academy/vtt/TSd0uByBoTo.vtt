00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.889
laz- [Voiceover] So we've covered the

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.372
basic idea that divides the usage

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:06.967
of "the" from "a" and "an".

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.843
"The" is the definite article,

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.492
and "a" or "an" is the indefinite.

00:00:14.492 --> 00:00:16.093
So when you're being non-specific

00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:17.069
in language,

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:18.068
you would use

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:19.393
the indefinite article

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:20.504
as in,

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:22.640
"May I have

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.664
an orange?"

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:32.363
Cause it doesn't matter

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:35.079
which orange you're asking for,

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.798
you don't care,

00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:36.799
it's any orange,

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:38.282
as opposed to if you wanted

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:41.436
the orange.

00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:45.410
This usage is much more specific,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.686
and it seems to indicate
that there is only

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:49.168
one orange.

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:53.214
You see the orange in
particular that you want,

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:54.326
you're identifying it,

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:55.392
you're asking for it.

00:00:55.392 --> 00:00:57.754
That's what this definite usage is.

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.592
Something that's interesting about

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:01.453
the word "the"

00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:03.907
is that it can be used for both singular

00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:06.176
and plural nouns.

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.222
So it's both singular and plural.

00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:13.034
So you could say

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:13.754
"May I have the orange?"

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:14.358
You could also say

00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:16.604
"May I have the oranges?"

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.973
And "a" and "an" does not really allow this,

00:01:19.973 --> 00:01:21.479
it is only singular.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.689
So you can't say

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.801
"May I have an oranges?"

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.356
This is not standard.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.024
What you'd probably say instead is

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:36.508
"May I have some oranges?"

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:39.015
So this is not standard,

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.193
does not work in standard
American English.

00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:44.703
The other thing about "a" or "an"

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:47.906
is that it's "a" or "an".

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:50.018
The indefinite article changes

00:01:50.018 --> 00:01:51.598
depending on the vowel sound

00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:53.758
that comes after it.

00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:58.758
So changes for vowel sounds.

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:00.630
Now what does that mean?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.371
Well it means that if you know

00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:07.507
that word that you're going to say next

00:02:07.507 --> 00:02:12.507
like ah or ooh or eh or uh or ee,

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:16.865
then you're gonna change it to "an".

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:18.537
So it's the difference between saying

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:19.929
"A box,"

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:22.807
and

00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:24.637
"An apple."

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:27.591
What we don't say

00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:28.823
in standard American English

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:30.257
is "a apple."

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.442
It's not as easy on the mouth, frankly,

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:36.042
it takes a little bit more effort.

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:37.506
And any linguist will tell you

00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:39.482
that the way languages develop

00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:42.382
is that they reward laziness.

00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:43.797
So we say "a box"

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:45.280
but we say "an apple."

00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:48.373
Something a little weird though,

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:49.138
you want to make sure

00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:50.718
that you're looking for vowel sounds

00:02:50.718 --> 00:02:52.475
not just for vowels.

00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:55.641
Because some vowels,

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:56.753
for example,

00:02:56.753 --> 00:02:57.869
the letter U

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.517
don't always produce "ooh" sounds.

00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:02.097
Sometimes if they're at
the beginning of a word,

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:03.416
like in word union,

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:06.392
so if you say "a union,"

00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:09.432
that produces a "yuh" sound,

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:12.344
and "yuh" is technically
a consonant sound.

00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:14.784
That's not a vowel.

00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:17.220
But there are certainly cases like

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.659
"An underwater boat,"

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.004
where the letter U does produce

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:24.584
an "ooh" or an "uh" sound,

00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:25.671
and that's a vowel.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:26.812
So if you're gonna start the word

00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:28.019
with a vowel sound,

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.527
what you wanna do is choose

00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:31.756
"an" instead of "a"

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:35.447
but just be careful of
the letter U for example.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.727
So to recap,

00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:38.768
"the" is the definite article.

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:41.952
You can use it for both
singular and plural usage.

00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:43.460
"May I have the orange?"

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.664
"May I have the oranges?"

00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:47.384
"A" or "an" is indefinite

00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:48.823
and it's only singular,

00:03:48.823 --> 00:03:49.820
so you can say

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.911
"May I have an orange?"

00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:51.723
or

00:03:51.723 --> 00:03:54.365
"May I have some oranges?"

00:03:55.323 --> 00:03:56.855
Before a vowel sound,

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:58.875
"a" changes to "an"

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:01.479
so you say "a box,"

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.091
but "an apple".

00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:05.732
Not "a apple."

00:04:05.732 --> 00:04:07.171
You say "a union,"

00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:09.393
but "an underwater boat."

00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.931
You can learn anything.

00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:12.969
