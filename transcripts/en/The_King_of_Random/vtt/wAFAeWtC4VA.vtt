00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.200
I love the look and feel of sitting in front of a fireplace if you don't have one though it could be thousands of dollars

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.040
And a lot of paperwork with the city to get one installed if it's possible at all

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.500
Now the purpose of today's video is to come up with a substitute

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.460
Fireplace that can go into any building with no paperwork at all and for very little cost some of you may be asking

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.560
But why because it's cool. Plus I really love building stuff that you can make it look really cool

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.300
This is a fancy decorative piece that looks surprisingly good. If you do it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.869
Well this project is going to be broken up into two videos and the first one we will build the structural shape of the fireplace

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.780
And in the second one will do all the decorative bits that make it look like a real brick construction most of the materials

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.340
We'll need are these sheets of foam core board and these sheets of four millimeter craft foam

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.189
These foam core boards are 20 inches by 30 inches

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.840
They are available at a whole lot of different craft stores, and these ones actually by the dollar store

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.409
They are surprisingly one dollar each, so that's pretty good price

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.108
This is the same stuff that we've used before with our styro-slicer'

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.260
To make stuff like this fighter jib these foam core sheets often come in a variety of colors white and black are the most common

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.079
We're going with black just because it's a little bit easier to film these craft foam sheets come in a variety of colors and thicknesses

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.269
We're using the thickest kind that I saw available

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.170
It's 0.2 inches or about four

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.629
Millimeters thick the color of these foam sheets shouldn't really matter because they will be covered in paint

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.060
But I did get a couple that are fairly close in color

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.749
To the brick look that we're going to want to hold everything together in this fireplace

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.459
We're also going to need a good glue gun now that we have all of our supplies. Let's start building to start

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.849
Let's grab four pieces of our foam core board that will become the front and back of the fireplace

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.799
These boards are 20 inches wide and 30 inches tall we want to keep the 30 inch height

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.769
but we actually want to take one inch off of each of our boards so that our final fireplace is 30 inches tall and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.720
38 inches wide you may be wondering why don't we just leave it the full 40 inches wide?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.399
So we don't have to cut a 1 inch strip off the actual reason for that is that the spacing of the bricks will work

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.189
Out much nicer if it's 38 inches wide instead of 4 you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.389
Anytime we cut strips or pieces off of our foam core don't throw them away because we can still use them later

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.370
We're going to glue the edges of these two pieces of foam core together and those will become the front of our fireplace

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.460
The front of our fireplace however is going to have an opening in it

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.340
So let's draw and cut that out before we glue the pieces together

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.919
We'll want the whole opening to be twenty-two inches wide which means we'll take eleven inches off of either side

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.110
The version of the fireplace that I'm building will have a slight arch at the top of it if you want to make a different

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.570
Shape you're welcome to do that as well anything can work

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.600
My opening will be twenty-two inches wide it will come up approximately seventeen and a half inches at the sides

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.460
And then in the middle it will come up about two inches higher than that to about nineteen and a half

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.960
Maybe 20 inches I have my two marks at 11 inches in so now

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.839
I'm just going to measure seventeen and a half inches up from there and now a mark in the center about two inches higher

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.700
somewhere around nineteen and a half

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.909
Maybe 20 inches and now have the two sides of my opening marked and where the top of my opening will go so what I?

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.450
Need to do is draw a nice curved line that connects the two sides

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.299
Running through my 19 and a half inch mark in the center

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.040
Now let's take our ruler and our razor blade and cut those pieces out on the curve of course

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.209
I can't put a ruler up against it, so I am just gonna have to freehand it with the razor blade a little bit

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.709
With those two pieces cut out you can now see the shape of the front of our fireplace is starting to take once again

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.719
Don't throw away the pieces that you cut out because we're still going to use them now those pieces are cut we're ready to glue

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.720
the two halves of the front of our fireplace together

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.190
With our glue gun let's run a bead along the edge of one board lay it down flat on the table and press it flat

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.730
And then press the other board into it so the edges line up perfectly

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.019
Clean away a little bit of this glue if you do this while the glue is too

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.809
Hot you will burn your hands the fact that I'm wearing gloves actually does help a little bit it protects my fingers from the heat

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.270
of the glue

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.430
We've now cut and glued the front panel of our fireplace to make it a little more

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.320
Structurally sound let's add some strips of foam core to the back of it glued on to both sides

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.099
This will really help. It keep its shape and prevent it from cracking. If there's any movement

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.349
Let's use one of the 1 inch strips that we cut off the side of our panels and cut a few pieces four inches long

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.350
With a front panel assembled

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.670
Let's set it aside and make the back panel the process for the back panel is the same as the front except

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.550
We don't cut out an opening so let's cut off one inch strip from the sides

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.710
And then glue it together down the seam in the middle

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.159
With the last piece we use three strips of foam core to

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.069
Reinforce the scene we want to do the same thing on this side

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.820
But we need to make sure that those strips aren't going to be visible because it'd be pretty ugly

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.039
So let's be careful about where we put them laying the front piece on top of the back piece. We can see that

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.999
There's a portion that will not be visible and we can put our reinforcing strips there

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.190
Let's also put one down at the bottom. Which will be used to help build the bottom of the fireplace later

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.189
There we have it now, we've built the back panel of the fireplace

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.839
Let's go back to the front panel and add some side and support pieces for the side panels

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.959
Let's make them the same width as these pieces that we already cut out from the front as you recall these panels are 11 inches

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.539
wide

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:35.709
Since we've used the entire height of the board of the panel our fireplace is 30 inches tall that means for our side panels

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.889
Let's cut out two pieces that are each 11 by 30 inches

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.239
We now have our two side panels cut out

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.470
And we'll also use these two pieces we cut from the front as interior side panels

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.509
It's going to be important that all of our side panels are at a nice 90 degree angle from our front and back panels

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.889
So let's cut a few angle pieces that will help us keep those side panels. Just the way we want them

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.609
I'm making some two inch squares that I'm then going to cut diagonally to give us some nice 90-degree angles now

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.810
Let's secure these right angle pieces to the backside of our front panel with these glued down when we attach our side panel

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.470
We'll have a nice 90 degree guide to be sure that it's a line straight up and down

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.329
With these pieces that we cut out of the middle and are now using as interior side pieces

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.620
Make sure that you have the narrow end lined up with the size that matches it

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.630
You don't want to take the wide end and put that on the edge here

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.730
Or you'll have a lot of weird overlap and you might be able to see the narrow end through the back of the fireplace

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.160
Just attach it as though over a door that you cut off and is swinging over

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.359
That's the first two panels attached and now let's attach the ones on the other side

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.859
With the edges attached to the front of our fireplace we can now see that it stands up on our own

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.020
And we're getting a really good look at how it's going to come together now we need to attach our back panel to our side

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.020
panels

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.420
The main body of the fireplace is progressing really nicely

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:54.089
So now let's add a floor right here this piece of support on the back is actually going to help hold up our floor

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.030
Let's add a one inch strip connecting these two front points here

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.929
And then we'll have a panel that goes on top of all of that before we add our strip

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.450
Let's cut out the shape that we're going to need for that panel

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.950
We could grab a new foam core board

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:10.200
But we have these two pieces that we cut off of our side panels so to avoid wasting too much material

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.509
Let's use these to make our floor one of these panels alone isn't deep enough to reach the back of our board

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:20.429
That's 11 inches back, and these are only about 9 inches wide, so let's glue these two pieces together

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.260
And then we'll have a large enough board that we can cut out the right size and shape for the bottom of our fireplace

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.950
This piece should now fit nicely into the space. We've got

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:37.169
We still have some leftover 1-inch strips, so let's cut one of those to be the right size to fit right in this gap

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.258
To start attaching our floor, let's just run a bead along this support. We have on the back

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:54.909
With the back little bit of glue attached now let's run a bead along the front and press that down as well

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.089
Now we have a couple inches in the back and the whole front attached

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:03.549
But our sides and especially our back corners are still very loose looking at the bottom of the fireplace

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.829
We can see how that bottom panel isn't very well connected everywhere so what we want to do is

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:13.029
Reinforce all along the edges to make sure it really is holding itself up well

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:19.179
To reinforce it a little bit extra in the corners. Let's even take a couple of one-inch pieces and glue those down

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.329
So it's really getting support from the sidewall as well

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:38.690
Our bottom is now pretty well attached

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.499
But we are going to want it to hold a little bit of weight so to add some support

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.429
Let's just take a few one-inch pieces and glue those around

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.709
Those will reach down from this panel on to the floor where our fireplace is resting there

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:54.469
We have it the floor of the fireplace is now really nicely attached

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.289
It's stuck on both front and back all the sides

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.420
And it has some extra support in the middle

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.270
At this point the main body of the fireplace is mostly complete so what we need to do is add a top piece a mantel

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.570
That goes on top of the fireplace

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:12.080
When we made the front and back pieces of our fireplace we trimmed off one inch from either side of the panels now we want

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.299
To have a mantelpiece that extends one inch over the edge

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.120
Making the bricks fit was one reason to trim down the edges

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.459
This is the other with a new piece of foam core

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:25.849
We need to cut out four panels that reach from the middle of our fireplace out to one inch beyond the edge

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.670
We also want the mantel piece to extend one inch beyond the front of our fireplace so we need to take a measurement that will

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.050
Take us from the very back of the fireplace to one inch beyond the front our side walls

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.130
We know are 11 inches

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:43.549
but we also have to account for the thickness of the foam core itself currently our whole fireplace is approximately 11 and

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:50.898
5/16 inches wide so now we need to cut four pieces that are 20 inches long and 12 and

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.630
5/16 inches wide

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.360
Pervert

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.270
Three more of those now these four pieces will become the top and bottom of our mantle first

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.489
Let's glue the edges of two of the pieces together

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.259
Now one of these is bottom and one of these is the top and to secure the two together we want to take some 1

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:27.149
Inch strips and go all the way around one of them and then attach the other one on top of those

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.260
Now before we secure the top piece onto this bottom piece

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.460
I want to do sort of the same thing that we did with the very bottom of the fireplace and that's just add a few

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.330
Little cross pieces to add a little bit of structural support on to our mantel

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.430
You know we've got the front attached, let's try attaching the side

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.360
The front and the sides now, let's just try and get a little bit onto the back

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:56.419
There we go our mantelpiece is now constructed and holding itself together pretty. Well. There is a couple little bits of cleanup

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.719
I want to do and I have a little bit of a lip so I want to cut that off

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.480
So it's nice and flush all the way across this product

00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:13.759
There we have it our mantle is now complete and rests nicely on top of our fireplace

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:19.250
This whole part of the fireplace has used seven pieces of the foam core build since I bought them at the dollar store

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.070
That's only seven bucks for a whole fireplace not too bad

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.219
We're not going to attach the mantel to the body of a fireplace just yet

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.750
We're gonna wait until we've added some more of the decorative elements to the fireplace and the mantel itself

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:35.239
Thanks for joining us for this video join us tomorrow as we finish up our fireplace and remember to come gear yourself up with products

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.669
And merch at the king of random calm. See you there

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.279
It only probably takes 20 to 30 seconds to cool down and after the point we can let go of it

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:45.279
But it still seems like it takes a long time

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.630
You
