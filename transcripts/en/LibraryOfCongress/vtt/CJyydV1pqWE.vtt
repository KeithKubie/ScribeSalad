00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.430
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Well,
welcome, everybody.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300
I'm John Haskell, the
director of the Kluge Center.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.600
The Center welcomes you.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.230
Our staff welcomes you.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.800
The Center, as some of
you know in the room,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.140
brings together scholars
from around the world.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.720
They both stimulate and energize
each other and they distill wisdom

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.640
from the Library's resources.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.580
And they also interact sometimes
with the policymakers here

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.180
in Washington and, of course,
the public like in this event.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.210
Kevin Schwartz, who's the feature
today, is currently a researcher

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.020
at the Oriental Institute of the
Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.210
where he focuses on Iran
and the Persianate world.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.100
Previous positions include being --

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.480
having been a Kluge Center Fellow
here at the Library of Congress.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.230
So he's decided to drop back by.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.710
Distinguished visiting professor
and chair of Middle East Studies

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.280
at the Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Maryland.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.630
Kevin's PhD is from the University
of California at Berkeley.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.860
He has a master's degree from
the Harvard University Center

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.400
for Middle Eastern Studies and
a BA from Columbia University.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.930
In this presentation Dr.
Schwartz uses tazkirahs --

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
authoritative collections
of Persian literary works

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.130
to map divergent conceptualizations
of the world

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.910
of Persian literary culture by
connecting them to one another

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.470
through their geographically
and historically diverse use

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.800
of documented sources and methods
of cataloging and classification.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.560
Doctor Schwartz shines a light

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.810
on how different individuals
demarcated the conceptual

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.260
and geographic boundaries of the
19th century Persianate world

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.750
and shows the hidden value
of the tazkirah genre

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.710
as an historical source for
documenting the intellectual,

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.790
social, and cultural life in
the wider Persianate world.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.510
Please join me in welcoming Kevin.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.450
[ Applause ]

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.750
&gt;&gt; Kevin Schwartz: Okay.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.050
Well, thank you so much
for that kind introduction.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.350
Thanks for having me back.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.870
It's good to be back here at the
Kluge Center where I completed most

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.430
of the research of this project.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.170
So I want to thank
them for hosting me.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.400
Thank you to the [inaudible]
reading room as well,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.700
specifically [inaudible].

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.000
I wrote my dissertation

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.610
in that lovely reading
room about three years ago.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.320
It feels particularly appropriate
to be giving this talk here

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.540
at the Library surrounded by
texts because this library is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.430
about a library of sorts.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.230
And I guess previous to this
research I was more accustomed

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.760
and conditioned to
think about a library

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.580
as this physically
imposing, stationary space.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.160
I never thought about
the process of movement

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.830
that undergirded its functioning.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.710
It sounds a bit silly,
but I just sat at my desk.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.570
I didn't move, the
Library didn't move.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.970
So not much was happening.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.820
But in fact, quite a bit was.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.080
Of course, libraries collect
texts from near and far.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.730
They circulate and distribute
them internally and externally.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.640
People come to use their texts.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.020
And, of course, through these
texts, through these collections

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.500
that are housed in the library,
different people are connected --

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.290
an author with a reader
and two readers

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.880
who are looking they same
text, maybe citing it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.760
in their own scholarly work, maybe
paraphrasing it or plagiarizing it.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.500
And, of course, these
process of movement

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.840
that undergird a library don't
necessarily need to relate

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.150
to a central physical location,
but I think they also can relate

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.090
to wider networks of texts that
aren't in one location and spread

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.650
across a vast geographic land.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.000
And that's really what I'm
going to talk about today:

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.960
A transregional collection of texts
stretching across Islamic Eurasia

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.030
in the early modern and modern
period that serves as a library

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.880
of sorts, a circulating accessible
repository of texts made available

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.130
to users across vast lands who
understood them more or less

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.080
as a type of bounded collection.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.560
Now, using a collection of texts
that are produced and circulated

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.980
across an expansive geographic
space, I think goes a long way

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.470
in understanding how people
were connected with one another

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.820
through shared cultural,
social, and textual norms

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.120
on a transregional basis.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.740
And to highlight some of these
features, I'm going to look

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.810
at one particular type of text,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.370
arguably one of the most
prevalent genres produced

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.310
in the early modern/modern period
across all of Islamic Eurasia,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.640
a work written in Persian and
dedicated to the recording of lives

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.820
of Persian poets, and
that is the tazkirah.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.590
And hopefully I'll be able to first
demonstrate how understanding these

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.680
text collectively as a library
of sorts provides insight

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.760
into a vast transregional
space, constantly shifting

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.750 position:56%
and refashioning itself, and second,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.170
how mapping technology can
elucidate these trends.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.390
So what I'll do is I'll break
my talk into three parts.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.790
First I'll look at the tazkirah,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.430
kind of explain what
a tazkirah is --

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.170
some of its features,
organizational methods.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.580
Then I'll explain a bit about
mapping, this tazkirah library,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.880
building my own database.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.360
And then we'll look at some of
the shifts and transformations

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.880
in this library, how it was
constructed and refashion itself,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.730
morphing and eventually
contracting over time.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.470
So what is a tazkirah?

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.680
Well, the etymology
goes back to the Arabic

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.170
from the root dhkr,
to recall or remember.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.610
And it could be loosely defined
as a biographical anthology

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.100
or biographical dictionary as its
purpose was to collect, collate,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.770
and organize the lives and activity

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.110
of the individuals it
sought to remember.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.520
And in this way may be thought
of as a precursor to a who's who.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.070
And these texts can include
entries on ten individuals

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.200
or thousands of individuals.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.750
And more importantly, it
was a widespread genre

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.350
that appears throughout
Islamic history

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.380
in different languages and formats.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.860 position:56%
So it appears in Ottoman Turkish,
and Arabic, and [inaudible] Persian.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.330
It relates to the lives
of scholars, Sufis,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.310
sultans, and, of course, poets.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.100
And here you just see one
of the most famous ones,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.610
[inaudible] Biography of Saints.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.910
And [inaudible] when the Library

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.930
of Congress World Digital Library
is actually originally in Persian,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.850
but it was translated
into Ottoman Turkish.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.440
So I'm only going to focus on
Persian text about Persian poets,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.440
but I want to be clear that this
constellation of texts is embedded

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.050
in a wider textual economy
that is multilingual.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.490
So what are the major
features of this text?

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.460
Well, they're usually broken
down into three parts.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.950
First you have the
introduction that includes praise.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.840
And that's praise for Allah,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.940
the Prophet Muhammad,
and perhaps a patron.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:44.930
And after that you have in the
introduction the author's biography

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:52.680
where he gives his own
biographical details

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.400
and also lists the
reasons for writing.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:12.570
So this is from a tazkirah Bustan-e
sokhan that's found in Hyderabad.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:22.250
And here this panel is the
beginning page was introduction.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.240
And he's highlighted it with
this word [foreign language,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.540
which is after.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.840
So basically, "After I've given
praise to Allah and the prophet,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.140
now I'm going to tell
you about myself.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.440
I'm going to tell you where
I've come from, what I've done,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.740
and here's the reason for writing."

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.040
After that, you have
the text itself.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.340
And they're usually
organized alphabetically.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.640 position:56%
So all the entries with biographical
details of the individuals,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.940
followed by their births.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.240
And here's, again, the
heading, [foreign language].

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.540
So the section that begins
with [foreign language].

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.840 position:56%
And here's the first poet imam whose
name begins with [foreign language]

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.140
or his pen name begins
with [foreign language].

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.440
And then we have a couple
lines about his life,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.740
how he was a good poet, he
worked with Persian and Hindi.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.540
And afterwards you have his verses.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.330
Now, these texts in
general can be divided

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.120
into two types of organizations.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.910
First you have the general type
of tazkirah, which is an overview

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.690
of poetry of previous centuries.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.480
So here the author tried to
represent the entire spectrum

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.270
of Persian poetic production,

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.060
including his own contemporary
times.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.850
And these texts tend
to be quite long,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.630
the longest one I found
is [foreign language],

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.420
which was produced
in 1790's in Banaras.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.210
And that listed 3,300 individuals.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.000
Now, opposed to that, you can
also have a specialized text,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.790
which focused on remembering a
more restrictive group related

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.570
to a court, one's contemporaries,
literary salon, or geography.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.360
And based on what you
chose, if you're going

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.150
to write a generalized specialized
text, that's going to define

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.940
in many ways your organization.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.730
So these grand compendiums of
the whole historic production

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.510
of Persian poetry usually divided
chronologically, ancients, moderns,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.300
contemporaries, some kind
of variation therein.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.090
And then you had the
specialized ones

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.880
which you have a whole
variety of permutations.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.670
Maybe it's one geography.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.450
Maybe it's one particular
court where poets were active.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.240 position:56%
The permutations are really endless.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.030
You have, for example, [foreign
language] who was talking

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.820
about local poets during his time.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.610
And he divided his text
according to those Hindu poets

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.390
who produced Persian and Muslim
poets, who produced Persian.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.180
And now is probably a good time
to note that Persian poetry,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.970
its production, wasn't restricted
to one ethnicity -- the Persians --

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.760
nor was it restricted to
one religion, Muslims.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.550
It was open to all
faiths and ethnicities.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.330
Now, you can break down these
tazkirahs into two types,

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.120
just know there is
some overlap there.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.910
Even if someone's focusing on
dynastic poets of one court,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.700 position:56%
they'll often situate it in relation
to a previous [inaudible] just

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.490
to you give you a little context.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.270
So there is some overlap indeed.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.060
And how one constructed these texts

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.850
or how they organized
them was equally impacted

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.640
by their own parochial intentions
and their access to sources.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.430
So many authors who were in
search of patronage sought

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.210
out to record the lives of
royals, an elite patron,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.000
poets of a royal court
composing poetry.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.790
And this impulse to
attract patronage

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.580
and [inaudible] work can lead
to the same author, in fact,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.370
reworking their work
multiple times over --

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.150
adding to it, tweaking it slightly

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.940
so it may be repackaged
for a new patron.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.730
So in the early 17th century
you have the author Taki Kashi

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.520
from Kashin in Iran,
he writes this work.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.310
He dedicates it to [inaudible]
shah, then he sprints

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.090
across the Persianate world.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.880
He rewrites it slightly,
slaps on a new dedication,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.670
gives it to another shah
to receive his patronage.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.460
I'm not going to be
too critical of them

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.250
because tomorrow I'm
giving a version

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.030
of this talk slightly different
but more or less the same.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.820
In addition to seeking
out patronage,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.610
others compiled their texts
simply as matters of scholarship,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.400
trying to record the participants
of an ever-growing core

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.190
of Persian poets whether in their
immediate locale and elsewhere.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.970
And of course, I mentioned the
way they organized these texts

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.760
or the way they constructed them
was often based on the sources

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.550
that were accessible to them.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.340
So, for example, people who
traveled, you had the author

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.130
of Mardom dideh, who wrote his book

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.910
in Awrangabad in India
in 1761, 1762.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.700
He donned the garb of the Sufi
wanderer, and he wandered around,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.490
he started collecting versus.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.280
But he was very clear about the
versus he was going to include

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.070
and the lives of individuals
he would include

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.850
in this particular tazkirah
would only be those people he saw

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.640
with his own eyes, Mardom dideh
-- excuse me -- people seen.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.430
And he comes up with
63 such individuals

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.220
who he records in his tazkirah.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.010
What you're seeing here is just one
little map to get a taste of it.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.790
I'll come back to it later.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.580
But here I tried to plot the
author movement from 1600 to 1900.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.370
So you get a sense of how
transregionally connected places

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.160
in Iran, Afghanistan,
and South Asia were.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.950
And what you're seeing
here is you're seeing a dot

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.730
which signifies an
author's birth place.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.520
And then you have the line
which signifies the route

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.310
and the arrow leading to the place
where they produced their text.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.100
So just give you a sense
of how far people traveled

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.890
to produce these texts for a
variety of reasons, maybe in search

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.670
of an opportunity or other reasons.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.460
Now, people didn't have to
travel or don the Sufi garb.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.250
You could be like Reza
Qoli Khan Hedayat.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.040
And I'm realizing somehow makes

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.830
into all my presentations
that one picture of him.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.610
He composes on Majma al-fosaha,

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.400 position:56%
which was the largest six-volume
work in [inaudible] Teheran in 1871.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.190
He didn't travel, he
sat at the court.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.980
He stayed put and he let
the texts come to him.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.770
He took all these texts
that were working their way

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.550
up the bureaucratic network at
the [foreign language] estate.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.340
He used them and created
this massive tazkirah called

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.130
Majma al-fosaha.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.920
I think his predecessor in
Isfahan did him one better,

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.710
Mohammad Taqi Nasrabadi, who
wrote his Takirah-ye Nasrabadi.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.490
And he did so by hanging out in
the coffee houses and coffee houses

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.280
of Isfahan around Naqsheh Jahan,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.070
which is right there,
still existing today.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.860
It was built by Shah [inaudible].

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.650
And he went to the coffee houses
and there he kind of hung out,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.430
rubbed elbows with various
individuals and poets.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.220
It was a kind of open mic night.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.010
People would talk and recite their
poetry, maybe they recite tales

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.800
of other poets they heard about.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.590 position:56%
People would come from far and near.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.370 position:56%
And so he collected all these tales,
just staying put in coffee houses,

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.160 position:56%
ended up producing this great
tazkirah, which is an ode to Isfahan

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.950
and all the people who came
and conglomerated in it.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.740
And ends up being one
of the most widely read

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.530 position:56%
and circulated texts moving forward.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.310
But most importantly, what
was used for the compilation

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.100
of tazkirahs were other sources.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.890
And so what happened was these
tazkirahs authors would come

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.680
into contact with other works.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.470
They'd take bits from their
entries and they used them

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.250
to compile their own works.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.040
These authors then took
this information culled

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.830
from this transregional library,
stuff they cited, paraphrased,

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.620
repackaged, and used it to create
their own tazkirah that was sent

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.410
out to the transregional library,
which would be become part

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.190
of the collection to circulate
anew and used by other authors.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.980
So, again, just like the previous
map I gave with author movement,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.770
this is a map that shows tazkirah
citations from 1700 to 1900.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.560
So the original dot is a
source, the line is a route

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.350
from where that source traveled.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.130
At the end of the line
you have an arrow

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.920
that shows you a particular text
-- that text was used by it.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.710
You would have, for example,
you know, a text somewhere

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.500
in central India, a lot
of arrows coming to it.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.290
That means that one particular
text used quite a bit of sources.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.070
And, again, just as an element

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.860
to show you how transregionally
connected

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.650
and interconnected this sphere
was through texts and tazkirahs.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.440
So I hope this very brief account
of the tazkirah features is able

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.230
to signify that it's
really the ideal text

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.010
to ascertain the ways people
were connected through production

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.800
and circulation of texts across
a vast transregional space

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.590
by participation in a
shared literary sphere.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.380
And because it's known
for the most part where

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.170
and when these texts were produced

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.950
and because they often
referenced other sources

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.740
like you're seeing here,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.530
one can begin to map this literary
sphere using digital technology

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.320
based in a database.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.110 position:56%
And I should add here that until
recently the tazkirah genre has been

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.890
more or less disregarded
by historians.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.680
People would go to it just to
reference one particular verse

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.470
of poetry to see if it was correct

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.260
or referenced a particular birth
date or death date of an author.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.050
So in the words of AKS Lambton,
she said, "Their interest, if any,

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.830 position:56%
to the historian is the witness
they bear, the special literary bent

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.620
of the Persian people, and the
place of the poet in society."

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.410
Now, however, various scholars are
using tazkirah for a whole variety

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.200
of projects -- to reconstruct
individual biographies,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.990
uncover literary debates,
reconstruct poetic networks,

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.770
and a host of other issues.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.560
Now, my goal here is to take
kind of macroanalytical approach

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.350
to the topic, a larger bird's eye
view, leveraging quantifiable data

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.140
to look at this literary
sphere in general

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.510
and understand its major features
and how it shifted it over time.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.070
So what have I been doing?

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.640
More or less all of last year
was creating the database.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.200
Through primary and
secondary sources,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.760
I created these own individual
entries on an author and his text.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.320 position:56%
So here you can just see an example.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.880
I have the author's name.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.450
I have his place of birth.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.010
You can see I don't have his
birth date or death date --

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.570
for some I do, for some I don't.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.130
And, of course, the name of the
text, the date of completion,

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.690
and the place of completion.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.260
And I was able to create entries

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.820
for about 200 texts
between 1200 and 1900.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.380 position:56%
But, again, you can see I don't have
information for every row there.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.940
And of these texts, I have
geographic and temporal data

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.500
for about 145 of them -- that is
the date and place of production.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.070
It's these texts that I used
to map this literary sphere.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.630
So now let's look at some maps.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.190
Here's the growth expansion of the
tazkirah library from the period

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.750
under discussion --
this little video.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.310
And it takes a while to get going.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.880
There weren't many tazkirahs
produced between 1221 and 1487.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.440
Just look for its expansion
over time

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.510
and where these texts
are cropping up.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:34.510
[Inaudible] one more
time if you can.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:41.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.480
Okay. So a lot can be
gleaned from this map,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.450
particularly how tazkirah
production's growth over time

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.420 position:56%
or different spaces intersected with
social and political phenomenon.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.390
So let's start in the pre-16th
century -- or pre-1600, rather.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.360
I mean, not much happening.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.330
There are a couple of texts that
begin to crop up beginning in 1221

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.300
and [inaudible] emergent
in Herat, and then later

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.270
with the emergence of
the Moguls in Delhi.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.240
But you can see this
kind of migration

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.210
of text moving eastward
that's much in line

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.180
with where Persian was
moving at that time.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.150
In the 1600 to 1700
period, you really begin

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.120 position:56%
to see the emergence of [inaudible].

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.090
And this is very much in line
with the rise of the Mogul states.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.060
The Moguls were an empire
that ruled in India based

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.030
out of Delhi from 1525 to 1857.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.000
They lost power in
the late 17th century.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.970
But Persian was their
administrative language.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.940
And finally -- or, not
finally, going on to 1700, 1800,

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.910
now you see this map that shifts.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.880
Suddenly we have the migration
of centers of production leaving

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.850
that center in Delhi and moving
to other places in north India

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.820
and now you're further south.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.790
And this is very much in line
what's happening at the time,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.760
which is the fracture and the
breakup of the Mogul empire.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.730
So that core of Delhi
is no longer there,

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.700 position:56%
but centers are migrating elsewhere.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.670
Poets are finding new
opportunities to produce their text

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.640
and record various poetic activity.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.610
And I'll talk about
that more in a moment.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.580
And then finally in
the 19th century,

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.550
you see a continued
relevance of South Asia,

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.520
but suddenly you see an
explosion of tazkirahs in Iran.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.490
And this is in line
with the Qajar state,

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.460
which existed in Iran
from about 1801 to 1925.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.430
And I'll talk about that
in a moment as well.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.400
But all these vast tazkirahs that
are being produced there are more

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.370
or less in line with
the rise of that state.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.340
So another visualization
is to look at it this way.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.310 position:56%
Just see the growth of tazkirah
produced over time and you could see

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.280
over here there's a steady increase

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.250
from the pre-1600 period
to the 19th.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.220
But at the same time that
doesn't really give us an idea

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.190
of how it intersected with
political trends at the time.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.160
So what we need to do is break
it down into smaller units.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.130
And here it's going
to be a lot easier

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.100
to scrutinize tazkirah production

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.070
and the way they intersected
with political events.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.040
And what you can see --
it should be clear --

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.010
is there are two intense
periods of increased activity:

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.980
One from 1725 to 1775 and
one from 1800 to 1840.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.950
And so I'll talk about
those two in turn.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.920
Why did you have these
increased times

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.890
of [inaudible] production,
tazkirah production?

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.860
Well, the first intense shift,
the first kind of increased period

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.830
of tazkirah growth was the
result of political upheaval.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.800
So you had the breakdown
of the Mogul state

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.770
in the late 17th --
late 17th century.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.740
And this led to dispersal

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.710
of the Persian litterateurs
throughout India.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.680
Places in north India, but
also places further south.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.650
And you had their increased
participation

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.620 position:56%
in non-court literary organizations,
which led to their amplification.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.590
And, of course, you had the
emergence of new courts.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.560 position:56%
So you had successor states cropping

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.530
up after the breakdown
of the Mogul empire.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.500
And that led to new opportunities

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.470
for various poets and
tazkirah authors.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.440
And just to remind ourselves to
go back to this production map,

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.410
that's basically what
you're seeing here.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.380
So with the breakup of the Mogul
empire, you have a migration

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.350
of various little tourists
who are going

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.320
to very north Indian urban
centers [foreign language],

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.290
and they're also coming
further south into the new court

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.260
that was cropping up in Hyderabad.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.230 position:56%
So I think what you can say is two
things about this shift here is one,

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.200
it may be assumed the fraction

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.170
of Mogul power further
amplified the importance

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.140
of already existent urban literary
salons and social gatherings

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.110
as major venues of
quite a production

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.080
that instigate a greater
tendency among those participants

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.050
to record their activities.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.020
So you didn't have the
anchor of the state,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.990
you didn't the umbrella
of patronage.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.960
And what happened, these authors
left, they started mingling

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.930
with their friends who
were non-court [inaudible]

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.900
literary salons.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.870
And I think they felt this urgency
to start recording that activity

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.840
without the apparatus of
the state behind them.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.810
Additionally, the second instance
for people who were going south

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.780
like the state in Hyderabad,
what these states did,

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.750
they actually served as magnets
attracting human poetic capital.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.720
Individuals were versed
in Persianate literary

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.690
and administrative
norms from elsewhere.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.660
So these new states
emerged, they had to rely

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.630
on Persian administrators
as functionaries.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.600
And so they served as magnets
to attract various individuals.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.570
And one of the processes
or effects --

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.540 position:56%
or one of the effects of this
literary migration was the injection

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.510
of a new crop of litterateurs who
were not only poets themselves

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.480
but carried with them tales,
stories, and verses of other poets

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.450
with whom they're acquainted
elsewhere.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.420 position:56%
In other words, the dispersal of the
litterateurs following the fraction

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.390
of the Mogul empire led to a
higher concentration of poets

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.360
in certain locales
and the amplication --

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.330
amplification of poetic
activity there.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.300
And the growth of tazkirahs during
this time, I think, is a reflection

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.270
of this redoubled vibrancy.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.240
You can go back and look at
the author movement map here.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.210
And this is the previous
century before the Mogul kind

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.180
of fractioning of power.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.150
And you can see there's a lot
of transregional movement.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.120
People are moving from Iran and
back to produce their tazkirahs.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.090
But in the period of
Mogul fracturing,

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.060
you really see a whole fluttering
of activity now around them --

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.030
people moving around, finding
new venues and new outlets

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.510
to produce their poetry
and record poetic activity.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.080
So the other intense
shift, the other moment

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.650
of increased poetic production is
the emergence of the Qajar state.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.220
And that happens in
1801 or 1800 here.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.790
And 53 tazkirahs were
produced under Qajars --

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:47.360
that's 60% of the 19th
century tazkirahs.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.930 position:56%
And tazkirahs at this time really
became a state project of producing,

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.500
collecting, and collating works.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.070
And the Qajars, they used
bureaucratic networks

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.640
to collect all these works, send
them up the bureaucratic pipeline,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.210
and create the vortex of poetic
production relevant to their rein.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.780
So from the case of India,

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.350
the breakup of the Mogul
empire lent itself to a kind

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.920
of horizontal distribution
of tazkirah production.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.490
For the Qajars it became a
process of vertical integration,

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.060
the collection of texts for outside
localities in Iran into Teheran.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.630 position:56%
In other words there became interest

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.200
in collecting information
specifically

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.770
in locales during their rein
and throughout their lands

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:37.340
to create a massive compendium

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.910
to demonstrate their
contributions to poetic culture.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.480 position:56%
So from the early days of their
rein, the Qajars invested themselves

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.050
in reconstructing a
library of tazkirahs.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.620
Serving as patrons,
collectors, and composers,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.190
the ruling family helped
churn the wheels of production

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.760
and use the Qajar state
bureaucracy to commission,

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.330
collate, and compose works.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.900 position:56%
The result was the transformation of
a once decentralized library cutting

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.470
across regions into one that was
now circumscribed to focus squarely

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.040
on textual production
in Iran itself.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.610
Royals, elites, and
government officials served

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.180
as the primary patrons
of tazkirah production.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.750
The work of poets located in
Iran during the Qajar period,

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.320
many times the poetry of
Qajar period itself served

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.890
as a primary focal point.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.460 position:56%
In other words, what they were doing
is they were reconstructing this

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.030
tazkirah library in their
own image, localizing it,

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.600
and making it relevant to
their own contributions.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.170
And here, again, you can see
tazkirah production [inaudible]

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.740
production there.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.310
It's happening right around
the center in Teheran.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.880
And even a better map
of that is here.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.450
This is a kernel density map,

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.020
which essentially is collating
both geographic and temporal data

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.590
to show you where the highest
dense points of production are.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.160
And you can see while that
exist in Isfahon and Shiraz,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.730
it's clearly centered
around Teheran.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.300
So this process to remake
the tazkirah library

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.870
in their own image really
begins with Fath Ali Shah

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.440
and continues after his death.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.010
And you can see this decade break
kind of tazkirah production more

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.580
or less corresponds by type to
his rein, which is right in here.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.150
And it's attributable
to his efforts.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.720
So Fath Ali Shah, he
commissioned works related

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.290
to [inaudible] production
throughout the lands,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.860
in particular places
outside of Teheran.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.430
And Qajar [inaudible] themselves
commissioned works often in praise

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.000
of themselves in a host of cities.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.570
And these texts made
their way up the pipeline

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.140
to create more general works,
which he did in his rein

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.710
and his successors did as well.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.280
Now, we had some help
in this regard.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.850
He had 48 sons, many
of whom were scattered

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.420
in various government
positions across Iran and eager

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.990 position:56%
to establish their own cultural bona
fides, they had texts commissioned

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.560
by their own local poets
oftentimes in praise of them.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.130
And these local efforts, too,
were sent to their father

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.700
so he can create his
own over-arching text.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.270 position:56%
And even absent the commissioning
of works, other works solely devoted

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.840
to poets of individual cities like
[inaudible], Shiraz, [inaudible],

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.410
and elsewhere began to crop up.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.980
And even the one commissioned
by the Qajars,

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.550 position:56%
they were used for the same purpose.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.120
And, again, we can get back
to the author movement here

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.690
and just see unlike previous
periods, there was not a lot

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.260
of transregional movement
leaving Iran.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.830
All of a sudden there's
all these opportunities

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.400
to create texts based
on local circumstances.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.970
So obviously it's situated
in Teheran,

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.540 position:56%
but there are places elsewhere where
people didn't have to go very far

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.110
or not leave at all
to create those works.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.680
And those dots you see, those
are reflective or signify people

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.250
who were born in one place
and also produced their texts

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.820
in that place as well.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.390
So, again, something has
definitely shifted here.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.960 position:56%
There are now new opportunities for
poets to record their local efforts.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.530
And all these efforts are
being kind of funneled

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.100
up into the central state
and the bureaucratic pipeline

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.670
to create massive texts
under Fath Ali Shah later,

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:47.240
one of which is Majma
al-fosaha, which we saw earlier,

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.810
by Reza Qoli Khan Hedayat.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.380
The last example I think I'll give

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.950
in this regard how I think this
literary space was changing

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.520
and how this kind of terrace
regional library's being localized

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.090
is by looking at citations.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.660
So while the citation of a text
by another can mean a variety

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.230
of things, from a scholar
using a cited text as source

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.800
to one simply wishing to
bad their bibliographies,

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.370
I think what it can tell us is how
individual authors conceived their

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.010
literary universe and how
they came to view their works.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.980
So here you have a citation network
from 1700 to 1800, and, again,

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.940
it's quite vast, interconnects
places

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.910
from Afghanistan to
Iran and South Asia.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.870
And you have the same map
here for the 19th century.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.840
So, again, very vast.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.800
I would say there's more of
a concentration internally

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.770
in South Asia and Iran,
but there still are those

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.730
transregional connections.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.700
The only problem with this
map is it's a bit misleading,

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.660
it doesn't distinguish between
author citing a text produced

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.630
in the 19th century
versus the 13th century.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.590
So if an author used a
text in the 13th century

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.560
across the Persianate
sphere, it will be mapped

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.520 position:56%
with a long arcing line, it doesn't
tell us much about how local authors

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.490
in 19th century conceptualized
the tazkirah library at that time.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.450
What we can do, though, and what
I've done is to compare two texts

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.420
that have vast citation
lists in their introductions.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.380
And they occur around the
same time at opposite ends

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.350
of the Persianiate world.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.310
One is Majma al-fosaha, which
I referenced several times,

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.280
[inaudible] in Teheran in 1871,

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.240
and Negarestan-sokhan,
which is 1875 in Bhopal.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.210
And I think what you can understand
comparing the citation list is how

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.170
they began to see a more local
and less transregional type

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.140
of library -- a shift that was
happening certainly in Iran

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.100
and also in India as well.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.070
And what's interesting
comparing these lists --

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.030
and they both list them
in their introduction,

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.000 position:56%
so they're not just found in various
entries but they're very conscious

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.960
about the text they're using --

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.930
is that they only have six shared
citations and none after 1679.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.890 position:56%
Additionally, they have no citations
of text from the other side

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.860
of the Persianate literary sphere.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.820
So that means a 19th
century author located

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.790
in Iran is not referencing
any texts in the 17th, 18,

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.750
19th century in South Asia.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.720
And likewise in South Asia, there's
no reference to any text in Iran

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.680
in the 18th and 19th century.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.650
So here's their kind
of citation comparison.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.610
And you can see there are quite
a few lines connecting them.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.580
Their shared texts are marked
by some of these triangles.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.540
But, again, all of these shared
texts occur previous to 1679.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.510
If you remove those and just
select the texts that are produced

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.470
after that period, you see
that their conceptualization

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.440
and their use of sources is
certainly more circumspect.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.400 position:56%
So, again, this transregional sphere
based upon tazkirah production was

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.370
being localized for a variety of
reasons, particularly the efforts

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.330
of the Qajars during that time.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.300
I think that's a good
place to leave things.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.260
I hope I've given you a small taste

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.230
of the transregional
Persianate sphere

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.190
in the early modern/modern period

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.160
and how highlighting various
features of one particular genre

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.120
of text and how through
conceptualizing them as a library

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.090
and the use of mapping
technology you can begin

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.050 position:56%
to understand how a vast
transregional space grew, developed,

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.020
morphed, and eventually contracted.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.510
Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Kevin Schwartz: Sure.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.310
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about
a couple of things.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.570
They were very insightful.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.840
Thank you for a wonderful talk.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.100
On one of the maps [inaudible]
you showed [inaudible]

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.370
to central Asia as well.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.630
And then I think it was [inaudible]
where it was a couple of items

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.900
from at least one spot
in that [inaudible].

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.160
I am curious, the works that
came out of [inaudible] had to do

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.430
with the [inaudible]; how much
[inaudible] are you writing

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.690
of [inaudible]?

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.960
B, in central Asia, what's the sort

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.220
of regional anomaly [inaudible]
salvation or the [inaudible]

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.490
or was it more connected?

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good questions.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.020
First, with the case of
Baghdad, so I'm just trying

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.280
to pull up the 18th to 1900 map.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.550
Yeah, I forget this exact text.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.810
That's certainly anomaly.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.080
There aren't many Persian
tazkirahs being produced then.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.340
I mean, it's the furthest as
you kind of get into the kind

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.610
of multilingual sphere will be
happening up in [inaudible].

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.870 position:56%
And you do find collections of texts
that are including of Turkish poetry

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.140
or [foreign language] poetry.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.400
As far as central Asia, you can
see there's really a big gap.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.670 position:56%
I mean, most of the texts from the
earlier period are actually produced

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.930
in central Asia, mainly
around Iraq [inaudible].

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.200
One of the most famous texts,
[inaudible], comes out of there.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.460
But beyond that, I don't have
many citations for central Asia.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.730
Doesn't mean none exist.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.010
It means the sources --

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.810

[ Inaudible ]

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.810

[ Inaudible ]

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.510

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.510
But I'm not -- yeah.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:27.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.100
No. I mean, there were connections.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.690
I mean, I don't remember that
exact entry and I don't know a lot

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.280
about all of these exact entries.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.870
There's 200 of them
or 144 in this case.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.460
But no, you certainly had
examples of litterateurs going

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.050
from Sentral Asia and producing
tazkirahs in South Asia.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.640
Some of the [inaudible]
exist at the time.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.230
I think that there are quite
a few central Asian tazkirahs

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.820
to be discovered in
the 19th century.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.410
And that's where I think
the real big gap is.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.010
And again, I think for me it's a
consequence of access to sources.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.010
[ Inaudible ]

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.810

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:24.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.320
And B, would you say
this is beginning

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.120
of what has now become
a problem for the rest

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.930
of Persian [inaudible]
nationalized by nation-states?

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:35.730
And I also think maybe
in Afghanistan

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.540 position:56%
because they're doing [inaudible] is
this effort to sort of [inaudible]

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.340 position:56%
as a -- what do you call it
[inaudible] and not so much connects

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.150 position:56%
onto the classics of Persian
[inaudible] non-regional [inaudible]

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.950
to the larger region?

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Schwartz: Yeah.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.560
I mean -- I mean, no, this
is the rise of, I think,

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.370
Persian nationalism, literary
nationalism in Iran that seeks

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.170
to really redefine the
boundaries of [foreign language].

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.980
You know, [foreign language] at
the place of Persian production

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.780
where Persians served
as a lingua franca.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.590
And it was expansive.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.390
But in this time it
begins to shrink.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.200
And one of the prime movers
in that is this sabk-i hindi,

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.000
which is understood to
be this really abstruse,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.810
difficult to understand,
negatively impactful style.

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:20.610
And, you know, I talked about
this in my dissertation,

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.420
but it's really the prime mover.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.220
I mean, what people like Hedayat --

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.030
and I keep on coming back to
Hedayat -- but other people do.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.830
And going into the early
20th century is they pick

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:34.640
up on this notion that
there was this bad type

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.440
of Persian poetry floating around
and necessitates the rescuing

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.250
of Persian poetry by the Iranians.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.050
And they went to this
Baz Gash movement

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.860
where they rekindled the
spirit of the ancient masters.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.660
They went back to Rumi,
Hafez, Saadi, and Ferdowsi.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.470
And that is pretty much the
nail in the coffin that begins

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.270
to separate the two
spheres of the time.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.080
So I mean, sabk-i hindi was a big
impact later on when people began

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.880
to conceptualize the borders
of [foreign language].

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.690
At this point, though, I mean,

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.490
people weren't really
thinking in those terms.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.300
I think they were just
thinking really, really locally.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.100
I think people all
of a sudden realized

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.910
that local tazkirahs had relevance,

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.710
that you could praise a certain
ruler wherever they were --

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.520
usually one of the shah's
sons throughout Iran --

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.320
and you'd get some
kind of largess for it.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.130 position:56%
And also that there were
opportunities now in the Qajar state

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.930
that didn't exist certainly in
the 18th century during the kind

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.740 position:56%
of Nader Shah period but also in the
[foreign language] period as well.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.540
So I think there was this kind
of renewed vigor to collect

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.350
and report poetic activity.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.150
But I mean, you're right, though,

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.960
things are happening
where it's fracturing.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.760
And these places where Persian
still existed, at least represented

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.570
through tazkirahs,
are kind of dying out.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.370
They're becoming enclaves
or islands onto themselves.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.180
And there's other reasons
for that, too.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.510
There's the rise of the British,
there's the rise of Urdu.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:25.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.690
&gt;&gt; They don't go eastward.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.870
So I'm wondering if anything --

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.050
has anything been found along trade
routes in China or does Persia end?

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.230
And the second question
is why coffee houses?

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.410
The coffee house where
-- why not tea?

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.590
And I'm not making any sense.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.950
So --

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.130
&gt;&gt; But I guess it --
it surprised me.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.310

why [inaudible].

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.490
&gt;&gt; Kevin Schwartz: Yeah.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.670
Well, this is a --

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.850
these representations are very much
a consequence of me solely focusing

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.030
on Persian tazkirahs
of Persian poets.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.210
So there -- I mean, I think the
most kind of prolific tazkirah

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.390
that goes really outside
into regions

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.570
that I haven't highlighted
have to do with Sufis.

tazkirahs in [inaudible] China.

There's a recent book about it.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.110
And so that definitely exists.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:32.290
And you'll find tazkirahs
of Persian and travelogues

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.470
and all different types of
Persian in various places --

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.650
Thailand, Nepal, Sri
Lanka, what have you.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.830
As far as coffee houses go, I can't
answer why it was chosen over tea.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.010
But in the [foreign language]
period, they did crop up all

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.190
around that square, Naqsheh Jahan,
which is still existent today

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.370
and still has a lot of coffee
houses and meeting places.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.550 position:56%
And that was just a space for poets.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.730
The Safed court at that time
didn't really have a lot

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.910
of opportunities for poets.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.090
So most poets who wanted to
make money, they'd either go

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.270
to India or they had another job.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.450
They were usually craftsman during
the day and night they'd go hang

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.630
out in the coffee houses
and recite their poetry.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.810
And luckily they had this one
amazing archivist essentially

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:20.010
who sat there and recorded
all their works.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.910
Yeah, there are some.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:29.310
There are some.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.700
And some of these tazkirahs are
solely devoted to women poets.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.100
I mean, they're a small proportion.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.500
But even in the Qajar times,
there's a tazkirah that's related

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.890
to women poets and specifically
those of the shah's harem.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.290
So they usually tend to
focus on royal families.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.690 position:56%
It's much harder to find kind of
on-the-street women poets going back

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.080
to early and modern times.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.480
But certainly we do
find tazkirahs of royal,

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.880
elite women who are
composing poetry.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.280
&gt;&gt; So essentially just [inaudible]
it is that more and more --

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.670
it was sort of a regional
development in Persia

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.070
and [inaudible] later
trends that [inaudible].

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.470
It was just phenomena
of [inaudible].

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.860
There were a lot of the
[inaudible] regions and centers.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.260
Is that a --

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.660
&gt;&gt; Kevin Schwartz: Yeah.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:27.050
I mean, again, I think it's a good
way to explain tazkirah production

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.450
at this time, that there seems
to be less transregional overlap

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:33.850
but certainly not for Persian
language and literature in general.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.250
I mean, a lot of the great
newspapers in Persian were cropping

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.640
up in Bombay, they were cropping
up elsewhere, in Istanbul.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.040
And they were crucial in the
constitutional revolution.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.440 position:56%
And of course you have transregional
connections among the Parsi

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.830
community and their impact in both
philology and education in Iran.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.230
So I mean, that's the one
thing I have to square.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.630 position:56%
And, you know, again, it's a
consequence of trying to use mapping

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:01.020
and keep it restrictive so I
can actually map, you know,

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.420
a select group of texts and
not have to map of entirety

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.820
of Persian literary
sphere but also be kind

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.220
of more attuned to those trends.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.610
Because I mean, transregionalism
was still happening.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:18.010
It just wasn't happening
in the way, you know --

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:19.520
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.730
Right, right.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.930
I mean, it's going to
have to be situated

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.140
in the larger kind of
transregional moment.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.350
But I think that's, you
know, definitely, again,

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.550
one drawback of this work that
doesn't bring in different texts.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.760
And so that was my
caveat at the beginning.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.970
This is a whole kind
of multilingual sphere.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.170
There's a whole other, you know,

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.380
genre going on with [foreign
language] that also are kind

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.590
of integrated into the space.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.800
But for purposes of practicality,
unless this is crowd-sourced,

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.510
I just had to focus on tazkirahs.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:56.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.010
No, it's just -- it's
an ongoing project.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.510
And the idea is that more
people contribute to this

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:07.010
and start creating entries
for Urdu tazkirahs as well.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.510
And you begin to see a big trend
in mid-19th century South Asia

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:14.010
where most of the tazkirahs

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.510
of Persian poets are actually
being produced now in Urdu.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.010
So they're written in Urdu, but
then you have the actual selections

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.510
that are in Persian because
it's about Persian poets.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:28.010
So I'm hoping people will get
involved on that side of it.

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.510
I think there are tazkirahs
for Ottoman Turkish.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:35.010
But, again, it's kind of a vast
project, but I really wanted

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.510
to show also the ways in which you
can use kind of mapping technology

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:42.010
to understand transregionalism.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.310
Well, if there are
no other questions,

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.610
thanks so much for attending.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:45.910
It's 4:00 p.m. on Friday,
so I really appreciate it.
