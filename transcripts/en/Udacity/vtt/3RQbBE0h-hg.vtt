We just saw that this equation was a circle, with a radius of 10. So now let's

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.115
consider some other points. Do you think each of these points would be, inside

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:15.988
of our circle? Outside of our circle? Or on the circle. Choose one of these for

00:00:15.988 --> 00:00:19.385
each of the points. Keep in mind if it's on the circle, this point, the x and y

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:24.686
value, would satisfy our equation. If it doesn't satisfy the equation, then

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:30.204
think about what kind of numbers our results would be inside the circle and

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:36.376
what kind would be outside. Good luck here.
