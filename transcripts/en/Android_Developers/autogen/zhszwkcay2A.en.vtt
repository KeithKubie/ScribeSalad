00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.810
design by I'd like to talk to you about
how screen pixel density affects your

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820
how screen pixel density affects your
 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.670

let's take a look so the first thing to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190
let's take a look so the first thing to
 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.430
let's take a look so the first thing to
understand is that Android devices come

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440
understand is that Android devices come
 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.890
understand is that Android devices come
in all shapes and sizes and the screens

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900
in all shapes and sizes and the screens
 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.779
in all shapes and sizes and the screens
on these devices have different pixel

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789
on these devices have different pixel
 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.810
on these devices have different pixel
densities and this number is measured in

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820
densities and this number is measured in
 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.840
densities and this number is measured in
dots per inch or dpi and these pixel

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850
dots per inch or dpi and these pixel
 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.450
dots per inch or dpi and these pixel
densities simply say you know in a given

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460
densities simply say you know in a given
 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.389
densities simply say you know in a given
square say inch of space on the screen

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399
square say inch of space on the screen
 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.509
square say inch of space on the screen
how many pixels will fit in and this

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519
how many pixels will fit in and this
 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.880
how many pixels will fit in and this
determines very much the kind of the

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890
determines very much the kind of the
 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.189
determines very much the kind of the
level of crispness that you're going to

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199
level of crispness that you're going to
 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.229
level of crispness that you're going to
see graphics and text and things like

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239
see graphics and text and things like
 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.410
see graphics and text and things like
that on that screen so in this example

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
that on that screen so in this example
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.869
that on that screen so in this example
here a couple of different dpi values

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879
here a couple of different dpi values
 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.649
here a couple of different dpi values
possible dpi values and how text in this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659
possible dpi values and how text in this
 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.750
possible dpi values and how text in this
case the letter a would be rendered on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760
case the letter a would be rendered on
 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.549
case the letter a would be rendered on
those screens you'll notice that on the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559
those screens you'll notice that on the
 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.740
those screens you'll notice that on the
higher density screens the letter A is

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750
higher density screens the letter A is
 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.410
higher density screens the letter A is
rendered in a much more crisp a much

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420
rendered in a much more crisp a much
 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.469
rendered in a much more crisp a much
more almost correct representation of

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479
more almost correct representation of
 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.330
more almost correct representation of
the letter A than on the medium density

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340
the letter A than on the medium density
 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.200
the letter A than on the medium density
screen on the left now as a designer

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210
screen on the left now as a designer
 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.039

these pixel densities like 165 234 and

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049
these pixel densities like 165 234 and
 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:20.580
these pixel densities like 165 234 and
so on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590
so on
 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.160
so on
could be very cumbersome to work with so

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170
could be very cumbersome to work with so
 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.779
could be very cumbersome to work with so
fortunately Android has created

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789
fortunately Android has created
 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.450
fortunately Android has created
something called logical pixel densities

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460
something called logical pixel densities
 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.539
something called logical pixel densities
or buckets of densities that the real

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549
or buckets of densities that the real
 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.389
or buckets of densities that the real
densities would fall into to simplify

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399
densities would fall into to simplify
 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.109
densities would fall into to simplify
things and so here on screen you see a

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119
things and so here on screen you see a
 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.569
things and so here on screen you see a
couple of the key the most important

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579
couple of the key the most important
 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.760
couple of the key the most important
logical densities that you as a designer

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770
logical densities that you as a designer
 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.160
logical densities that you as a designer
would have to work with so something

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170
would have to work with so something
 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.120
would have to work with so something
like if a real device had 165 dpi screen

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130
like if a real device had 165 dpi screen
 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.870
like if a real device had 165 dpi screen
that would be mapped down to 160 dpi and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
that would be mapped down to 160 dpi and
 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.789
that would be mapped down to 160 dpi and
then everything that you would do from

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799
then everything that you would do from
 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.709
then everything that you would do from
that point on you wouldn't have to worry

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719
that point on you wouldn't have to worry
 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.380
that point on you wouldn't have to worry
about the 165 number you simply think

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390
about the 165 number you simply think
 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.499
about the 165 number you simply think
about oh this screen I will treat as a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
about oh this screen I will treat as a
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.830
about oh this screen I will treat as a
160 dpi screen and 160 dpi is a special

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840
160 dpi screen and 160 dpi is a special
 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.289
160 dpi screen and 160 dpi is a special
value it's something called the baseline

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299
value it's something called the baseline
 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.230
value it's something called the baseline
density on Android wear everything and

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240
density on Android wear everything and
 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.000
density on Android wear everything and
specifically the the density independent

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
specifically the the density independent
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.950
specifically the the density independent
pixel units we'll talk about in a second

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960
pixel units we'll talk about in a second
 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.570
pixel units we'll talk about in a second
where everything is

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580
where everything is
 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.200
where everything is
based on this baseline density so that's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210
based on this baseline density so that's
 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.840
based on this baseline density so that's
160 dpi at the other foreigner of the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850
160 dpi at the other foreigner of the
 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.500
160 dpi at the other foreigner of the
spectrum currently the highest number

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
spectrum currently the highest number
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.230
spectrum currently the highest number
the highest logical density is extra

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240
the highest logical density is extra
 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.610
the highest logical density is extra
extra high DPI or xxhdpi which is 480

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620
extra high DPI or xxhdpi which is 480
 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.790
extra high DPI or xxhdpi which is 480
dots per inch and so there are four

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800
dots per inch and so there are four
 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.150
dots per inch and so there are four
specific densities between 160 and 480

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
specific densities between 160 and 480
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.680
specific densities between 160 and 480
that you should really be aware of

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
that you should really be aware of
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.780
that you should really be aware of
that's 160 240 320 and 480 now there are

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790
that's 160 240 320 and 480 now there are
 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.980
that's 160 240 320 and 480 now there are
a couple that are not listed here

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990
a couple that are not listed here
 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.570
a couple that are not listed here
there's a ldpi at 120 and TV DPI at 213

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
there's a ldpi at 120 and TV DPI at 213
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.250
there's a ldpi at 120 and TV DPI at 213
but those are less common and you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260
but those are less common and you
 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.270
but those are less common and you
generally don't need to worry about

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
generally don't need to worry about
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.990
generally don't need to worry about
those so now that we understand density

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000
those so now that we understand density
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.760
those so now that we understand density
let's now talk about something that's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770
let's now talk about something that's
 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.680
let's now talk about something that's
critical to designing for Android and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690
critical to designing for Android and
 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.960
critical to designing for Android and
that's the density independent pixel

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970
that's the density independent pixel
 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.900
that's the density independent pixel
unit now density independent pixel units

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910
unit now density independent pixel units
 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.199
unit now density independent pixel units
which are sometimes abbreviated as DP or

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209
which are sometimes abbreviated as DP or
 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.010
which are sometimes abbreviated as DP or
di P sometimes referred to as dips in

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020
di P sometimes referred to as dips in
 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.860
di P sometimes referred to as dips in
conversation they're a virtual pixel

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870
conversation they're a virtual pixel
 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.360
conversation they're a virtual pixel
unit and they're equivalent to one

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370
unit and they're equivalent to one
 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.090
unit and they're equivalent to one
physical pixel that's one physical pixel

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100
physical pixel that's one physical pixel
 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.750
physical pixel that's one physical pixel
on the screen on an mdpi or 160 dpi

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
on the screen on an mdpi or 160 dpi
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.560
on the screen on an mdpi or 160 dpi
screen and now if you have you know a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
screen and now if you have you know a
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.009
screen and now if you have you know a
single density independent pixel on a

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019
single density independent pixel on a
 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.070
single density independent pixel on a
mdpi screen that's one physical pixel

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080
mdpi screen that's one physical pixel
 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.890
mdpi screen that's one physical pixel
but if you're on a larger screen let's

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
but if you're on a larger screen let's
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.800
but if you're on a larger screen let's
say an xhdpi screen it's actually four

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
say an xhdpi screen it's actually four
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.390
say an xhdpi screen it's actually four
pixels two across and two down so why do

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400
pixels two across and two down so why do
 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.030
pixels two across and two down so why do
we use density independent pixels well

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040
we use density independent pixels well
 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.440
we use density independent pixels well
the reason for that is that we want to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450
the reason for that is that we want to
 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.970
the reason for that is that we want to
make sure that when we create layouts

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980
make sure that when we create layouts
 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.880
make sure that when we create layouts
and overall kind of define the user

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890
and overall kind of define the user
 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.790
and overall kind of define the user
interface for our application we want to

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800
interface for our application we want to
 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.030
interface for our application we want to
make sure that the UI elements remain

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
make sure that the UI elements remain
 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.120
make sure that the UI elements remain
the same physical size approximately

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130
the same physical size approximately
 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.920
the same physical size approximately
across devices with different densities

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930
across devices with different densities
 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.410
across devices with different densities
we don't want to have to specify for

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420
we don't want to have to specify for
 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.650
we don't want to have to specify for
each individual density what the sizes

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660
each individual density what the sizes
 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.140
each individual density what the sizes
of our UI elements should be so let's

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150
of our UI elements should be so let's
 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.520
of our UI elements should be so let's
look at an example so here we have 200

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530
look at an example so here we have 200
 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.159
look at an example so here we have 200
dips and again dip units or DP units

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169
dips and again dip units or DP units
 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.350

like the tablet you see here 200 dps

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730
like the tablet you see here 200 dps
 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.610
like the tablet you see here 200 dps
will actually result in something that

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620
will actually result in something that
 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.450
will actually result in something that
is 200 pixels tall so again 1 DP is 1

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460
is 200 pixels tall so again 1 DP is 1
 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.659
is 200 pixels tall so again 1 DP is 1

and this is actually built in behavior

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380
and this is actually built in behavior
 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.140
and this is actually built in behavior
if you specify that something should be

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150

thing about DP units is that since

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760
thing about DP units is that since
 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.370
thing about DP units is that since
they're the same physical size across

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380
they're the same physical size across
 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.770
they're the same physical size across
devices we can start representing

that means is that when you are sizing

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990
that means is that when you are sizing
 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.620
that means is that when you are sizing
your buttons and other UI elements you

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630
your buttons and other UI elements you
 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.540
your buttons and other UI elements you
want to make sure that things don't get

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550
want to make sure that things don't get
 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.510
want to make sure that things don't get

button without making too many mistakes
so let's look at some math that will

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289
so let's look at some math that will
 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.020
so let's look at some math that will
help us get comfortable with converting

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030
help us get comfortable with converting
 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.860
help us get comfortable with converting
between pixels and DP units now here's

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870
between pixels and DP units now here's
 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.620

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630
the only real formula you need to solve
 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.750
the only real formula you need to solve
for one of the variables you simply plug

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760
for one of the variables you simply plug
 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.300
for one of the variables you simply plug
in the other two so let's look at some

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310
in the other two so let's look at some
 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.920
in the other two so let's look at some
examples so here's the the definition of

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930
examples so here's the the definition of
 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.219
examples so here's the the definition of
DPS one pixel is one dip or one dip is

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229
DPS one pixel is one dip or one dip is
 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:14.400
DPS one pixel is one dip or one dip is
one pixel at 160 dpi easy enough now on

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410
one pixel at 160 dpi easy enough now on
 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.909
one pixel at 160 dpi easy enough now on
a 320 dpi screen one dip is actually 2

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919
a 320 dpi screen one dip is actually 2
 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.260
a 320 dpi screen one dip is actually 2
pixels 2 pixels across and 2 pixels down

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270
pixels 2 pixels across and 2 pixels down
 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.730
pixels 2 pixels across and 2 pixels down
so let's actually put this equation in

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740
so let's actually put this equation in
 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.560
so let's actually put this equation in
practice and look at a quick exercise

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570
practice and look at a quick exercise
 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.560
practice and look at a quick exercise
so how big is the 2013 Nexus 7 screen in

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570
so how big is the 2013 Nexus 7 screen in
 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.300
so how big is the 2013 Nexus 7 screen in
density-independent pixels now the

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310
density-independent pixels now the
 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.310
density-independent pixels now the
information we have is that we know that

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320
information we have is that we know that
 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.290
information we have is that we know that
the screen is seven inches across

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300
the screen is seven inches across
 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.410
the screen is seven inches across
diagonally we know that it's an xhdpi

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420
diagonally we know that it's an xhdpi
 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.480
diagonally we know that it's an xhdpi
screen meaning it's a 320 dpi screen and

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490
screen meaning it's a 320 dpi screen and
 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.800
screen meaning it's a 320 dpi screen and
we also know that the screen resolution

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810
we also know that the screen resolution
 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.870
we also know that the screen resolution
is 1920 by 1200 pixels and so the first

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880
is 1920 by 1200 pixels and so the first
 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.640
is 1920 by 1200 pixels and so the first
thing you may want to ask yourself is

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650
thing you may want to ask yourself is
 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.340
thing you may want to ask yourself is
you know what information here is

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350
you know what information here is
 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.340
you know what information here is
necessary now the fact that it's a 7

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350
necessary now the fact that it's a 7
 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.780
necessary now the fact that it's a 7
inch screen here is not actually

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790
inch screen here is not actually
 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.030
inch screen here is not actually
necessary to calculate the number of

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040
necessary to calculate the number of
 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.980
necessary to calculate the number of
density-independent pixels we don't

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990
density-independent pixels we don't
 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.870
density-independent pixels we don't
actually need a diagonal screen size if

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880
actually need a diagonal screen size if
 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.400
actually need a diagonal screen size if
we have the number of pixels and the

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.410
we have the number of pixels and the
 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.710
we have the number of pixels and the
density so if you look at the formula

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720
density so if you look at the formula
 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.830
density so if you look at the formula
from before you'll notice that the ratio

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840
from before you'll notice that the ratio
 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.660
from before you'll notice that the ratio
between xhdpi and mdpi is 2 to 1 so to

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670
between xhdpi and mdpi is 2 to 1 so to
 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.600
between xhdpi and mdpi is 2 to 1 so to
convert from pixels to DP units on an

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610
convert from pixels to DP units on an
 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.620
convert from pixels to DP units on an
xhdpi device you simply divide by 2 and

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630
xhdpi device you simply divide by 2 and
 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.620
xhdpi device you simply divide by 2 and
so the answer here is 1920 divided by 2

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630
so the answer here is 1920 divided by 2
 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.600
so the answer here is 1920 divided by 2
by 1200 divided by 2 or simply 960 by

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610
by 1200 divided by 2 or simply 960 by
 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.960
by 1200 divided by 2 or simply 960 by
600 density independent pixels so you

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:41.970
600 density independent pixels so you
 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.640
600 density independent pixels so you
may be asking what's the point of this

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.650
may be asking what's the point of this
 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.620
may be asking what's the point of this
calculation well the reason is that

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:45.630
calculation well the reason is that
 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.690
calculation well the reason is that
density independent pixels better

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:47.700
density independent pixels better
 

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.770
density independent pixels better
capture device physical screen size

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.780
capture device physical screen size
 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.480
capture device physical screen size
pixels could be the same across devices

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490
pixels could be the same across devices
 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.820
pixels could be the same across devices
of different screen sizes for example

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:55.830
of different screen sizes for example
 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.160
of different screen sizes for example
you can have a medium density tablet at

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.170
you can have a medium density tablet at
 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.030
you can have a medium density tablet at
1280 by 800 pixels and an extra high

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.040
1280 by 800 pixels and an extra high
 

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.110
1280 by 800 pixels and an extra high
density phone at 1280 by 720 pixels and

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120
density phone at 1280 by 720 pixels and
 

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.180
density phone at 1280 by 720 pixels and
their screen resolutions and pixels are

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.190
their screen resolutions and pixels are
 

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.360
their screen resolutions and pixels are
almost the same but that same phone will

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:11.370
almost the same but that same phone will
 

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.070
almost the same but that same phone will
actually have a much smaller screen

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080
actually have a much smaller screen
 

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.860
actually have a much smaller screen
resolution when looked at in terms of

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:15.870
resolution when looked at in terms of
 

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.920
resolution when looked at in terms of
density independent pixels and so

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:17.930
density independent pixels and so
 

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.390
density independent pixels and so
density independent pixels better

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400
density independent pixels better
 

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.620
density independent pixels better
capture that so with that let's move on

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:24.630
capture that so with that let's move on
 

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.890
capture that so with that let's move on
to some quick tips before we sign off so

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900
to some quick tips before we sign off so
 

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.280
to some quick tips before we sign off so
first remember to design inspect all of

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.290
first remember to design inspect all of
 

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.100
first remember to design inspect all of
your layouts in terms of arrangement of

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.110
your layouts in terms of arrangement of
 

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.380
your layouts in terms of arrangement of
UI elements the sizes of elements the

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:36.390
UI elements the sizes of elements the
 

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.690
UI elements the sizes of elements the
positions of elements make sure to spec

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700
positions of elements make sure to spec
 

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.980
positions of elements make sure to spec
that all out in deep

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:39.990
that all out in deep
 

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.750
that all out in deep
units it's gonna make it a lot easier

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760
units it's gonna make it a lot easier
 

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.600

for your developers to implement things

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:44.610
for your developers to implement things
 

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.190
for your developers to implement things
correctly ii remember that because there

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200
correctly ii remember that because there
 

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.690
correctly ii remember that because there
are a number of different densities for

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700
are a number of different densities for
 

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.750
are a number of different densities for
optimal crispness of assets you want to

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760
optimal crispness of assets you want to
 

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.610
optimal crispness of assets you want to
make sure that you provide those graphic

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620
make sure that you provide those graphic
 

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.370
make sure that you provide those graphic
assets those PNG files in all the

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380
assets those PNG files in all the
 

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.500
assets those PNG files in all the
different densities so here's an example

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:00.510
different densities so here's an example
 

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.840
different densities so here's an example
of a share icon you want to make sure

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:02.850
of a share icon you want to make sure
 

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.730
of a share icon you want to make sure
that you're providing it in four

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740
that you're providing it in four
 

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.430
that you're providing it in four
different densities if possible an

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440
different densities if possible an
 

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.420
different densities if possible an
xxhdpi all the way down to mdpi and to

do again the calculation for the sizes

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279
do again the calculation for the sizes
 

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:16.310
do again the calculation for the sizes
of these things you simply use the

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320
of these things you simply use the
 

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.380
of these things you simply use the
formula that we used before so if we

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.390
formula that we used before so if we
 

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.790
formula that we used before so if we
know that we want to have a thirty-two

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800
know that we want to have a thirty-two
 

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.300
know that we want to have a thirty-two
DP square icon we'll know that on an

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:23.310

xxhdpi device the asset you need for

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:26.670
xxhdpi device the asset you need for
 

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.850
xxhdpi device the asset you need for
that should be 96 by 96 pixels so that's

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:31.860
that should be 96 by 96 pixels so that's
 

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.280
that should be 96 by 96 pixels so that's
it on today's design byte on how screen

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:34.290
it on today's design byte on how screen
 

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.260
