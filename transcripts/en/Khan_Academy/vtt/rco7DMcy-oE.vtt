00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.470
Simplify the expression
using rational exponents.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.865
So we have the cubed root of
all of this stuff over here,

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:08.490
which would be the
same thing, or which

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.140
is the same thing by definition,
as all of this stuff--

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.180
64a to the sixth, b to
the third, c to the ninth,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.440
raised to the 1/3 power.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.082
These are equivalent
by definition.

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:23.040
And if we take the product
of a bunch of things

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.581
and raise them to
an exponent, that's

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:26.690
the same thing as raising
each of these things

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.940
that we're taking the product
of to the exponent first

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.980
and then multiplying.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.020
So this is going to be equal
to 64 to the 1/3 power times

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.340
a to the sixth to
the 1/3 power times

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.990
b to the third to
the 1/3 power times

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.210
c to the ninth to the 1/3 power.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.497
And we've seen this in
several examples already.

00:00:49.497 --> 00:00:51.080
Well first let's try
to simplify this.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.650
64 to the 1/3.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.170
You might recognize
that already,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.146
but we can factor 64
as-- well, I wouldn't

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:59.020
do a pure prime
factorization, because you'll

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.545
see it's 4 to the third power.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:02.420
Actually, you could
verify that for yourself.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.920
Or I encourage
you, if that's not

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.410
obvious to see that this is
4 to the third power, 64,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.980
multiply it out for yourself.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.710
Or if you're like,
how did you know that?

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.190
Do the prime factorization.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.260
And what you're going
to do is if you--

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.110
well, let me just show you.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.526
If you do the prime
factorization,

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:17.360
you're going to have 2 times 32.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.526
32 is 2 times 16.

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:21.570
16 is 2 times 8.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.650
8 is 2 times 4.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.690
And then 4 is 2 times 2.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.920
So you can have 2 multiplied
by itself three times,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.050
or you could have it-- a 2
multiplied by itself three

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.280
times and that happens twice.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.750
Or you could have
4 times 4 times 4.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.590
So if it immediately
didn't jump into your head

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.840
that 64 is 4 to the
third power, you

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.250
can literally do a brute
force prime factorization here

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.160
and see that you have
6-- you could factor this

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.170
into 2 to the sixth power,
or the same thing as 4

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.000
to the third power.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.960
So I'll let you think
about that a little bit.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.800
But this right here simplifies
that 64 is 4 to the third power

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.480
and you raise that
to the 1/3 power.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.630
That is the same thing.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.740
Actually, let me
write it that way.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.240
That could make it
more interesting.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.860
So this right here, this
is 4 the third power.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.820
So I have 4 to the
third power and then

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.290
that raised to the 1/3 power.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.380
So if I want to rewrite
that term right over here,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.550
that's going to be
four to the 3/3 power.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.610
I'm literally
multiplying 3 times 1/3.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.760
4 to the third and
then that to the 1/3.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.370
Then over here, I have a to
the sixth and then that the 1/3

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.190
power.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.620
That is going to be a to
the 6 times 1/3 power,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.130
or a to the 6/3 power.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.710
Then I have b to the third and
then that raised to the 1/3,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.600
so that's going to
be-- we literally

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.230
can multiply exponents here.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.440
So we have b to
the 3 over 3 power.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.660
And then finally, we
have c to the ninth

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.520
and then that raised
to the 1/3 power.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.100
So that is c to the 9/3 power.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.010
And if you simplify it, this
first term here, 4 to the 3/3,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.400
that's just 4 to
the first power.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.310
So that's just 4.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.710
We have a to the 6/3.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.500
6/3 is just 2, so that
just becomes a squared.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.200
B to the 3/3 power, that's
just b to the first or b.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.900
And then finally, c
to the 9/3, that's

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.960
just c to the third power.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.280
So we write c to the third here.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.997
And we are done.
