JULIA FERRAIOLI: My
name is Julia Ferraioli,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.040
and I'm a developer advocate
with the Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.059
Today I have the privilege to
introduce Ashley Gavin, who's

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.680
a curriculum consultant
to schools, non-profits,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.830
and companies with
an intense desire

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.562
to teach young people
computer science.

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:23.270
ASHLEY GAVIN: Hi.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.820
Thanks.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.550
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
So during CSEdWeek,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.200
we got to hear a little
bit about the Girls

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.480
Who Code mission as well as
some of the long-term goals

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.340
of the organization.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.447
So what drew you
to Girls Who Code?

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:40.530
ASHLEY GAVIN: It's actually
kind of a funny story.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
I left my work at MIT
Lincoln Laboratory

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.015
without a job knowing that I
wanted to move back to New York

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.850
to write a musical-- so
really completely tangential--

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.730
but I got a call
from a friend saying

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.555
there was this organization that
was teaching young women how

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:00.730
to code, and they lost
their robotics instructor.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.290
And when I was at Bryn Mawr,
they offered a course teaching

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.760
computer science using
personal robots, so I thought,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.650
oh this is a really good
match, and I happened

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.810
to have ten robots
in my closet--

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.880
as I always do-- and I said,
I can be there next week.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.160
And so I went in, and
learned a little more

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.897
about the organization,
and never left.

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:23.230
JULIA FERRAIOLI: That's awesome.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.122
Was having the 10 robots in
your closet a prerequisite?

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:27.830
ASHLEY GAVIN: No.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.030
No, but it's just something
that I always happen to have.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.520
I have more robots than
any one person should,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.090
especially in a closet.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.710
JULIA FERRAIOLI: What
kind of robots are they?

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.830
ASHLEY GAVIN: So they're
called Scribbler robots.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.630
You can-- the robot
itself is made

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.890
by a company called Parallax.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.700
You can actually
buy them online.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.860
And they have a little chip
developed by Bryn Mawr College

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.750
and Georgia Tech specifically
to run certain APIs and such

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.570
for educating kids
in computer science.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.540
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
That's fantastic.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.520
So curriculum developer,
that's not really a career

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.139
that you hear about very
often within technology.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.699
Definitely wasn't
one that I'd ever

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.060
heard about when I
graduated with my CS degree.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.270
So tell us a little
bit about what

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.780
you do within Girls Who Code.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.310
ASHLEY GAVIN: Yeah,
so when I first

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.726
started teaching at Girls Who
Code, the role of curriculum

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:26.320
developer was not something
that I had heard about either.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.590
It sort of formed itself.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.460
My responsibilities vary
on a day-to-day basis.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.430
Some days, I'm helping
teachers with their instruction

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.420
in the classroom.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.440
Other days I'm training teachers
on how to give instruction.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.460
Other days I'm writing
code to develop libraries

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.090
for making computer
science education easier,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.780
or I'm assessing other
people's libraries.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.290
Other days I'm just writing
a ton of assignments,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.200
thinking of creative
ways to get people

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.430
interested in computer
science through things

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.230
like art, and
music, and robotics,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.240
app development,
things of that nature.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.430
So it's all over the place.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.471
It's working with people.

00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:04.530
It's working alone.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.284
It's really fun.

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:07.950
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Sounds like the
perfect combination for someone

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.940
who's interests vary
quite a bit as well.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.690
ASHLEY GAVIN:Yeah.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.000
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Yeah.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.041
ASHLEY GAVIN: I think so.

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.590
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Yeah, so
that sounds-- that's awesome.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.100
For those who might be
interested in pursuing

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.960
a similar path, can
you tell us a bit

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.500
about your background, how you
got to where you are today?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.830
ASHLEY GAVIN: Yeah, so I started
as a typical computer science

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.056
major.

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:29.930
I knew I wanted to major
in computer science.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.390
I was lucky enough to be
exposed to computer science

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.910
in high school, fortunate
enough that an adviser talked

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.980
to me about it.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.320
I had never really thought
of teaching as a career,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.246
but while I was in
college, I loved

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:45.370
being a teaching assistant.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.550
It was my favorite thing.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.340
I worked on a fellowship
where I actually

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.220
worked with Bryn Mawr professors
on that Scribbler project

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.750
that I described, and when I got
into my later years of college,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.250
I started teaching
middle schoolers,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.860
and I found that all of my
extracurricular activities

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.120
were centered around teaching
or advertising computer

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.690
science, which probably should
have been a sure sign that I

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.380
should do that.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.430
But when I graduated,
I went to MIT,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.570
which was phenomenal
and a great experience,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.459
but I found myself yearning
to be doing more interaction

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.400
with people and to be helping
people in a more direct way.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.560
And so that's-- when I found
out about Girls Who Code,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.329
it kind of dawned on me, oh,
maybe you should try doing this

00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:30.870
for a living.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.780
You really like it.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.100
And I think it's something that
not a lot of computer science

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.037
majors consider while
they're in college.

00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:38.370
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Definitely not.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.000
It's not a career that
I had ever heard about,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.270
and it sounds almost
kind of similar to what

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.930
I do in developer relations
as well, helping people learn

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.010
new technologies.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.940
So what kind of role
did science and math

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.700
play in your early life?

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.590
Do you think that
you were uniquely

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.240
suited to go into computer
science once you were exposed?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.630
ASHLEY GAVIN: In some ways, yes.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.810
And in some ways,
absolutely not.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.400
People thought I probably
would have been a train wreck.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.900
So I'll start with the yes.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.410
I played tons of video games
as a kid, which is sometimes

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.520
a telltale sign that you might
enjoy making a video game

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.500
or making technology.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.110
I was the kind of kid that
built websites for fun.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.586
I loved Photoshop,
but simultaneously,

00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:31.840
at the same time, I
was flunking biology

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.480
and getting D's in math.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.756
I begged to get out
of math actually.

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:38.630
But I wasn't allowed to
take computer science

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.830
at first because of
my poor math grades.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.890
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Oh, wow.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.610
ASHLEY GAVIN: Yeah, and
so I think a lot of people

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.729
would have said, maybe she could
be a graphic designer or a web

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.520
designer, but I don't
think a lot of people

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.250
would have said that I'd be
a good computer scientist,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.762
and so finally, when my
adviser in high school

00:05:57.762 --> 00:05:59.470
took over the computer
science department

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.710
and opened it up to
more kinds of students,

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.150
I was lucky enough to
try it, and magically, I

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.630
was very good at it,
and my other grades

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.930
improved, all the typical signs
of when a student is excelling.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.130
It sort of excels
across the board.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.460
And I just never stopped.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.080
JULIA FERRAIOLI: That's
an amazing story.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.100
What would you say to
other young adults who

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.970
maybe think that math isn't
really their strong suit,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.320
but the idea behind
creation and making

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.860
that you oftentimes see in
computer science and technology

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.790
still appeals to them?

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.530
How would you guide them?

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.170
ASHLEY GAVIN: Yeah,
I think, I mean,

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.650
there's first of all the initial
fear of feeling like you are

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.559
not one of those people,
or it's not for you.

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:48.600
And I would say, if you're
the kind of person who

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.990
enjoys any art form-- creation
with your hands, with words,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.200
with performance-- I would say
at least consider it and look

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.690
at it from the perspective
of building a world.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.440
What kind of world
do you want to build?

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.600
Is it a video game world?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.890
Is it an app world?

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.540
And that can make it
a lot more appealing.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.840
And at Girls Who Code
we start our first week

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.319
entirely building video games.

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.360
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Oh, wow.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.970
ASHLEY GAVIN: So
just to keep kids

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.550
engaged, and they come out
pretty complicated and pretty

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.160
fun.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.970
As far as directly actually
going out and learning computer

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.070
science, I think you have to
get a little creative in where

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.400
you look for resources,
because it can be taught

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.410
a little dryly, and I think
that's why people get turned

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.287
off, because they're not doing
a full weeklong of video games

00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:39.370
as their first assignment.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.240
So I actually would recommend
looking for a game development

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.660
course or an app
development course.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.700
Those are probably a good place
to start rather than straight

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.040
up computer science.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.570
I think it might be a more
engaging way to learn.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.278
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
Gotcha, and you actually

00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:55.800
had the benefit of working with
robots in some of the intro

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.585
classes for computer
science as well.

00:07:58.585 --> 00:07:59.960
Would you recommend
that approach

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.979
to learning computer
science principles?

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:03.020
ASHLEY GAVIN: Absolutely.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.630
Yeah, in fact, if you're
willing to go out and get

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.640
one of these robots or download
the software that-- Can we

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.371
provide links at
the end of this?

00:08:11.371 --> 00:08:11.870
Is that a--

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.990
JULIA FERRAIOLI: We can
put them in the comments.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.320
ASHLEY GAVIN: OK, yeah.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.625
We'll put some in the comments.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.020
I have some links to
open source materials

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.510
that you can teach
yourself Python

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.107
while using either a
real or simulated robot.

00:08:22.107 --> 00:08:23.940
I recommend the real
robot, but not everyone

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.985
has $200 to shell
out for a robot.

00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:29.400
Or you can borrow one of my
10-- that's not a real offer,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.376
but we'll provide
links, I guess.

00:08:32.376 --> 00:08:33.750
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
Yep, definitely.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.419
Definitely.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.140
So let's dive into a
little bit of the Girls

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.919
Who Code aspect
of your role here.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.080
What makes the curriculum
of Girls Who Code different

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.780
than a traditional CS education?

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.755
You touched a little
bit on this already.

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:50.130
ASHLEY GAVIN:
Yeah, I think there

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.430
are two ways to look at it.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.740
There's the actual
content that we teach,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.880
and then there's the process by
which we deliver that content.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.210
In terms of the actual
content that we teach,

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.390
it's very similar to
the first two semesters

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.020
of college-level
computer science,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.320
except everything's done
through another layer,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.250
and each week that
layer changes.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.430
So, the first week, the
layer is video games.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.040
The second week the
layer is robotics.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.860
The third week, the layer
is art, like graphics--

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.210
like Pixar, for
example, sort of thing,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.660
or other 3D animation graphics.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.950
And because we have a
different layer every week,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.580
it's not just appealing
to young women.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.700
It's appealing to anyone
who has an interest in any

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.507
of those layers.

00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:34.090
So if you're the
kind of person that's

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.530
interested in medicine
or mobile applications,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.800
you can find how
computer science

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.570
can be interesting to you.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.660
A lot of young women
want to help people.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.660
So a lot of these "layers,"
as I'm calling them,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.180
have to do with helping
people through medicine

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.200
or through sort
of social justice,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.147
and that makes it
very "girl" friendly

00:09:55.147 --> 00:09:57.920
or, I just think,
human friendly.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.830
I think, without that
layer, it can get dry,

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.740
and it's important to have that.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.430
On the other side, I think a lot
of computer science education

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.270
right now is sort
of like the way

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.020
we learned math 50 years ago.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.090
It's very rote.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.200
And it's more about
syntax and language,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.490
whereas at Girls Who Code
it's very project-based,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.180
and it's very exploratory.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.170
We don't really have a set
curriculum in terms of,

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.660
today you're going to
learn about operators,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.570
or today you're going to
learn about [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.990
We kind of find those
topics through our projects,

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.130
and the projects are designed
to find those topics,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.720
but the girls will
encounter them on their own

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.170
and actually look things up
and learn about them based

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.560
on their own initiative,
which makes it a lot more fun.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.660
You go out to learn
something because you

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.930
need it to make that
video game work.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.602
It's a lot more interesting
than learning operators

00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:56.060
for the sake of
learning operators.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.880
So it's exploratory,
and experimental, and

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.110
project-based.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.693
JULIA FERRAIOLI: The
layers definitely

00:11:01.693 --> 00:11:05.480
contextualize the lessons,
so that's fantastic.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.200
Have any particular layers
been especially successful

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.490
amongst young women?

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.430
ASHLEY GAVIN: Yeah,
we do-- I mean,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:14.870
this might not
come as a surprise,

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.300
but the mobile app week
is intensely popular.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.400
Everyone wants to make a mobile
app, and some of these apps

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.630
are really, really impressive,
and it sort of brings out

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.060
their own interests.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.930
We had some girls make
a mobile application

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.260
so that if you don't have
a dollar but you encounter

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.850
someone on the street,
a homeless individual,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.320
it automatically pulls
up the-- actually

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.915
using the Google Maps API--
it automatically pulls up

00:11:40.915 --> 00:11:43.630
the closest soup kitchens and
a list of homeless shelters

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.820
and provides directions.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.960
Because a lot of times
homeless individuals,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.672
they'd like to frequent
those locations,

00:11:48.672 --> 00:11:50.130
but they don't know
where they are.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.671
They don't have
access to technology,

00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:54.770
and so this serves
as a little reminder

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.800
that the user can
show this person,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.180
and it has other information.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.140
So really, really
popular mobile apps.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.210
JULIA FERRAIOLI: OK.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.280
So you obviously have a really
interesting role in technology,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.320
helping to inspire others
to follow STEM careers.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.670
Have there been any specific
moments where you thought,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:19.120
I can't believe that I get
to do this in my day job?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.920
ASHLEY GAVIN: Yeah,
so one comes to mind,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.670
and I just get a
little giggly about it,

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.170
because it was just so cool.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.430
Well, two now, but the
first one was we recently

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.410
had an article in "The New
York Times" mention us.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.160
Something that
people noticed was

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.050
that there is pretty good
gender equality in biology

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.160
and forensic sciences,
and we notice

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.050
that all of our students
when they come in--

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.300
or many, many of our students
when they come in-- they

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.930
want to be forensic biologists,
and it's because of CSI.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.780
And so this article
basically wrote,

00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:00.270
why is there not a hacking,
coding equivalent of this where

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.320
a young woman can watch TV and
see another young woman coding?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.000
And after reading--
some producers of MTV

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.320
actually read this article
and reached out to us,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.660
saying that they are producing
a show where-- on MTV--

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.730
where a young
woman solves crimes

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.980
using computing and
works for the NYPD.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.880
It's called "Eye Candy,"
and they made the pilot,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.500
and it's starring
Victoria Justice.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.410
Probably most developers don't
know who Victoria Justice is,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.000
but ask any 15 year-old
who Victoria Justice is,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.690
and she'll freak out.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.790
And they invited me to teach
the entire cast how to code.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.290
And so I was sitting
with Victoria Justice,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.500
and she signed my robot--
getting a little weird,

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.710
but you get-- and yeah,
it was just amazing to--

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.470
and the director of "Twilight,"
Catherine Hardwicke,

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.270
was there as well.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.420
And so-- she's
directing the show--

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.840
and that was pretty
unbelievable.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.000
I couldn't believe that my
computer science degree got me

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.040
into the room with these
amazing, creative people,

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.820
and it was a pretty cool moment.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.890
My students were obsessed.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.510
They thought it was
the coolest thing.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.070
JULIA FERRAIOLI: That's awesome.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.290
I mean, you've taught basically
people who probably had never

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.930
thought they'd learn
how to code how to code

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.180
and then got a
signed robot to boot.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.880
ASHLEY GAVIN: Yeah,
I mean, and they

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.249
loved-- the great thing about
it was they were awesome at it.

00:14:26.249 --> 00:14:27.790
I mean, they were
really good coders,

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.400
and I think that speaks
to the creativity piece.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.040
They thought it was
amazing, and they

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.539
loved all the
different applications

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:38.820
they could think about
being used on the show.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.380
There's natural-- kind of
related back to my work

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.530
at MIT-- there's interesting,
crime-solving abilities

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.710
inherent in computer
science that a lot of people

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.123
don't know about, including
the cast of the show.

00:14:49.123 --> 00:14:51.790
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
Yeah, definitely.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.840
Well, that's fantastic.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.000
Thank you so much, Ashley, for
joining us today and telling us

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.940
a bit about Girls Who Code.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.990
We'll see if we can get
some links to some resources

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.380
that you were mentioning
today in the description

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.550
of the video.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.455
So thank you so
much for joining us.

00:15:09.455 --> 00:15:10.913
ASHLEY GAVIN: Thanks
for having me.

00:15:10.913 --> 00:15:11.789
It was a lot of fun.

00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:13.330
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
Thank you for tuning

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.790
in to this special edition
of Women Tech Makers.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:20.020
You can look forward to more
segments coming down the pipe.
