00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now we look at different harvest rates--2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times 10⁵ tons per year.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The middle one happens to be the same 2.5 * 10⁵ tons per year.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The question is will the amount of fish eventually decay to 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Do we have a strong issue with over fishing?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is the quiz for you--what about the amount of fish for the blue harvest rate--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
will it never shrink to 0, does it depend on our circumstances whether or not it shrinks to 0,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
will it almost surely decrease to 0, or will it even surely decrease to 0.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The same for the hour's rate of 2.5 * 10⁵ tons per year and the same

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
for the harvest rate of 2.0 * 10⁵ tons per year.

00:00:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is going to lead us to the concept of maximum sustainable yield.
