00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:25.220
All right, good morning. So today, we are
going to talk about what is both a basic device

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:36.170
in itself, the amplifier, and it also serves
as a real key example of both nonlinear analysis

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.000
and small signal analysis.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:01:06.990
So, today, dependent sources and amplifiers.
So, let me first spend a few seconds just

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.980
pointing out to you some of the key points
from our previous lectures. I also want to

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.730
point out that each chapter in the course
notes has a summary at the end of it.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.810
And if you take a quick scan of the summary
at the end of each chapter, it highlights

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.000
the major takeaway points from each chapter.
It stresses what's important, and if you have

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.880
to remember a few things, what are those things
to remember? So, to quickly review, we talked

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.970
about a few primitive elements: resistors,
voltage sources, and so on.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.460
And by now, you should have the facility to
play around with these device elements. And

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:04.340
then we talked about the Node method, and
this is kind of the workhorse of 6.002. When

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.750
in doubt, use the Node method.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:22.670
OK, and this will work both for linear circuits
and nonlinear circuits. OK, so if you see

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.770
a problem, or if you see a situation in real
life that requires analysis, then as a first

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.040
step, you should try to think of whether you
could apply some of the key intuitive shortcut

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.120
methods, superposition.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.410
One of my favorites, the Thevenin method,
the Norton method, or the method that involves

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.790
composition, that is very quickly analyzing
circuits that have resistors in series and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.260
parallel. OK, so if you can apply one of these
quick, intuitive, shortcut methods, go do

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.680
so.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.490
If you can't, then usually you can resort
to the Node method irrespective of whether

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:11.130
the circuit is linear or nonlinear. So the
last week was focused on the nonlinear method

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.870
or nonlinear circuits, and we spent the first
lecture talking about a straightforward application

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.380
of the Node method, which gave us a bunch
of nonlinear equations that we had to solve.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.819
In the last lecture, we talked about the small
signal trick. What we said is if you look

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:41.180
at the whole space of nonlinear circuits,
then within that space, if we focus on small

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.370
variations, small perturbations about an operating
point, then even the behavior of nonlinear

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.500
circuits in that small regime would be linear.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:12.890
So small signal method. And as an example,
I showed you how I could take a highly nonlinear

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:21.099
device like the garage door opener LED, and
using that, build a pretty nice transmitter

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.130
that would transmit music.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.349
And as long as we kept the signal small, and
operated the device in a region where its

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:39.279
transfer curve was relatively smooth, and
I biased, or set the operating point appropriately,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.370
I would get a linear, small signal response.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:57.039
OK. So today, we're going to do a couple things.
We're going to look at dependent sources.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:05.580
And the reading for this is section 2.6 of
your course notes. And, the dependent source

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.789
will be a new element in your tool chest.

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:23.599
We will also do amplifiers, and amplifiers
are in section 7.1 and section 7.2 of your

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:32.669
course notes. So, before I begin with dependent
sources, I'm just a huge believer in motivating

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.279
things with real world examples.

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:42.559
OK, so let me start by motivating: why we
need an amplifier? Why do we need to do things

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:47.889
like this? Or why do we even bother? And,
spend a few minutes really getting you to

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.439
appreciate that amplification is fundamental.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:59.800
OK, it's as foundational to life as high fat
potato chips and stuff like that. So, let's

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.419
do some basic examples here. So first, let
me talk about, why do we need to amplify signals.

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:21.689
Why amplify? Why do we care about building
an amplifier? So, an amplifier, think of a

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:28.919
little box, and apply some sort of small input.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:38.090
And I get a larger output. In this example,
this may be a voltage with a swing of 10 mV,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:47.749
and in this case, the output might be another
voltage with a swing of, say, 100 mV. And

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:54.461
commonly, the amplifier, in addition to an
input and an output, input port and output

00:06:54.461 --> 00:07:02.719
port, may also contain the power port, OK,
so that I can apply a power supply to the

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:10.039
amplifier because commonly as an amplifier
signal, I'm looking for a power gain as well,

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.740
an increase in the power provided by the output.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:21.619
So, that's an abstract definition of an amplifier,
and let's take a look at an example of why

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:33.689
we may need this. So let's say I have a small,
useful signal, and let's say the signal has

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:36.770
1 mV peak to peak.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:43.029
And, I'm looking to transmit the signal over
a wire to some other point. But let's say

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:54.179
that in this environment, I get a bunch of
noise that is in a noisy environment. And

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:58.029
in this environment, let's assume that some
noise may get superimposed.

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:03.839
And if I have a 1 mV signal, and 10 mV of
noise, then what I end up with at the output

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:08.330
is something that looks like this. And it's
really hard to distinguish my 1 mV signal

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.939
from that large amount of noise.

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:19.839
On the other hand, if I do the following,
if I took the signal and passed the signal

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:30.699
to an amplifier, and I amplified the signal
to be a much larger version of the same signal,

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:37.599
let's say in this particular situation 100
mV peak to peak signal.

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:43.769
OK, so I magnified the signal by a factor
of 100. OK, let's say it's a linear amplifier,

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:49.360
I linearly amplified signal to be 100 mV,
then in that case, if I had a noise on top

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.389
of this, it's going to be less discernible.

00:08:52.389 --> 00:09:02.130
The signal will look like this.
OK, my 10 mV noise would add on to it. But,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:08.529
this is still pretty decent. I can still recognize
the input. And so, this is one application

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:14.960
of amplification. If I need to send something
from point A to point B as an analog signal,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.770
then an amplified signal is less prone to
noise attacks than a small signal.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:27.610
Not surprisingly, a large number of devices
that are used in everyday life have amplifiers

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:35.240
built into them. So, get a little cell phone,
and virtually every single cell phone contains

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.699
an amplifier. By the way, this is an all digital
cell phone.

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:46.759
It's a Kyocera, I forget the number now. It's
completely digital. OK, although they say

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:51.389
it's completely digital, it turns out that
a significant fraction of the circuitry is

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:58.541
analog, in particular, so digital is sort
of a marketing term to say that there's something

00:09:58.541 --> 00:09:59.600
special about this.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.290
But remember, there's a bunch of analog stuff.
So, here's my little antenna from the cell

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:10.459
phone. OK, and typically the first thing that
happens to a signal as it comes out of the

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:17.120
antenna in your cell phone is, look at cell
phone circuits, or cell phone systems would

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.190
be something that looks like this, OK, this,
and may have a label LNA.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:32.959
If someone were to take a guess at what LNA
might stand for? What's that? Linear amplifier.

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:42.980
That's pretty good. So that's LNA. Close enough.
A is correct. It's amplifier. What does L

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.910
and N stand for? Low noise.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:52.530
OK, so this stands for low noise amplifier.
So, I get a really rinky dinky small signal

00:10:52.530 --> 00:11:00.019
here, and then the low noise amplifier amplifies
a signal. And in real cell phones, and for

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:06.930
that matter, in your 802.11b, or 802.11a,
or 802.11g wireless cards, same thing.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.990
Antenna, low noise amplifier, and then you
may have a bunch of processing. And commonly,

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:17.740
you have a bunch of analog processing. And
then, you convert the analog to a digital

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:27.490
signal. OK, I recall last week I asked somebody
in class here, how would we transmit the signal

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:32.200
from point A to point B without it being impacted
way too much by noise, and he said, oh, go

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200
digital.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.690
Good point. OK, so if I go digital, I can
transfer the signal without noise being a

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:43.910
real factor. But the analog to digital converters
need the signal strengths to be a given value

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.810
before it can chop it up into digital levels.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:52.640
OK, so an amplifier is very fundamental. OK,
and so in this case, what may be a signal

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:59.990
of a few tens of microvolts to be amplified
to some large enough value that it can be

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:12.060
further processed. So, that's application
of amplification in the analog domain.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:20.529
Let me talk about amplification in the digital
domain. So, that's in the analog domain. This

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:26.110
amplification is in the domain that I have
both analog and digital. OK, and now let me

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:32.040
talk about amplification in the digital domain,
OK? I'm going to argue that amplification

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.410
is absolutely foundational to the digital
domain.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:41.610
OK, the digital abstraction would not occur
if I did not have basic amplification. OK,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:49.120
and the next minute and 37 seconds I will
prove that to you, OK? So, let's do so. So,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:13:01.889
let's suppose I have a very simple digital
system, and the system simply contains a pair

00:13:01.889 --> 00:13:03.180
of inverters.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.730
So, if I send a one here, it's a zero here
and a one here, which is a very simple, trivial,

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:16.860
digital system. And here's the input. Here's
the output. And we said that for digital systems

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.779
of this sort to work, they have to follow
a static discipline.

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:25.680
OK, our signals and our circuits must follow
a discipline for them all to work together.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:34.279
And, the discipline we described comprised
of signals adhering to certain voltage thresholds

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:41.740
so that all the components in the system could
agree on what comprised a zero, and what comprised

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:48.890
a one, OK? So the way we did that was we said
that you would have a threshold called VIH,

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.050
V input high, and another threshold called
VIL, V input low.

00:13:53.050 --> 00:14:02.180
OK, and we said that this circuit must recognize
signals that are higher than VIH, 3 V for

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:08.990
example as a one, and simultaneously, any
signal that has a voltage level less than

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:13.139
VIL, say, two volts, should be recognized
as a zero.

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:23.130
That was the input constraint. On the output,
it had a similar set of constraints, where

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:29.589
we had tougher constraints on devices, where
we said that the output had to satisfy a output

00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:33.129
low constraint, output high constraint.

00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:39.829
What this said is that for this circuit to
be called a good digital circuit that satisfies

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:45.839
the static discipline, signals that were ones
here should be recognized as such. And if

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:50.560
I am producing a one as an output, then the
signal level should be higher than VOH.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.249
Similarly, if the signal's a zero, then it
should be less than VOL. So as an example,

00:14:55.249 --> 00:15:03.199
this may be 2 V, this may be 3 V, and this
may be 4 V, and this may be 1 V. OK, so input,

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:09.259
I should recognize 2 V and less as a zero,
but at the output I have to produce a very,

00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:11.040
very low value, 1 V.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:20.199
So, I have some noise margin. So as an example,
say if I made a plot of the input/output,

00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:33.399
so I get my VIL here and VIH here. This is
time. This would comprise a valid digital

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:38.480
signal: zero, one, zero, one, and so on.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:47.410
OK, now, I had a tougher set of constraints
at the output. I would have VOL, VOH. So,

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:56.870
at the output, OK, I'm required to stretch
the ones and zeros to be further apart from

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:03.279
each other so that I get noise margin, and
the corresponding signal for our little circuit

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:06.350
there would look like so.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:14.569
Right, if this is a valid input, then this
would be the corresponding, valid output.

00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:21.589
OK, and need I say more? OK, you can see that,
intuitively, look, there's amplification happening

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:27.930
here, and the reason is that VOL is chosen
to be less than VIL, and VOH is higher than

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:28.930
VIH.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:38.150
So therefore, the signal has to be stretched.
The signal has to be amplified. OK, and what's

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:43.410
the minimum amplification needed for the system
to work? The minimum amplification is if I

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.730
had a signal that looked like this.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:54.749
OK, that barely skimmed the VIL, VIH level.
OK, so if signal were this high peak to peak,

00:16:54.749 --> 00:17:02.279
VIH minus VIL, and what's the absolute minimum
signal at the output? It would look something

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:10.150
like this. OK, barely skimming VOL and VOH,
OK, so the corresponding output level would

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.470
be VOH minus VOL.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:21.260
OK, so this is the absolute minimum amplification
that my digital circuit has to provide. OK,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:29.420
and notice, VOH is larger than VIH. VOL is
smaller than VIL. Therefore, this quantity

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.950
needs to be greater than one.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:37.710
OK, so I've shown you both a simple, graphical,
intuitive explanation, and this is a slightly

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:43.890
more formal proof that even the digital circuit
really requires to have amplification built

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.100
into it, if it is to satisfy valid static
disciplines.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:18:09.310
Yes? Yes. The question is, is that the same
as gain? Good question. Yes, the term amplification

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:17.580
has many, many variants. You could say gain.
You could say amplification. You could say

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:22.370
increase in signal strength, and so on and
so forth.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:28.750
And in fact, when talking about low noise
amplifiers, people sometimes talk about having

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:38.590
the low noise, high gain amplifier at the
input stage. OK, so let me pause there in

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:45.570
terms of motivation. So, I believe I've motivated
every which way: pure analog, analog/digital,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.610
and digital.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:52.190
OK, so I've covered every single base here.
And so, we need amplification. OK, so let's

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:59.530
look at how to build a fundamental, primitive
device called the amplifier. Before we do

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:11.610
that, however, let me take a quick detour.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:17.220
It will be convenient for me, as I show you
how to build an amplifier, to introduce a

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:28.261
new device, a new element, called the dependent
source. OK, let me introduce a new device

00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:38.060
for your arsenal of devices, along with resistors,
You learned about a MOSFET, a switch, voltage

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.510
source, current source, and now a dependent
source.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:20:00.370
So, a dependent source looks like this, OK,
has an output port, and has a control port.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:13.810
So, a dependent source in its simplest form
has two ports: an input port and an output

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:22.550
port. Remember, a port is a convenient pairing
of terminals, and I apply signals to such

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.950
terminal pairs.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:31.910
But this is a abstract diagram for a dependent
source, and to get a little bit more specific,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:37.470
let me show you an example of a dependent
source. So, let's say, here's my input, and

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.360
I label the terminal variables for the input.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:50.340
VC is the voltage applied to the input, and
IC is the current into this terminal here.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:57.560
And, here is the symbol for the dependent
source. Much like a current source or a voltage

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:05.290
source has a circle around it, the corresponding
symbol for a dependent source is like so.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:11.390
So this example, for instance, is a dependent,
current source. I can apply the corresponding

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:25.391
output variables, I0, OK, and I can say that
the current, I, is some function. In this

00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:32.130
example, I've designed the example that the
current through the current source, I, is

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.900
some function of the input voltage or the
control voltage, VC.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:42.250
OK, so notice that the current through a current
source, the current through this current source,

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:49.070
I, is some function of another variable. OK,
in this example, it's the voltage across its

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.070
control port.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:22:04.170
Not surprisingly, this device is called a
voltage controlled current source -- -- or

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:29.600
a VCCS. So, in like manner I can also devise
other forms of sources. You can think of this

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.490
is a device where a voltage controls an output
current.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.680
You can think of all other combinations, current
controlling current, voltage controlling voltage,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.800
current controlling voltage, and so on. So,
another example, I give you another dependent

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:54.520
source, and in this situation, my output current
is controlled by an input current, VC.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:03.450
IC rather. And I claim that I for this one
is some function of a current, IC. OK, it's

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:08.050
another dependent source where the output
current for its output port is related to

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:16.630
the current, IC. And, this is a current controlled
current source.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.920
OK, it's a current controlled current source.
And, if I had lots of time on my hands, and

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.290
I was wanting to kill time, I'd sit around
drawing for you, other types of dependent

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:34.320
sources. I would draw for you a current controlled
voltage sourced, and I could also draw for

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.450
you a voltage controlled voltage source.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:44.530
OK, so that's an abstract diagram for such
a source. And so, let's do a few examples

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:53.920
involving elements like this. To begin, just
so you can build up your intuition, let me

00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:05.760
start by doing a very simple circuit, involving
an independent current source,

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.760
OK, just so we can relate back to what we've
been doing so far.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:19.460
So, let's say I have some resistor, and I
have a standard current source with current

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:28.730
I nought. This is an independent current source.
Remember the circle? And, some resistor, R,

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.030
and let's say I care about the voltage across
the resistor.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:39.910
OK, so I have a current I nought flowing through
it. So, I can very quickly write down VR as,

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:47.750
simply, I0 R. OK, it's the drop across the
resistor when a current I nought flows through

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.790
it. OK, so this is what you've been used to
doing.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:25:03.750
Correspondingly, I can do an example with
a dependent current source. And, as an example,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:09.760
I'll use a voltage controlled current source.
OK, a voltage controlled current source is

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:17.380
a dependent current source whose output current
depends on the voltage applied at the control

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.980
port of the current source.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:37.420
So let me build a little circuit. OK, so here's
my current. And let's say it's VC IC for the

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:45.690
control port, and similarly, let's say my
current I here is some function of the control

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:51.701
port voltage. And let's say, to be specific,
there is some K over VC, some function.

00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:57.940
OK, there are a variety of dependent sources
that can be built, and here's a hypothetical

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:05.990
device where the output current is mathematically
related to the input in the following manner.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.570
So, let me build a circuit of the following
form.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:22.300
So, let's add the resistor, R, and here's
my circuit, OK? And, as before, let me look

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:28.700
to figuring out what VR is. So, notice that
I have to supply some voltage at the input

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.250
so that the output can depend on the input
because right now I don't know what the input

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.250
here.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:42.560
So what I'll do is let me apply VR over here.
OK, so let me make this connection. OK, let

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:53.820
me make the connection from here to here.
What I've done is I've applied VR at the control

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:59.020
port of the dependent current source.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.730
OK, and I often draw a circuit like this.
This looks pretty messy. I will often draw

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:31.260
the circuit like so: R, VR. OK, short form
circuit drawing would look like this. This

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.860
is a complete drawing that I show you the
explicit connections of the control port,

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:40.140
but oftentimes, when the control port does
not have any other impact in the circuit,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.840
you can eliminate, don't explicitly show the
control port.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.690
Rather, you can simply show the dependence
of the output current on whatever circuit

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:54.510
variable you have in mind. So, you can draw
the diamond like this, and see its current

00:27:54.510 --> 00:28:11.380
is some function of VR. VR in this is case
is K divided by VR, OK?

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:17.900
OK, so let's go ahead and analyze this little
circuit here, and look at what this might

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.900
give us.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:27.040
Our goal, as before, is to find out the value,
VR. So, in this case, let's apply the Node

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.750
method to this node, and sum the currents
into that node to be zero. OK, so sum the

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.440
currents going into that node to be zero.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:46.490
The current going down is simply VR divided
by R. OK, and that is equal to the current

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:52.840
that is going out of the node. And so that
is equal to F of VR. And I know that F of

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.390
VR is given by K divided by VR.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:06.750
OK, a simple application of the Node method.
So then, I collect VR's on the left hand side,

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:20.010
and I get VR squared is K times R, OK, and
VR is simply the square root of KR. There

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:27.480
you go: I'm done. OK, I've gone ahead an applied
the Node method to this, and when have to

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:33.270
figure out the current here, I simply reflect
the fact that it depends on VR like so, and

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.820
I just go ahead and solve the circuit.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:42.960
Remember, the workhorse of the circuit industry,
the Node method, when in doubt, apply it.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:50.730
It simply works. And notice, this is a nonlinear
circuit. OK, the dependence is nonlinear,

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.190
and I get the response like so.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:30:06.180
So, to plug in some numbers, supposing K was
10 to the minus 3 amperes per volt, and R

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:15.461
was one kilo ohm, then I can plug the numbers
in and the kilo here cancels with the 10 to

00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:20.590
the minus 3, and I get VR equals 1 V.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.360
OK, this simply says, if I build a circuit
like this, then this voltage here will be

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:38.600
1 V. So, again, as long as you remember that
the dependent source is simply another little

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.190
circuit element, OK, and you usually draw
just the output port for dependent sources,

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:54.940
and reflect the way that the control affects
the current, that'll suffice, and you get,

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.900
through the application of the Node method,
the variable you're interested in.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:09.070
Let's do another example,
OK, of another fun current source, a voltage

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:18.530
controlled current source, and look at it
this way. So, let's say I have a resistor,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:29.261
and I have a current source, a resistor, RL,
and this goes to some, I apply a VS here.

00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:35.120
Remember this short form notation; that's
simply applying a supply VS between that node

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:44.180
and the ground. OK, and let us say the current
IV through the device is some function of

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.000
the current at its control port.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:54.610
OK, so I'm not going to show you that. But
remember that the device already looks like

00:31:54.610 --> 00:32:06.700
this, that there is a control port here. I'm
not showing that to you. And let us say that

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:12.240
I apply some voltage, VI, to the input port.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.260
The reason we often don't show the input port
is for many practical dependent sources, the

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:23.780
input has no other effect on the circuit.
So, for example, in this case, the input has

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.730
infinite resistance looking in.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:32.100
So therefore, if I apply a VI here, it doesn't
draw any current from VI. I simply apply the

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.610
voltage, VI. It doesn't affect the circuit
in any other way except in terms of how it

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.590
controls the current ID.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:45.210
So let's say the current ID is some function
of VI because VI is applied at the control

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:58.760
port. OK, and as I pointed out before, I oftentimes,
just for clarity, just to show this dependent

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:05.070
source explicitly.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:14.160
OK, so let's work the example. So as I said,
I'm going to choose ID to be F of VI, and

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:21.020
let's pick some specific parameters here.
Let's say it's K by two VI minus one, both

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:33.910
squared. OK, and let's say this is true for
VI less than equal to one volt.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:46.100
And let us also say that ID equals zero for
VI less than one volt. OK, it's a dependent

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.000
source, and it can have various forms of dependences
on the input. And, I just picked an example

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.470
of some hypothetical, or as yet, hypothetical
dependent source, the current through which

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:03.380
is related to the input using a square law
relation, VI minus one all squared as long

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.410
as VI is greater than one.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:12.280
And if VI is less than one, then the current
is simply zero, it shuts off. So, I can go

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:20.240
ahead and apply. So, let's say I want to find
out V0 versus VI. So, I care about finding

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:27.740
out V0. V0 is the voltage of this node with
respect to ground.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.639
OK, so it's a slightly more complicated circuit
than you saw up here, than you saw up there.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:40.660
So, let's go ahead and do this example. Start
by applying the workhorse of the circuits

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:49.440
business, the Node method, and let's start
with doing this for VI.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.129
Let's first do it for VI greater than one,
notice the behavior of this is different for

00:34:54.129 --> 00:35:00.190
different ranges of VI. So let's first do
it for VI greater than or equal to one and

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:06.110
apply the Node method. Node method says sum
the currents going into this node; we know

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.110
the voltage at this node.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:14.080
It's VI. We know the voltage at this node.
It's VS. OK, the only unknown is V nought.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:20.130
And so, let's go ahead and write the node
equations for that node. So, the current going

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:26.860
up, let me simply equate the current going
up to the current that has been supplied by

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.140
this particular node here.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:33.630
And, that should equate that the two of them
should sum to zero, the current going up plus

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:43.880
the current going down should sum to zero.
So, I get V0 minus VS divided by R. That's

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.340
the current going up.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:51.430
Plus, the current going down must sum to zero,
plus ID must sum to zero. And ID is going

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:58.930
to be K divided by two VI minus one all squared.
That must equal zero. Straightforward application

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.680
of Node method, current going up plus the
current going down at this node should equal

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:12.700
zero because the total current leaving the
node must be zero, OK? So I can go ahead and

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.410
simplify this, multiply it throughout by,
I call this RL here.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:23.560
So, multiply it throughout by RL, and move
all of this to the other side, so I get VS

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:29.520
divided by RL, multiply it throughout by RL.
I get VS at this side. I take this term to

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.420
the other side. This becomes a minus.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:45.800
RL multiplies here, so I get KRL. That's the
expression I get. V nought is VS minus KRL

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.310
divided by two times VI minus one all squared.
Let me put a box around this because I will

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:57.820
be referring to this more times in 6.002 for
a variety of reasons than probably any other

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.950
equation on Earth.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:06.750
OK, this is the first time you saw it. You
saw it here. OK, mark it down. You'll smile

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:11.540
every other time you look at it in quizzes,
and you will find out why this comes up very

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:20.390
often in 6.002. So, I'll just give you a few
seconds to savor this big moment in your 6.002

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:21.560
life.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:29.050
All right, OK, so it's pretty simple actually.
I mean, there's really not much. A lot of

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.030
this stuff is just a plain old, simple application
of the Node method, and things just fall out.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.370
It's just so simple.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:41.590
So, the V nought, I apply the Node method,
I get V nought for this nonlinear circuit.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:49.900
I can also it for VI less than one. For VI
less than one, when VI is less than one, what

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:59.340
happens? ID is zero. OK, since ID is zero,
think of this as an open circuit.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:13.610
OK, so there's no voltage drop across RL.
And, this voltage V nought is equal to VS.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:22.200
So, I like to see things in pictures. I'm
not an equations kind of person. I'm much

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.850
more of a graphical person.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:30.370
So, let me draw a little graph to show how
V nought, to see the form of V nought, and

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:40.310
then let's study that little system a little
bit more carefully. So, this is page seven,

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:47.010
and we plot V nought versus VI for you.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:52.420
And let's take a look at how this really simple
circuit looks. This has got nothing. It's

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:58.310
got an RL resistor connected to a supply,
and a dependent current source, and I apply

00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:59.721
some voltage VI at the input.

00:38:59.721 --> 00:39:12.200
It's a very, very simple circuit. So, let's
see. So as long as VI is less than one,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:23.070
the output stays at VS. OK, that makes intuitive
sense, right? As long as the current here

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.610
is zero, this is like an open circuit here.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:33.180
If this is an open circuit, then effectively,
V nought is simply the voltage VS. V nought

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:39.190
simply appears here. If you want to grunge
through KVL and KCL, go ahead. VS minus RL

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:44.560
times the current is V nought, and the current
is zero so it's, yes.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:53.610
So, this is simply VS. When VI goes above
one volt, fun stuff begins to happen. OK,

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:59.520
when V nought goes above one volt, then this
equation applies because VI is greater than

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.130
one. This equation applies.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:07.800
And, when VI is a one, one minus one is zero.
This term cancels out, so this is VS. OK,

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:17.010
phew! So, I start off here. As VI increases,
what happens now? As VI increases, this term

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:23.080
here becomes increasingly negative, OK, subtracting
from VS.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:30.880
OK, so I get some behavior like this. V nought
begins to drop. And it makes intuitive sense,

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:37.460
right? As ID begins to increase, the voltage
here will begin to drop because I'm drawing

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.700
more and more current through RL.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:45.820
I'm dropping more and more across RL. So more
and more drops across RL, so V nought begins

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:56.610
to drop too. So, it looks something like this.
I'll show you a little demo, but my claim

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.960
is that you have just seen an amplifier.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:16.020
Whoa. You just saw an amplifier. So, I snuck
an amplifier by you, OK? So, I

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:25.300
just snuck an amplifier past you. I'll show
you why in a second. So, let's take a look

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.619
at this waveform here. Let's not worry about
what happens way down here.

00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:37.040
We'll talk about that a little later. But,
look at this curve here. I claim there is

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:47.310
amplification in the following sense. Focus
on some change in the input voltage, delta

00:41:47.310 --> 00:42:06.360
VI, OK, and for that change in input voltage,
I get some change in the output voltage.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.290
OK, for some change in the input voltage,
delta VI, I get some change in the output

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:18.280
voltage. And guess what? In this, at least
the way I have drawn it, delta V nought divided

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:26.730
by delta VI, if I can find regions of the
curve where this is greater than one, then

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:31.700
I have amplification.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:40.200
OK, so what's that saying? What that's saying
is that if I apply some voltage here, OK,

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:47.450
and I change that voltage by a small amount
from, let's say, 2 V to 2.1. OK, I am going

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:48.450
to find the output voltage.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:57.530
Let's say I go from 2 V to 2.1 here. OK, abstractly
out there, I might have an output that goes

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:04.711
from three to, let's say, two V perhaps. OK,
so for a 0.1 change here, I'm going to get

00:43:04.711 --> 00:43:12.319
a bigger drop here, so from 3 V to 2 V, giving
me an amplification in this little circuit.

00:43:12.319 --> 00:43:17.040
OK, so we'll see this again and again, and
you'll really understand it. So, I have a

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.260
small change in the input, and I have a corresponding
larger change in the output. So, I've shown

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.260
you an amplifier.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:31.850
I haven't shown you a linear amplifier. There's
an extra charge for that. OK, that'll happen

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:39.000
later. OK, all I've shown you so far is an
amplifier, and this happens to be a crummy

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.770
amplifier. It's a nonlinear amplifier because,
notice, this is not linear.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:49.060
It's a nice little curve, and so it's not
linear. But, I promised you an amplifier,

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:54.460
and I'm cheap, and that's all you get for
now. OK, we'll see linear stuff later, but

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.330
for now, I have a little amplifier.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:01.130
So, let's do some real numbers, and plot some
numbers down, and also look at a demo. So,

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:10.660
let's do an example. Let's say VS is 10 V,
that the K is two milliamps per V squared,

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:18.970
and let's say RL is five kilo-ohms, OK? So,
let me substitute these values into that equation,

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:24.670
and I get V nought is, VS is ten.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:30.710
So, it's ten minus, KRL divided by two. So,
K is two milliamps. Two milliamps times five

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:44.710
kilo-ohms is ten divided by two gives me five,
and VI minus one squared. That's what I have.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:52.840
I just plug in a bunch of numbers, and that's
what I get.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:45:00.920
So, what I'll do is let me just do a little
table for you, and plot using real numbers,

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:06.380
simply plot those values for you.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:12.870
So when VI is zero, my current is zero, and
I get - oh, that equation doesn't apply, by

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:18.130
the way; that applies when VI is greater than
one. Ok. So as long as VI is less than one,

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.200
my output is simply VS, the output is simply
ten volts.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:32.010
Ok, so all the way up to one, my output V
is - all the units are all volts - that's

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:36.350
what I get.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:43.480
I come down to 2, I plug in two for VI, 2
minus 1 is a 1. So it's 1 squared. 5 times

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:53.020
1 squared is five. And 10 minus 5 is 5. I
get 5 out here.

00:45:53.020 --> 00:46:03.220
Ok? And then, I can go and do the math. If
it's 2.1, I get 4 volts here. And 2.2, I get

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:16.630
2.8. And so on. Ok, notice that the .1 volt
change here resulted in a - go up a .1 change

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:25.300
here results in a minus 1 volt change there.
So input went up by .1 volts, my output...

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.460
kerplunked down by one whole volt.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.890
Ok, so a small change here resulted in a bigger
change there. And that's the amplification

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:34.370
that I am claiming here.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:41.000
Ok? So. Let me show you a small demo of a
small device that I built involving such a

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:51.369
dependent source.

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:53.150
Let's do it here.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:47:02.500
Ok. So on my s axis, here is VI. And VO is
on my y axis. And focus on this little point

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.500
here.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:13.680
Ok? Right now my VI is zero. And so therefore
that's my output. I will gradually increase

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:20.720
VI, we're going to watch the output and see
how it behaves. Pretty much like the little

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.110
graph I drew for you.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:33.140
So I'm increasing VI. Ok, notice that invitially
the current source is off, the dependent source

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:43.970
is off, so I move straight down. Ok, nothing
happens. Until I hit a value at which the

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:49.940
the current source begins to come on. And
then I begin to see a drop in the output as

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:56.480
the current source begins to conduct current.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:03.650
So you see that as I increase the voltage
VI, boom! You see the huge drop.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:11.440
Ok, notice that for a small change, I'm now
getting a big drop in the output. Ok?

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:17.200
So let's pause here for a second, and in the
last couple of minutes, I want to cover one

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:36.100
last point.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:41.010
Notice that the curve I've shown you up there
looks like the curve up here: it goes kaboom!

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:50.610
and drops according to come kind of formulation
that I've shown you here.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:55.910
In the last couple of minutes, let me discuss
a small point that's a practical issue.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:06.040
In the curve that I showed you, in the mathematics
that I gave you, if you just go by the math.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:11.190
So what I'm about to show you will differentiate
a mathematician from an electrical engineer.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:24.010
Mathematicians would have taken the curve,
and reported it like this. This is zero.

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:31.460
Mathematically, that equation says that starting
here, this current simply goes down. But if

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.860
I told you this device that I have here, this
dependent source is a practical dependent

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:44.100
source, a device that I have physically built,
and I also say that it's a passive device.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:48.590
In other words, it cannot produce power. It's
like a little resistor. It doesn't produce

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.310
power. It's a passive device.

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:57.310
So if it's a passive device, if I tell you
that, then you'll say, Something doesn't make

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:03.620
sense here. Mathematically, it says it should
look like this. But what's special about a

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:10.020
point down here? The point down here says
the output has gone negative. This is zero

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:15.801
here. The output has gone negative. And my
current source is still supplying a current.

00:50:15.801 --> 00:50:25.260
Ok, so up here, the voltage across the device
is positive, and it's supplying a current,

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:33.090
so it's consuming power like a resistor. Like
all bad little resistors do, they burn power.

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:37.550
So here, on the other hand, my output is going
to be negative, but it's still sitting there

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:44.200
sinking current. Ok, because VO is negative,
but my current is still in the same direction,

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.590
what has now happened is the device has begun
to supply power.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:51.980
So mathematically, this curve says the device
has begun to supply power.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:58.869
It turns out it's not a practical device,
it's a passive device. So it cannot go here.

00:50:58.869 --> 00:51:06.150
So what happens is that somewhere along here,
our model breaks down. The equation I've shown

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.940
you for the current source, where is it?

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.940
This model breaks down.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:18.680
When V0 becomes very small, the model breaks
down and it no longer behaves like a current

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680
source.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:28.630
It begins to behave more and more like a resistor.
And what happens realistically, is that the

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:35.490
output goes down and then kind of becomes
a zero-hugging line. I'll show you that in

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.040
a second.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.430
And it doesn't - for this particular device
it doesn't really go down here.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:49.270
Let me just show you that part. So notice
for that device, mathematically, just by that

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.760
model, it should have just gone through the
floor and it points through to the corridor

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.600
below, but this is a prcatical device.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:02.660
So notice that the model breaks down. And
that's what begins to happen.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:08.980
Ok, the device stops behaving like a dependent
current source, rather it behaves like some

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:13.360
corny old resistor or something like that
and saturates out. Ok.
