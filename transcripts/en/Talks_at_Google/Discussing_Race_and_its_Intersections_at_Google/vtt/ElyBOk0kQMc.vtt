00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.670
SPEAKER 1: We present to
you the final Decoding

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
Race talk back here at
my home, New York City,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.070
and I will now introduce
Roland Martin who

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.340
has been an amazing friend
to me for more than 10 years.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.470
He's an award-winning
journalist,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.030
an all-around amazing
television-radio personality.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.600
He's the current host of
"NewsOne Now" of TV One

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.780
and just fantastic.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.910
He was the first moderator
for Decoding Race,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.700
and he's going to give
us a grand closing.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.200
So join us, Roland.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.794
Thank you.

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:40.677
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.677 --> 00:00:42.010
ROLAND MARTIN: All right, folks.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.530
What's up?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.040
I'm on?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.360
I'm on?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.956
I'm on now?

00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:46.622
All right, cool.

00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:48.320
So how are we doing?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.820
OK.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.404
I break rules.

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:50.778
I'm not going to
be sitting down.

00:00:50.778 --> 00:00:52.070
So let me move this over here.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.680
All right.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.970
So everybody's good?

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.750
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.260
ROLAND MARTIN: All right, then.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.449
So they gave me a list
of questions to ask.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.740
I don't know why they did that.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.040
So whoever stayed up to
write those questions,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.536
cut somebody out, because
I'm not going to read them.

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:05.680
You wasted your time.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.990
We're going to have
a great conversation.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.700
So I'm going to bring up
our panelists right now.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.950
So let's get this thing going.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.434
So you all are
like, he really did

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:12.600
say he was going to do that.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.120
I tell you.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.340
Luvvie, come on out, Luvvie.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.152
Thank you for dressing
up for the panel.

00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:19.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.220
Appreciate that.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.610
We appreciate that.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.480
Yes.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.290
Looking mighty
dressy, of course.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230
"New York Times" best
selling author, speaker,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.490
digital strategies.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.710
Of course, she deals at
the intersection of comedy,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.870
technology, and activism.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.497
Of course, we just
call her Luvvie.

00:01:34.497 --> 00:01:35.330
You got a last name?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.600
Are you like Cher or Madonna?

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.520
LUVVIE AJAYI: Ajayi.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.760
ROLAND MARTIN: OK.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.970
Gotcha.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.150
All right.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.660
Cool.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.021
Just checking.

00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:40.520
All right.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.546
Give it up for Luvvie Ajayi.

00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:45.378
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.378 --> 00:01:46.270
Vint Cerf.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.450
Vint, where are you, Vint?

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.080
Come on up.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.360
VINT CERF: I'm right here.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.943
ROLAND MARTIN: He
dressed the hell up.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.610
Vint with a three-piece.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.580
All right.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.540
Vice President, Chief Internet
Evangelist for Google.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.820
Of course, contributes to
global policy development

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.930
and continued spread of
the internet as well.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.908
Give it up for Vint.

00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:04.408
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:07.230
VINT CERF: Thank you.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.370
ROLAND MARTIN: Paola Mendoza,
the Chief Co-director

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.320
of Partnerships and Artistic
Director for the Women's March

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.530
in Washington.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.740
She's done documentaries
like "Free Like the Birds,"

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.280
"Autumn's Eyes," "La
Toma," "Still Standing."

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.890
Wow, that's mighty
environmental of you.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.920
"Free Like the Birds,"
"Autumn's Eyes," What's next?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.930
Winter Solstice?

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.360
PAOLA MENDOZA: Yes.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.380
ROLAND MARTIN: All right, cool.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.000
All right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.452
So give it up for Paola, please.

00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:32.396
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:32.896
All right.

00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:33.960
Where's Eddie Huang?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.220
Eddie, where are you?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.400
Eddie, come on up.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.110
All in the back, hanging out.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.630
He's a lawyer turned clothing
designer, restaurateur,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.727
TV host, and author.

00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:45.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.880
Guess you were bored
with the law, huh?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.922
EDDIE HUANG: How are you?

00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:51.421
ROLAND MARTIN: So of course,
he has a restaurant in New York

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.345
City's East Village.

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:54.220
He also is the author
of the "New York Times"

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.010
best selling memoir "Fresh
Off the Boat" and host

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.820
of his own show on Viceland.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.810
That's our panel.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.000
So anytime we have
these conversations,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.812
folks always it's a
conversation about race.

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:11.020
And I never understood what--

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.460
I don't see what people
really mean by that.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.190
And so anybody can jump in.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.080
I'm not going to direct
it to anybody at all.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.480
What should folks get
out of these discussions,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.790
out of these conversations?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.996
What should they get?

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:27.120
Don't need raise your hand.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.710
VINT CERF: First thing I would
say is that what you want

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.710
is to get comfortable
with candor.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.480
That's probably the
most valuable lesson

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.010
that you could
possibly take away

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.160
is it's OK to have candid
discussions about hard topics,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.550
not only here in Google
but outside as well.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.160
EDDIE HUANG: I think it's
important with race discussion

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.461
to acknowledge that
it's a social construct.

00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:54.460
Do you know what I mean?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.070
Like race is a social
construct, and I

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.140
think an excellent starting
point for any conversation

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.440
about race is to acknowledge
that it's a social construct,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.710
that we carry pretty much the
same genetic DNA amongst all

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.140
of us and that a lot of the
things people have told us

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.100
about race are
entirely fabricated.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.930
VINT CERF: That's fair.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.370
LUVVIE AJAYI: So
social constructs

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.560
are sometimes we want to use as
an excuse to not give something

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.200
the weight that it should have.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.789
Money is also a
social construct.

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.080
Language is a social construct.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.380
But it's as real as the
fact that the sky is blue,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.260
because how we
behave around race

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.320
means that social construct
has real-life consequences.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.210
So I don't want people to be
thinking, just because it's

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.680
social in that we just created
it, we created most things.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.950
This chair, Christmas, but
we give each other gifts.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.870
Like, Santa is not real.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.945
VINT CERF: He's not?

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:53.570
EDDIE HUANG: But the
thing is with race

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.750
is that so many people have
been promoting or perpetuating

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.290
the idea that there is some
genetic foundation to race.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.290
I'm sure you remember that
"Sports Illustrated" article

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.790
from 25 years ago saying
that black athletes had

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.360
a different ligament or
a different hamstring

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.175
and trying to give credence to
race with a genetic foundation.

00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:21.250
And I think it's important
to kind of dispel

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.210
a lot of those myths when
having those conversations.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.660
It's a starting point.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.760
Of course, social
constructs have

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.030
the value that you give it.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.550
Do you feel like
at times with race

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.650
that people have tried to create
a narrative that it's destiny

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.370
or that sometimes the way
people act is predetermined

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.040
by the universe
or somebody else.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.960
PAOLA MENDOZA: I think
also with regards

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.750
to what people should be
talking about with regards

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.860
to race today, I want people
to recognize where we are

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.310
politically in this country
today is, in my mind,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.980
because of our lack of
ability to speak about race,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.585
to see where the president
is and the policies that he's

00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:09.280
implementing now, in my mind,
are surrounded and based

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.150
in the idea of white supremacy.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.210
And even that word, when
you start saying that word,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.934
people get very uncomfortable.

00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:22.600
And I think, as you
were saying, that we

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.720
have to lean into that quote,
unquote "uncomfortability,"

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.510
those courageous discussions,
those daring discussions

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.770
to move forward in
order to get to a more

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.175
honest and sincere place.

00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:36.050
ROLAND MARTIN: When we
talk about this issue,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.320
I think for so many
people, they're

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.530
wholly ignorant of
American history.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.760
And so that's also
part of the problem.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.510
When you begin to confront
the issue of race,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.420
and you begin to understand
economically, understand

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.007
socially and culturally, as
you begin to talk to folks,

00:06:52.007 --> 00:06:53.840
you start throwing out
things that happened.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.020
And two years from now
we'll be commemorating

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.960
the 400th anniversary of the
first folks of African descent

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.320
to come to the United
States in 1619.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.080
You explain to people
244 years of slavery,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.090
almost 100 years of Jim Crow,
even mention reconstruction.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.620
And I'm not talking about the
low-information Trump voters.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.476
I was in an event after
the election in DC.

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:15.100
So all these really
smart people there,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.080
probably about five
black people in the room,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.444
about four Latinos in the room.

00:07:18.444 --> 00:07:19.860
I think there were
a couple Asian.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.550
Everybody else was white.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.440
And I asked the
question, how many of you

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.760
know about reconstruction?

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.250
Literally three hands went up.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.085
Three.

00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:30.719
VINT CERF: Doesn't that happen
after surgery or something?

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:31.510
ROLAND MARTIN: Huh?

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.430
VINT CERF: Sorry.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.200
ROLAND MARTIN: They
all had lobotomies.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.051
I don't know what was going on.

00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:40.590
And so even when I threw out the
question of same-sex marriage,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.414
Equal Protection
Clause, 14th Amendment,

00:07:42.414 --> 00:07:44.330
I'm like, that was a
reconstruction amendment.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.070
They had no idea.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.570
And so when you try to even
have a conversation as to how

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.134
we got to this point and folks
have no idea about history,

00:07:53.134 --> 00:07:55.300
I think that also is a
contributing factor as to why

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.000
people are so scared
because, frankly, they

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.050
don't know jack even with
their wonderful degrees.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.970
VINT CERF: So can I just
make an observation?

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.830
It's something that you said
I think is very important.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.750
It's this social construct
notion applies not only

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.220
to race, but it applies to all
kinds of different groupings.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.900
You can group people
by all kinds of--

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.780
I'm the token old fart,
for example, up here.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.140
So the point I want to
make is the same tensions

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.400
can arise out of various
groupings, not just about race.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.250
The value of having the racial
discussion, today anyway,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.010
is that it will apply to all
those other groupings as well.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.250
So there is a depth
of knowledge which

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.490
is missing, not only about
factual history with regard

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.280
to race but about other
factual history with regard

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.364
to other groupings, whether
it's economic or, in my case,

00:08:45.364 --> 00:08:46.780
I'm hearing impaired,
for example,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.080
and so I fall into
a minority category

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.390
in that particular grouping.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.310
So anyway, I just
think that the lessons

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.410
that we can learn from
these conversations

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.490
are broadly applicable to a
wide range of different kinds

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.210
of prejudice.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.626
ROLAND MARTIN: One reason why
I think this is important is

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.300
because-- and I've been
saying this since 2009--

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.466
that we are about to embark
on what I call a 30-year war.

00:09:11.466 --> 00:09:12.340
VINT CERF: Holy moly.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.840
ROLAND MARTIN: And it's real.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.380
Not the next election for
30 years, because by 2044

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.720
no one group will be
the dominant majority

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.010
in this country.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:26.020
And once you start peeling back
the layers of why people feel

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.890
the way they feel today,
you cannot help but get

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.810
to the defining issue of race.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.350
I'll throw this out to you.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.502
So when the study was done last
year, the question was asked,

00:09:36.502 --> 00:09:37.960
are you optimistic
about the future

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.110
of America for the next
10 years economically?

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.880
African-Americans,
lowest wealth in America,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.950
highest optimism 58%.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.572
Latinos, second lowest wealth,
second highest optimism.

00:09:50.572 --> 00:09:51.530
VINT CERF: Interesting.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.904
ROLAND MARTIN:
Whites in America,

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:55.277
highest wealth, lowest optimism.

00:09:55.277 --> 00:09:56.860
LUVVIE AJAYI: That's
because they know

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.380
they're losing their power.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.920
So it makes sense.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.380
When you are the
person at the top,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.296
you're the person that
everyone's gunning for.

00:10:04.296 --> 00:10:06.304
So you know you have
nowhere to go but down.

00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:09.310
I'd be sad too.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.260
But it's about time.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.500
That makes perfect sense.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.007
We have higher optimism because
we're like, we can only go up.

00:10:19.007 --> 00:10:20.715
VINT CERF: It can't
get any worse, right?

00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:21.063
LUVVIE AJAYI: It
can't get any worse,

00:10:21.063 --> 00:10:22.650
so I'm like I have nothing
but good things coming,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.300
because if it got any worse,
jeez, I'd just not be here.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.675
ROLAND MARTIN:
But the reason I'm

00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:28.610
putting that out
there, because whenever

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.650
there are these discussions on
television, radio, in print,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.210
they literally skip
right over that

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.480
and don't then ask a
second question, why?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.570
Because now the
why question then

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.040
informs where we stand today.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.510
The reaction to Trump
running, the reaction

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.400
to other candidates, what
buttons are being pushed.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.490
And so when the immigration
button is being pushed,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.400
they're really pushing
a different button.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.500
When you have the whole
issue of globalism.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.990
That's another
button being pushed.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.455
No one talks about how
technology has changed the game

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:04.350
or how automation has wiped out
significant numbers of jobs.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.530
Oh, no no.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.030
Send those folks back to Mexico.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.820
That's why we don't
have our jobs.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.210
Those are buttons being pushed.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.090
I just think that we have
to go much deeper when

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.615
we start talking
about why people

00:11:14.615 --> 00:11:17.320
are responding the way
they respond politically.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.730
EDDIE HUANG: And
also immigration

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.210
is a boon to the economy.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.230
It always has, if you
study immigration patterns.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.220
Even Buffalo, New York did not
have an increase in population

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.470
since I believe the 1950s.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.470
In the last few years,
it has the most--

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.950
it's like the fourth largest
growing city in America

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.480
is Buffalo, New York.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.670
And a lot of it is
immigrants coming

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.240
from Africa and the Middle
East, creating businesses.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.650
You look at--

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.060
I believe it's
Deerfield, Michigan--

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.810
it's a very strong
Middle Eastern community.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.330
Immigrants coming America,
they create businesses,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.120
they become customers,
they become landowners.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.260
And it's a boon to the country.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.110
ROLAND MARTIN: But the
history, though, shows those.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.620
When you have
economic anxieties,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.409
there always is a tendency
I need to blame somebody.

00:12:09.409 --> 00:12:11.200
EDDIE HUANG: And that's
a social construct.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.940
That is a narrative
that white people

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.980
who are afraid of the
dispossession of their country,

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.870
they create that narrative
that it's Mexicans taking jobs.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.400
It's immigrants taking jobs.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.610
Immigrants fill jobs that normal
second and third-generation

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.480
Americans, they
don't want to take.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.030
They don't need to take.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.100
This is the new
workforce coming in,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.310
whether it's building the
railroads, reconstruction,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.110
the Panama Canal, the gold rush.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.070
It was always immigrants coming
in and filling these jobs.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.680
VINT CERF: So could I just
make an observation about this?

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.370
This entire country is
nothing but immigrants.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.690
ROLAND MARTIN: Vint, you're
on the panel for observation.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.773
You don't have to tell me.

00:12:49.314 --> 00:12:51.230
You're saying you want
to make an observation.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.240
EDDIE HUANG: I agree with you.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.240
ROLAND MARTIN: Go ahead.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:53.741
Go ahead.

00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.490
VINT CERF: No, no.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.180
I just wanted to make
that observation,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.750
that this entire country
is nothing but immigrants.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.420
That's where we all came from.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.660
In fact, we displaced the
folks who were here before,

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.890
which is another big issue.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.740
EDDIE HUANG: Before they were
Mexicans, before there was--

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.740
PAOLA MENDOZA: The Irish,
before it was Chinese,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.750
before it was Japanese.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.625
EDDIE HUANG: Italian,
Irish, or Jewish people

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:15.880
were treated the
way that a lot of us

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.750
are treated now,
maybe not as badly.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.130
But like there was
always another.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.380
There was always a
new immigration group.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.590
There was always another.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.840
PAOLA MENDOZA: So the reality
is, just off that point,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.220
I think that from the
2008 economic collapse,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.990
cities that had the
most immigration

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.630
population were the ones
that actually responded--

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.930
rebounded economically
better than other cities.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.490
And our reality here
is, where we are today,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.620
is to be an immigrant--
the existence

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.920
of an immigrant really at this
moment in time is to resist.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.980
My existence as an immigrant
born in Colombia, here

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.680
in the United States for
the majority of my life

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.240
is one of resistance
because, again,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.350
the political structure,
power structure, power vacuum

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.440
that we're in.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.260
And on top of that, the idea
of undocumented immigrants

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:05.880
is even--

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.592
we see what was going on
yesterday in Texas with SB4

00:14:10.592 --> 00:14:12.550
and the protests that
were there and that there

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.512
were actual fights between state
representatives on the floor,

00:14:15.512 --> 00:14:17.470
and they were threatening--
one was threatening

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.000
to shoot another one.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.060
He said that he called
ICE on protesters.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.370
And so that is the political
climate where we are.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.310
And I truly believe
that we're there

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.032
because actually we are
unable to communicate

00:14:30.032 --> 00:14:30.740
with one another.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.510
We are unable to reach
across the aisle, whatever

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.811
that aisle is, and see what
is happening with someone

00:14:36.811 --> 00:14:37.810
that thinks differently.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.049
Now, having a conversation
obviously is not--

00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:41.590
I'm not saying to
have a conversation

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.830
is allowing for oppression
and for oppressive thoughts

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.270
to be legitimized but to
actually just sit down

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.330
with someone and say let's
break down the facts.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.220
Let's break down the
history of this country

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.290
and talk about immigration
and talk about race

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.609
and see where we are and
see where we've been.

00:14:58.609 --> 00:15:00.400
And so where are we
going to go and how are

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.340
we going to break the cycle?

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.440
But we're not doing
that at this moment.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.180
ROLAND MARTIN:
Except when you're

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.950
defining things by fake news.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.860
But you mentioned something
there when you said resist.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.110
So the question I have--

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:16.870
OK, resist is one thing,
to get what is another.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:22.090
So I can look at Montgomery
Improvement Association taking

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.270
place December 1st after
Emmett Till is killed.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.140
And then I see this move in
the Black Freedom Movement,

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.600
this quest for freedom.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.750
But resist is one thing.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.910
To get what?

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.539
See because that's vital.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:39.330
PAOLA MENDOZA: Yes.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.340
ROLAND MARTIN: You can resist,
then it's OK I've resisted.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.650
But what the hell am I trying
to get with my resistance?

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.550
EDDIE HUANG: You know
I had a women's studies

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.050
professor in college break it
down for me, Dr. [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.800
She said, you know, what
I want in this world is

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.890
the same opportunity for the
same job for the same pay

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.017
for the same work.

00:15:58.017 --> 00:15:59.600
And I was like, that
makes some sense.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.270
And in terms of
resistance, the thing

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.580
I always think
about resisting is

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.430
Americans have to resist this
idea that the country belongs

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.320
to one dominant cultural group.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.110
It doesn't belong to one
dominant cultural group.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.690
The country belongs to
this idea that there

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.450
can be a land in
this world founded

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.880
on equality, freedom
of expression,

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.670
and multiculturalism.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.145
ROLAND MARTIN: But
stop right there.

00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:21.500
EDDIE HUANG: That
is the idea that--

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.624
ROLAND MARTIN: I got
something right there, though.

00:16:23.624 --> 00:16:28.327
You said a nation
founded on equality.

00:16:28.327 --> 00:16:29.285
LUVVIE AJAYI: The idea.

00:16:29.285 --> 00:16:30.201
EDDIE HUANG: The idea.

00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:31.368
ROLAND MARTIN: But-- no, no.

00:16:31.368 --> 00:16:32.367
PAOLA MENDOZA: But what?

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.320
ROLAND MARTIN: But even
that idea was a lie.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.611
PAOLA MENDOZA: It wasn't, yeah.

00:16:35.611 --> 00:16:39.490
ROLAND MARTIN: Because if you
are not a white male landowner,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.990
the country was not
founded for you.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.940
EDDIE HUANG: That's why I
say it's an idea, not a fact.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.420
You know what I mean?

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.590
It's been sold around
the world as this idea.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.720
LUVVIE AJAYI: Right.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.440
EDDIE HUANG: But that's
our cultural soft powers

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.690
that we've exported this idea.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.729
VINT CERF: Actually, it's
an aspiration and which

00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:52.270
it involved--

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.090
EDDIE HUANG: It's a lifestyle.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.040
LUVVIE AJAYI: I
don't even think--

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.081
that's the thing, though.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:57.610
I don't even think America
aspires for equality.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.510
That's the thing.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.150
This country plays the
global captain save a planet,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.069
like runs through and be like
there's no democracy here.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.390
We're going to bomb your place.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.140
Meanwhile, in our own country,
what happens, I think America--

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.730
back to one of your points--

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.030
one of the reasons why
we can't move forward

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.624
is because America
does not do a good job

00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:21.040
of looking at itself in the
mirror and being like, oh, OK.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.900
I see what's coming back at me.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.579
It's playing this global leader
has this very high moral stance

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.079
elsewhere.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.810
But what's happening
in the country

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.970
is just not-- it's the
same things we're bombing

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.260
people for is happening here.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.610
ROLAND MARTIN:
Well, you're right.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.237
I think if you read Stephen
Kinzer's book, "Overthrow,"

00:17:35.237 --> 00:17:36.820
if you want to look
at what Russia did

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.920
to us in the last election--

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.215
PAOLA MENDOZA: Right.

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:38.510
You've done.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.301
ROLAND MARTIN: Hell,
we did that going back

00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:42.421
to [INAUDIBLE] in Iran in 1954.

00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:44.420
PAOLA MENDOZA: We did
that to all Latin America.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.590
ROLAND MARTIN: We pretty
perfected the art of jacking up

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.280
a country--

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.680
PAOLA MENDOZA: Yes.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.051
ROLAND MARTIN:
--with that group.

00:17:50.051 --> 00:17:50.510
No, seriously.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.870
PAOLA MENDOZA: Fact.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:51.370
It's true.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.076
Fact.

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:54.700
ROLAND MARTIN: But the reason I
want to stay on this whole idea

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.430
in terms of this
ideal, because as we're

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.370
talking about moving
discussions forward, trying

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.100
to figure it out, I think
we have to deal with that.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.580
Because if you look
at income inequality

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.880
now, if you look
at how much wealth

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.570
is being held in
so few hands, it

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.490
is literally a 21st
century version

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.257
of when this
country was created.

00:18:15.257 --> 00:18:16.090
PAOLA MENDOZA: Yeah.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:16.990
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.615
ROLAND MARTIN: You're literally
in the exact same spot in terms

00:18:19.615 --> 00:18:21.740
of a handful of
people with wealth

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.440
determining the future
direction of the country.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.100
And so I go back to
this notion of resist.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.087
We are resisting to do what?

00:18:32.087 --> 00:18:33.170
VINT CERF: Well, presume--

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.790
ROLAND MARTIN: To get what?

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.300
VINT CERF: Presumably more
equal treatment for everyone.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.350
More equal opportunity
for everyone.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.183
PAOLA MENDOZA: Yeah.

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:43.590
I think we're resisting
for two things.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.380
In this immediate
moment, we're resisting

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.080
to protect our communities,
and all of our communities

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.786
are under attack
in various forms.

00:18:49.786 --> 00:18:51.160
And then I would
also say that we

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.630
are resisting for freedom,
like we're resisting

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.660
for freedom of everything.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.210
And it's something
to strive for.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.470
Will we get there?

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.030
Not in my lifetime.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.670
I don't know when
we'll get there.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.120
LUVVIE AJAYI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.328
PAOLA MENDOZA: I know, right?

00:19:04.328 --> 00:19:07.190
Sorry to break it to you.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.720
EDDIE HUANG: I
think it's the two

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.710
things is that equal protection
of the laws that has never

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.880
been present.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.640
And then the equal opportunity,
because I don't think anybody

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.980
here or listening or on
the stage wants anything

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.030
given to them.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.590
I just want the
same opportunity.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.120
ROLAND MARTIN: Like James
Brown said, open the door.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.510
I'll get it myself.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.780
LUVVIE AJAYI: You know--

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.738
PAOLA MENDOZA: Exactly.

00:19:24.738 --> 00:19:27.890
LUVVIE AJAYI: You know, I would
want something given to me.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.670
Yes.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.335
Because this country
has been people of color

00:19:32.335 --> 00:19:33.710
who have been
doing all the work.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.360
So things have been
given to white people.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.250
It's time for us to be
given some things too.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.460
And I think the lack of--

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.660
the guilt that comes with us, we
work so hard that sometimes we

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.260
do get something given to us,
we're like did I deserve it?

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.230
Yes.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.450
They've been getting this
for free for 400 years.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.310
It's time for us to get some
things for free too and not

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.400
feel the guilt.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.830
ROLAND MARTIN: I'll
go back to equality

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.000
and equal-- equal
protection, equal protection

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.830
clause, equality.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.690
A lot of people love
Dr. King and one

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.270
of the things they don't realize
is that he rarely ever used

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.180
the word equality.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.430
VINT CERF: That's interesting.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.490
ROLAND MARTIN: He
typically said freedom.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.260
He wanted freedom.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.506
You said that earlier and that
is the moment a child is born,

00:20:13.506 --> 00:20:15.380
even before that, you
want the mother to have

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.670
the same prenatal
care as somebody else.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:16.935
PAOLA MENDOZA: Yeah.

00:20:16.935 --> 00:20:17.200
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.100
ROLAND MARTIN: But you
want freedom, freedom

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.840
to drive down the street
and not get pulled over,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.440
freedom to not have somebody
call ICE because you

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.220
look Latino and they
think you're also

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.690
an illegal immigrant.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.690
That to me, I , think,
as we're moving forward,

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.880
I look at word usage.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.090
I think that's a more
powerful word, because when

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.350
you hear the so-called patriots,
oh, the founding fathers, they

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.645
believed in freedom.

00:20:43.645 --> 00:20:45.050
See, I don't want equality.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.924
Equality means you've
got to pass another law

00:20:46.924 --> 00:20:47.890
to give it to me.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.390
No.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.750
I want what you've
got without a law.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.552
That's freedom.

00:20:51.552 --> 00:20:53.510
VINT CERF: So could I
make a suggestion to you?

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.154
When we look at
the Constitution,

00:20:55.154 --> 00:20:56.570
and we look at the
Bill of Rights,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.180
and you see the First Amendment
that speaks about freedom

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.890
of expression,
freedom to assemble,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:01.610
freedom of [INAUDIBLE]--

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.810
ROLAND MARTIN: Not equality
of expression, freedom.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.030
VINT CERF: No, no.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:03.530
Yes.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.820
I agree with you.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.320
But I wanted to
emphasize something

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.700
that you didn't mention.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.200
And that's another
notion of freedom

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.680
from harm, which is not
in our Bill of Rights

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.000
but it should be.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.310
That's the one thing that
we are willing to give up

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.010
a certain amount of freedom
in exchange for safety.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.090
And that's part of
the social contract.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.720
It's a very tricky
concept, but it's one

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.420
that we have to embrace
because without that--

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.790
in theory, my freedom of
action should stop about 1 cm

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.414
from your nose.

00:21:36.414 --> 00:21:38.622
ROLAND MARTIN: Actually it
should stop in that chair.

00:21:38.622 --> 00:21:41.077
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:41.077 --> 00:21:44.514
That's where it should stop.

00:21:44.514 --> 00:21:48.210
You get your ass out that chair,
it's going to be a problem.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.400
EDDIE HUANG: That's actually
the more conservative

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.660
interpretation of Locke.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.230
He has the more liberal
interpretation of Locke

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.250
in the social contract,
which is that it's

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.175
up to the centimeter
of your nose.

00:21:58.175 --> 00:22:00.960
It's that you can express
your freedom to the extent

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.360
that it does not impose
on someone else's

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.570
unlimited freedom.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.680
And so I think as a
society it's like boxing.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.650
It's about mastering
your distance.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.233
ROLAND MARTIN: So
I'll throw this out.

00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:14.370
So here we have
massive changes when

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.430
I look at what young
folks are doing today,

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:20.430
which is not unlike any
other areas of history.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.990
I can think back to SNCC--

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.880
Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee--

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.254
1960s, meeting at Shaw
University and what they did

00:22:26.254 --> 00:22:28.170
and how they drove the
Black Freedom Movement.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.957
VINT CERF: SDS.

00:22:28.957 --> 00:22:31.290
ROLAND MARTIN: But here's
what's very interesting to me,

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.200
is that when you begin to look
at polling data, when you look

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.780
at white millennials
who believe today

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.732
that racism against whites is
just as significant as it is

00:22:41.732 --> 00:22:43.440
against African-Americans--
to your point

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.320
about it being a construct--
we have, I believe,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.260
sold ourselves this
false notion that, oh,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.210
but kids they all
listen to hip hop.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:51.960
It's all good.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.908
LUVVIE AJAYI: It's the
least racist generation.

00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:58.033
ROLAND MARTIN: You find
that hilarious, I can tell.

00:22:58.033 --> 00:23:00.690
EDDIE HUANG: I find it hilarious
because I remember growing up,

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.900
I actually felt a
lot of solidarity.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.610
I found a lot of connectivity
to hip hop music.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.010
It was the music that made me
feel less alone and less alien

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.940
because I was the only
Chinese kid in school.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.450
But I knew that a
lot of the other kids

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.830
listening to it, that
it was a phase for them.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.880
It was a costume, like
they come back from summer

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.976
and it's like, oh, I'm wearing
FUBU and Phat Farm now,

00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:28.350
but then I knew next summer
they'd be wearing Abercrombie

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.541
&amp; Fitch, you know?

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:30.332
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:23:30.332 --> 00:23:32.650
EDDIE HUANG: And by the
time people went to college,

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.690
they just dropped it.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.814
A lot of people dropped it.

00:23:34.814 --> 00:23:37.840
But then hip hop became
a mainstream culture.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.050
But I think that says
more about this art form

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.450
that black communities
created, the power of hip hop

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.782
and how undeniable it is.

00:23:46.782 --> 00:23:48.990
It's the most powerful
movement of the last 30 years.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.531
ROLAND MARTIN: What
I'm trying to say

00:23:50.531 --> 00:23:53.130
is that we can't
live on this idea

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:58.710
that just because there are
folks today who are 24, 25, 26,

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.920
that somehow everything
is going to change

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.590
because they live in a
much more diverse world

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.090
than their parents.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.150
We actually still
take on the identity

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.500
and the views of our parents.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.000
How--

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.210
EDDIE HUANG: It
becomes more insidious

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.920
when you don't think
there is an actual threat.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.430
PAOLA MENDOZA: Right.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:15.221
EDDIE HUANG: Right?

00:24:15.221 --> 00:24:19.170
And so I think the ABC show,
that "Fresh Off The Boat"

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.620
is a real good example of
they'll use your yellow faces

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.240
and tell white stories.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.810
You know?

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.360
ROLAND MARTIN: So
moving forward,

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.030
how do we be mindful
of that to ensure

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.330
we don't fall into the
trap of just assuming,

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.600
oh, it's all good?

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.330
EDDIE HUANG: I'm probably
the wrong person to ask.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.320
LUVVIE AJAYI: Well,
we shouldn't assume.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.960
So part of the
thing is we always

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.080
assume people are at the same
place we are in understanding,

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.330
in knowledge and
wherever our beliefs are.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.560
And that's completely wrong.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.540
Everyone got shocked
November 9 being

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.767
like, oh god, I thought
everybody I knew

00:24:50.767 --> 00:24:51.600
was voting this way.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.134
No.

00:24:52.134 --> 00:24:53.550
That assumption
is wrong, which is

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.424
why the conversation
needs to happen in rooms

00:24:55.424 --> 00:24:57.557
that are difficult or not.

00:24:57.557 --> 00:24:59.640
We need to talk about white
privilege and the fact

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.470
that most people don't even
know what white privilege means.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.220
They just think it
means that I got things

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.620
handed to me all my life.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.789
These kids who are 24, 25
still doing blackface parties.

00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:10.580
And then we want to
sit and be like they're

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.820
the least racist generation.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.960
No, they're not.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.850
They're being raised
by racists, so they're

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.390
going to be racist too.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.200
It doesn't matter if they're
around black people all day.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.720
If their mom and your dad
has beaten in your head

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.630
that this is exactly how--
white supremacy and the idea

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.490
of genetic supremacy.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.590
And that is going to be
what they carry with them.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.570
So we have to bring it to them.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:36.060
ROLAND MARTIN: Does it
behoove us to quickly call

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.890
someone or something racist?

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.702
Here's is why I'm putting that
out there-- before you answer--

00:25:41.702 --> 00:25:42.660
so here's what happens.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.940
We have these
conversations today.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.970
An event happens,
let's say blackface.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.970
All of a sudden it
goes, that's racist.

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.350
No, it's not.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.680
The conversation then is
no longer about blackface.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.610
The conversation is now you're
racist, you're not a racist.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.340
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah,
self-preservation.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.756
ROLAND MARTIN: The
argument that I

00:26:00.756 --> 00:26:04.470
make is there is a whole lot
of stuff in between racist

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:05.550
and non-racist.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.770
I've rarely called
someone a racist,

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.940
because I want to stay focused
on exactly what happened

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.050
as opposed to that conversation,
because it will quickly shift.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:16.800
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.110
For me, if I'm talking
to somebody about race

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.330
or I feel like maybe
something is racist,

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.030
I try to establish with
them in the conversation,

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.400
I don't want anything from you.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.234
I want this for you.

00:26:28.234 --> 00:26:29.233
Do you know what I mean?

00:26:29.233 --> 00:26:31.170
I want you to have
this understanding

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.300
so everything I'm telling you
is not for me to report you

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.490
or to complain about
you or ruin your career.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.925
I'm here for you to get
closer to the truth.

00:26:38.925 --> 00:26:39.800
You know what I mean?

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.610
ROLAND MARTIN: Paola,
I'm going to go to you.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.318
So for instance, same
thing happened when

00:26:42.318 --> 00:26:43.780
it came to the Women's March.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.060
I've been highly critical of the
National Organization for Women

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.393
for a long time because it
should have been the National

00:26:48.393 --> 00:26:49.680
Organization for White Women.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.410
PAOLA MENDOZA: Agreed.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.618
ROLAND MARTIN: So when a
14-year-old girl in McKinney

00:26:52.618 --> 00:26:55.670
had her face slammed into
the ground, now said nothing.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.300
And I put them on blast and
ever since then, every time

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.800
something happens
with a black girl,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.470
they put that statement
out in about 20 minutes.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.340
But the point being, if you
say it now you're racist,

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.830
the reaction from these
white liberal women,

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.430
oh my god, I'm not racist?

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.177
No, but you're silent.

00:27:12.177 --> 00:27:12.760
MENDOZA: Yeah.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.280
So this is exactly what I
was going to talk about,

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.070
is the idea and the power of
language or lack of language.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.800
So I work in the immigration
space, specifically

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.500
in the undocumented space,
and this is a new territory

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.030
for most people.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.040
So people don't necessarily
know the language.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.170
So you will hear
people say "illegal"

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:30.520
as opposed to "undocumented."

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.770
And I've kind of
perfected the way

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:37.210
in which to correct someone in a
non-confrontational, productive

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.790
way so that they actually
understand why they shouldn't

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.550
use that language.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.760
I don't call people out
publicly, or if I do,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.910
it's a very safe space
in which to do it in.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.669
And I think that goes
to your question,

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:49.210
because at the end
of the day, what's

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.360
important to me in that
circumstance in particular

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.140
is to educate, empower,
and create a conversation.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.210
And when we are attacking
people right away,

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.300
then that ability to have a
conversation is unattainable.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.210
But also keeping in mind that
there are just some people

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.080
that I will not engage
in conversation with,

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.290
and those are just
the outliers that we

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.840
don't talk to or engage with.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.940
And with regards to
the Women's March,

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.440
I think one of the
things that we're

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.970
most proud of is that we were
able to push the needle forward

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.850
within the women's
movement to talk

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.410
about this idea of feminism
being for white women

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.750
and really having white
women in particular

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.780
understand why feminism had
become so selectively white.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.880
And within the organization,
we had numerous conversations

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.930
where we were crying,
upset, laughing.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.150
And these were strangers.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.890
These were 25
women, 30 women that

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.110
came together, didn't
really know one another,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.430
to have these discussions.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.180
And the people that were really
having the most emotionally

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.160
difficult discussions
were the white women

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.285
because they were being
confronted in a space where

00:28:53.285 --> 00:28:56.279
they were actually equal
in numbers of women

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:57.320
of color and white women.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.520
They were not the majority.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.890
And so I always--

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.260
ROLAND MARTIN: And they
thought everything was good.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:01.630
PAOLA MENDOZA: Oh, yeah.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.260
They did know.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.190
They honestly didn't know.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.020
And so you don't know
what you don't know.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.360
So that's where you
start the conversation.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.570
And it's exhausting and tiring
and emotionally draining,

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.320
but it's one conversation
that each individual can

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.430
choose to take on.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.890
So my point is that
again, it goes back

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:22.660
to this idea of conversations,
of how do you call someone

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.430
out in a way that's
productive and where

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.000
they don't get defensive.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.917
LUVVIE AJAYI: Call in.

00:29:25.917 --> 00:29:26.875
PAOLA MENDOZA: Exactly.

00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:27.600
You call them in.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.058
ROLAND MARTIN: Let
me do this here.

00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:33.040
So how many folks in the
room have heard of Title IX?

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.020
VINT CERF: Oh yeah.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.640
ROLAND MARTIN: How
many of you believe

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.237
that Title IX was about sports?

00:29:39.237 --> 00:29:39.820
VINT CERF: No.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.854
It was about gender.

00:29:40.854 --> 00:29:41.770
ROLAND MARTIN: No, no.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.880
It was about-- the way that
it's been positioned that it's

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.280
about sports and gender.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.190
But if you actually
go back, Title IX

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.230
was created to
specifically open up

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.920
the professional schools
for women, doctors, lawyers,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.580
dentists.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.110
Now let me ask this question.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:04.730
Who knows where Title
IX even comes from?

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:05.990
Precisely.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.941
The 1964 Civil Rights Act.

00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:12.470
So Title IX gets passed, '72.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:13.390
Gets passed.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:16.430
You see an explosion of women
become doctors, dentists,

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.280
lawyers, engineers, in
professional schools.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.950
Largely white women, because
still the opportunities

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.700
were being closed
for black women.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.331
So all these women--

00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:27.080
talking about a lot
of women in the room--

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.580
who then go into
corporate America,

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.190
who get all these
particular jobs.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:32.090
Guess what?

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.090
They were able to advance
because black folks marched

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.740
to get the '64 Civil
Rights Act passed.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.769
PAOLA MENDOZA: Exactly.

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.560
ROLAND MARTIN: Now when
you throw that out,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.780
and I've done this in speeches,
white women in the room

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.155
look at me like,
oh, my god, what

00:30:43.155 --> 00:30:44.970
the hell is he talking about?

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.330
To Eddie's point, you're
talking about if you

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.610
are Chinese or
Korean or Japanese

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:53.210
and you appreciate voting
with your native tongue

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.000
in the ballot,
thank black people

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.945
and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

00:30:56.945 --> 00:30:59.570
I go back to the reconstruction
amendment, the Equal Protection

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.030
Clause, 14th Amendment,
that came out after slavery.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.170
The point I'm making is--

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.580
also if you're disabled.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.990
Remember the disabilities act?

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.880
Provision of the '64
Civil Rights Act.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.390
All of these laws
that have been changed

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.320
were a result of the
black freedom movement.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.770
And when you throw
that out there,

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.932
people then go, oh,
where you going?

00:31:17.932 --> 00:31:19.640
Which allows me to go
into the next part.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.610
That is when you look at
Black Lives Matter and then

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.740
these efforts that
are happening today,

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.560
these laws that are being--
these changes are being forced

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.960
not to just benefit black folks,
but again, like everything else

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.330
that I just said, to benefit
every other American.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:38.020
How do we get that
through folks' heads

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.940
that it just ain't
a black thing?

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.180
A body camera can
save your ass, too.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.020
VINT CERF: Good point.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.270
EDDIE HUANG: As a kid, like, I
didn't see Asian politicians.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.320
I didn't see that
many Asian leaders.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.540
There was not any
representation of us

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.760
culturally besides Bruce Lee.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.930
You know?

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.990
And I read Hank
Aaron's autobiography.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.040
I would read "Thank
You, Jackie Robinson."

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.500
I listened to Charles Barkley.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.916
You know, like, as much he
didn't want to be a role model,

00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.340
he was my role model, you know?

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.630
And I read about the march.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.880
I read about Malcolm
X, Martin Luther King.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.840
And I read, "I Have A Dream"
and compared it to "Letter

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.767
From Birmingham Jail."

00:32:18.767 --> 00:32:19.850
And I started to realize--

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.000
I was like, black people
have paved the way for anyone

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.190
of difference in America.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.660
And I think for me, I grew up
just always wanting solidarity,

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.970
because I could see
strength in solidarity

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.470
and I could see how
I was benefiting

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.870
from the work of
black Americans.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.517
And going to the Women's March--

00:32:38.517 --> 00:32:40.100
you know, I went to
the Women's March.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.224
It was one of the most
incredible things I've seen.

00:32:42.224 --> 00:32:45.040
And once I saw Trump
going at women,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.540
I was like, we're actually going
to make some progress here,

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.430
because everybody has a mother.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:53.220
Everybody has been kind of
slandered by this man now.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.300
And this is now
everybody's fight

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:55.610
and everybody has to join in.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.482
ROLAND MARTIN: Yes.

00:32:56.482 --> 00:32:57.440
EDDIE HUANG: And then--

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:57.940
I'm sorry.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.390
I haven't finished the point.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:04.070
Then the Women's March became
this platform and this canvas

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.670
that everyone could bring their
issues and their stories to.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.100
And I saw tons of
Black Lives posters.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.890
And you know, it
was a place where

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.020
everyone had a place
to come have a voice

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.370
and stand up for something.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.140
And the women at
the march really, I

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.640
think, carried the
torch and carried

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.150
a lot of people's issues
for them that day.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.800
ROLAND MARTIN: Yet 53% of
white women voted for Trump.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.050
Yet people then, after
the election, said whoa,

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.919
I was voting for this,
I totally ignored this.

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:35.960
Like all the people right
now who are now crying,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.850
please don't take
my health care.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.500
Now you're trying to wake up.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.200
So as we're moving forward, all
these different movements that

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.830
are going on--

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:43.610
EDDIE HUANG: I'll
take them whenever

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:44.818
they want to wake up, though.

00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:45.775
You know what I mean?

00:33:45.775 --> 00:33:47.525
LUVVIE AJAYI: I sat
out the Women's March,

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:50.330
and it was a persons
decision to do that.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.190
Because I was like,
you know what?

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.230
Yes, black people are
always showing up.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.094
Honestly, on this
day, I don't want to.

00:33:57.094 --> 00:33:58.760
So I actually sat
home, and I didn't go.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.080
But I was like, props
to everybody who went,

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.830
and I really respected the
significance of the event

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.300
and how massive it was.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.000
I mean, biggest protest ever.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.969
OK, so that was epic.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:15.050
But the fatigue that comes
from always showing up

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.600
for people who never show
up for you, on that day,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.469
I was not feeling the need
to be uniting with anybody.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.940
I was like, I
[INAUDIBLE] afterwards.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.340
But today, what happens
when black women do

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.219
decide to all sit out one day?

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:29.389
If we don't show up.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.639
Like, how far would we be--

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.080
how far would women be?

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.655
Even though we usually get
the brunt of, oh, my god,

00:34:35.655 --> 00:34:37.530
the Black Lives Matter
people are protesting.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.389
They should like,
stop stopping traffic.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:41.989
Meanwhile not
realizing that, like,

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.572
your kids are
benefiting from the fact

00:34:43.572 --> 00:34:45.320
that these people
are stopping traffic.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.000
So I mean, I think it's
really important for people

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.080
to acknowledge that.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.000
It's the fact that
black Americans do not

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.570
get enough credit for the amount
of work that they've put on--

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.190
I was born in
Nigeria, so I'm also

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.220
an immigrant in that I didn't
come here until I was nine.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.180
And Africans come here
and get really successful,

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.180
but we also have to
acknowledge the reason we're

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.700
able to do that is
because when we come here,

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.180
all the work that black
Americans have done

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.470
allow us to come here and
then become doctors in three

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.350
years and four years, and
then be able to be, like,

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:18.697
in the 10%, which is amazing.

00:35:18.697 --> 00:35:20.780
So I just wanted to take
this moment to say, like,

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.290
black Americans, y'all
are super heroes.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.860
You don't get told that enough.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.884
And history doesn't give you
enough credit, but it should.

00:35:27.884 --> 00:35:29.300
PAOLA MENDOZA: And
to that point--

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.720
and this is something that I'd
like to say publicly as often

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.830
as I can--

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.590
that the Women's March
was as successful

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.800
as it was because we were
literally on the backs of Black

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.490
Lives Matter.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.100
Black Lives Matter had been
training the American people

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.560
for two, three years previous
to the women's movement

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.070
to go out to the streets, to
protest, to shut things down.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.370
And it was when
the perfect event

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:55.430
of Donald Trump and
everything that he

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:59.000
had done to women and an
event was posted on Facebook

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.060
that we had just the
perfect energy, synergy,

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.700
whatever you want to call
it, to get millions of people

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.840
out to the street.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.780
But I don't think that we would
have had that had Black Lives

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.450
Matter not been happening for
three years previous to that.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.040
And also what you're
talking about I

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.706
think at the end of
the day is something

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:16.710
that is organizing 101.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.010
When we put the most
marginalized people

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.250
at the center of the movement,
and we work towards them,

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:26.220
and we realize that our freedom
is bound to their freedom,

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.950
that's the work that
needs to get done.

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:29.510
So when we're here
in this space,

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.664
and we're talking about race,
the reason race is important

00:36:32.664 --> 00:36:34.580
and the reason why we
need to be uncomfortable

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.280
and the reason why we need to
have these daring discussions

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.810
is because when we have them, we
will all start to become free.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.600
We will all get closer to that
place that we're striving for.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.200
And so I think that's why Google
is having this conversation,

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.820
because they are
obviously-- you all

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.670
are obviously at the forefront
of where we need to go.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.120
And that is why
it's important to,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.540
whether if you're white, if
you're black, if you're Latino,

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.320
if you're undocumented, if
you're gay, if you're straight,

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.990
if you're disabled,
whatever it is--

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.420
that is the importance and
the power of the conversation.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.086
ROLAND MARTIN: So but how are we
dealing with intersectionality?

00:37:05.182 --> 00:37:06.140
EDDIE HUANG: I'm sorry.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.230
I really want to respond to
what she said, because I really

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.790
understand your frustration.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.340
And you don't need
me to say it, but I

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:17.290
think it's very, very fair
that some people sat out

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.290
the Women's March.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.120
Because it's like the
sword in the stone,

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.120
do you know what I mean?

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.450
It's like, you know,
Black Lives Matter

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.400
have been pulling on
this sword in the stone,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.560
doing all the work
pushing it forward,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.390
trying to open America's eyes.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.022
And a lot of people
are just like, why

00:37:31.022 --> 00:37:33.230
are you saying-- why are we
talking about Black Lives

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.860
Matter?

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.690
Treating it almost
like a nuisance,

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.930
do you know what I mean?

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:37.305
Treating Colin
Kaepernick like he

00:37:37.305 --> 00:37:39.050
was a nuisance, when
in fact that man

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:43.220
sacrificed his career to make
a statement and awaken America.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.940
And it has to be frustrating
from a black perspective

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.900
to see that when white
women were attacked,

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.700
that then the sword was
taken out of the stone.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.046
ROLAND MARTIN: That's called
being black in America.

00:37:55.046 --> 00:37:57.005
No, I mean, that's the reality.

00:37:57.005 --> 00:37:58.100
EDDIE HUANG: Even a China man
can understand that, though.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.808
ROLAND MARTIN: We're
just like, you know.

00:37:59.808 --> 00:38:01.940
EDDIE HUANG: I'd like
to say this, too--

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.940
ROLAND MARTIN: You got
the New York Giants owner

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.530
in today's newspaper talking
about we got all these letters

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.946
from Giants fans saying we're
going to boycott if you sign

00:38:08.946 --> 00:38:10.850
Kaepernick, but they
didn't say a damn thing

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.125
when they had a
kicker who was beating

00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:12.840
the hell out of his wife.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.590
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.670
And the other thing, too, is I
would say, is, like, I totally

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.590
get the frustration,
but sometimes I

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.537
feel like, as a minority
or a person of color,

00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:23.870
however everyone's supposed
to be identified these days,

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.000
it's like unfortunately,
we may not have

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.440
the privilege of sitting out.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:27.650
ROLAND MARTIN: No, no, no.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.270
EDDIE HUANG: [INAUDIBLE],,
you know what I mean?

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.269
ROLAND MARTIN: Here's how
I see her sitting out.

00:38:31.269 --> 00:38:33.994
It's sort of like if we're
in a tug of war, it's like--

00:38:33.994 --> 00:38:36.160
EDDIE HUANG: You and Rick
Mahorn pull the chair out.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:36.930
ROLAND MARTIN: No, it's like--

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:37.760
I'm going to take a rest.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.180
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:38.340
LUVVIE AJAYI: That's it.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:38.840
That's it.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.589
ROLAND MARTIN: No.

00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:41.292
Basically, we're
like, in a tug of war,

00:38:41.292 --> 00:38:42.500
I'm going to take a breather.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.035
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:43.035 --> 00:38:44.035
LUVVIE AJAYI: That's it.

00:38:44.035 --> 00:38:44.770
ROLAND MARTIN: I'm
going to step out.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.610
And I'm going to get back in.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.620
LUVVIE AJAYI: I'm gonna get back
in, but give me five minutes.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.630
ROLAND MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.330
LUVVIE AJAYI: Your turn.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.680
ROLAND MARTIN: But I want
to go to Vint, though,

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.950
because I want to do this
intersectionality piece,

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.960
because it's
interesting when you

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.230
talk about this intersection
of different issues.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.530
I think about-- and again,
I brought the 14th Amendment

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.334
again, equal protection clause.

00:39:03.334 --> 00:39:05.750
The Supreme Court, when they
decided same sex marriage was

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:10.820
based upon that, what was
interesting is BYP100 had done

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.340
a shout out where
they said, look, OK,

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.870
y'all get same sex marriage.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.830
That ain't what we
concerned about.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.050
And it was interesting
because I had

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:23.220
black gay folks who
were saying, that

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.100
ain't number one on our list.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.850
And I've had to deal with
African-Americans, same

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.550
you're talking Jose
Antonio Vargas, Asians,

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.330
Latinos, who are gay, who are in
this movement saying, hold it.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:39.720
How we all gay, but then we're
still fighting marginalization

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.770
in the LGBT movement-- in
the equality movement that

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.200
practices inequality?

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.546
So as we begin to
move forward, I

00:39:47.546 --> 00:39:49.670
think we're going to see
even more of those battles

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.044
where all of a
sudden it's not as

00:39:51.044 --> 00:39:56.620
clear as black,
Asian, Latino, women.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.910
Now it's going to
be things crossing.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:03.500
VINT CERF: Look, there are
dozens, if not more, categories

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.315
in which everyone fits.

00:40:05.315 --> 00:40:09.350
And a lot of those categories
will put you into minority.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.050
And so it seems to
me absolutely clear

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.810
that everything that you were
saying with regard to people

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:18.020
of color and your sense of
oppression and unfairness

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.810
will show up in all of those
other instances as well.

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.920
The net result of all
that is that if we've

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.430
got to get Americans to
understand and believe

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.512
that no one is free
until we all are.

00:40:32.512 --> 00:40:33.220
EDDIE HUANG: Yes.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.391
LUVVIE AJAYI: That's actually--

00:40:36.391 --> 00:40:39.252
EDDIE HUANG: The man
invented the internet.

00:40:39.252 --> 00:40:41.472
LUVVIE AJAYI: That's a
mantra the BYP100 says.

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.430
Like, none of us are free
until we're all free.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.780
And understanding what you
said, like our freedom is bound

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.329
to somebody else's
freedom, is what

00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:50.120
will make you get out
of bed in the morning

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.920
when it doesn't have
anything to do with you.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.220
Right?

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.770
But the thing is, like, most
Americans don't get out of bed

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.759
until it has something
to do with them.

00:40:56.759 --> 00:40:59.300
They're not getting out to march
until, oh, he said something

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.050
about white women.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:00.860
Now I have to--

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.930
where were you for
the last two years?

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.571
So it's a matter of
us seeing ourselves

00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:06.320
in other people's
struggles and understand

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.190
that if that person has a
harder time living a free life,

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.610
I will, too, in some way.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.670
It's going to show up
in some way in my life.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.450
And that means their
struggle is my struggle.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.200
That means their fight
has to be my fight.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.830
Until we do that,
nothing's going to happen.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:20.010
VINT CERF: That's right.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.410
ROLAND MARTIN: About five
to eight more minutes

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.980
until our panel is going to go
to questions from the audience,

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.104
and so please let me know--

00:41:25.104 --> 00:41:26.186
VINT CERF: Mr. Moderator?

00:41:26.186 --> 00:41:28.130
ROLAND MARTIN:
Hold on one second.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.456
Doing some housekeeping.

00:41:29.456 --> 00:41:31.670
So let me know when the
questions are up here.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.170
OK?

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:32.815
Go right ahead.

00:41:32.815 --> 00:41:34.190
VINT CERF: So I
was going to make

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.730
one other psychological
observation.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.770
People see behaviors
that they don't like.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.360
And they'll say,
I don't like them,

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.609
you know, for whatever reason.

00:41:44.609 --> 00:41:47.170
But what they don't do is what
you were suggesting earlier,

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.450
which is to dig deeper
to find out what is

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.230
the reason for that behavior?

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:54.790
What are the incentives
that drive that behavior?

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.534
And until we understand
what the incentives are,

00:41:57.534 --> 00:41:59.200
we won't be able to
change the behavior.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.640
Because just complaining
about it doesn't work.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.330
You have to figure out how
to change the incentives.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.530
And that's probably the
most fundamental question

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.200
that we have to wrestle with.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.540
How do we change the
incentives for the behaviors

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.380
that we don't like?

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.130
ROLAND MARTIN: And
when we say incentives,

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.510
that means, look, how many
folks have been to Washington DC

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.471
in a visit or been
by the White House?

00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:19.345
LUVVIE AJAYI: Lately?

00:42:19.345 --> 00:42:20.370
VINT CERF: Well,
I live there, so--

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:20.950
ROLAND MARTIN: In
your whole life.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:21.991
In your whole life.

00:42:21.991 --> 00:42:22.490
Yes.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.946
Thank you.

00:42:22.946 --> 00:42:23.402
VINT CERF: Thank you.

00:42:23.402 --> 00:42:23.860
Right.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:24.360
Yes.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.190
ROLAND MARTIN: Now I'm
gonna ask this question.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.470
There's only one federal
agency that shares

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.530
a lawn with the White House.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:35.260
They can literally play
flag football on the lawn.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.282
Which agency?

00:42:36.282 --> 00:42:37.240
LUVVIE AJAYI: Treasury.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:37.820
VINT CERF: No, it's--

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.370
ROLAND MARTIN: Treasury.

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:38.820
VINT CERF: Treasury.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.280
Oh, that's right.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:39.920
Yeah.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.360
ROLAND MARTIN: To understand
America, power, money.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.580
Money, power.

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.080
That's the only one that shares
a lawn with the White House.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.630
You could literally go 100 steps
out the side of the Treasury

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:53.710
Department, you'll be in the
East Wing of the White House.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.900
So we talk about
incentives, Vint.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.305
I think about Al Newhart, when
he was the CEO of Gannett,

00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:00.670
the founder of USA Today.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.640
He said, here's a guy,
grew up in South Dakota.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.520
Didn't see many black people.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.760
But he said, we're going
to be the leading company

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.880
when it comes to diversity.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.690
And he then said, I'm going
to attach our diversity

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:15.700
goal to your bonuses.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.900
And then he said, if
you don't like it,

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.899
you can leave the company.

00:43:19.899 --> 00:43:21.190
And there were people who left.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.980
And he said, see ya,
because they wouldn't do it.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:27.030
And so when Gannett became
the leader in the industry

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.960
for diversity, it caused
[INAUDIBLE] to go,

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.460
then we better get
our act together.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:31.990
It literally caused
a ripple effect.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.554
The entire media industry
said, we'd better go start

00:43:34.554 --> 00:43:36.220
recruiting some folks,
because Gannett's

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.400
going to get all of the
great minority talent.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.360
That changed the game.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.318
VINT CERF: Interesting.

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:43.600
ROLAND MARTIN: The
president of FX, same thing.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.760
They did a study in
FX network, and he

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.090
said, how is it that
88%, or whatever,

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.660
of our movies, our show
runners, are white males?

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.589
And he sent a single
email out saying

00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:56.755
this should not be the case.

00:43:56.755 --> 00:43:59.680
Six months later, it was
flipped to nearly half

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.419
of their shows were
people of color.

00:44:01.419 --> 00:44:02.710
LUVVIE AJAYI: I mean, look at--

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:03.615
ROLAND MARTIN: But
that was a leader.

00:44:03.615 --> 00:44:04.870
LUVVIE AJAYI: Look what
"Scandal" did for television.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:06.328
ROLAND MARTIN: That
was leadership.

00:44:06.328 --> 00:44:09.190
LUVVIE AJAYI: I mean,
when "Scandal" started,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.340
the last black lead for a
prime time show or drama

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.020
was Diahann Caroll in 1974.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.410
So when "Scandal" became
successful, literally all

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.910
the TV networks was
like, oh, it can

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:21.460
be profitable for a black
woman to lead a show.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.860
Then it actually became a
thing that all the networks

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.370
were doing.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.870
It is the money that's tied to
it and chained to incentives.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.619
So like now, in publishing.

00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:30.910
For a long time, they were
like, oh, black people don't

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:33.430
read books, so we're not
going to really give you guys

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.540
a lot of book deals.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.700
And they started
giving us book deals,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.830
and they realized
we can hit "New York

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.040
Times" best seller list.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.790
Oh, somebody else can
get a book deal now.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.500
It's always tied to the money.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.029
Always.

00:44:44.029 --> 00:44:45.070
ROLAND MARTIN: Questions.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.004
Y'all ready?

00:44:46.004 --> 00:44:47.420
LUVVIE AJAYI: Was
that a mic drop?

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.072
Was that a mic drop?

00:44:50.072 --> 00:44:53.018
ROLAND MARTIN: I said, power
and money, money and power.

00:44:53.018 --> 00:44:53.518
All right.

00:44:53.518 --> 00:44:56.900
Let's role.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.901
Really?

00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:59.276
Really, you don't
have questions?

00:44:59.276 --> 00:44:59.775
All right.

00:44:59.775 --> 00:45:00.600
Who got a question?

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.516
VINT CERF: Here we go.

00:45:01.516 --> 00:45:02.470
We can see it here.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:03.330
ROLAND MARTIN: OK,
we've got a microphone.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.550
Man, come on.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.340
Who got a question?

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:06.840
Really?

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.227
Nobody here has a question?

00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:09.060
VINT CERF: Wait, no.

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:09.774
It's right-- hey.

00:45:09.774 --> 00:45:10.940
ROLAND MARTIN: I've got him.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.150
VINT CERF: We've got
the question here.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.380
ROLAND MARTIN: Here we go.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.040
Microphone works.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.916
Step on up in light.

00:45:13.916 --> 00:45:14.302
Come on.

00:45:14.302 --> 00:45:16.160
It's going to be like the
old Phil Donahue show.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.300
EDDIE HUANG: No, Roland, we
got a-- we got a question--

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.076
ROLAND MARTIN: Let me explain
to you who Phil Donahue is.

00:45:20.076 --> 00:45:20.568
OK.

00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:21.650
You know who Phil Donahue is.

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:22.483
I see the grey hair.

00:45:22.483 --> 00:45:23.010
Yes, indeed.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:23.520
What's your name?

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.394
What's your question?

00:45:24.394 --> 00:45:26.030
AUDIENCE: My name
is Jason, and you

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.600
said that it's hard
to challenge someone,

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600
just call them a racist.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.860
So having these conversations
maybe more around,

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.750
as Eddie suggested, around a
specific reaction somebody had

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:36.820
or a thing they said.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.653
What are some good ideas
for how to do that?

00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:39.690
I've got a big family.

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:41.023
I need to do a lot of education.

00:45:41.023 --> 00:45:41.980
ROLAND MARTIN: Oh.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:46.230
He's trying to survive
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.730
All right.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.862
Who wants to take that?

00:45:47.862 --> 00:45:49.820
LUVVIE AJAYI: I've had
that question sent to me

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.790
a lot of times, because I've
challenged my white readers

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:57.230
to not be silent in the face
of just problematic things

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.270
happening in their--
like, if you're

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:01.400
silent as it's happening,
you're giving it air.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.220
So my suggestion is to
just really point it out.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.410
So you're at dinner,
and let's say

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:08.780
your uncle makes
that racist joke.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.150
You should be like, hey,
yeah, that's not OK.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.760
Simply even saying, that's
not OK is better than you

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.280
just being like,
oh, here he goes.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.940
Because you let him know
that when you're in the room,

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.710
he has less space for that.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:24.290
He will do it less in your
presence at the minimum,

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:25.000
if nothing else.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:25.305
Start there.

00:46:25.305 --> 00:46:26.138
ROLAND MARTIN: True.

00:46:26.138 --> 00:46:26.641
Eddie?

00:46:26.641 --> 00:46:28.640
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, you
know, when I was younger,

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.480
I used to turn in these essays.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.070
They were like fiery,
angry, analytical essays.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.920
And my teacher-- I had a
professor, Doctor Jones,

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.680
ask me-- she said, why is it
that you use this language?

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.430
Why is it that you just beat
the reader over the head

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:44.180
over and over?

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.770
And I said, because I'm right.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.840
And she said, OK, fair.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.880
I agree with you.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.287
ROLAND MARTIN: Damn.

00:46:49.287 --> 00:46:49.694
You too, huh?

00:46:49.694 --> 00:46:50.101
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.

00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:52.142
And she said, I agree with
you that you're right.

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:55.180
You have proven it over the
course of these paragraphs.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:59.990
But the purpose of writing is
to communicate and to persuade.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:04.310
And she says, you should be
a more results-based writer.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:06.680
And at first, I was upset.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.070
I didn't accept it.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.100
But over time, I
realized, just being

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.580
right does not give you license
to attack people with language.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.090
Also being right, you
don't get a medal for that.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:18.290
You need the results.

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.420
You need people to
open their eyes.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.130
The purpose is to
convey your feelings

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.630
and for them to understand you.

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:26.330
And I've noticed, at least
in my own personal life,

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:30.240
the more patient and
generous and humble

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.720
I am in front of someone
that may have said something

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.330
that I consider racist,
I get more when I give.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.400
And it's such a
hard thing to do.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.400
It's really hard.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.370
LUVVIE AJAYI: That
is labor intensive.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.870
ROLAND MARTIN: But
it's also based--

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.600
it's also based upon
really the situation.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.744
Here is the way you are.

00:47:46.744 --> 00:47:48.410
EDDIE HUANG: I mean,
I interviewed a guy

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.324
from the alt right, like, in a
DC episode of "Huang's World."

00:47:51.324 --> 00:47:52.740
ROLAND MARTIN:
White nationalists.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.600
That's what I call them.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.530
I don't call it the alt right.

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.900
EDDIE HUANG: He was the
director founder of AmRen.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.215
And you know, from the
beginning, I could have got hot

00:48:00.215 --> 00:48:01.150
and argued with him.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.566
I probably should have
choked him, you know?

00:48:03.566 --> 00:48:07.665
But I just kept, at
least in my mind, giving.

00:48:07.665 --> 00:48:08.540
ROLAND MARTIN: Right.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.320
EDDIE HUANG: And giving.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.278
And then you know what?

00:48:10.278 --> 00:48:11.970
That fool walked
himself into a hole.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.220
ROLAND MARTIN: Oh, every time.

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:13.970
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:15.730
ROLAND MARTIN: So
they're not smart.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:16.734
No, they're not.

00:48:16.734 --> 00:48:18.150
EDDIE HUANG: They're
also hateful.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.990
ROLAND MARTIN: I
had Richard Spencer

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.350
for 32 minutes on my show.

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.280
It was supposed to
be eight minutes.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.370
LUVVIE AJAYI: You didn't
punch him in the face,

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:22.780
like everybody else?

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.113
ROLAND MARTIN: I said, I won't
beat his ass for about 10

00:48:25.113 --> 00:48:25.686
more minutes.

00:48:25.686 --> 00:48:27.980
Then another 10 minutes.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.660
And again, he looked
crazy at the end.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.240
But I do believe
the moment matters.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.240
Like, I don't like it
when I'm in a first class,

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.820
like I've got
Texas A&amp;M stuff on.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.100
They say, you play football?

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.416
Hell no.

00:48:37.416 --> 00:48:38.430
Did you?

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:39.030
No.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:40.780
Because really, I
want you to ask first,

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.227
is that your-- is that
where you went to school?

00:48:43.227 --> 00:48:45.060
Don't assume I played
ball or I coach there.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.130
And so depending on how I
feel, I might be nice about it,

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.445
and say, no.

00:48:49.445 --> 00:48:51.110
Or I might be very dismissive.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:52.020
Hell, no.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.385
All depends on the mood I'm in.

00:48:53.385 --> 00:48:54.260
What's your question?

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.160
AUDIENCE: So I was--

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.493
ROLAND MARTIN: I've got the mic.

00:48:56.493 --> 00:48:57.740
We're good.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.850
Put your hands in your pocket.

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:04.160
AUDIENCE: I'm Christina,
and I recently-- well,

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.810
first of all, thanks
for being here

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.726
and thanks for this
discussion and everything.

00:49:07.726 --> 00:49:11.480
I'm really glad that I work at
a company where this is valued.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.720
I recently read a book
called "Homegoing,"

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.810
and it's one of the best
books I've read ever,

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.730
so if you haven't
read it, you should.

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.970
And it talks about, for
anybody who hasn't read it,

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:26.660
the story of two
different family--

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.180
one family, two sisters.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.840
One follows, like, her lineage
for the last 400 years,

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.190
going from the
Gold Coast in Ghana

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.420
to the United States
and everything.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.242
You know, basically
living in slavery

00:49:40.242 --> 00:49:42.200
and then after slavery,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.460
And it was just a
heartbreaking book to read.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.030
And while reading
it, it was just,

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:53.540
like, there's black people
just don't even have a--

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.730
you know, they didn't
have a chance ever.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.930
You know, like, with
that kind of history,

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.620
they're so far behind.

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.980
There was so much
institutional baggage.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.800
It just felt very heartbreaking.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.300
Fast forward to-- well, not
fast forward, but the same time,

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.160
I lived in Clinton
Hill, Brooklyn.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.650
You know, 90% voted
against Trump,

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:19.560
and very democratic, very
open liberal community.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.590
And yet you look at your
schools in my neighborhood,

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:25.782
and they are, frankly, they're
sort of segregated, you know?

00:50:25.782 --> 00:50:27.240
PAOLA MENDOZA: They
are segregated.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.310
New York City has the
most segregated schools

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:31.415
in the country, and more so
than the Civil Rights Movement

00:50:31.415 --> 00:50:31.550
during the '60s.

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.675
AUDIENCE: And the rates of
incarceration, you know.

00:50:33.675 --> 00:50:35.147
So you have this
sort of dissonance

00:50:35.147 --> 00:50:37.230
that I'm so uncomfortable
with, and I don't really

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:38.400
know what to do with it.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.379
But I just thought--

00:50:40.379 --> 00:50:41.670
I don't really have a question.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:42.090
I'm just like--

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:42.420
ROLAND MARTIN: Oh, no.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.170
We got it.

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.466
We got it.

00:50:45.466 --> 00:50:49.297
AUDIENCE: --and schools, and
where are we and is there hope?

00:50:49.297 --> 00:50:50.880
VINT CERF: Pointing
out the dissonance

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.740
is exactly the
right thing to do.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.750
I think it's an extremely
helpful thing to do.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.420
And now we all have homework
to go read that book.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:02.700
ROLAND MARTIN: But it's also
not accepting the silly notion

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.940
that it's a Democratic
or Republican thing.

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:07.770
And that's the problem.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.080
So when-- what's
the fool on CNN?

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.080
LUVVIE AJAYI: Which one?

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:11.996
ROLAND MARTIN: I know.

00:51:11.996 --> 00:51:13.590
There's a lot of them.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:14.770
Jeffrey Lord.

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:16.590
So when Jeffrey Lord's
running his mouth,

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.580
and he's talking about, oh,
the Democrats carry the KKK.

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:22.506
And the problem I have is
that too many people on CNN

00:51:22.506 --> 00:51:23.880
have no understanding
of history,

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.760
because it's very easy to
shut Jeffrey Lord down.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.240
You simply say, Jeffrey
Lord, which president

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.781
left the white lily
movement in the 1930s?

00:51:31.781 --> 00:51:33.530
And he will look at
you like you're crazy.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:34.830
He will say Herbert Hoover.

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:36.760
He was a Republican.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.260
See?

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.820
So what happens is
a long it becomes,

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.540
oh, if you're Republican,
you hate minorities,

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.640
and if you're a Democrat,
you love minorities,

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.900
you lose sight of the fact that
our schools come down to money.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.250
Democrats like money.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.484
Republicans like money.

00:51:51.484 --> 00:51:53.400
They like money in their
own school districts.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.410
And so that's, I
think, where we fail.

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:57.360
This is not to
change these systems.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.130
It's not a Democrat
or Republican thing.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.690
It's a human thing.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:03.060
Democrats can be just
as idiotic and stupid

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.390
when it comes to allocation
of resources as Republicans.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:09.420
In many cases, Republicans
have been actually

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.300
more supportive of historically
black colleges and universities

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.790
in the White House
than the Democrats.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.130
So again, don't fault
for the political trap.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.510
The question is where do
you stand on the issue,

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:20.710
regardless of your party?

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:22.950
PAOLA MENDOZA: And
also, I think, just

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.080
to take it a step further
with regards to liberal,

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.580
and I'll be fast since
we have someone else.

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:28.292
There's a school.

00:52:28.292 --> 00:52:30.000
I also live in that
area, in Fort Greene.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.060
A friend of mine, she sent
her child to a charter school

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.400
from all Fort Greene,
Clinton Hill area.

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:40.470
And the parents actually
advocated for the principal

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.720
to take away African-American
History Month.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.470
EDDIE HUANG: What?

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.990
PAOLA MENDOZA:
These are liberals.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.135
EDDIE HUANG: What
school is this?

00:52:45.135 --> 00:52:46.590
PAOLA MENDOZA: It's
somewhere downtown.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:46.980
I don't know where.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.120
It's an elementary school.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:48.930
ROLAND MARTIN: Eddie's
looking for it.

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:50.375
PAOLA MENDOZA: Exactly.

00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:51.250
That was my reaction.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:51.770
ROLAND MARTIN:
Eddie's like, what?

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:52.561
Show me the school.

00:52:52.561 --> 00:52:53.440
He going right now.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.000
PAOLA MENDOZA: It's liberals,
educated, predominantly white

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.150
community, and they talk to
a black principal to say,

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.220
please take away
African-American History Month,

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.730
because that's just
saying to our children

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:06.660
that we're different.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.870
And we're not all different.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:08.700
We're equal.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.270
Right?

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.860
So that is also--

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.564
not understanding the
importance and the purpose

00:53:14.564 --> 00:53:16.230
and the point of
saying, actually, we're

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:17.914
not all the same.

00:53:17.914 --> 00:53:20.080
We are different, and there's
beauty in differences,

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.960
and that is the important thing.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.040
Not to make us all one.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.527
So I think to your point
and to Roland's point,

00:53:26.527 --> 00:53:28.110
it doesn't matter
if you're a Democrat

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:29.760
or Republican or a
liberal, it's really

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.890
how you're analyzing
and seeing the world

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:35.316
and checking inside to say,
I don't understand this,

00:53:35.316 --> 00:53:37.690
and I don't understand this,
like you're saying, and why?

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:38.440
What can I do?

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.540
Who do I talk to?

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.270
Who do I expose myself
to and my children

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.900
to to actually understand why
African-American history is

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.500
important.

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.708
LUVVIE AJAYI: Also, it's
important for white liberals

00:53:48.708 --> 00:53:50.740
not to feel like just
because they're liberal,

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.780
they're doing the work.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:56.810
Like the fact that a whole
neighborhood community that

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.730
considers themselves liberal
can tell a principal take Black

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:02.850
History Month away,
it comes to the idea

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:05.760
that, first of all, people
always think bad guy, good guy,

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.260
right?

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:06.780
I'm liberal.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.111
I'm good.

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:08.610
No.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.360
You're not good.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.550
You're part of this
amazing system that is

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.110
just-- you're embedded in it.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:17.100
And you just being like, I'm
liberal, is not the solution.

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.930
you have to do more
than just be liberal.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:20.490
ROLAND MARTIN: If you read
Dr. King's book, "Chaos

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:20.980
or Community?

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.438
Where do We Go From Here,"
which is his worst selling book,

00:54:23.438 --> 00:54:26.490
written in '67, he
said in the book,

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:29.082
it didn't cost America much
to allow us to go in a hotel,

00:54:29.082 --> 00:54:31.540
it didn't cost America much to
allow us to go in the parks,

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:32.780
didn't cost America
much to allow

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.405
us to eat in the restaurants.

00:54:33.405 --> 00:54:35.240
He said, the real
question now is

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.760
what will America write that
big check to fix the problem.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.010
And he said even our
white allies will not

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:44.790
be with us because they
believe you've gotten enough.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:45.540
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yup.

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.550
ROLAND MARTIN: So there's
point is, that's why--

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:49.091
just like there are
some black people

00:54:49.091 --> 00:54:51.730
I am not riding with,
because they're crazy.

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:53.326
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

00:54:53.326 --> 00:54:54.700
ROLAND MARTIN: So
the issues goes

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.460
to where do you stand
on stuff, as opposed

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.150
to what do you look like and
what's your party affiliation.

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.990
LUVVIE AJAYI: Right.

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.630
ROLAND MARTIN:
What's your question?

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:03.846
Put your hand down.

00:55:03.846 --> 00:55:05.130
I got you.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.290
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Samera,
an Iranian-American woman.

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:11.950
So I think it's a follow
up to your question, is,

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:12.940
what is that next?

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:17.020
I think it's a cultural thing,
being born and raised here,

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.050
and being a terrorist growing
up until the current day,

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.870
and the immigration
law and all that.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:24.910
I think it was always
like, don't say anything,

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:25.660
from your parents.

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.700
It's something culturally
ingrained, like don't push,

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.580
don't push the boundaries.

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.290
Don't get yourself in trouble.

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.050
Now being a mother
of two kids, I'm

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:35.675
like, no, we need to
push the boundary.

00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:37.260
I just don't know what that is.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.330
Because I've always
been told to step back.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.330
ROLAND MARTIN: Good one.

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:42.041
Who wants it?

00:55:42.041 --> 00:55:43.582
LUVVIE AJAYI: You've
always been told

00:55:43.582 --> 00:55:46.150
to step back because you
were not in the best position

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:47.034
to push forward.

00:55:47.034 --> 00:55:49.450
So the people who are in the
good position to push forward

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:51.241
should be the ones
pushing forward for you.

00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:53.920
Because you, right
now, pushing forward

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.080
is a threat to you
and your livelihood.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.320
Meanwhile, white men are sitting
up here not doing anything.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.420
They should be pushing
forward for you.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.350
So I mean, your
existence is resistance,

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.350
basically at this point.

00:56:07.319 --> 00:56:08.860
EDDIE HUANG: I
understand what you're

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.420
saying, that people
in power should

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.716
be doing their jobs
as our representatives

00:56:12.716 --> 00:56:13.840
and pushing things forward.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.150
But at least, in
my experience, I've

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:19.270
noticed that no one's going
to do anything for you

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:21.263
but yourself, you know.

00:56:21.263 --> 00:56:24.505
And I come from my a community,
Taiwanese, Chinese-Americans,

00:56:24.505 --> 00:56:28.180
we're also told just be
quiet, look at your feet

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.760
when you're walking down the
street, don't cause no trouble.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.037
I mean, every single
movie has an Asian person

00:56:33.037 --> 00:56:34.870
with the same line, I
don't want no trouble.

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:35.745
You know what I mean?

00:56:35.745 --> 00:56:38.733
That's been our
community's standard line

00:56:38.733 --> 00:56:39.970
for, like, 30 years.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.730
I don't want no trouble.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:43.660
Or you break you buy.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.905
We got a few lines,
that's really it.

00:56:45.905 --> 00:56:47.339
But you know--

00:56:47.339 --> 00:56:48.880
VINT CERF: What
about that other one.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.011
Go ahead, make my day.

00:56:50.011 --> 00:56:51.760
EDDIE HUANG: I feel
sorry for your mother.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.150
But no, like, those
are our three lines,

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.580
very known for delivering
those, in all manner

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.143
of cultural product.

00:56:59.143 --> 00:57:00.851
ROLAND MARTIN: Hey,
we used to get killed

00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:01.154
before the credits finished.

00:57:01.154 --> 00:57:02.336
I understand that.

00:57:02.336 --> 00:57:03.710
I mean, the credits
weren't done.

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:05.616
Damn, the brother's
already dead.

00:57:05.616 --> 00:57:06.402
OK.

00:57:06.402 --> 00:57:08.485
EDDIE HUANG: We're like,
we don't want no trouble.

00:57:10.862 --> 00:57:13.070
LUVVIE AJAYI: But you made
it through a movie though.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:15.650
EDDIE HUANG: We made
it through the movie.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:17.406
ROLAND MARTIN: At
least y'all made it.

00:57:17.406 --> 00:57:18.780
VINT CERF: I
actually wanted want

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:22.570
to counter your observation
that no one will do anything

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:23.950
unless you do it for yourself.

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:24.550
EDDIE HUANG: OK, sure.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:25.480
VINT CERF: That's not true.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.220
EDDIE HUANG: OK.

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.386
I'm gonna finish this point.

00:57:27.386 --> 00:57:28.420
VINT CERF: All right.

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.320
EDDIE HUANG: You
invented the internet,

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.070
so you can shut me
down whenever you want.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.919
I would just say,
though, that I actually--

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:38.168
VINT CERF: If you want your
email to continue working.

00:57:42.686 --> 00:57:44.060
EDDIE HUANG: So
I was just saying

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:48.569
that I didn't see anyone else
in my community speaking up,

00:57:48.569 --> 00:57:50.360
and I was like, I'm
going to try to do this

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.149
at least for myself, for my
family, and for my brothers,

00:57:53.149 --> 00:57:54.440
and it goes on, and on, and on.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.460
And it's incredible the power
that one person has if you just

00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:59.420
set your mind to it.

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:02.120
I feel like you should
engage in and do something.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.120
ROLAND MARTIN: Question.

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.495
"There have been
reports today--"

00:58:04.495 --> 00:58:06.810
VINT CERF: Wait a
minute, Mr. Moderator--

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:06.942
ROLAND MARTIN: I know.

00:58:06.942 --> 00:58:07.650
I've got five minutes.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.980
I got to get to this question
before they cuss me out,

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:10.280
these tweets.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.863
"There have been
reports today, Google

00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:14.390
thinks is too expensive
and labor intensive

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:18.650
to investigate the DOJ
claims that we systematically

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:20.150
underpay women.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.920
If this is true,
how can we advocate

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.810
that, at least
within the company,

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:26.297
to ensure that we do pay our
women and minorities equally?"

00:58:26.297 --> 00:58:27.380
VINT CERF: Point of order.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:27.800
EDDIE HUANG: I don't
think that's too

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.850
expensive for Google.

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:29.210
ROLAND MARTIN: Oh,
that's for Vint.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:30.450
That was for Vint.

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:31.533
VINT CERF: Point of order.

00:58:31.533 --> 00:58:32.420
It's not the DOJ.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.010
It's the Department
of Labor that

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.320
is asking for the statistics.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.530
And apparently, we have
given them an enormous amount

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:41.570
of statistical information.

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:44.840
We even have data that shows
that when we hire women,

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:48.252
they get higher pay raises
than the men do in order

00:58:48.252 --> 00:58:49.710
to adjust for the
fact that they've

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:51.650
been historically underpaid.

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:53.510
So there's a lot of
evidence that Google

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:57.350
has done a great deal to
even out these things.

00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:01.025
It's built in now to our
algorithms for raises

00:59:01.025 --> 00:59:01.900
and things like that.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.605
It's now algorithmically built.

00:59:03.605 --> 00:59:05.980
EDDIE HUANG: You've got a
snitch in your company, though.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.689
[LAUGHING]

00:59:07.689 --> 00:59:08.980
ROLAND MARTIN: Paola, go ahead.

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.031
[INAUDIBLE] out here snitching.

00:59:11.031 --> 00:59:13.405
PAOLA MENDOZA: I think-- this
is what I like to advocate,

00:59:13.405 --> 00:59:16.430
and this is what I do
on my own personal life.

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:18.939
I think we just need to
share how much we make.

00:59:18.939 --> 00:59:19.730
LUVVIE AJAYI: Word.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:20.522
PAOLA MENDOZA: Women,
you just need to go up,

00:59:20.522 --> 00:59:21.950
and you need to
ask your coworker,

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:23.530
hey, how much do you make?

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:25.010
This is what I make.

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:26.570
I'm just saying.

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.000
I'm just saying.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.350
We as women and as
people of color,

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:35.450
need to share
information because when

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:38.150
we have information, we
can then empower ourselves

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.660
from a place of knowledge.

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.060
And it's as simple as that.

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.320
Break down that barrier
and ask the question.

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.650
And men, be up front
with your coworker.

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.050
And you can go up to her,
him, too, and say, hey,

00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:49.410
I make this amount of money.

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:49.750
How much do you make?

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:52.250
EDDIE HUANG: I would pull up
to the club with my tax return,

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.410
if that was socially acceptable.

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.412
You feel me?

00:59:56.412 --> 00:59:57.620
ROLAND MARTIN: Next question.

00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.230
"I recently had a
conversation with a friend who

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.770
insisted racism, sexism is no
longer a problem in America,

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:08.220
that America is the least
racist country in the world."

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.750
Parentheses, "It was a baffling
and frustrating conversation,

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.475
no doubt.

01:00:13.475 --> 01:00:15.410
Does the panel have
suggestions for how

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.600
to get people to rethink
this misconception?"

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.900
One person, who
wants to take it?

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.900
LUVVIE AJAYI: I'd probably
stop being friends with them,

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.233
because I'm like you just so
out of-- just out of touch.

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:24.580
Just, I can't.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.000
I mean, where do you go?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.154
So when you're having a
discussion with somebody,

01:00:28.154 --> 01:00:29.820
the point is to have
this middle ground.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.920
But when you're over here,
and the person's over here,

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.970
how do you come to
the middle with that?

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.969
VINT CERF: That's what
you've been trying to do.

01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:37.820
And both of you have said
that you're trying to find--

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:41.600
the trick was to get away
from the racist discussion

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.610
and get to something
more specific.

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.340
Because, in fact,
whatever it was

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.590
might not actually have
been a racist issue at all,

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:49.610
it might have been
something else.

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:50.880
But finding something concrete.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.910
LUVVIE AJAYI: But this person
said it's no longer a problem.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:54.200
This person said racism
and sexism is no longer

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.860
a problem in America,
and that America

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.669
is the least racist country.

01:00:57.669 --> 01:00:58.960
How do you talk to that person?

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.293
EDDIE HUANG: When someone is
like that out to lunch, out

01:01:01.293 --> 01:01:04.190
to sea, I'm just like, please
tell me how you got here.

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:05.240
Just tell me more.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.760
Like we said, I just
want to hear more.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.900
VINT CERF: Just ask--

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.608
ROLAND MARTIN: I think
in that situation,

01:01:10.608 --> 01:01:13.090
no matter how stupid
or crazy they are,

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:15.668
you still force them to
say, OK, well, let's talk

01:01:15.668 --> 01:01:17.501
about the study that
showed that if you have

01:01:17.501 --> 01:01:21.230
a black sounding name, you have
50% less likelihood of getting

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:23.830
a return phone call for a
job than if you were white,

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.619
when it is the
exact same resume.

01:01:25.619 --> 01:01:27.160
LUVVIE AJAYI: They
will find excuses.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.340
ROLAND MARTIN: No, but
here's the deal though.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.290
In my experience, in
hitting people every day

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:34.750
with questions, you begin to hit
folks with specific questions

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.680
and data, it's hard to ignore.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.330
The problem, I
think, in that case,

01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:40.665
is when you have
general conversation.

01:01:40.665 --> 01:01:42.040
When you hit them
with specifics,

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.831
it's a little harder
for them to wiggle out

01:01:43.831 --> 01:01:46.760
because they have to justify how
that forms with their opinion.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.260
Question.

01:01:49.814 --> 01:01:51.230
AUDIENCE: On the
panel there, they

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:54.670
talked about how there's like
two ends of the spectrum,

01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:55.420
right?

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.920
You have one person that
could be called a racist,

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.750
and then another
person who disagrees.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:03.840
And then the meat of
the issue gets lost.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.080
When I think about a
lot of these things,

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.930
there's a lot of facts
that are hitting history.

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:11.450
And as you stood on the stage,
and you were reading out

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:13.490
lots of facts, I
was just like, wow,

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:15.154
because not a lot
of people know that.

01:02:15.154 --> 01:02:16.820
ROLAND MARTIN: Because
they didn't read.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.200
AUDIENCE: They
didn't read, and I

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.824
didn't grow up in this country.

01:02:19.824 --> 01:02:20.740
LUVVIE AJAYI: Nigeria?

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.981
AUDIENCE: Like Luvvie--

01:02:21.981 --> 01:02:24.022
LUVVIE AJAYI: I knew you
were a Nigeria man, yes.

01:02:24.022 --> 01:02:25.920
VINT CERF: You recognized that.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.170
LUVVIE AJAYI: I saw my people.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.100
AUDIENCE: I came to the USA.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.090
I took an African-American
culture class,

01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:37.560
and I was just amazed at a lot
of things that are in history,

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.430
but again, are lost
to a lot of people.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:41.940
ROLAND MARTIN: There's
history, and there's his-story.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.190
Two different meanings.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:44.540
True.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:47.040
And I know the writer
Ta-Nesisi Coates,

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.780
and he wrote that
magnificent essay.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.270
And again, so much facts in
there that not a lot of people

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.770
know.

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.800
So how do you get those
facts out there to people?

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.050
Because at the end of the
day, we're all human beings.

01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:57.970
And that's what
we're trying to do.

01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:59.990
Because you can't
force people to love.

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:02.150
VINT CERF: I have an
unfortunate observation

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:04.120
to make about the
American culture.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:04.270
ROLAND MARTIN: Thank you.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:04.380
Go, go.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.171
We got two minutes.

01:03:05.171 --> 01:03:10.040
VINT CERF: The American
culture tends to have amnesia.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.730
If you visit in Europe, there
will be casual conversation

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:19.340
in which the years 1400
and 1066 and 1622 and 1648

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.160
are regularly mentioned
as if they were yesterday.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.320
In America, you can't remember
what happened two weeks ago.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.930
And so we have cultural, really
serious cultural problems

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.705
remembering facts and history.

01:03:30.705 --> 01:03:32.080
And I don't know
how to fix that.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.840
ROLAND MARTIN: Well,
part of the problem

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.090
is that we have not actually
had real American history

01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:36.650
in our schools.

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:40.254
That's why I say history
and his-story, that's real.

01:03:40.254 --> 01:03:41.670
And so there's so
many things that

01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:43.450
are actually being left out.

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:48.590
And so for me, I use my
media platforms to do it,

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:53.530
every single day, in terms
of I got #rolandbookclub.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.356
So people ask me, dude, how
you know all this other stuff?

01:03:56.356 --> 01:03:57.980
These are all the
books that I've read.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.850
Then they're like, OK,
man, I understand now.

01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:07.424
And so, we also have to
make history accessible

01:04:07.424 --> 01:04:09.340
and explain it in a way--
you got to remember,

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.760
newspapers, historically,
have taught us

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.580
write on a fifth grade level.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.800
It may sound crazy.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.749
But you write on a
fifth grade level.

01:04:18.749 --> 01:04:21.040
And so to understand, and
literally, I was on the radio

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.650
today, and they were trying
to talk about economics,

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:26.180
and I said, OK, let me
just walk you through.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.830
1619 to 1863, 244
years of slavery.

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:32.310
Two years of the war,
then you had, of course,

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:36.760
end of the war, 1865 to 1877,
12 years of Reconstruction.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.840
Great Compromises of
1877 starts Jim Crow.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.580
That goes through almost 1970.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.260
If you use the death of
King, April 4th, '68,

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.250
then let's say
another two years,

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:51.490
so if you say 1970
is the marker where

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:55.510
black folks were technically
fully free Americans, that's

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:57.680
only 47.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.320
Only 47 years.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.320
When people hear that,
they go, whoa, hold on.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.271
That's it?

01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:05.770
Then you say yes, the first
wave of black and blue corporate

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:08.059
America happened
in the early '70s.

01:05:08.059 --> 01:05:09.850
The first African-Americans
on Wall Street,

01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:12.240
in terms of Morgan
Stanley, those companies.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.010
Then the first African-Americans
in major Ivy League

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:15.910
institutions.

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.670
Now all of the sudden--

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:20.230
then I say, I'll
be 49 in November.

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.980
LUVVIE AJAYI: Wow.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.130
ROLAND MARTIN: Which means
I was born into an America

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.090
where I was not fully free.

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:28.570
Which means-- I
don't have any kids--

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.380
my nieces and nephews
are the first generation

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:38.770
of African-Americans born
technically fully free.

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:42.010
Now people go, damn.

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:46.570
Because they think
slavery, 1863, and totally

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.910
ignore the fact
that we literally

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:51.640
were frozen out of
economic systems

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.790
through the 1960s to 1970.

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:57.170
But again, it's getting people
to break it down that way.

01:05:57.170 --> 01:06:01.450
Then they go, whoa,
as opposed to just,

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:03.400
oh, slavery ended at this time.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.810
Because people really,
they just don't know.

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:11.020
Even a whole lot of black
people have no idea, no clue.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.610
EDDIE HUANG: You
mentioned Dr. King.

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:14.670
You asked the question about--

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.680
you asked the question about
we have all these facts,

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.280
yet it seems like people don't
want to listen or give credence

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.000
to these facts.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.860
And I think Dr. King's works,
it really tells you the most

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.062
and gives you the blueprint.

01:06:28.062 --> 01:06:29.770
"Letter from Birmingham
Jail" is probably

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:31.990
the most analytical essay
that Dr. King wrote.

01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:34.210
It breaks things down
systematically with facts,

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:37.030
and it's written
to intellectuals.

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:38.200
But his most powerful--

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:38.840
ROLAND MARTIN:
Actually, it was written

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.660
to white pastors in Birmingham.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.600
EDDIE HUANG: Yes,
intellectuals, yes.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.100
So his most powerful
speech, though,

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.690
and the most persuasive speech,
undeniably, is I Have a Dream.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:52.780
And that is a persuasive speech.

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.570
And I think that all of
us have to acknowledge,

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:57.700
it's not just enough
to be right if we

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.010
want the result that we desire.

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:01.470
We have to be persuasive.

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:05.350
ROLAND MARTIN: But don't
just read the bottom one

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.600
third of the speech.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.100
First all, it was never even
called "I Have a Dream" speech.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.660
It was called
"Normalcy No More."

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.470
EDDIE HUANG: I understand this.

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:12.190
But you're talking to me
like I don't know the facts--

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.250
ROLAND MARTIN: No, no, no.

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:14.960
I'm saying it to other
folks in the room.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.465
Here's why.

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:16.840
LUVVIE AJAYI: Come
on, knowledge.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.670
ROLAND MARTIN:
Because every year,

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:22.990
we replay the King's speech, and
we replay the "I Have a Dream"

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:24.010
part.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:26.680
We don't talk about
the top two thirds,

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.440
where he talked about police
brutality, economic inequality,

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.900
bank of injustice, because
"I Have a Dream" part

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:32.890
is all nice and feely.

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:34.420
EDDIE HUANG: What does
that tell you, Roland?

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.175
LUVVIE AJAYI: It makes him
the patron saint of good times

01:07:36.175 --> 01:07:37.130
and nonviolence.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.440
ROLAND MARTIN: Right.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.140
LUVVIE AJAYI: That's
what that makes him.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.770
ROLAND MARTIN: We turned
King into a bobblehead--

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:40.570
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:43.050
ROLAND MARTIN: As opposed
to a radical revolutionary

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:43.890
that he was.

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:44.210
LUVVIE AJAYI: Exactly.

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:45.960
ROLAND MARTIN: So the
challenge to anybody

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.030
in the room is, don't leave here
just reading the bottom part,

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.280
start from the
beginning, and then go,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.675
whoa, dude was slaying
folks, and not holding hands.

01:07:53.675 --> 01:07:56.050
EDDIE HUANG: Of course, but
do you think that he would be

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:57.285
as productive and persuasive--

01:07:57.285 --> 01:07:58.618
LUVVIE AJAYI: And assassinated--

01:07:58.618 --> 01:08:01.540
EDDIE HUANG: --and
create all the progress

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.360
that he did if he
was not smart enough

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.949
to be persuasive as well?

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:07.490
ROLAND MARTIN: No,
he was persuasive.

01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:08.320
EDDIE HUANG: He was a genius.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.790
ROLAND MARTIN: He was a
radical revolutionary.

01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:10.930
EDDIE HUANG: He did it all.

01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.350
He was a five tool player,
like persuasive and analytical.

01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:16.600
And you can't just keep
telling people read the facts,

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.474
read this, read this.

01:08:17.474 --> 01:08:19.420
They're not-- a lot of
people aren't going to.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.503
You have to persuade them.

01:08:20.503 --> 01:08:21.939
They need sugar
with the medicine.

01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:23.319
ROLAND MARTIN: But what
we've done, though, is--

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:24.943
this is why I disagree
with you, Eddie.

01:08:24.943 --> 01:08:27.250
What we've done is,
we've only given America

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:30.460
the I Have a Dream part, because
that's the hand-holding part.

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.210
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:33.069
ROLAND MARTIN: See,
the top, that's

01:08:33.069 --> 01:08:35.439
the equivalent of
listening to a sermon,

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.510
and you cheering, but you
skipped the scripture.

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:39.640
EDDIE HUANG: I'm not telling
you to skip the rest,

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.099
I'm telling you to
Trojan horse people.

01:08:42.099 --> 01:08:44.390
ROLAND MARTIN: But I want
them to read the whole thing.

01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.010
EDDIE HUANG: You
ever gone fishing

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:46.260
without something on the hook?

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.326
ROLAND MARTIN: I hate fishing.

01:08:48.326 --> 01:08:50.220
Damn it, I'm going
to the supermarket

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.740
to buy some catfish.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.710
Blend, what's up?

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:56.260
AUDIENCE: My name is Tsvi,
and I was curious what the--

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.729
ROLAND MARTIN: Spell that.

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:58.969
AUDIENCE: T-S-V-I.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:00.760
ROLAND MARTIN: I would
have never got that.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.801
EDDIE HUANG: I've seen
your graffiti around town.

01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:05.649
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah,
that's my tag.

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:10.540
So my question is about protests
on college campuses being

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.640
shut down.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.850
Sorry, speakers being shut
down because of protests.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:19.660
Not just like people asking
good questions at the end,

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.943
or making a little
noise at the beginning,

01:09:21.943 --> 01:09:23.359
but then letting
the person speak.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.650
I'm talking about fully
shutting down speakers

01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:27.340
like at Middlebury or Berkeley.

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.580
And I was just curious
what, you know--

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.180
I understand it's a very
nuanced, complicated issue.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.569
But I was curious--

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.401
VINT CERF: It's not
complicated at all.

01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:37.359
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot.

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:39.109
VINT CERF: This is not
complicated at all.

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:41.410
This is an incredible
erosion of what

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:44.620
should be a serious freedom
of speech on the campuses.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.890
I think it's outrageous
that students do that,

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.040
because the whole key
here, and the thing

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.870
we've been talking
about all this session

01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:56.890
is about the conversations that
we have to have on tough topics

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.080
where there's real
serious disagreement.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.840
And hearing the other side is
an important part of all that.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.480
So I think it's outrageous
that the campuses have

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.190
been forced to do this.

01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.450
ROLAND MARTIN: Stupid and
asinine, that's what it is.

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:09.564
No, it is.

01:10:09.564 --> 01:10:11.730
Because what happens when
someone wants to shut down

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:12.760
a speaker you like?

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.090
PAOLA MENDOZA: Which
is happening right now

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.881
with Linda Sarsour.

01:10:14.881 --> 01:10:17.440
So Linda Sarsour is the
commencement speaker at CUNY,

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.230
and the right wing has
taken it up to try and shut

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:21.940
her down because
she's a Muslim woman,

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.470
and they claim a lot of things.

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:25.440
And I know Linda
personally very well,

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.710
that are completely not true.

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:28.530
So there are protests.

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:30.520
There's an online
campaign against her.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.530
And that is someone
that we want speaking.

01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:35.150
And that is someone that I
believe in what she's saying.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:39.170
So I agree that it's not
a difficult question.

01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:40.670
Speakers should be
allowed to speak.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.220
ROLAND MARTIN: Final comment.

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:44.810
The one thing you want
people leaving here with,

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:45.970
moving forward.

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:49.327
30 seconds, go.

01:10:49.327 --> 01:10:51.160
LUVVIE AJAYI: Just
challenge your own ideas,

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.365
and also read beyond the
"I Have a Dream" speech.

01:10:53.365 --> 01:10:55.240
I'm really glad you
actually brought that up.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.840
Because MLK Day comes
and everyone share's

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.820
the exact same quotes, of
him being this pacifist,

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.040
like yeah, we just
all need to unite.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.030
No, like, before he
even got to that dude,

01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:08.780
and even as his
politics went further,

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.090
he got even more radical.

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:12.070
So for all the
historical figures,

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:14.740
you hear about Rosa Parks
sitting on the bus, read deeper

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:17.940
about these same bobbleheads
that you keep seeing

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.897
in social media as buttons.

01:11:19.897 --> 01:11:21.730
And realize what they
were saying back then,

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:22.690
because I feel like
there's something

01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:23.815
we need to learn from them.

01:11:23.815 --> 01:11:25.180
There's a lot of things.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.596
PAOLA MENDOZA: I
want to challenge

01:11:26.596 --> 01:11:28.900
everyone here and listening
to have a conversation that

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:33.190
makes your heart pound, that
makes your palms sweaty.

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:36.996
And do that and be OK in that
feeling of uncomfortability

01:11:36.996 --> 01:11:39.370
and knowing that when you get
to the other side, whatever

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.770
that conversation is about,
that you're going to be OK.

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:44.311
And during that conversation--
and this is the most important

01:11:44.311 --> 01:11:44.860
thing--

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.050
is that you have to
listen to understand, not

01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:48.810
listen to be right.

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:49.810
And so, do that.

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:50.770
Do that this week.

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:52.000
Go have that conversation.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:52.875
ROLAND MARTIN: Eddie?

01:11:55.637 --> 01:11:57.220
EDDIE HUANG: Despite
all the stupidity

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.430
I see on an everyday basis,
I'm bullish on humanity,

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:02.770
and I do think that it's
going to get better.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:03.840
ROLAND MARTIN: Vint?

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.381
VINT CERF: For the
Google people that

01:12:05.381 --> 01:12:07.230
are here, take the
unconscious bias

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:08.840
test if you haven't already.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:12.640
You will be just shocked to
discover that you have them.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.916
You just don't know that yet.

01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:16.290
ROLAND MARTIN: I created this
hashtag just playing around

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:19.700
called #teamwhipdatass.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.450
LUVVIE AJAYI: Why?

01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:21.450
Why is Roland like this?

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:23.350
ROLAND MARTIN: Well,
I did, team, whip--

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:29.740
W-H-I-P, dat-- D-A-T, A-S-S.
Y'all think I'm lying,

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.330
look it up.

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:35.910
Every day I wake up
ready to do battle.

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.890
Every day I have
breath, I believe

01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:43.210
that I could flip
somebody on a given issue.

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:44.750
I don't why from a fight.

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.600
I don't back down from a battle.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.010
I'll debate you.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:50.370
It might be rough,
it might be soft.

01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:51.370
It might easy.

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:52.710
It might be hand-holding.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:55.129
Or I might have
to whoop your ass.

01:12:55.129 --> 01:12:56.920
But that really is the
attitude that I have

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:02.170
because if people of conscience
take a day off and run

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:06.430
from the fight, then
ignorance always wins.

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:08.983
And the last thing
is, I'm never going

01:13:08.983 --> 01:13:11.980
to let somebody else know
more information than I do,

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.650
so I'm going to read as much
as I can, so when they lie,

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:16.674
I can bust them
every single time.

01:13:16.674 --> 01:13:17.590
Thanks a bunch, y'all.

01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:19.390
Give it up for our panel.

01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:20.590
EDDIE HUANG: Thanks, Roland.

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:25.440
[APPLAUSE]
