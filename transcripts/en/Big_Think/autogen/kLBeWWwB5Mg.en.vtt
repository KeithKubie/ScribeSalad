so one of the great things about
 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.129
so one of the great things about
civilization is that there's a whole

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
civilization is that there's a whole
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.960
civilization is that there's a whole
bunch of different people all the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
bunch of different people all the
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.609
bunch of different people all the
different people have different about

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
different people have different about
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.269
different people have different about
different things and somehow if they all

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
different things and somehow if they all
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.600
different things and somehow if they all
follow their own curiosity in some way

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610
follow their own curiosity in some way
 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.190
follow their own curiosity in some way
great stuff happens that's sort of

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200
great stuff happens that's sort of
 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.580
great stuff happens that's sort of
what's happened so far I mean if you're

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
what's happened so far I mean if you're
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.130
what's happened so far I mean if you're
in a civilization where you're able to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
in a civilization where you're able to
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.319
in a civilization where you're able to
support people doing that then the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
support people doing that then the
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.869
support people doing that then the
civilization feels you feel happier to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
civilization feels you feel happier to
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549
civilization feels you feel happier to
be in it i mean when i read about

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
be in it i mean when i read about
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.250
be in it i mean when i read about
something at whether it's art or biology

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
something at whether it's art or biology
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.160
something at whether it's art or biology
or sociology if i read about something

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
or sociology if i read about something
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930
or sociology if i read about something
interesting and I realize that some

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
interesting and I realize that some
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.149
interesting and I realize that some
humans actually spent their whole life

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159
humans actually spent their whole life
 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.309
humans actually spent their whole life
doing Beth and it's and that we

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:55.319
doing Beth and it's and that we
 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.040
doing Beth and it's and that we
supported them doing it I I feel like

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
supported them doing it I I feel like
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.169
supported them doing it I I feel like
that's the the the pinnacle of

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179
that's the the the pinnacle of
 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.100
that's the the the pinnacle of
civilization that's the best so I think

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110
civilization that's the best so I think
 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.880
civilization that's the best so I think
you know one of the reasons we fund

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
you know one of the reasons we fund
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.130
you know one of the reasons we fund
these experiments is because we want to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
these experiments is because we want to
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.310
these experiments is because we want to
live in a world where people find stuff

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
live in a world where people find stuff
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.139
live in a world where people find stuff
out imagine if you funded nothing in

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149
out imagine if you funded nothing in
 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.999
out imagine if you funded nothing in
science and you never found anything out

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
science and you never found anything out
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.459
science and you never found anything out
how depressing would that be I don't

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469
how depressing would that be I don't
 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:23.779
how depressing would that be I don't
know actually how depressing would that

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789
know actually how depressing would that
 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.450
know actually how depressing would that
be that but that would be pretty

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
be that but that would be pretty
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.149
be that but that would be pretty
depressing or imagine a world in which

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
depressing or imagine a world in which
 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.060
depressing or imagine a world in which
nobody could write books or yeah I think

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
nobody could write books or yeah I think
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.429
nobody could write books or yeah I think
the reason to fund things and of course

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
the reason to fund things and of course
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.529
the reason to fund things and of course
you can't argue that any stupid thing

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539
you can't argue that any stupid thing
 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.300
you can't argue that any stupid thing
you should have fun but if there's a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
you should have fun but if there's a
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.880
you should have fun but if there's a
whole lot of people who are interested

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
whole lot of people who are interested
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740
whole lot of people who are interested
in doing something and it makes sense

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
in doing something and it makes sense
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.779
in doing something and it makes sense
and they've worked on it for years it's

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789
and they've worked on it for years it's
 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.819
and they've worked on it for years it's
reasonable to fund it I think if you can

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
reasonable to fund it I think if you can
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.969
reasonable to fund it I think if you can
I mean there's some people who believe

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979
I mean there's some people who believe
 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.959
I mean there's some people who believe
that you know you should only fund

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969
that you know you should only fund
 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.539
that you know you should only fund
things that make people's lives longer

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549
things that make people's lives longer
 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.770
things that make people's lives longer
that seems ridiculous how about making

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
that seems ridiculous how about making
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.169
that seems ridiculous how about making
people's lives better how about people

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179
people's lives better how about people
 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.660
people's lives better how about people
making people happier to be alive

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
making people happier to be alive
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.969
making people happier to be alive
because they can read cool stuff the New

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
because they can read cool stuff the New
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249
because they can read cool stuff the New
York Times or whatever wherever in

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
York Times or whatever wherever in
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.669
York Times or whatever wherever in
science so this so people are somehow

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679
science so this so people are somehow
 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.529
science so this so people are somehow
moralistic about the length of people's

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
moralistic about the length of people's
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.930
moralistic about the length of people's
lives rather than the quality of life or

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
lives rather than the quality of life or
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.490
lives rather than the quality of life or
the rather than the standard of living

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
the rather than the standard of living
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.940
the rather than the standard of living
so I think by me doing particle physics

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
so I think by me doing particle physics
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.130
so I think by me doing particle physics
it raises everybody's standard of living

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
it raises everybody's standard of living
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.099
it raises everybody's standard of living
that's a

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109
that's a
 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.569
that's a
boy maybe I shouldn't be quoted that way

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579
boy maybe I shouldn't be quoted that way
 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.200
boy maybe I shouldn't be quoted that way
I think I think I do
