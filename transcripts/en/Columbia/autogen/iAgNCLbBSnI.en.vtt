education within the three years to be
 

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:04.000
education within the three years to be
able to make it into University and so

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.010
able to make it into University and so

yes we differed from our colleagues our

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:06.650
yes we differed from our colleagues our
 

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.590
yes we differed from our colleagues our
colleagues felt that it was it enough

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:08.600
colleagues felt that it was it enough
 

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.450
colleagues felt that it was it enough
and that they should extend the time to

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:10.460
and that they should extend the time to
 

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.640
and that they should extend the time to
give the children more time to be able

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:12.650
give the children more time to be able
 

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.460
give the children more time to be able
to do it but I believe that if the

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:15.470
to do it but I believe that if the
 

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.020
to do it but I believe that if the
quality of the education is not good

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:17.030
quality of the education is not good
 

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.359

parasitical diseases like malaria and
 

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.239
parasitical diseases like malaria and
all all of them and I guess that too

00:43:55.239 --> 00:43:55.249
