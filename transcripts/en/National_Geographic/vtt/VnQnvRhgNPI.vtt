ANDRE CHOULIKA: We didn't have
any intention of injecting

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:07.667
these type of vials to
patient because we needed

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.533
a lot of vials to
be able to file

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.100
our clinical trial application.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.767
And this was planned to be done
with the University College

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:15.500
London.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.433
NARRATOR: Before any new
medication or therapy

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.834
is considered safe
and effective,

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:27.834
it must first be rigorously
tested through clinical trials.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.700
These trials are
fundamental in determining

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.100
an experimental treatment's
dosage and safety

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.667
and to identify any
possible side effects.

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.567
At the University
College London,

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:47.433
Great Ormond Street Institute of
Child Health, Professor Waseem

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:51.300
Qasim was working with Cellectis
as the principal investigator,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.666
taking the universal CAR
T-cells from the lab to trials.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.400
Normally, this process
can take over a decade,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.367
with nearly endless
layers of approval.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:04.599
So our questions were what
do you do if your patient is

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.065
already so unwell that
you can't collect cells;

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.734
or has had so much chemotherapy
that there's no white blood

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:13.265
cells left to collect, that you
think are going to be useful;

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.734
how do you do this process
in a way that can be

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:19.000
done quickly and delivered
back to the patient in a timely

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.133
manner?

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.232
And the answer to
that is perhaps

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:25.700
being able to use a product,
a cell product, that's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.033
been made beforehand,
that can be given

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:30.834
back to multiple patients.

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.266
Now in order to do that, we
have to overcome the barrier

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.333
of transplantation,
which means if I put

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:41.633
my cells into a
nonmatched individual,

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.833
the cells firstly will want to
react against that individual

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.734
because they will know the
individuals is foreign.

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:48.833
And secondly, the person
receiving the cells

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:51.300
will try and reject
them because they know

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.600
the cells are not their own.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.133
NARRATOR: In affiliation
with Professor Qasim,

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.366
Doctor Paul Veys works
on the front line

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:00.133
with patients who
desperately need

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.033
new cancer treatment options.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:06.266
I'll have treated well over
3,000 patients and at least 600

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.100
of those will have gone wrong.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.132
So there's a lot of
patients that we lose.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.600
It's unsuccessful.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.333
You've got to be able
to come in the next day.

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:24.100
Even from our failures,
we've learned lots.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.966
And if we hadn't gone
through those failures,

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:29.200
we wouldn't be having some of
the successes we have today.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.433
Has the chest has
always been good?

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.100
He's not had any big
chest infections?

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.966
NURSE: No.

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:33.800
It's not good.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.633
Let's warm it up.

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:39.633
Sit forward again.

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:40.467
Yeah.

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.467
Perfect.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:43.100
OK.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.132
Big breaths.
