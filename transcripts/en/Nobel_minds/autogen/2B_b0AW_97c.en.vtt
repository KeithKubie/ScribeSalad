so we believe that there are

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709
so we believe that there are
 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.190

sound but the waveform has wiggles in
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.510
sound but the waveform has wiggles in
them and if you look at these Wiggles

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520
them and if you look at these Wiggles
 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.110
them and if you look at these Wiggles
and how they vary over time you can

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
and how they vary over time you can
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.510
and how they vary over time you can
represent what you see in terms of an

observe what the universe behaves like
 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.709
observe what the universe behaves like
in terms of gravitational waves and then

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719
in terms of gravitational waves and then
 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.770
in terms of gravitational waves and then

they got the call from Stockholm this
 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.200
they got the call from Stockholm this
morning well I think they were expecting

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210
morning well I think they were expecting
 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.899
morning well I think they were expecting
it more or less as I said at the press

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909
it more or less as I said at the press
 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.309
it more or less as I said at the press
conference the first discovery of a

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319
conference the first discovery of a
 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.200

measurement caused the sensation

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250
measurement caused the sensation
 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.600
measurement caused the sensation
worldwide so it's been speculated

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610
worldwide so it's been speculated
 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.450
worldwide so it's been speculated
already for a year that this was a

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460
already for a year that this was a
 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.290
already for a year that this was a
deserving discovery and so I think they

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300
deserving discovery and so I think they
 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.519
deserving discovery and so I think they
were half expecting it they were still

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:27.529

but then as the detector grew in size

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000
but then as the detector grew in size
 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.469
but then as the detector grew in size
and people started talking of kilometer

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479
and people started talking of kilometer
 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:17.550

unfortunately I don't think it is
 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:48.600
unfortunately I don't think it is
possible but each Nobel laureate has the

gravitational waves are here in some
 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.290
gravitational waves are here in some
sense what will they tell us about the

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.300
sense what will they tell us about the
 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.490
sense what will they tell us about the
universe so what we hope to learn from

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:08.500
universe so what we hope to learn from
 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.000
universe so what we hope to learn from
the gravitational waves is

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.010
the gravitational waves is
 

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.710

dark which you've never seen before
 

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.750
dark which you've never seen before
because electromagnetic radiation

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760
because electromagnetic radiation
 

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.510
because electromagnetic radiation
doesn't reach us from there

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:29.520
doesn't reach us from there
 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.130

gravitational waves are unstoppable so

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:32.140
gravitational waves are unstoppable so
 

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.980
gravitational waves are unstoppable so
they will so we hope to learn about this

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:34.990
they will so we hope to learn about this
 

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:40.560
