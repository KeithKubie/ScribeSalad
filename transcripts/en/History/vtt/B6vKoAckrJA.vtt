- You remember Kim from Mark V
fiberglass?

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:04.404
You got your seat.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.639
When I was over there
picking up buggy parts,

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:09.475
she was talking to me
about her bug she's got

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:12.745
and a Mach 1 that she
and her husband had.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:13.746
Look at this bad boy.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.548
This has got to be the spot.

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:17.417
I had to get my
mind off of pinstripes

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.785
and graphics for a minute.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.287
Kim Ball-- she's a legend
in the car business.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.423
She knows everything about cars.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.159
In fact, she was the first
woman to work behind a parts

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.161
counter in the entire country.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.396
She lives here in Vegas
and invited me to stop by.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.099
I just hope Mike can keep
his mouth shut long enough

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.435
to maybe learn a thing or two.
Look at that.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.438
It's a '66?

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.172
I don't know.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.706
'66, I think.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.707
You know I'm ignorant when
it comes to these things.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.842
Yeah, it's '66.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.811
Wow, that's a beautiful Mustang.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.181
All right, before we go
gawking all over her ride,

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.082
let's go get her first.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.187
No soliciting.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.588
Maybe you should have
waited in the car.

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.123
I don't know.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.524
I gotta look it up, see
what it really means.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.726
Maybe they got a dog
for you to play with.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.528
That'll be good.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.830
You like dogs.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.532
- I like cats better.
- How are you doing?

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:07.867
KIM: Hi, how are you?
- Kim--

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.669
Hi, Kim.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.270
We're here to check out your
Mach 1 you were talking about.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:12.839
OK, well, if you want
to go around to the front,

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.307
I'll open the garage doors.
- Cool.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.841
- All right.
- Very cool.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.209
All right.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.310
Dude, I'm a sucker
for '69 Mach 1s.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.744
I really am.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.613
I love bugs.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:21.614
That's your daily driver?

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:22.548
KIM: Daily driver.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:23.749
That one looks cool.

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:24.884
I like all the
upgrades you're doing.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.352
I like the split window.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:28.554
Typically, they're
not done very well.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.289
And they look bad.

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:31.457
That one looks cool.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.227
Well, you know,
that one opens, too.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.295
So you got a bug hatchback.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:38.764
The struts allow me to
open it three different ways.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.366
This is completely open.
RYAN: OK.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:41.834
And then you can bring
it down to where it's

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.636
only open like this far up.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.706
And, if you pop the back windows
at the same time, you really--

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:47.907
RYAN: It's like a
wind tunnel in there.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.475
You can really
get a lot of wind.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:50.476
RYAN: Nice.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.711
You gotta have cup holders.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.179
RYAN: I like the tray.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:55.781
KIM: So I made a tray.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:59.352
Wow, '69 Mach 1-- as
far as I'm concerned,

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.887
the only Mustangs
on this planet--

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.788
and I know a lot of people
are going to hate me for it--

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:03.656
is the '69.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.192
That's it.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:08.794
1969 was the first
year Ford introduced

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:12.932
the Mach 1, replacing the GT as
its premiere performance model.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.501
The Mustang's body style
changed drastically

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:17.670
this year to make it more
competitive during the muscle

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:18.871
car craze.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:21.240
With new quad
headlights up front

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.277
and a wider, longer,
more muscular body,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.679
this pony car was
built to give Camaros,

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.549
Firebirds, and [inaudible]
a run for their money.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.785
The Mach 1 model was insanely
powerful and popular,

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.620
accounting for almost
a quarter of all

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.557
the Mustangs sold that year.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.825
This is the original
paint on the car.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.794
This is the original interior.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:44.830
And the drive train had
been stripped out of it.

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:50.236
We found the guy that originally
bought the car in Pennsylvania.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.838
So we went up, and we got
the drive train from the--

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:54.240
He still had--

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.409
He still had it
wrapped in plastic.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.911
And that's what's
made this what it is.

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:00.313
RYAN: This is an--

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:00.980
You still got your
numbers matching.

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:02.548
This is a numbers--

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:03.549
This is an all original,
numbers matching--

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:04.951
MIKE: That's awesome.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.519
So I guess you want to
see if she's real or not.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:07.720
Well I just-- well,
you know-- hey--

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:08.721
Hey, a motor's a motor.

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.323
You want to see a 428.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.825
Not that I really, truly
know the difference--

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:13.960
Oh, man.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:14.961
That is-- that's
a factory AC part?

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.996
Factory AC.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.933
Damn, this thing is
stuffed in there, too.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.270
I can't believe that
this is all original--

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.404
like the graphics, everything.

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:26.939
Everything on this car is real.

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.407
KIM: Everything is original.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.742
Damn near down to the tires--

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:34.580
I mean, how can you own
a '69 with a 428 Cobra Jet

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:35.982
and not have Polyglas tires?

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.016
You have to.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.584
They literally don't look right.

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:41.420
This is way better
than any 401K.

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:43.022
I mean, this is
really a retirement

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.757
plan sitting in your garage.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.359
KIM: And it didn't
start out at that.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.628
It just started out as a
car that I loved driving.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.564
And I have driven it
all over the country.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:52.999
I'll be damned.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.700
Well that was well
worth my lunch hour.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:56.902
Kim did a beautiful job on
the mods on her Volkswagen.

00:03:56.935 --> 00:03:59.639
And seriously, '69 Mustang--

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.040
that thing was gorgeous.

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:03.609
You only see a car like
that once, maybe twice,

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:05.642
in a lifetime-- beautiful car.
