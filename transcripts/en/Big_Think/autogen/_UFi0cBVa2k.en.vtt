years ago or so you know science was the

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
years ago or so you know science was the
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.860
years ago or so you know science was the
domain of you know the hair professor

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870
domain of you know the hair professor
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.029

the sort of white male old man that had

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
the sort of white male old man that had
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.160
the sort of white male old man that had
all this prestige show because he

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
all this prestige show because he
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.220
all this prestige show because he
understood this thing that that regular

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
understood this thing that that regular
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.439
understood this thing that that regular
people couldn't understand you know

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
people couldn't understand you know
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.420
people couldn't understand you know
science right and so there was this it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
science right and so there was this it
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.979
science right and so there was this it
wasn't systematic you know this sort of

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989
wasn't systematic you know this sort of
 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.380
wasn't systematic you know this sort of
feedback loop that made that that was

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
feedback loop that made that that was
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.290
feedback loop that made that that was
purposely started here that I am doing

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
purposely started here that I am doing
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.920
purposely started here that I am doing
this rarefied thing right that you the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
this rarefied thing right that you the
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630
this rarefied thing right that you the
normal person can't get you know you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
normal person can't get you know you
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369
normal person can't get you know you
have to be Albert Einstein you have to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
have to be Albert Einstein you have to
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350
have to be Albert Einstein you have to
be you know whoever right and that mere

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
be you know whoever right and that mere
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810
be you know whoever right and that mere
mortals can't cope in this world and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
mortals can't cope in this world and
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.840
mortals can't cope in this world and
that has become made it so that people

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
that has become made it so that people
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060
that has become made it so that people
are afraid of science they think science

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
are afraid of science they think science
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279
are afraid of science they think science
they think it's too hard and then they

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
they think it's too hard and then they
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.200
they think it's too hard and then they
also have this stereotype of this old

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
also have this stereotype of this old
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.479
also have this stereotype of this old
guy like you know why would I want to be

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
guy like you know why would I want to be
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160
guy like you know why would I want to be
like that these guys were never athletes

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
like that these guys were never athletes
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750
like that these guys were never athletes
right and so I think that there's that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
right and so I think that there's that
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.600
right and so I think that there's that
this the stereotype of these boring a

whether and it does have to be biology
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350
whether and it does have to be biology
just think about computer science I mean

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
just think about computer science I mean
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480

you know those people are certainly text

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
you know those people are certainly text
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.300

messaging so they can do science right

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
messaging so they can do science right
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.210
messaging so they can do science right
and so it's so and I have to say this is

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
and so it's so and I have to say this is
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.760
and so it's so and I have to say this is
not um

scientists nightmare dinner party and we

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910
scientists nightmare dinner party and we
 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.750
scientists nightmare dinner party and we
got a lot of these right and it's so odd

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
got a lot of these right and it's so odd
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.180
got a lot of these right and it's so odd
because it would be unthinkable for me

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
because it would be unthinkable for me
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.830
because it would be unthinkable for me
to say I just didn't want to learn to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
to say I just didn't want to learn to
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.100

read right come on how many heroes do

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
read right come on how many heroes do
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.740
read right come on how many heroes do
you know in science right you know like

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750
you know in science right you know like

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
I mean if an athlete were to walk down
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460
I mean if an athlete were to walk down

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.860
Nobel Prize and people in Princeton
don't even know who he is right and so I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
don't even know who he is right and so I
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.990
don't even know who he is right and so I
think that we don't have heroes right

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
think that we don't have heroes right
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.660
think that we don't have heroes right
and that is new because in the 50s you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
and that is new because in the 50s you
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.580
and that is new because in the 50s you
know and earlier you know Einstein was a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590
know and earlier you know Einstein was a
 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.130
know and earlier you know Einstein was a
hero sock was a hero you know Fleming

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
hero sock was a hero you know Fleming
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.069
hero sock was a hero you know Fleming
those were heroes and somehow culture

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079
those were heroes and somehow culture
 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.050
those were heroes and somehow culture
has changed that it's not cool and

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
has changed that it's not cool and
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.059
has changed that it's not cool and
heroic to do science and I think that's

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069
heroic to do science and I think that's
 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.120
heroic to do science and I think that's
kind of a pity right and and and I don't

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130
kind of a pity right and and and I don't
 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.589
kind of a pity right and and and I don't
think it's just movies I think it's a

think it's just movies I think it's a
 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.059
think it's just movies I think it's a
much bigger thing it's what we've been

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069
much bigger thing it's what we've been
 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.520
much bigger thing it's what we've been
talking about that it's that our entire

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530
talking about that it's that our entire
 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.100
talking about that it's that our entire
country is turned off from science at a

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110
country is turned off from science at a
 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.430
country is turned off from science at a
really early age for both religious and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440
really early age for both religious and
 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.150
really early age for both religious and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
political and educational reasons right
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.770
political and educational reasons right
and then there's no way to grapple with
