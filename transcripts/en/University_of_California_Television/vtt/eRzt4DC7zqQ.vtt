(electronic tones beeping)

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.800
- Dr. Hansen is the Director
of Clinical Programs

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.920
at UC Davis Mind Institute,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.180
and Professor in Chief

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.400
of Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.790
Department of Pediatrics,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.550
and Director of the Center for Excellence

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.503
in Developmental Disabilities
at UC Davis Health Systems,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.578
and a good friend. (laughs)

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:32.411
(audience applauding)

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:34.120
- Where's my clicker, here?

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.080
- And this is your pointer.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.810
Oh, I forgot to say what
you're gonna talk about.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.980
- That's okay, my slide's up.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.160
- Good.
- It's right there.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.610
So it is nice to be back,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.260
and I realized as I was
thinking about my updates

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.690
that I will be updating
you on some of the research

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.880
that's evolved since the last time

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.963
I was here presenting on
autism research updates.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.360
So I have nothing to disclose,
financial disclosures.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.930
I do have to disclose that the day after

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.400
I sent my slides in for the syllabus,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.720
we had a new study that came out online,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.900
so I'm gonna talk about it.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.833
So this is not in your syllabus.

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:18.640
I think those of us who
treat patients with autism

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.360
and certainly those of us doing research

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.678
in autism spectrum disorders understand

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:25.430
how complicated they are
and how heterogeneous

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.850
they are in terms of presentation,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.480
certainly in terms of etiology,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.273
and increasing in prevalence.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.410
Our research has really
tried to understand

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.940
what are some of these etiologies?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.840
Can we identify biomarkers?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.320
Can we find endophenotypes
or subtypes of autism

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.580
that help us in understanding
potential targeted treatments

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.720
so that we can do a better job

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.270
in not only early diagnosis
but early treatment as well.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.103
So as I said,

00:01:57.103 --> 00:01:59.380
I'm gonna try and highlight
some translational research

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.130
that's been ongoing at the Mind Institute,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.530
I realize for about 20 years,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.340
and some of the most recent research

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.630
that we have that primarily relates

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.920
to looking at
gene-environment interactions

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.340
as well as taking us
along this path to looking

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.903
at immune dysregulation as
a risk factor in autism.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.860
So the learning objectives are one,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.270
to understand the current
prevalence estimates

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.890
of autism in the United States,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.800
to understand or identify four maternal

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.180
metabolic conditions
that we think increase

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.710
the risk for autism as well

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.363
as more generalized developmental delays.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.520
To understand or list the
clinical characteristics

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790
of a subtype of autism called

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.790
maternal auto-antibody
related autism or MAR autism,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.670
and to list some of the
core and co-morbid symptoms

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.910
associated with some different immune

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.563
endophenotypes in the children themselves.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.020
So we are fortunate in the United States

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.040
to have the CDC doing
ongoing prevalence studies

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.540
across the country at various sites,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.180
and each time that they report out,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.100
which is about every two years,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.200
the prevalence of autism has increased

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.240
and we don't know how much longer

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.300
it's going to keep increasing,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.300
but right now it's currently
one in 59 or 1.7% of children,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.410
and this work is done where they evaluate

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.893
multiple records at eight years of age.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.730
So it's up from the last
time they reported it,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.283
which was one in 68,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.450
and one thing I think is significant

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.201
is that less than half of these children,

00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:44.330
looking back, were diagnosed by age four,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.300
although most of their parents
had concerns way before this.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.620
I think it really pushes us to try

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.640
and figure out ways to
do earlier diagnosis

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.623
so we can really get earlier treatment.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.100
This is a schematic
just to start the story

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.870
of the research that we've been doing

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.160
and I'm not quite sure
how to use my pointer

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.790
but it all started with
a study that was funded

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.710
by NIEHS and the EPA
called the CHARGE study,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.670
and this was really as we were beginning

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.990
to try and figure out why
would a highly-heritable,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.440
at least genetically-based disorder

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.810
be increasing so rapidly?

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.590
There's gotta be something
else that's changing

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.370
because genetic disorders
don't change that fast.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.750
So can we try and figure
out by looking at multiple,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.620
multiple, in a population-based
case-control study,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.730
can we look at the shotgun approach?

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.400
We really weren't particularly
focused on looking

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.860
at immune dysregulation but
it was one of the things

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.740
that we figured we should be looking at,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.270
and things in the environment
that we knew were changing,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.493
many of which are
potentially very neurotoxic.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.610
Something that came out of that,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.233
so this was primarily
a retrospective study.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.120
I'll show you another slide

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.470
that goes into a little more detail,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.530
but an outshoot of that
then was looking at a study,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.530
we developed a study called MARBLES,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.240
Markers of Autism Risk in
Babies - Learning Early Signs,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.130
so this is a population of children

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.660
who were mothers who were studied

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.660
from the time that they
were pregnant or before

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.490
they were pregnant who already
had a child with autism,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.730
so we knew that they were at greater risk

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.340
for having another child with autism.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.890
So these are all co-collaborators

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.020
and we all lived at the Mind Institute

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.150
and at the Children's Center
for Environmental Health.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.020
This is just another schematic
to show you that in CHARGE,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.870
these kids were two to five years of age.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.890
We had three groups.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.470
We had kids with autism,
with a diagnosis reconfirmed,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.680
kids with typical development,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.820
and kids with developmental
delays who did not have autism.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.310
We looked at a lot of biological factors.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.480
We looked retrospectively at
a lot of historical factors.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.841
We had newborn blood spots to look at,

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:01.310
blood findings at the time of birth,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.680
and then this is MARBLES,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.530
so you can see this is
a prospective study,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.040
as I said, of children, of pregnancies,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.200
and then the children out to age three

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.580
where we looked at a lot of
the same biological samples,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.740
we did a lot of the same
environmental questionnaires,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.123
except that it was prospective.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.050
All right, so that sets the stage.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.690
One of the things that
we found and reported on

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.720
and I think I presented
at a previous study

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.330
but we've got some
updates is the important

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.970
of folic acid and reducing
the risk of autism.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.630
So this was in CHARGE,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.780
this was retrospective
data asking the mothers,

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.613
did they remember,

00:06:40.613 --> 00:06:44.123
did they take prenatal
vitamins during this pregnancy,

00:06:44.123 --> 00:06:46.420
when did they start?

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.354
And what we found was that
there was about a 40% reduction

00:06:50.354 --> 00:06:53.010
in the risk of having a child with autism

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.240
if mothers took prenatal vitamins

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.630
which have extra folate and preconception

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.270
or at least in the first
month or trimester.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.633
This has been replicated several times.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.650
We didn't have any studies that looked at,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.870
were there actual differences
in the maternal blood folate

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.430
at the time of birth or
in the first trimester,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.430
and then the other thing
that was interesting

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.870
about this that allowed
us to look at this impact

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.360
was primarily on women
who had a genetic variant

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.170
that made them inefficient
folate metabolizers,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.900
so in order to have what we
think of as normal folate,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.130
they needed to have extra folate on board

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.010
because they were slow metabolizers.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.600
So it was this first clear
gene-environment interaction

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:47.850
that we found in one of
our studies in CHARGE.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.860
This just shows you
that in this next study,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.840
we were able to actually
measure the difference

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.170
in maternal folate between
mothers who had children

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.950
with autism in red and then
mothers who had a child

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.720
with typical development out here.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.720
So this was at the time of
the first month of pregnancy.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.040
So now this study is from MARBLES.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.640
So this is one of the first studies

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.130
out of the prospective
study looking at children

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.440
who were followed out to age three

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.600
who ended up with a diagnosis of autism,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.340
non-typical development,
or typical development.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.317
So a lot of children who are at risk

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.490
probably from shared
gene-environment interactions

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.730
for autism may not end up
with a diagnosis of autism,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.960
but have some delays in terms
of their language development,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.990
have some behavioral
concerns around attention,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.200
emotion regulation,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.920
and sometimes we call that
the broader autism phenotype.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.740
It's not quite autism
but it's getting close,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.545
so that's what we've
called, in this study,

00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:04.480
non-typical development.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.220
And you can see that the mothers

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.070
who used pre-natal
vitamins in the first month

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.181
were about half as likely to have a child

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:18.730
on the autism spectrum,

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.940
so there was a big, big difference here.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.430
No significant differences,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.260
it's maybe a little bit different

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.750
in terms of non-typical development,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.700
but clearly having extra folate on board

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.820
in the early, early part of pregnancy

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.200
was really important and
this is a group of mothers,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.790
oops, sorry, this is a group
of mothers that we know

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.570
are at risk and a group
of fetuses are at risk

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.000
because they already have an
older sibling with autism.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.720
In this study, about by
the time of mid-pregnancy,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.133
about half of the moms were
taking pre-natal vitamins.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.870
In preconception and in the first month,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.660
only about 1/3 of the mothers

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.210
were taking pre-natal vitamins.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.240
By the end, almost everybody
was taking pre-natal vitamins,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.970
so it looks like this
is a critical window,

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.223
when extra folate is really important.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.800
Okay, so I'm gonna stay with
the maternal environment,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.050
but I'm going to shift to another

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.330
group of studies that we've done

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.360
looking at metabolic conditions.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.150
These are all clearly disorders
that impact an increasing

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.270
number of women in the United States.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.120
You can see how common diabetes,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.300
other related metabolic
conditions like obesity,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.210
chronic hypertension, metabolic syndrome,

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.473
and what I'm adding here
is the pre-eclampsia,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.810
and what all of these metabolic
conditions have in common

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:52.810
are that they have underlying
chronic inflammation

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.573
which then causes insulin resistance,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.730
and just in the course
of normal pregnancy,

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.210
insulin resistance increases anyway,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.350
just because of the metabolic changes

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.800
that go along with pregnancy.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.500
This is a flow chart
looking at our schematic

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.660
in terms of why we thought
this was important to look at

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.600
in terms of some of the potential impact

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.600
on fetal brain so we know that
maternal metabolic conditions

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.860
put moms in a pro-inflammatory state,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.760
so they have elevated levels
of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.730
These cross the placenta.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.550
They stimulate fetal
immune cells in the brain

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.660
which are really important
for early brain development,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.670
so you have a pro-inflammatory state

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.670
in terms of fetal brain,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.340
then the other mechanism in
terms of insulin resistance

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.910
is when you're resistant to insulin,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.670
maternal glucose levels go up.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.343
This stimulates fetal insulin to go up.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.550
Stimulates increased fetal growth,

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.490
more oxygen consumption and
the potential for fetal hypoxia

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.030
as well as iron deficiency,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.250
and this is particularly
important if we think about

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.773
pre-eclampsia and placental insufficiency.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.360
So the questions that we were asking

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.190
is can we show that these
metabolic conditions

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.520
during pregnancy increase the likelihood

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.333
of having a child with
ASD or other delays?

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.540
So you could see,

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.955
in terms of the initial
study that we looked at,

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:31.000
that both children with
ASD and developmental delay

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.670
but not autism had a higher likelihood

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.530
of having mothers with
any or a combination

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.620
of these different syndromes.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.740
And you can see how significant,

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.240
actually, these risk factors are,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.931
both for delayed development

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.693
but autism specifically as well.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.520
So when we looked at pre-eclampsia,

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.380
we found that the same thing was true,

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.920
that in women who had pre-eclampsia,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.620
they were twice as likely to have a child

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.973
on the autism spectrum.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.820
When we looked at children who ended up

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.300
with a diagnosis of developmental
delay, but not autism,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.500
it wasn't really until there
was very severe pre-eclampsia

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.470
and placental insufficiency
where we saw this spike

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.080
in terms of impacting fetal outcomes.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.330
So again we've added
pre-eclampsia to one of these

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.960
risk factors that we think is
very important in increasing

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.673
or at least mitigating risk for autism.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.050
So now I'm going to shift
gears and talk about

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.210
the other side of the immune system,

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.130
so the cellular immune
system, and what we found,

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.890
one of the observations that we have found

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.700
initially in the CHARGE study early on

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.470
was that some women develop antibodies

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.763
that have a target on fetal brain,

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.600
and unfortunately these are IgG proteins

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.700
which means they can cross the placenta

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.907
and their targets happen to be circuit

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.020
fetal brain cells

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.070
and their impact seems to reduce

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.850
the development of dendritic spines

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.310
and as we've looked at
children whose mother

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.810
have these antibodies and again,

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.180
this started out in the CHARGE study,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.081
about 1/4 of the moms who
had children with autism

00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:29.081
had these patterns of antibodies
with fetal brain targets

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.860
and we didn't see them in the mothers

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.620
of children with developmental
delay and we didn't

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.560
see them in mothers of children
with typical development.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.820
And as we continue to look,

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.380
we actually realize
that there's particular

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.930
some characteristics of these children.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.750
Not only do they have
autism but they seem to have

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:52.430
distinct subphenotype where
they have more severe behaviors,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.373
they tend to have higher autism severity.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.040
Lots of stereotypical
behavior, and in boys at least,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.453
they tend to have larger
brains, so macrocephaly.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.750
And the story of how we developed

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.270
or took this information
I think is a really

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.270
interesting story in terms of translation

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.330
and the importance of
having both clinicians

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.944
and basic scientists on your team

00:15:20.944 --> 00:15:23.530
to really develop this
story and understand

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.170
what it is you're observing clinically,

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.020
what those mechanisms might
be and then how can you use

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.623
that information to get
back to clinical targets?

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.150
So I'm just gonna walk you through,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.060
as I said we just, on
Western blots, early on,

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.110
we saw that these
different patterns existed

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.150
in some of the mothers who
had children with autism.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.720
We weren't really sure what their clinical

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.900
significance was but we
thought they probably

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.793
were significant because
they weren't in other moms.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.120
And it was really hard,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.700
this was when studies were first starting

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.710
to really think about or
look at the immune system

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.082
and it's all over the place,
continues to this day.

00:16:03.082 --> 00:16:05.343
It's hard to replicate
some of these studies.

00:16:06.349 --> 00:16:08.950
But one of the things that
I think really helped us

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.790
along this path is we
took antibodies from moms

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.130
who had kids with autism and
had these antibody patterns

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.730
and in four different animal models,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.570
used these antibodies,
these maternal antibodies,

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.660
and injected them in
two early mouse models

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.660
and two primate models
and this intervention

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.150
resulted in demonstrating

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.430
that both mice and monkeys

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.210
develop symptoms that
are similar to at least

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.170
some of the behavioral symptoms
that we see in children.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.720
They had social abnormalities,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.510
they had lots and lots
of repetitive behaviors

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.620
and a lot of self-harm.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:56.563
So we had some proof of concept here,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.970
and then some of the other
things that we started

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.470
figuring out is that many of these women

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.320
who had these antibodies
also had a genetic variant

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.430
in the C-MET gene that
seemed to be associated

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.680
with producing these auto-antibodies.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.500
We also found again by
observation, clinical observation,

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.570
that a lot of the boys whose
mother has these antibodies

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.950
and who had autism had larger brains,

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.540
and then we also found
that mothers who had

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.480
these auto-antibodies
were more likely to have

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.630
metabolic conditions during pregnancy,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.583
so again, tying both of these
lines of research together.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.010
So the next step was
really trying to figure out

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.640
if we could target what
are these antigens,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.550
and where are their specific targets?

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.410
And this really took a lot longer

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.110
than we thought it was gonna take.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.880
But we finally identified the proteins

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.480
and they were quite common proteins.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.830
LDH, CRMP1, and STIP1
which are very important

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.650
in terms of early neurodevelopment,

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:03.290
and so Jackie Crawley
and her team developed

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.090
a mouse model and injected
these specific proteins,

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.098
not from maternal serum,

00:18:10.098 --> 00:18:12.942
but developed these proteins and developed

00:18:12.942 --> 00:18:15.870
this mouse model of autism.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.743
So again, another proof of concept.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.870
The step clinically then
is to try and figure out

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.050
how can we screen for these antibodies,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:30.730
identify them in a clinical way

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.760
that's valid, that's efficient,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.410
that you could do a lot of screening.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.970
And this has been
complicated because a lot

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.820
of the recombinant proteins that are used

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.110
in the ELISA assay have His tags on them,

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.830
and it turns out that a lot of vaccines

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.380
also have this tag,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.430
so you get a lot of non-specific binding

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.540
in women who don't have these
antibodies but have His tags.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.770
So it's taken a very long time
to get this assay completed.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.750
Lots of stops and starts,

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.570
but I think we're getting very close

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.780
to having a clinically-available screen

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.913
for these auto-antibody patterns.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.961
Okay, so this is my last shift,

00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:13.970
I hope I have enough
time to do this, I do.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.530
Sorry for running through this so fast,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.120
but now I want to just look
at some immune dysregulation

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.300
in the children themselves,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.300
so all of this has been related
to what we've understood

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.960
in the maternal environment and
with maternal dysregulation,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.230
so this is actually from another
study at the Mind Institute

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.183
called the Autism Phenome Project.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.610
These children were between
the ages of two and three.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.930
They had a diagnosis of autism

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.380
that was confirmed and
we had a comparison group

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.393
of typically-developing boys
as well of the same age.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.040
What we found is that
there were differences

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.220
across these groups in their patterns

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.960
of immune response to stimulation,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.610
and particularly when we
looked at within the group

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.850
of boys that had a diagnosis of autism,

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.530
and stimulated their mononuclear cells

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.302
with lipopolysaccharide which usually just

00:20:16.302 --> 00:20:21.302
causes a upregulation or a
pro-inflammatory response.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.330
We found that some kids in this group

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.340
were high responders in these dark bars,

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.687
and kids that didn't quite respond,

00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:34.640
they didn't get such a great
response as this group did,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.860
so we call them high and low responders.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.360
And then we looked at autism severity,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.450
so this is from the ADOS,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.090
the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule,

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.850
and you can see that the
boys with the high response

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.250
had much more impairments

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.000
in their social affective relating.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.060
No real significant differences in terms

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.838
of repetitive behaviors and not clinically

00:21:00.838 --> 00:21:04.440
statistically significantly different

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.833
but some increase in their
overall autism severity.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.270
And when we looked at,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.880
oh they also actually had lower overall

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.960
developmental quotients and particularly

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.260
in the non-verbal developmental quotient.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.590
No significant differences in
terms of their verbal skills.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.930
Then we looked at correlated behaviors,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.630
sort of co-morbidities, and again,

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.710
found significant increases
in the high responders

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.740
in terms of sleep problems
and aggressive behaviors.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.470
Some suggestion that
there's some increased

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.320
attention problems but again
not statistically significant.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.320
So what this may help us
develop is trying to be able

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.640
to segregate not just by
diagnosis but by subtype,

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.580
particularly as we're trying

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.210
to do more targeted clinical trials.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.300
It may be that when you
look at a group of boys

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.180
who we all know have autism
and we all can agree upon that,

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.640
and some seem to respond to a particular

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.320
targeted treatment and others don't,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.623
and so it all kind of
washes out in the middle,

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.810
so you don't find statistical significance

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.860
or clinical differences,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.670
it may be because these kids
have different etiologies

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.900
and need different targeted treatments.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.340
So this is just one way of
thinking about how we might

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.143
subdivide groups when we
look at clinical trials.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.190
So just in summary, I think
immune studies and autism

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.300
really do reflect the
complex heterogeneity

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.150
both in etiology as well as
trying to sort things out

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.020
in terms of gene-environment interactions

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.230
that are very complicated,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.440
and our line of research would suggest

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.570
that it's both maternal
and child immune systems

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.600
that may be very important
in subtyping children

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.683
as we try and develop
more targeted treatments.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.363
They may also be early
biomarkers that help us

00:22:51.363 --> 00:22:54.930
look for risk and hopefully,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.640
we can get towards prevention.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.640
So I think making sure that
women of child-bearing age

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.730
understand the importance
of taking pre-natal vitamins

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.090
when they're planning a pregnancy,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.403
before they get pregnant,

00:23:10.357 --> 00:23:13.800
is a public health
message that is important

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.310
and I think trying to address
some of the health factors

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.660
that contribute to metabolic
conditions as best we can

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.340
is also an important
aspect of autism treatment

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.753
or perhaps prevention.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.160
So thank you to all the families

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.690
that have participated in these studies,

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.620
to our funders, and to
my co-collaborators.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.077
So thank you.

00:23:37.077 --> 00:23:40.244
