say when you when you pair a sentence

down to what is intelligence the
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 align:start position:0%
down to what is intelligence the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 align:start position:0%
sentence is problematic because part of
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.220 align:start position:0%
sentence is problematic because part of
it<00:00:29.609><c> is</c><00:00:29.670><c> a</c><00:00:30.029><c> question</c><00:00:30.960><c> about</c><00:00:32.149><c> if</c><00:00:33.149><c> and</c><00:00:33.510><c> how</c><00:00:33.719><c> such</c><00:00:34.200><c> a</c>

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 align:start position:0%
it is a question about if and how such a
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.049 align:start position:0%
it is a question about if and how such a
thing<00:00:34.380><c> might</c><00:00:34.770><c> manifest</c><00:00:35.130><c> itself</c><00:00:35.610><c> in</c><00:00:35.820><c> the</c><00:00:35.910><c> world</c>

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
thing might manifest itself in the world
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.220 align:start position:0%
thing might manifest itself in the world
so<00:00:37.579><c> there's</c><00:00:38.579><c> a</c><00:00:38.670><c> fact</c><00:00:39.030><c> out</c><00:00:39.329><c> there</c><00:00:39.540><c> or</c><00:00:39.840><c> set</c><00:00:40.140><c> of</c>

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 align:start position:0%
so there's a fact out there or set of
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 align:start position:0%
so there's a fact out there or set of
facts<00:00:40.440><c> that</c><00:00:40.530><c> corresponds</c><00:00:41.190><c> to</c><00:00:41.309><c> intelligence</c>

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
facts that corresponds to intelligence
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.190 align:start position:0%
facts that corresponds to intelligence
but<00:00:42.000><c> the</c><00:00:42.090><c> other</c><00:00:42.210><c> problem</c><00:00:42.390><c> is</c><00:00:42.660><c> well</c><00:00:42.840><c> what</c><00:00:43.020><c> do</c>

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
but the other problem is well what do
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.529 align:start position:0%
but the other problem is well what do
you<00:00:43.379><c> mean</c><00:00:43.710><c> when</c><00:00:44.070><c> you</c><00:00:44.250><c> say</c><00:00:44.489><c> intelligence</c><00:00:45.300><c> and</c>

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 align:start position:0%
you mean when you say intelligence and
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.660 align:start position:0%
you mean when you say intelligence and
you<00:00:46.320><c> kind</c><00:00:46.530><c> of</c><00:00:46.590><c> have</c><00:00:46.739><c> to</c><00:00:46.770><c> nail</c><00:00:47.039><c> that</c><00:00:47.219><c> down</c><00:00:47.280><c> if</c>

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to nail that down if
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to nail that down if
you're<00:00:47.789><c> going</c><00:00:47.879><c> to</c><00:00:47.969><c> have</c><00:00:48.120><c> a</c><00:00:48.770><c> conversation</c>

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a conversation
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a conversation
about<00:00:50.430><c> intelligence</c><00:00:51.030><c> that</c><00:00:51.210><c> doesn't</c><00:00:51.480><c> go</c>

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
about intelligence that doesn't go
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
about intelligence that doesn't go
entirely<00:00:51.960><c> astray</c><00:00:52.559><c> and</c><00:00:52.829><c> so</c><00:00:53.489><c> you've</c><00:00:53.670><c> got</c><00:00:53.879><c> it</c>

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
entirely astray and so you've got it
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549 align:start position:0%
entirely astray and so you've got it
you've<00:00:54.120><c> got</c><00:00:54.300><c> a</c><00:00:54.329><c> definitional</c><00:00:55.079><c> problem</c><00:00:55.440><c> as</c>

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
you've got a definitional problem as
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.810 align:start position:0%
you've got a definitional problem as

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 align:start position:0%
well as an empirical problem and so
 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.040 align:start position:0%

there<00:00:59.820><c> have</c><00:01:00.000><c> been</c><00:01:00.120><c> and</c><00:01:00.510><c> this</c><00:01:00.690><c> was</c><00:01:00.840><c> especially</c>

how at how intelligence has been
 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.130 align:start position:0%
how at how intelligence has been

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
assessed and why and then you can make
 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.780 align:start position:0%
assessed and why and then you can make
up<00:05:43.290><c> your</c><00:05:43.440><c> own</c><00:05:43.470><c> mind</c><00:05:43.740><c> anyways</c><00:05:44.310><c> here's</c><00:05:44.550><c> some</c><00:05:44.700><c> of</c>

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 align:start position:0%
up your own mind anyways here's some of
 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.690 align:start position:0%
up your own mind anyways here's some of
the<00:05:45.169><c> examples</c><00:05:46.169><c> of</c><00:05:46.320><c> other</c><00:05:46.530><c> forms</c><00:05:47.520><c> of</c>

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
the examples of other forms of

the examples of other forms of

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 align:start position:0%
intelligence and so then the question is
 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.070 align:start position:0%
intelligence and so then the question is
