CHRIS BROADFOOT: Hi.

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.215
I'm Chris Broadfoot.

00:00:01.215 --> 00:00:03.540
I work on the Google Maps
Developer Relations Team.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.770
DANIEL SCHRAMM: And I'm Daniel
Schramm, Associate Product

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.970
Manager on the Google
Maps Mobile APIs.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.680
CHRIS BROADFOOT: We recently
released updates to our Mobile

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.400
Maps APIs on both
iOS and Android.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.100
DANIEL SCHRAMM: These updates
introduce three new features

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.220
that we want to talk about
in today's video--

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.881
map padding, marker rotation,
and flat markers.

00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.670
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So first up,
let's talk about map padding.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.350
Map padding allows you to offset
the default Google Maps

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.590
controls from the outside of the
map, allowing you to add

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.500
overlays like translucent
menu bars or side bars.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.140
Map padding can be changed at
any time, or animated, for

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.841
example when sliding a side bar
in and out from the map.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.260
Camera updates such as
re-centering the map take

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.120
padding into account, so you
don't need to do any

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.540
calculations about the offset.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.920
DANIEL SCHRAMM: The next future
we want to talk about

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.460
are flat markers.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.790
Flat markers are a new type of
marker that always stay flat

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.880
on the map, regardless of how
the camera is positioned.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.250
This is different from standard
markers, which will

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.820
pop out from the map when
the map is titled.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.830
You can also now rotate both
flat and standard markers

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.420
around their anchor point.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.130
This allows you to create some
interesting flat markers, such

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520
as compasses, which will always
stick on the map,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.950
pointing in a specific
direction.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.620
CHRIS BROADFOOT: These two
features can be combined to

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.200
create some really compelling
experiences.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.600
For example, we're showing a
playback of a GPS route.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.850
The marker's bearing represents
the user's bearing

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.430
at that particular point in
time, and it can be animated

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.775
as the marker moves
along the map.

00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:43.810
DANIEL SCHRAMM: Those are the
cross-platform features we

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.510
have time to talk about today,
but to learn more about

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.920
platform-specific features,
please see the release notes

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.010
on our documentation.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.640
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And stay in
the loop by following the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.590
Google Maps API+ page.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.280
Thanks for listening, and
we'll see you next time.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.530
DANIEL SCHRAMM: See you.
