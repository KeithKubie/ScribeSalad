00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.730
Thanks to Marvel and DC, shared movie universes
are the new big thing in Hollywood.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.889
But comic book movies didn’t start the trend.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.609
Filmmakers have long been looking for intricate
ways to connect their projects, including

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.480
fan-favorite director Quentin Tarantino.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.500
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Hidden Clues to
Tarantino’s Shared Universe.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Brothers in Crime

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.310
Though we don’t learn everyone’s real
name in Reservoir Dogs, it’s revealed that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.390
Mr. Blonde is actually Vic Vega.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.960
Moviegoers were able to see Tarantino’s
love of continuity when his breakout hit Pulp

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.640
Fiction was released years later, starring
John Travolta as Vincent Vega.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.500
Tarantino would later confirm the two characters
were brothers, and he even planned to film

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.020
a prequel starring the siblings before their
respective films, but due to the actors’

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.610
ages, the project never came to be.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.800
That would have been fun to see, but this
subtle clue is entertaining in its own right.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.800
Son of the Bear

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.250
Tarantino’s universe even includes a film
that he wrote, but didn’t direct: True Romance.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.810
The film features a character by the name
of Lee Donowitz, who works as a Hollywood

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.210
film producer.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.799
Fast forward to Tarantino’s own Inglourious
Basterds, and viewers are introduced to Sgt.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.859
Donny Donowitz, aka The Bear Jew.

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.670
That last name isn’t a coincidence: the
director has stated that Lee is actually Donny’s

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.670
son.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.300
Perhaps the manner in which his father assassinated
Hitler – shooting him in a bloody rampage

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.439
in a movie theater – inspired Lee to forge
his career path.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.649
Tarantino characters certainly like their
pop culture.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:34.649
Movies Within Movies

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.679
In a mind-bending twist, Tarantino has revealed
that some of his works are movies that exist

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.399
within his own movie universe.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.810
His everyday characters are apparently able
to watch From Dusk Till Dawn or Kill Bill

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.889
at their local movie theater.

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:53.250
As just one example, the cast and plot of
Kill Bill matches Mia Wallace’s failed pilot

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.130
Fox Force Five so closely, it seems like someone
adapted the TV show for the big screen and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.079
brought Mia back to reprise her role.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.079
Big Kahuna Burger

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.249
In one of Pulp Fiction’s most famous scenes,
Jules Winnfield enjoys a stolen bite from

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.430
a restaurant with an unforgettable name: Big
Kahuna Burger.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.310
What seemed like an amusing way around product
placement is actually a running theme in Tarantino’s

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.310
universe.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.470
Audiences first got a glimpse of Big Kahuna
in Reservoir Dogs when Mr. Blonde enters the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.489
film’s central warehouse, and it’s even
been featured in From Dusk Till Dawn.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.099
They do make a tasty burger, so the popularity
makes sense.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.099
Red Apple

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.310
Keeping with our theme of Tarantino’s signature
brands, Red Apple cigarettes also make frequent

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.310
appearances.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.569
The most famous is in Pulp Fiction when boxer
Butch gets a pack at the bar, but he’s not

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.319
the only one who uses them.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.730
Red Apples are also seen in From Dusk Till
Dawn and Kill Bill, with a giant billboard

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.730
showcased in the latter.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.440
It’s interesting to consider that Red Apples
are more prominently featured in the “movies

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.450
within movies” than the “real life movies,”
which perhaps is amusing commentary on the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.730
prevalence of product placement in Hollywood.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.439
Tarantino strays away from it, but the minds
behind Kill Bill don’t.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.310
A Nurse Named Bonnie

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.599
When Mr. Orange is shot at the beginning of
Reservoir Dogs, his life relies on immediate

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.599
medical attention.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.090
Needing to avoid the hospital for obvious
reasons, he becomes reliant on Nice Guy Eddie

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.209
to find the right doctor for treatment, who
mentions a nurse named Bonnie who might be

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.209
able to help.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.769
It seems like a throwaway comment, but consider
this.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.849
In Pulp Fiction, the character Jimmy – played
by Tarantino himself - has a wife named Bonnie…

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.349
who also works as a nurse.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.139
That could just be a very big coincidence,
but with all the crazy connections between

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.219
the two crime flicks, we wouldn’t bet on
it.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:47.489
The Lonely Grave of Paula Schultz

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.430
In 2012, audiences were introduced to the
charming and sentimental Dr. King Schultz

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.959
of Django Unchained, but his story may have
begun years before the Civil War-era story

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:56.959
was released.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.209
In Kill Bil Vol. 2, The Bride escapes from
the grave of one Paula Schultz who died in

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.209
1898.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.560
The years make it hard to say if the two characters
are directly linked, but Tarantino has teased

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.389
a subtle connection to his larger universe
in Django.

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.060
The other candidate would be the outlaw Crazy
Craig Koons seen on a Wanted poster, who happens

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.630
to share a name with Christopher Walken’s
Captain Koons in Pulp Fiction.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.630
Mr. White &amp; Alabama

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.759
When we learn some of Mr. White’s backstory
in Reservoir Dogs, Joe Cabot mentions that

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.860
White once had a partner named Alabama, whom
White hasn’t worked with for years.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.810
It’s hard to forget such a name, and when
True Romance introduced a character named

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.160
Alabama Whitman-Worely, the connection was
obvious.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.820
The Alabama of True Romance is supposed to
be the same accomplice Mr. White is speaking

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.820
of.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.710
It’s too bad we never got to see a movie
of their exploits, because it would have been

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.580
a highly entertaining one for sure.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.133
We’ll just have to let our imaginations
do the work for us.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.830
The Brothers Dimmick

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.010
Mr. White’s connections to the shared universe
don’t stop with Alabama.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.919
We also get to see one of his blood relatives
featured in Pulp Fiction.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.020
It’s none other than Jimmy Dimmick, the
character that Tarantino memorably played

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.020
in the film.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.530
Though the evidence is scarce, it’s still
there.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.060
Mr. White’s real name is Lawrence Dimmick.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.120
Some may question if the two really are related,
but Tarantino showed us with the Vega siblings

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.430
he’s not afraid to pull this trick, and
Dimmick seems like an oddly specific last

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.460
name.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.590
As for how it’s possible Tarantino and Harvey
Keitel have roles in both Reservoir Dogs and

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.169
Pulp Fiction, we’ll leave that up to you.

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.169
One Tough Sheriff

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.830
It’s hard to forget the introduction of
Sheriff Earl McGraw in the first Kill Bill,

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.930
the stoic lawman played by Michael Parks,
and accompanied by his son and deputy, also

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.599
played by Park’s real-life son, James (“son
number one”).

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.320
Die-hard Tarantino fans will remember McGraw
from his first appearance in From Dusk Till

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.039
Dawn, having apparently survived the terror
of the infamous Gecko brothers.

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.920
Sheriff McGraw would return for the director’s
Grindhouse movie Death Proof, where his daughter

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.680
Dakota is also introduced, linking Tarantino’s
“movies within movies” with a single family.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.530
Those are our picks for hidden clues to Tarantino’s
shared movie universe.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.080
Are there any we missed?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.940
