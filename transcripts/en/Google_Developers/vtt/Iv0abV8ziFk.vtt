MARTIN OMANDER: Hi, my
name is Martin Omander,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
and I welcome you to
the Root Access Show.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.354
Today, I'm joined by Waleed
Abdulla, founder of Ninua.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:16.020
Thanks for coming in
here today, Waleed.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.955
WALEED ABDULLA:
Thank you, Martin.

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:18.830
MARTIN OMANDER: Tell
us a bit about Ninua.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.685
What does your startup do?

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.340
WALEED ABDULLA: So
we have two products,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.020
Symphony at symphonytools.com.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.560
It's a social media
management dashboard

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.520
for businesses to publish
to multiple social networks

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.640
at the same time
and also to listen

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.890
to what their customers
say about them

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.380
on these social networks.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.000
And the second is
Network to Blogs,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.990
which is a platform for bloggers
to distribute and promote

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.960
their blogs and to network
with other bloggers.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.430
It has about 1.2
million bloggers on it.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.275
And it's active-- been
going on for a few years.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:00:58.480
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.290
So for a few years?

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.150
Had did Ninua get started?

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.750
WALEED ABDULLA: So Network to
Blog started in a hackathon.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.750
This was one of those events
where you go on Friday,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.640
build a product, and launch
it by the end of Sunday.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.630
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.510
WALEED ABDULLA: So
that's how it started.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.160
It was a side project.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.800
It was not planned
to be a startup.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.760
And then it kind
of grew over time

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.930
and started gaining
more traction.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.660
At some point, we were getting
a thousand bloggers signing up

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.220
every single day.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.130
We have a total of 4.2
million blogs on it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.070
and about 7 million users-- 1
million monthly active users.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.520
So somehow it just happened.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.332
It wasn't planned.

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:43.540
MARTIN OMANDER: That's great.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.360
The best things in life are
often the unexpected ones,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.380
right?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.270
So now you have this product
that attracts a lot of users

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.250
and you hadn't really
planned for it.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.545
What was your first
business model?

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.830
WALEED ABDULLA: So we
started with advertising

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.300
just like a lot of startups do.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.640
We put AdSense on it,
and then after a while,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.039
we started looking into other
options like other networks

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.960
and kind of experimented with
trying to sell ads directly.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.820
That didn't scale as
we wanted, though.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.500
We had millions of
page views, but we

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.150
didn't have tens of
millions of page views.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.770
So with a few millions
of page views,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.630
you can make good revenue.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.560
You can cover your costs
and maybe pay a salary.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.940
But to build a
business that scales,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.820
you need tens or hundreds
of millions of page views,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.240
and we did not have that.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.074
We worked a lot on trying
to increase engagement,

00:02:44.074 --> 00:02:45.490
but at the same
time, we also knew

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.380
that we were targeting
a niche of bloggers.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.370
So after a lot of
experiments, we

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.230
realized that
probably this will not

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.540
scale to hundreds of
millions of page views.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.210
So that's when we started
looking at other options.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.340
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah,
and getting enough money

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.290
for one salary is nice, but
not enough to build a business

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.425
and grow the business.

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:09.670
WALEED ABDULLA: Exactly.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.750
MARTIN OMANDER: So when
you hit that realization,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.550
it was time to rejigger
the business model.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.970
What did you do?

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.140
WALEED ABDULLA: So we tested
as well paid features.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.620
So the product is free, and we
added a few additional features

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.610
that you can pay for.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.920
It was a low dollar
level payment plans,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.790
like $5 per month
or $20 per month.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.280
And we experimented with that.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.970
It wasn't our focus.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.380
We were still focusing on
optimizing advertising.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.260
But that continued to grow
as well and at some point

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.950
was generating more
revenue than ads.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.670
Actually, it was
like 2 to 1 ratio.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.060
So finally we thought, OK, maybe
for our business it fits better

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.450
to monetize it with a paid
system rather than advertising.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.324
And then we decided
to focus on that.

00:04:04.324 --> 00:04:05.240
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.960
So now you have
the business model

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.220
of-- the ads are
still there, you

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.180
have the new model
that is the way

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.779
to go with paid
premium features.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.149
A decision to make here, right?

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.149
Did you create a new company?

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.600
Did you create a new
product or a new brand?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.950
What did you end up doing
and what was your thinking

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.380
going into this decision?

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.980
WALEED ABDULLA: Yeah.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.630
So it was the same team
and the same technology,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.500
so we kept the same company.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.990
But the new customer segment
was small businesses.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.290
And small businesses don't
identify as bloggers.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.450
And the name, Network
to Blog, lends itself

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.640
to a blogging related tool.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.320
So even if a
business has a blog,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.730
they think of themselves as
a business, not as a blogger.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.170
So we decided to go
with a different name,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.770
and that's how we
ended up with Symphony.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.190
We took the same source
code, then modified it,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.190
copied and modified it,
to launch a new product.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.100
We removed a lot of the features
that are specific to Network

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.050
to Blogs, to the social
aspects of Network to Blogs,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.770
and kept the features that
are more useful to businesses,

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.090
and then built on that.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.530
And then we ended up
with the new product.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.144
MARTIN OMANDER: So
that's interesting.

00:05:24.144 --> 00:05:25.560
Tell me a little
bit more of that.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.410
So you had this one product,
this one codebase, and then

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.930
you needed to have this
business-focused version.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.990
But you had the millions
of consumers as well.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.730
So you forked the codebase?

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.560
So what did you do?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.080
WALEED ABDULLA: Yes.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.579
Exactly.

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:43.700
So we forked the codebase,
we had a new code base,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.280
and made a lot of changes
of the second version of it

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.850
that became the new product.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.130
MARTIN OMANDER:
The business one?

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.338
WALEED ABDULLA: The Symphony.

00:05:50.338 --> 00:05:54.290
And then we continued to grow
both of them independently.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.920
There's a lot of overlap, but
from a user point of view,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.270
they're completely different.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.014
There are some common
features, but they

00:06:02.014 --> 00:06:03.180
are very different products.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.240
They look different,
they behave different,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.600
and they target different
segments of users.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.010
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, so you
can put new consumer features

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.560
into the consume
product over here,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.350
and new business features,
premium features, over here.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.530
Ah, I see.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.070
So with millions of users,
consumer bloggers or people

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.510
who identify as bloggers
rather than businesses,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:30.280
how did you plan for going
and hitting this new customer

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.495
segment-- the small businesses?

00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:36.810
WALEED ABDULLA: So we started
with our existing users, which

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.590
was the easiest thing to do.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.150
So we put links on
our Network to Blogs.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.280
We put the ads on
there that point people

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.010
to the new product, emailed some
of them, and started that way.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.200
And then over time, we started
learning about new ways

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.900
to reach this new
segment of users.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.487
And it's a new segment, so
there are different ways

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:00.070
to reach them.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.170
And we are learning
as we go every day,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.520
so it's still a
continuing journey.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.380
MARTIN OMANDER: Every day is
a learning experience, right,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.027
in a startup?

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.360
WALEED ABDULLA: Definitely true.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.290
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.470
Thank you so much for sharing
your experiences with us,

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.680
Waleed.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.700
WALEED ABDULLA:
Thank you, Martin.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.325
MARTIN OMANDER: Hope
you find something

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:18.980
useful for your startup in here.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.870
So please leave comments on the
show in the YouTube comments

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.390
section.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.940
We read everything you write.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.370
Also, if you're in a
startup, you should go

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.410

developers.google.com/startups

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.550
and see how Google
can help your startup.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.350
With that, thank you,
and see you next time.
