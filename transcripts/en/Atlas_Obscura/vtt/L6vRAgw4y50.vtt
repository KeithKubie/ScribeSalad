00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
A salsa bar in a Taco Time, in Dalles Oregon

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:07.967
is the site of the largest bio-terrorist attack in US history

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:10.667
and no this is not a joke

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:22.834
In 1970 in India a spiritual leader named Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh began a new movement 

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:28.100
 the philosophy of the Rajneeshee movement was an odd mix of capitalism, meditation 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.633
 and dirty and ethnic jokes

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:34.333
Nonetheless he managed to accumulate a large following

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.934
By the 1980s his movement had swelled to the tens of thousands

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:40.066
Rajneesh wanted to start his utopia

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.033
so with the help of this woman Ma Anand Sheela

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.166
they purchased 64,000 acres, a ranch in Oregon

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.800
and it was here that they began building their utopia

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:57.133
Some seven thousand followers moved onto this ranch property

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.734
the followers all wore red, they adhered to very strict schedules

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:07.967
meanwhile Ma Anand Sheela began calling herself Queen and carrying around a 357 Magnum

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:12.667
the Rajneeshees also began driving around town in a jeep

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.800
with a machine gun on the back of it

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.934
the plan was to overwhelm these towns by basically taking over their political systems

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:24.667
the Rajneeshees had already taken over a nearby town called Antelope

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.834
and renamed the town Rajneesh

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.867
so the huge influx of these red clad cultists

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:34.133
didn’t sit that well with the local conservative small towners in Oregon

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.967
the Rajneeshee movement needed ways to inflate their numbers

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:41.667
and essentially keep the locals away from the voting polls

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:46.667
what if everyone was too sick to actually go out and vote

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:51.433
In September of 1984 a woman stood at the Salsa Bar in Taco Time

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:55.166
holding a small bag of her own “homemade salsa”

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.433
she poured it across all of the condiments

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:03.133
and this started what was the largest bio-terrorist attack in US history

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:07.834
the group contaminated ten different fast food restaurants

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:10.200
with Salmonella over the course of two months

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.133
It made 757 people sick, it sent a couple dozen people to the hospital

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:20.400
had they gone with their initial plan of using typhoid fever

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.967
it would have been a massacre

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:26.734
when this finally was discovered it was found

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:31.734
that they had set up a fully fledged bio-terrorism lab on the compound

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:36.133
Ma Anand Sheela and her co-conspirator were given twenty years in prison

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:38.000
but ultimately only ended up serving two

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.467
And Rajneesh actually didn't serve a day in jail

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:45.934
the attack on the salsa bar at the Taco Time and nine other fast food restaurants

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:50.934
remains the largest bio-terrorist attack in US history

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:54.333
amazingly, that Taco Time is still open

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:57.000
we suggest you skip the Salsa Bar

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.433

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.266
Today there is still a plaque in the town of Antelope

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.367
It’s awesome it’s at the post office

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:07.934
And its like something out of a movie

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:12.200
like “To all those who stood against the Rajneeshee invasion" 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.233
What are some other wonders that I should know about?

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:15.266
What do you want to hear me talk about, what do you want to tell me about

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:19.734
what is the greatest place you have ever been?

00:03:19.734 --> 00:03:21.667
I want to know all of these things
