This episode of Dnews is brought to you by
BASF, THE chemical company.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.980
Still counting your calories?

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.530
That's so 2014.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:18.349
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with one of
the coolest inventions I've seen in a very

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.349
long time.

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.429
A company called Consumer Physics just Kickstarted
the Scio - which is a molecular scanner that

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.579
can scan physical objects and give you a breakdown
of their chemical makeup.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.390
It works by flashing a beam of infrared light
onto whatever material you're scanning, then

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.570
uses a built-in spectrometer to analyze the
light that gets reflected back.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.820
The spectrometer determines the absorption
rate of the material - which is different

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.610
for every object - and then cross-references
that against a database of materials, to figure

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.610
out it is.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.010
It then sends that data back to your smartphone
over Bluetooth LE.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.260
So for food, you would scan an item, enter
the approximate weight of what you're about

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.920
to eat, and within seconds, you get a neat
little breakdown of the calories, fats, carbs,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.280
and proteins in it.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.759
Amazingly, it can also gauge the quality of
the food you're eating - so things like produce

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.229
quality, ripeness, and spoilage in foods like
cheese, fruits &amp; vegetables, sauces, salad

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.229
dressings, etc.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.289
But it's not just for food!

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.090
It also works on plants and medications.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.710
For plants, it can analyze the moisture levels
and tell you when you need to water them.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.889
And for drugs - the example they give, is
that if you were to order medication online,

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:29.340
from say another country - you could scan
it, to make sure it's legit.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.329
Over time, the goal is to expand Scio to cover
just about any physical object - cosmetics,

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.590
clothes, jewels, plastics - even human tissue
and bodily fluids.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.039
One day, its creators hope to see the technology
built straight into smartphones - which would

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.170
be amazing.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.590
When it ships, the Scio will cost $149.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.640
And they've already quintupled their Kickstarter
goal of $200K, with several weeks left to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640
go.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.170
So if you wanna back it, head over to their
Kickstarter by June 15th.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.979
And hey - speaking of great inventions, Discovery
Digital and BASF are teaming up once again

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.049
- to encourage kids to use their imagination
and demonstrate their knowledge of all things

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.049
science.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.690
Children in grades K-8 are asked to submit
a 2-4 minute video about an educational and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.110
creative science experiment related to chemistry,
sustainability innovation, technology, or

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.110
energy.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.950
One Grand Prize winner will receive a $10,000
college scholarship, along with an iPad and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.170
a Stuff To Blow Your Mind prize pack.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.860
To enter, just submit your video to stufftoblowyourmind.com/science-awards
by May 23rd.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.890
The winner will be announced June 6th, and
the winning video will be featured on StuffToBlowYourMind.com.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.290
So get your submissions in!

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.280
