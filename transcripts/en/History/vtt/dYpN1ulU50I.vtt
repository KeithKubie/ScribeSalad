00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.040
NARRATOR: On September 6, 1901
President

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.210
William McKinley was shot.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.710
Eight days later, he died.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.290
Teddy Roosevelt became president
and the first president

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.290
to have around the clock
Secret Service protection.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.670
But why did it take
Congress 25 presidencies

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.210
and three assassinations
to make that happen?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.040
To answer that,
we have to go back

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.750
to the end of the
Civil War when America

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.380
had some real money problems.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.750
By 1865, up to one half of
American money in circulation

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.250
was fake.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.080
So on April 14, 1865,
President Abraham Lincoln

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.540
authorized the creation
of a government agency

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.330
to fight counterfeiting.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.040
He called it the Secret Service.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.250
Later that night, Lincoln
would be assassinated.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.580
But that wasn't enough to
convince Congress to give

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.580
the president his own police.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.330
And it wasn't enough, in
1881, when President James

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.710
A. Garfield was assassinated.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.460
Because, for the most
part, Congress feared

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.120
centralized power
more than they feared

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.790
for the president's life.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.750
Congress had hesitated to create
a national law enforcement

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.790
agency, preferring to leave
matters of law and order

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.920
to the individual states.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.120
But toward the end
of the 19th century,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.380
these attitudes began
to change as America

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.210
grew into an economic and
imperialist powerhouse.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.210
McKinley's presidency,
in particular,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.620
was marked by unparalleled
industrial and territorial

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.380
expansion.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.790
But as America grew
in size and power, so,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.290
too, did the threats against it.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.290
Anarchists who advocated
for stateless societies

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.920
had been staging attacks
against powerful governments

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.000
across the world
since the 1870s,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.920
including one that
sparked Chicago's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.790
Haymarket Riot in 1886.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.330
Leaders at the
national level grew

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.790
more concerned about
the president's safety,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.170
fearing he may be a target.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.790
So the Secret Service stepped
in to unofficially protect

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.920
the president, when needed.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.750
When President McKinley attended
the Pan American Exposition

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.830
in Buffalo in
September of 1901, he

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.580
had a fair amount of security,
18 exposition guards,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.500
seven soldiers provided by
the 73rd Seacoast Artillery,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.080
and three Secret Service agents.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.620
McKinley, though, like many
presidents before and after,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.960
found protection
mostly annoying,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.380
believing it got in between
the president and the people.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.170
So when Americans lined up
to shake hands with McKinley

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.460
on September 6, he nixed the
standard two guards next to him

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.710
in exchange for his
secretary and the president

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.460
of the Exposition.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.210
That was a big mistake, because
in line to meet the president

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.210
that day was a lone
anarchist who may have also

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.170
suffered from mental illness.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.540
When his turn came to
shake hands with McKinley,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.380
he instead drew a gun hidden
beneath his handkerchief

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.540
and shot the president twice,
point blank in the stomach.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.460
[music playing]

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.210
[camera flashes]

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.540
His name was Leon Czolgosz.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.120
And that's important.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.460
Because while he was a
natural born American citizen,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.710
Leon Czolgosz didn't quite
have the same Anglo-Saxon ring

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.250
as John Wilkes Booth.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.080
And this foreign-looking
name added to the perception

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.830
that anarchism was coming into
America through foreigners,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.080
leading to the passage of the
1903 Immigration Act, which

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.540
allowed anyone
associated with anarchism

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.710
to be barred or expelled.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.250
It became the first federal
law since the 1798 Alien

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.580
and Sedition Acts,
authorizing deportation

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.170
and exclusion based on a
person's ideological beliefs

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.330
and associations.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.170
McKinley's death also
confirmed the real fear

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.040
that US presidents
would be targeted

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.250
for political assassinations,
spurring the expansion

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.460
of the Secret Service to
officially include protecting

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.460
our nation's leaders, which was
a smart move because as America

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.040
rose in power through the
20th century, so, too,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.290
would the number of threads
against its presidents.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.540
