00:00:00.382 --> 00:00:04.561
To get a better understanding of quantitative easing

00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.009
in the American context, especially the context

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.077
that Ben Bernanke is talking about,

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:11.353
I want to read this quote from a speech that

00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:13.587
Ben Bernanke gave at the London School of Economics

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:17.138
on January 13th, 2009. So this is shortly

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:19.869
after a lot of the craziness of the financial crisis

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.758
was happening but it was still going on.

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:25.893
And he's saying, "Our approach, which could be described as

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:30.560
'credit easing' -- resembles quantitative easing in one respect."

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.493
He's saying it's not quite quantitative easing,

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:33.935
although it really is.

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:40.329
"It involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet."

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.045
So just to understand what he's talking about,

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.943
the central bank, it has liabilities and assets,

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:46.554
like any corporation, and they have to,

00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:52.311
the liabilities, plus the equity has to match up to the assets.

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:56.146
Just for simplicity, let's just have the assets and the liabilies

00:00:56.146 --> 00:01:00.276
lining up together. So let's say that this is the central bank's

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.394
balance sheet right over here.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:05.627
This is their current assets, and let's say

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:07.676
that is is their liabilities over here,

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:10.341
so liabilities, and then this is their equity,

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.548
although the federal reserve's equity is a little bit strange,

00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:17.117
it's not like traditional equity, that they get all the

00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:19.059
excess profits and all of that, all the excess

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:21.632
profits actually go to the US government.

00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:25.887
But when the fed prints money, what they literally do

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:29.477
is that they create offsetting liabilities and assets

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:31.991
So when they print money they'll, so literally

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.636
let's say that they're printing some money right over here,

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.473
so that's money that they're printing,

00:01:36.473 --> 00:01:39.318
so this is literally, it would be federal reserve notes

00:01:39.318 --> 00:01:42.411
being created, so these are notes, which are essentially dollar bills.

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:46.749
So these are dollar bills right here being printed,

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.122
either physically or electronically.

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:51.326
And then they have an offsetting liability

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:53.644
which is just notes outstanding, which is literally saying

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:56.477
that hey, these are notes that we've created.

00:01:56.477 --> 00:02:02.289
Notes outstanding is the other side of the balance sheet.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.215
So, just to parse the statement, when he says, "credit easing

00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:08.876
resembles quantitative easing in one respect

00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:11.727
it involves an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet."

00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:15.193
So this is the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet.

00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:18.911
Which is essentially the same thing as printing money.

00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:21.193
And the federal bank will get these notes into

00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:23.676
circulation by going out into the market

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.944
and buying assets.

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:28.900
Traditionally, when the fed is more focused on

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.327
short-term interest rates,

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:32.594
on overnight borrowing rates between banks,

00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:35.509
it will use these to buy shorter-term debt

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.876
that increases the amount of currency out there

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:40.410
the amount of dollars out there, and so it will

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.894
lower the interest rate for people buying

00:02:42.894 --> 00:02:44.249
and selling dollars, or I should say

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.041
borrowing and lending dollars, not buying and selling.

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.758
Borrowing and lending dollars, the overnight rate

00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:51.658
for banks will go down because there's more dollars out there,

00:02:51.658 --> 00:02:53.669
the cost of borrowing them will go down.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.277
That's normally what the fed is concerned about.

00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:58.826
And they're saying, look, quantitative easing is just

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:01.631
this idea of expanding that balance sheet.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.971
Let's keep reading:

00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:06.069
"However, in a pure quantitative easing regime,

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.326
the focus of quality is the quantity of bank reserves,

00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:12.815
which are liabilities of the central bank;

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:15.684
the composition of loans and securities on the asset side

00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:18.888
of the central bank's balance sheet is incidential."

00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:20.935
So he's saying in traditional quantitative easing,

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:25.147
the central bank says look, I just care about printing money

00:03:25.147 --> 00:03:28.543
I just care about printing money,

00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:32.066
So their liabilities increase accordingly.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:36.810
So this is notes outstanding again,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.426
And the height here is proportional to how much money

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:41.317
they print, so maybe this is another trillion

00:03:41.317 --> 00:03:42.793
dollars they're printing.

00:03:42.793 --> 00:03:45.355
But what the federal reserve is saying, in traditional

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:46.155
quantitative easing, all the central bank cares about

00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:49.739
is printing this money and getting it out there

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.707
into circulation, and they don't really care

00:03:51.707 --> 00:03:55.543
what they're using this money for.

00:03:55.543 --> 00:03:57.360
So whenever they get this money into circulation

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.486
they do go out there and they do buy assets

00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:01.009
usually treasury assets,

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.918
and then they say even, "Indeed, although the

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:06.262
bank of Japan's policy," -- so he's comparing

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:10.010
relative to what Japan did when they kind of faced deflationary crisis.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.555
"Indeed, although the bank of Japan's policy approach

00:04:13.555 --> 00:04:17.166
during the quantitative easing period was quite

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:20.322
multifaceted, the overall stance of its policy

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:26.009
was gauged primarily in terms of its target for bank reserves."

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.626
So you're saying look, the Japanese were trying to fight

00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:32.375
a deflationary bank crisis, they kept printing money

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:36.240
so they kept increasing the liability side of their

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.136
balance sheet, they kept printing money

00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:40.571
and they did use this money for a bunch of stuff,

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.980
they did use that money to go buy a bunch

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.656
of assets, but their focus of their intervention

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:49.023
was just, how much did they print?

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:50.306
They didn't really care, they didn't really

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:52.633
engineer where that money went to.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.810
They really weren't trying to change what happens

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.276
in the markets that they were participating in.

00:04:58.276 --> 00:04:59.919
Let's keep reading what the fed is saying.

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.940
"In contrast, the Federal Reserve's credit easing

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.180
approach focuses on the mix of loans and securities

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.689
that it holds and on how this composition of assets

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.725
affects credit conditions for households and businesses."

00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:17.688
So what he's saying is that, we are mechanically

00:05:17.688 --> 00:05:19.602
doing the same thing that Japan did,

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:24.185
we're increasing our balance sheet, which is analogous to printing money

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:27.009
And we are also buying a bunch of stuff,

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.276
just like Japan did,

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:30.144
Japan had a multifaceted approach,

00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:32.397
that's how they put the money into circulation,

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:34.948
but what Bernanke is saying

00:05:34.948 --> 00:05:37.561
is that our approach isn't just focused on the amount

00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.745
of cash that we are printing, our focus is

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:42.426
where are we putting that cash toward,

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:45.857
how can we use this cash that we printed

00:05:45.857 --> 00:05:50.576
to kind of, provide liquidity, to ease up things

00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:52.560
in certain parts of the economy. To understand

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.320
what he's talking about, let me draw

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.855
a yield curve right over here.

00:05:56.855 --> 00:06:00.676
Let me draw this yield curve right over here,

00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:06.609
so this is maturity on the horizontal axis,

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:09.309
and this is yield,

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:11.588
and I'm gonna draw the yield curve for treasuries.

00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:14.875
So let's say the short-term overnight borrowing for,

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.547
let's say, let's do the yield curve for treasuries,

00:06:17.547 --> 00:06:20.210
maybe it looks something like this.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.862
So short-term interest rates are already

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:26.909
pretty darn close to zero, and maybe you know

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.737
this is some, I don't know what percentage,

00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:32.241
maybe this is like 4% or something.

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.977
It's not accurate, but just gives you an idea.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:37.876
So this is the treasury yield curve.

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:41.709
Now you could also have a yield curve for other types of

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.171
debt. Maybe you have AAA corporate debt,

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.946
a very safe corporate debt, a perceived safe corporate debt,

00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:49.744
but it's not quite as safe as US treasuries,

00:06:49.744 --> 00:06:56.269
so maybe it's yield curve might look something like this

00:06:56.346 --> 00:06:59.829
and this difference, for any maturities,

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:01.545
maybe this is a 10 year,

00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:03.373
this is 10 year debt right here.

00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:08.501
This difference between this AAA corporate debt

00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:11.977
and the treasury, that is the yield spread.

00:07:11.977 --> 00:07:16.019
And maybe the fed is able to, through intervention,

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.098
first they're able to print money,

00:07:18.098 --> 00:07:20.127
normally they buy shorter-term debt,

00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:24.369
maybe they start buying longer-term treasury debt,

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:26.209
and maybe that helps get the yield curve,

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.110
for longer-term treasuries down a little bit.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.780
Helps bring it down.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.042
But maybe the AAA corporate debts

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:34.937
don't react, maybe the spread doesn't stay constant

00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:39.492
maybe the spread widens. Maybe the same thing

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:42.372
for other types of debt. This is highly rated

00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:44.924
mortgage backed securities, maybe they have a

00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:47.176
slightly higher interest rate.

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:49.493
And once again, even though the treasury interest rates

00:07:49.493 --> 00:07:51.203
are coming down, while they're intervening

00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.447
because of all the craziness that is happening in the economy,

00:07:53.447 --> 00:07:58.857
the spread between treasuries, and AAA mortgage

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:01.502
backed securities, or the spread between treasuries

00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:03.078
and AAA corporate debt

00:08:03.078 --> 00:08:05.164
that widens, or another way to think about it

00:08:05.164 --> 00:08:07.199
is the treasury interest rates are coming down

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.136
while these things aren't following it,

00:08:09.136 --> 00:08:11.936
so what Ben Bernanke is saying, look we are doing

00:08:11.936 --> 00:08:14.394
quantitative easing, we are printing money

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:16.698
and we are using that money to go buy things in the economy

00:08:16.698 --> 00:08:18.181
and we're increasing the amount

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:20.136
of cash that there is in the economy,

00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:22.399
but our point isn't to increase the amount

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:23.743
of reserves, or increase the amount of cash,

00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:25.994
because it's really not changing the behavior

00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:28.129
of banks. What we are going to do is

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:32.529
go buy things like highly rated mortgage backed securities,

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:37.336
or things like commercial paper, AAA corporate debt,

00:08:37.336 --> 00:08:41.719
so that those things, the interest on those things

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:44.371
goes down. Obviously if someone is willing to pay more

00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:46.493
for a certain amount of debt,

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:48.387
and I've gone over this in another video,

00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:49.737
maybe it's not so obvious,

00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:53.536
then the interest rates on it will go down.

00:08:53.536 --> 00:08:55.870
And so what they're doing is, what Bernanke is saying,

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.631
is he cares more about what winds up on the

00:08:58.631 --> 00:09:00.320
asset side of the Fed's balance sheet,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.936
because it takes these dollars that it printed,

00:09:01.936 --> 00:09:03.276
and goes and buys other stuff,

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.687
and it wants to put some mortgage backed securities

00:09:05.687 --> 00:09:08.586
over here, it wants to put some AAA corporate debt

00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:12.328
over here. And maybe it also does some longer term

00:09:12.328 --> 99:59:59.999
treasury securities, or whatever else.
