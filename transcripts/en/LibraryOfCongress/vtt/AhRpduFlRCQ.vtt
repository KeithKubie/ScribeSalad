00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.833
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.380


00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.713
Hi. One person is saying
hi back so I feel

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.780
like I'm getting people's attention.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.620
That's good.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.020
I'm Mary Quattlebaum.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.153
I'm a regular reviewer.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.020
[Sound effects] Somebody's
actually clapping for me.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.883
[Laughter] I'm a regular reviewer
of middle grade and teen fiction

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.276
for the Washington Post Book
World and I'm just here today.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.943
Yes, let's all cheer
for the Washington Post.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.650
Thank you, just to welcome you
to the National Book Festival.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.926
The Washington Post is a
charter sponsor of the festival

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.350
and it has been an enthusiastic
supporter for all 10 years

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.336
of the festival's existence.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.070
So think about, 10 years

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.440
and the book festival just keeps
getting more and more exciting.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.816
On author here today
who helps ratchet

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.496
up that excitement is Jane Smiley.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.950
[Sound effects] Yeah!

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.816
Jane is that rare author
who can write wonderfully

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.160
for both adults and young people.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.690
In fact, she's presenting
later today

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.943
in the poetry and pros pavilion.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.420
We know her of course, as the author
of many acclaimed novels for adults.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.056
These include, A Thousand Acres,
which won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.253
Other titles, The Greenlanders,
Horse Heaven and most recently,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.940
Private Life, but last year
Jane Published her first novel

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.430
for young people, The
George's and the Jewels.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.163
In a star review publishers weekly
called it a lyrical medication.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
The Chicago Sun Times
praised Jane's intricate

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
and sophisticated knowledge
of horses, horses.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.896
Bingo. That's what has made
this novel really stand out.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.386
And I was a huge reader
of horse book,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.610
all Marguerite Henry's horse
books when I was a kid.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.730
The horses in the George's and the
Jewels are as believable and flawed

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.426
and endearing as the humans.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.580
There's Abby Lovitt, who's the
main character who is 7th grader.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.876
But who can forget honoree George,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.970
the trouble-making
gelding that she trains.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.776
You can't fake the horse stuff.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.090
Kids know that.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.290
And Jane Smiley is the real deal.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.853
So Jane has a new book coming out
very soon called The Good Horse.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.703
Before Jane comes on stage I want to
tell you that there are two reasons

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.023
to give her a big welcome.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.266
She's a wonderful writer, of course,
but also tomorrow is her birthday!

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.390
So I'm going to count to three

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.926
and everybody here can just
say a big Happy Birthday!

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.660
One, two, three, Happy
Birthday Jane.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.860
[Sound effects] So welcome.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.060
[Applause]

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.660
&gt;&gt; Jane Smiley: Well
thank you for that.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.043
I have to say in my house
tomorrow is the beginning

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.796
of the birthday season and all
the kids birthdays are coming very

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.900
soon too.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.633
Since I'm first I get
a little overlooked.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.933
The one who comes last, you
know she gets parties for weeks.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.430
This is the cover of The
George's and The Jewels.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.753
The Good Horse will be
out in about three weeks.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.843
All the series concerns Abby.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.006
The books take place in the mid
1960's when I happened to be a girl.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.580
I am not Abby.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.713
Abby is the girl I wish
had been my best friend.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.716
But I didn't know her.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.840


00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.143
Abby works hard for a living.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.343
Her father and mother have come
from Oklahoma some years before

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.773
and they are in the horse business.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.973
They are in the import/export
business.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.616
They go back to Oklahoma, they find
inexpensive horses, they bring them

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.196
to California and they
retrain them and sell them.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.630
And dad's -- well you'll
find out in the first page.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.886
But anyway there's
lots of horses in here

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.553
and that's what I would have wanted

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.353
when I was a girl is just an
onslaught of horses to read about.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.536
So I have fulfilled my own
fondest desires and I'm going

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.633
to start at the beginning.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.326
Chapter One: sometimes when you fall
off your horse you just don't want

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.050
to get back on.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.246
Let's say he started bucking and you
did all the things you knew to do,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.933
like pull his head up from between
his knees and make him go forward.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.413
Then use a pulley reign
on the left to stop him.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.943
Most horses would settle at that
point and come down to a walk.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.890
Then you could turn
him again and trot off.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.856
It's always harder to buck
at the trot then at the lope.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.443
But, if right when you let up on
reigns your horse put his head

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.706
between his knees again and took off
bucking, kicking higher and higher

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.793
until he finally dropped you and
went tearing off to the other end

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.946
of the ring, well you
might lie there as I did,

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.930
with the wind knocked out of you and
think about how nice it would be not

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.330
to get back on, because
that horse is just dedicated

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.526
to bucking you off.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.560
So I did lie there looking
up at the oak branches

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.800
that grew beside the ring and I
did wait for daddy to come trotting

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.086
over with that horse by
the bridle and I did stare

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.553
up at both of their faces.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.660
The face of that horse
flicking his ears back and forth

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.906
and snorting a little bit, and
the face of my father, red cheeked

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.700
and blue-eyed and I did listen
to him say, "Abby you okay honey?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880
Sure you are.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.013
I saw you bounce.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.880
Get up now."

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.213
[Laughter] I sighed.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.663
"How am I going to tell those folks
that are looking to buy these horses

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.363
that a little girl can ride them,
if you don't get up and ride them?"

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.146
I sat up. I said, "I
don't know daddy.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.836
My elbow hurts but not too badly."

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.340
Otherwise I was okay.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.723
Well then some horses buck you off.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.373
Some horses spook you off.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.330
They see something scary and drop
a shoulder and spin and run away.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.356
Some horses stop all of
sudden and there you are head

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.826
over heels, sitting on the ground.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.663
I had a horse, we were so high once,
that I just slid down over her tail

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.850
and landed in the grass
easy as you please,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.236
watching her run down to the barn.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.226
I started riding when I was three.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.083
I started training horses
for my dad when I was eight.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.736
I wasn't the only one.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.603
My brother Danny was 13 at the
time and he did most of the riding.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.953
Kids horse for sale.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.783
But I'm the only one
now, which is not to say

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:05.273
that there aren't good
horses and fun horses.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.360
I ride plenty of those too,
because daddy turns those over fast.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.073
I had one a year ago,
a sweet bay mare.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:18.310
We got her because her owner
had died and daddy picked her

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.776
up for a song from the bank.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.790
I rode her every day and
she never put a foot wrong.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.986
Her lope was as easy as flying.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.313
One the days she was with
us I had a 24-hour virus.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.206
So I went out to ride I tacked her
up and took her down to the creek

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.593
at the bottom of the pasture
out of sight from the house.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.176
I knew daddy was about
to go into town

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.290
and would be gone for the afternoon.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.093
So when I got down there I just
took off the saddle and hung it

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.100
over a tree limb and the bridle too.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.223
And I laid down on the
grass and fell asleep.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.136
I knew she would graze for a
while, and she did, I suppose.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.190
But when I woke up, and
feeling much better, thank you,

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.130
there she was curled up
next to me like a dog,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.153
but sweet and large and soft.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.530
I laid there feeling how warm she
was and smelling her fragrance

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.640
and I thought, "I never
heard of this before."

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.930
I don't know why she did that.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.040
But now when daddy tells me that
horses only know two things,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.103
the carrot and the stick, and not
to fill my head with silly ideas

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.856
about them, I just
remember that mare.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:37.380
She had a star shaped like
a triangle and a little snip

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.826
down by her left nostril.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.000
We sold her for a niece piece
of change within a month.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.453
And I wish I knew where she was.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.433
But daddy names all the mares
Jewel and all the Geldings George

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.776
and I can hardly remember
which was which after a while.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.943
The particular George who
bucked me off had a hard mouth.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:04.930
I did the best I could with him for
another 20 minutes, but daddy said

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.303
that probably he was going to
have to get on him himself,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.060
which meant that we weren't
going to turn this one over fast,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.546
because a little girl couldn't ride
him yet, which meant that daddy was

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.156
in a bad mood for the
rest of the day.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:23.936
We took the George back to the barn
while daddy through out the hay.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.316
I brushed the George off.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:29.760
He didn't mind but he didn't
love it like some of them do.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.630
Then I picked out his feet
and took him out and put him

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.636
into one of the big corrals.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.880
We didn't keep horses in stalls
unless we had to because daddy said

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.430
that they did better outside anyway
and if you kept them in stalls,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:45.906
well then you spent your life
cleaning stalls rather than riding.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.433
Was that what I wanted?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.640
I always said, "No daddy"
and he ruffled my hair.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.290
In the winter though, it bothered
me to think of them huddled

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.650
out in the rain, their tails into
the wind and their heads down.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.593
Of course that's what
horses were meant to do

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.166
and ours had heavy coats.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.900
But I would like awake
when it rained

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.900
in the night, wishing
for it to stop.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.326
It was worse in Oklahoma.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:18.896
Oklahoma was where we came from
where daddy and mom grew up

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.683
and had Danny and then me.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.010
We moved to California in 1957
when I was four and I half.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.770
I could barely remember
living there,

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:31.926
though we went back once a year

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:33.930
to see my grandparents
and buy some horses.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.790
In Oklahoma there could be real
rain and real snow and real ice.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.020
Daddy had seen a horse slide
right down a hill once,

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.870
just couldn't stop himself.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.536
Went down like he was on skis
and over the edge of a creek,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.870
fell on the ice and had to be pulled

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.936
out with a tractor;
couldn't be saved.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.750
At least in California
we didn't have the ice.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.786
It was only five when I got into
the house, not even supper time.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.393
But it was January
and days were short.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:10.680
Christmas was over and school
would start again on Monday,

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.780
which meant I could ride two
horses in the afternoon at most.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.220
Now that my shoulder and my arm
were starting to hurt from my fall,

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.506
I didn't mind a break
from the riding.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.186
It was just that I was sorry to be
going back to school; seventh grade.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.036
I have never heard anyone
who had a single nice thing

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.830
to say about seventh grade.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.410


00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.953
But you know that turns out not
to be true because my daughter,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.553
who's here, had a good
time in seventh grade.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.403
So she's a strange one.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.870


00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.530
The next day was church.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.626
We went to church twice on Sundays
from 9:00 to 12:00 in the morning

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.166
and from 2:00 to 4:00
in the afternoon

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.500
and also Wednesday evening.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.623
Daddy was an elder in the
church and the place we'd found

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.036
that we called our chapel was really
just a big room in a strip mall

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.290
with a cleaners on one side and
a Longs Drug Store on the other.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.033
Daddy and Mr. Hazen were
looking for another place,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.400
maybe a church that was for sale.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.753
You'd be surprised at how
many churches get sold

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.240
when the congregation
decides it needs more room.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.090
But they hadn't found
one yet, so between noon

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:28.270
and two we kids wondered around
that strip mall and went into Longs

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.250
and looked at the comic books
until we got caught or the toys

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.123
or the makeup or the medical
supplies, whatever there was

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.723
that might be interesting.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:41.710
Sometimes daddy drove me
home to check on the horses

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.030
and sometimes he went by himself.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.196
Mom always offered but daddy
said she had enough to do setting

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.953
up the lunch for the
brothers and sisters.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.243
The brothers and sisters
were mostly fairly old,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.736
older than daddy and Mom.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.063
Only three families had kids.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.163
Us and the Hollingsworth's
and the Greeley's.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.750
We had me; the Hollingsworth's
had Carley, Erica and Bobby

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.296
who were all younger
than Danny and I.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.440
The Greeley kids were
four, two and one.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.393
Sometimes on a really unlucky
day Carley Hollingsworth

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.553
and I would be told
to watch the Greeley's

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.006
and then our hands were full

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.340
because those Greeley's,
even the baby could run.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.950
What mom said if I made a face
was, "Sally and Sam need a break,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.923
so you can do your share."

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.230
The only thing I like about
church, though I didn't say

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.096
to this daddy and mom
was the singing.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.276
To tell the truth I never knew
what songs were really hymns

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.083
because daddy, mom, Mrs.
Greeley and Mr. Hazen were ready

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.670
to sing anything and some Sundays
we would sing for an hour at a time,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.196
more like a song fest
than a church service.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.310
On those days daddy
always came home happy.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.446
We sang Further Along, When the Road
is Called Up Yonder I'll be There,

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.873
Abide with Me and Amazing Grace.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.103
We didn't have hymnals.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:10.863
Daddy said we might
get those next year

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.156
but someone always knew the words
anyway and would teach the others.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:17.330
It wasn't right that
the singing would push

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:19.420
into the preaching of the gospel.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.973
But sometimes it did
and I didn't mind.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.016
On the days when there
was more preaching

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.550
and less singing daddy
came home in a worse mood.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.780


00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.596
That Sunday after I fell off
I was still a little stiff.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.330
So rather than wander around
Longs I stayed with mom

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.570
and helped her serve the food.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.606
She had macaroni and cheese, baked
beans, some broccoli and carrots,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.686
a loaf of bread and
a wedge of cheese.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.406
For dessert Mrs. Greeley
had made an applesauce cake,

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.540
which I liked very much.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.940
The younger women always made
a lot of food because mom said,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.533
"For some of the old people this was
the biggest meal they got all week.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.760
You know you're going home
to a nice supper Abby,

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.020
so you watch what you eat, because
Mrs. Larkin doesn't have that

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.973
and neither does Mrs. Lodge."

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.420
I watched what I ate,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.486
but I especially watched myself eat
a piece of that applesauce cake.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.306
The second service was
more like Sunday school.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.053
The grownups went to one side of
the room and studied the bible

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.910
and the kids went to another
side of the room and did things,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.010
like read bible stories and
color bible coloring books.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:36.896
There was also a felt board that
Mrs. Larkin sometimes brought

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.776
on which she did felt shows.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.246
There would be a cutout of
Joseph say made of white felt

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.666
and then a bunch of cutouts of his
brothers and some felt palm trees

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.346
that represented Egypt and felt
house that represented Israel.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.426
She moved the felt pieces around
on the board while telling us

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.920
the story.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.830
I think she had pieces for six
or eight different stories.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.810
For the most part everyone
at church was nice.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.353
This was not true of seventh grade.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000


00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:12.223
Monday morning I got on the bus.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.223
Because we had horses to feed

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.933
and water before school I was
always the last person on the bus

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.716
and fairly often the driver had
stop after he had already started

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.596
and open the door again for me.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.886
The impossible thing was deciding
whether to get dressed first

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.463
and then do the work or
get dressed, do the work

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.150
and change again before
going to school.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:36.490
I slept in even a little, I
could not get dressed twice

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.006
and so my shoes would be a little
dirty when I got on the bus.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.186
Sometimes the other kids started
yelling, "Hey what's that smell?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.200
Hey, what smells so bad in here?"

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.816
And sometimes they didn't but
I always expected them to.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.416
I didn't have any friends
on the bus so I tried

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.066
to read a book or look
out the window.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.590
The best thing that can happen
to you in seventh grade really is

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.953
that you float from one
classroom to another like a ghost

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.920
or a spirit undetected
by the humans.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.383
I thought maybe it would be
possible to do that at one

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.370
of those big schools in a big
town, but our school was small.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:18.760
The seventh grade had
forty kids divided

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.486
into two classes and
everyone had a slot.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.346
My homeroom teacher was Mr.
Jebson, the math teacher.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.896
It did not help that
numbers made my head hurt.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:32.603
If I could sit by myself
at night and work

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.316
out my problems I almost
always got them right,

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:42.056
but Mr. Jebson was the kind of
teacher who likes to interrupt,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.896
so..."Abby what's the
square root of 64."

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.006
And then just when you're opening
your mouth to say 8 he says,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.630
"Cat got your tongue today?

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.030
Are you thinking?"

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.040
And then when you open your
mouth again he says, "Well,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.220
what's the square root of 16?"

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.780
And now you're in this rhythm.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.083
Every time you have the answer,
he asks you another question

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.476
until he gives up on you and
finally he says, "Billy Russell."

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.953
And of course, Bill
Russell's been sitting there

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.576
for five minutes thinking about
the answer and he pipes up,

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.223
"eight" as bright as he can be
and Mr. Jebson says, "Good boy."

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.306
Or if you happen to look out the
window as soon as your eyes went

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.790
in that direction Mr. Jebson would
say, "Abby is the great outdoors

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.583
that much more fascinating
then this classroom?"

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.496
And of course you couldn't
say, "Yes."

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.303
You had to keep your mouth shut.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.540
Most of the other kids
seemed to like Mr. Jebson,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:45.773
at least they laughed
at all of his jokes.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.800
Even so, I had a B in math,
A on homework and tests,

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.246
C on class participation and
that was good enough for daddy

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.923
who didn't expect me to be
going to college anyway.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.196
[Applause] Have you guys
been asking questions?

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.023
I doubt it right.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.233
Oh great, that's my favorite thing.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.900
So has anybody got a question?

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.796
[Background sound effects]
Time is running out.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.916
Yes, over there.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.516
This girl has a question.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.240
&gt;&gt; What inspired you
to write this book?

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.070
&gt;&gt; Jane Smiley: What inspired me
was that I have a lot of horses

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.543
and the thing I've
notice about them is

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:43.030
that they are completely
different from one another.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.743
And they not only seem to think
differently from one another

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.876
but their bodies are different.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.413
They are constructed differently
and they can do different things.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.540
And one of the things
that my horsy friends

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.236
and I do all the time is
talk about the personalities

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.903
and characters of our horses.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.686
And so when I was a child
and I loved horse books.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.146
That was the thing I
loved about the horses.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.680
It was like having horses
except they were in books.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.706
And so that's what inspired me.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.453
All the horses that I knew
just had to be in books.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.600
They were way too interesting
not to be in books.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.910
&gt;&gt; Well thank you.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.243
&gt;&gt;Jane Smiley: Let me say
one thing about this series.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.096
You may remember, some of you
older people may remember movies

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.976
like My Friend Flicka where a horse
is trained by the cowboy getting

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.433
on him or her and the horse
bucks until he's exhausted

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.900
and he starts doing what the
cowboy wants him or her to do

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.666
and that's being trained.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.023
Around where I live in the
Monterey Peninsula in California,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.480
in the 1960's there emerged
another way of training horses

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.720
that has become the
dominant way now.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:06.153
And some people call it
natural horsemanship.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.473
And the person who originated it
was a man named Tom Dorence who came

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.446
from a ranching family but
he was rather a small man.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.910
And he didn't want to try
to dominant the horses.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:27.086
So what he did was he watched
horses interact among themselves

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.973
and he watched how
they told each other

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.883
who was the boss and
how to come along.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.150
And then he used his own body in
those ways and the horses woke up.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.143
And we realized hundreds
of new things about horses

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.056
and how their minds work
and that they have minds.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.503
And that they can be
interested in and do things

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.010
because those things are a pleasure.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.896
So one of the things I wanted
to in these books was to show

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:03.206
that transition from the old and
what I would consider cruel ways

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.946
of training horses to the modern
and much more accommodating ways

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:08.596
of thinking about and
training horses.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:11.800
So there's a character in
here named Gem Jarrell.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.660
He is based on Tom Dorence
and he is probably one

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.943
of my favorite characters in the
book, so one question for you.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.410
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite book
that you have not written?

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.070
&gt;&gt; Jane Smiley: That
I have not written?

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.463
What's my favorite book
that I have not written?

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.293
You mean by another author
or that I'm going to write?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.300
&gt;&gt; By another author.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.126
&gt;&gt; Jane Smiley: Well you know I've
gotten to the point in my life

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.650
that I have lots and lots of
favorite books because I don't feel

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.630
that they're terribly comparable.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.116
But when I was -- how old are you?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.573
&gt;&gt; I'm nearly 11.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.346
&gt;&gt; Jane Smiley: Okay so when I was
11 my favorite book was a horse book

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.266
and it was called Silver Birch.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.426
And it was about that amazing
thing that always happens.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.830
A little girl wants a horse and
there happens to be a horse running

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.750
in the forests around the
farm and nobody owns it

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.223
and it's really beautiful.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.756
[Laughter] And so she
goes out and tames it.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:13.643
So I thought boy this is
absolute social realism

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.096
and where is my horse?

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.076
[Laughter] And that
was my favorite book.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.840
But my second favorite was the
Hound and the Baskervilles,

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.526
which is sort of about
the same thing except

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.306
that the same running
around was the dog.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.173
[Laughter] Two minutes.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640
Yes?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.706
&gt;&gt; It seems to be a transition
from A Thousand Acres to Jewels

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:37.796
and Georges and is that the just
the years, you have an interest now

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.550
in writing for young adults
or how did that come about?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.623
&gt;&gt; Jane Smiley: Well, I've written a
lot of books since A Thousand Acres

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.300
and all of them were a big
change from A Thousand Acres

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.280
and A Thousand Acres
was a big change

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.080
from everything that came before.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.080
So I just like to write
lots of different things.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.613
It's more interesting and in some
ways you're always finding yourself

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.653
at the bottom of the mountain

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.520
and climbing the mountain,
and I like that.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:11.503
So those who consider me the author

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:13.913
of A Thousand Acres
clearly haven't read Moo.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:16.973
Those who think of me as the author

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.440
of Moo must not have
read the Greenlanders.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.440
And so it's just fun
-- it's more fun

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.176
to write lots of different things.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360
Yes?

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.426
&gt;&gt; I just want to know what
influenced you to become a writer.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.753
&gt;&gt; Jane Smiley: My mother.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.820
My mother was a journalist.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.703
She was the woman's page editor
for the St. Louis Post Dispatch

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.530
and she was an inspiring novelist

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.876
and she always had a typewriter
sitting on the dining room table.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.786
And it wasn't that she
made me become a writer.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.553
It was that she saw -- I saw through
her that this was a possibility.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:01.790
I read lots and lots of books and
none of them were respectable.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.986
I was not the girl who was
reading War and Peace at age 11.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.163
I knew girls like that,
but I was not her.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.943
I was reading horse books.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.876
I was reading Nancy Drew.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.343
I was reading the Dana
Girls and the Hardy Boys.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.450
Misty of Chincoteague, you
know the Marguerite Henry books

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.136
and in my experience of both
as a child and as a mother,

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.716
those books are the ones that
lead you forward into wanting

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.690
to be an author because
you love them so much.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.350
When I was a kid and I was
reading the Bobbsey Twins

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.603
to me an existential question
was how come in the Bobbsey Twins

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.440
at Home Mann and Burt are eight
and Freddie and Flossie are four

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.556
and in the Bobbsey Twins at
School Mann and Burt are twelve

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.450
and Freddie and Flossier are six.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.783
You know I knew how
to add and subtract

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.220
and I pondered this
question over and over again.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.700
So you can see where
I was headed you know.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.943
I was headed towards literature.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.486
So I love kid's books.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.553
There is no kid book that
is too unrespectable for me.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:14.786
My daughters grew up
reading Sweet Valley High.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.340
I'm going to tell a story I often
tell about Phoebe, who's here.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.056
When she was eight I read one
of these Sweet Valley High books

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.286
in which the good twin
falls off the back

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.480
of a motorcycle and
goes into a coma.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.220
And you know I was shocked.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.286
Here's my eight year
old reading about this.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.086
So in the morning she got up and I
said, "Phoebe, you know I don't know

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.420
that I want you to be
reading about this trauma."

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.200
And she looked at me said,
"Mom, it's not trauma.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.550
It's drama."

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:52.083
[Laughter] So that's the
lesson I will leave you with.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.420
I also would say that there is
not a single vampire in this book

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.076
and you know -- [Applause]
Thank you very much.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.510
