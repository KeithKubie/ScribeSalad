Newtonian determinism says that the

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
Newtonian determinism says that the
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.519
Newtonian determinism says that the
universe is a clock a gigantic clock

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529
universe is a clock a gigantic clock
 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.140
universe is a clock a gigantic clock
that's wound up at the beginning of time

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
that's wound up at the beginning of time
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.089
that's wound up at the beginning of time
and it's been ticking ever since

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099
and it's been ticking ever since
 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.730
and it's been ticking ever since
according to Newton's laws of motion so

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
according to Newton's laws of motion so
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.430
according to Newton's laws of motion so

Einstein believed in that Einstein was a

Einstein believed in that Einstein was a
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.140

determinist well does that mean that a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
determinist well does that mean that a
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.679
determinist well does that mean that a
murderer

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
murderer
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.710
murderer
this horrible mass murderer isn't really

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
this horrible mass murderer isn't really
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900
this horrible mass murderer isn't really
guilty of his works because it was

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
guilty of his works because it was
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.269
guilty of his works because it was
already preordained billions of years

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
already preordained billions of years
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.850
already preordained billions of years
ago nine sign said well yeah in some

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
ago nine sign said well yeah in some
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190
ago nine sign said well yeah in some
sense that's true even mass murderers

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
sense that's true even mass murderers
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.729
sense that's true even mass murderers
were predetermined but he said they

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
were predetermined but he said they
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.400
were predetermined but he said they
should still be placed in jail

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410
should still be placed in jail
 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.990
should still be placed in jail
Heisenberg then comes along and proposes

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
Heisenberg then comes along and proposes
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.639
Heisenberg then comes along and proposes
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.389
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and
says nonsense there's uncertainty you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
says nonsense there's uncertainty you
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.040
says nonsense there's uncertainty you
don't know where the electron is it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
don't know where the electron is it
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900
don't know where the electron is it
could be here here or many places

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
could be here here or many places
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.130
could be here here or many places

this of course I'm Stein hated because

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
this of course I'm Stein hated because
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510
this of course I'm Stein hated because
he said God doesn't play dice with the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
he said God doesn't play dice with the
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.990
he said God doesn't play dice with the
universe

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
universe
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.170

well hey get used to it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
well hey get used to it
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.560
well hey get used to it
Einstein was wrong God does play dice

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
Einstein was wrong God does play dice
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200
Einstein was wrong God does play dice
every time we look an electron it moves

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
every time we look an electron it moves
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.969
every time we look an electron it moves
there's uncertainty with regards to the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
there's uncertainty with regards to the
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.679
there's uncertainty with regards to the
position of the electron so what does

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
position of the electron so what does
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.109
position of the electron so what does
that mean for free will it means in some

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
that mean for free will it means in some
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510
that mean for free will it means in some
sense we do have some kind of free will

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
sense we do have some kind of free will
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.929
sense we do have some kind of free will
no one can determine your future events

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
no one can determine your future events
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.020
no one can determine your future events
given your past history there's always

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
given your past history there's always

the wild card

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
the wild card
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810
the wild card
there's always the possibility of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
there's always the possibility of
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.929
there's always the possibility of
uncertainty in whatever we do so when I

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
uncertainty in whatever we do so when I
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.359
uncertainty in whatever we do so when I
look at myself in a mirror I say to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
look at myself in a mirror I say to
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429
look at myself in a mirror I say to
myself what I'm looking at is not really

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
myself what I'm looking at is not really
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.910
myself what I'm looking at is not really
me it looks like me but it's not really

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
me it looks like me but it's not really
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.569
me it looks like me but it's not really
me at all

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
me at all
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.600
me at all
it's not me today now it's me a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
it's not me today now it's me a
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190
it's not me today now it's me a
billionth of a second ago because it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
billionth of a second ago because it
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.480
billionth of a second ago because it
takes a billionth of a second for light

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
takes a billionth of a second for light
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.320
takes a billionth of a second for light
to go from me to the mirror and back
