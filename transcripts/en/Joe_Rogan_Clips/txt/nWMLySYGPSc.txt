Speaker 1:          00:00          Five four, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Yes. And realize Brian Calvin, we are live on the Internet in cashmere right now. Everybody. Me, how come you don't wear watches? You were just saying I don't wear, I don't, I was thinking as I was saying Brendon, I go, you could rob my house and there's nothing you'd find a value. Like there's not a viking thing. It's still your car. Oh, okay. Oh no wonder why you make money then. Yeah, well got a lot of money. Right? You can totally like not work for years. I, yeah, I have enough. I make money. But uh, I never thought I was thinking about that too. I can, I genuinely, I did some soul searching about this because I watch how motivated Chavez, he's so buttoned down about his stuff. He's just always coming up with ideas and I don't think I ever gave to Fox for real about fame or money and I still don't, I have a very precarious relationship with that.

Speaker 2:          01:04          What I love is coming up with new ideas and writing new stand up and you know, like now having done the album, now I've got to come up with a whole new bag of tricks that that's a really fun time. I'm probably more happy or never as happy as when I'm on the road at some cafe somewhere coming up, solving problems, coming up with new ideas and surprising myself, everything else, you know, I like hanging with my boys and laughing and like having a nice house. Do you get any pleasure out of having a nice house? Yeah, but uh, I could live, uh, I'm have lived in rudimentary places and I have, I don't notice. Yeah, I noticed that when I, when I first started making money, you get, everything gets normal. Like this is your house. Wake up. It's normal. You know what doesn't change wouldn't always makes you feel good as views.

Speaker 2:          01:52          I was about to say that I can't believe you just said that you use not underrated. No views or views are very underrated. I so interesting you say that. I had just said that, you know who else said that to me? Ray Kurzweil. Really? Yeah. He always lives in a place with a view. Yeah. When I interviewed him, he was on a very high floor in an apartment building in San Francisco. That's where he lives. And You out, you look out from his apartment and you see the city and you see the bay and it's beautiful. Yeah. It's expensive. Yes. He said views are very important to him. They are. But I have another weird thing that like if you put me in a French cafe, there's a, there's a, I don't know if it's still around, but there was a fuss. I'm so French Seo and that we should pop.

Speaker 2:          02:39          We'll see. Go homoe uh, so my accent as far as say, Ham Sandwich, the jazz for him, I said I speak French fluently. Say Hummel, come home. Do Shambu how well do you feel much speak it fluently? No, I mean, I used to speak it. I went to French schools in Lebanon. Yeah. Um, you know, I mean I can give me, give me six months and I'm going to, you'd hop right back in then. I think so the dating pool and frauds. Shelly, what were you saying? You're about to say something about you were in a cafe in France, there's a place called Chez Paul, which is, uh, this restaurant where you're crammed in with a bunch of people and, and the walls and the wood has been there. You know, you go to the comedy store, like a comedy, like a comedy club that's been around since the 70s.

Speaker 2:          03:25          I yourself. Yeah. And you think these are the wood in this. This is a weird thing, but the wood in his walls has, have absorbed so much laughter and good energy. I was just saying that the other day about the ice house. Ah, it's, it's, it's very special. If they ever dump, demolish that, God forbid I would buy that wood and put it up on my walls. Oh, so you do get to match stuff. Yes. Magical stuff. Yes. I like things that last, I like marble and, and heavy would like old railroad tracks. Reclaimed wood. Yeah, I like this table. Yeah. Good leather. Who reclaimed wood? Yeah. A man with a mustache. Handmade, things like that are handmade. I do craftsman like, like, like if I had, if I wanted to, I would maybe go and have my shoes made in London. I'd have bespoke shoes. Bespoke.

Speaker 2:          04:17          Yes. That when they use that high, now I'd have bespoke shoes. The problem with jewelry watches, nice shoes and everything is I, I'd have to maintain them and I, I'd rather have. Mm. I also think we have to maintain watches. Just put them on. That's right. But I have a weird, I have another weird thing, which I think if I have leather under my feet, I don't feel as secure and I don't feel like I can run or fight. Oh. Like leather soles. Rubber Bro. I gotta yeah, you should have some tread. Yeah, they can put some leather tread below the rubber tread rather. Blow the leather. You don't want those scuffed up leather bottom shows, man, those bitches are useless. I've been on socks. Right. But it's good for pivoting. If you want to pivot, like you want to throw a wheel kit, it's really good. Yes, it's true. If you want to bear down, if I want to, let's call it squash the bug when I throw my right and squash the bug with my and my back foot. No, because you want to push off. You want to have some something to push off. You don't need that much pivot. You really need pivot with a kick. A spinning kick. Yes. Yeah. So this is, this is the kind of bullshit you and I still talk about it. 52 it's so with that, you're going to end well.
