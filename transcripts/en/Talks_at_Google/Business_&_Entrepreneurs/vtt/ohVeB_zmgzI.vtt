[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.770
JESSE: OK.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.460
All right, guys.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.668
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:14.240
I really appreciate
you guys coming.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.650
We have an awesome,
awesome speaker lined up.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.150
I'm personally very excited.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.290
I'm a big fan of this
guy, James Altucher.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.570
He's a multiple
best selling author.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.560
He's written books like "Choose
Yourself," "Reinvent Yourself,"

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.550
"Trade Like Buffett."

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.520
He's a serial
entrepreneur, investor VCs

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.860
invested in over 20 companies.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.200
He's a prolific podcaster.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.690
He's interviewed people
like Steven Pressfield, Tony

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.930
Robbins, to Rick Ross, who ran
a big drug empire in the '80s,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.130
so people from
all walks of life.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.490
He's a crypto expert, but
he likes to remind people

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.290
that that's not all he's about.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.895
That is all the rage right now.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.310
And he does have an awesome
class on MasterClass

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.826
you guys should check out.

00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:58.700
And if you guys want to
learn more about him,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.646
go to Jamesaltucher.com.

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:03.809
So without further ado,
let's start this interview.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600
I really appreciate
you coming here, James.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.224
JAMES ALTUCHER: Jesse,
I can't tell you

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:10.460
how much I'm appreciative
of being invited here,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.260
my favorite company
in the world.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.420
JESSE: Absolutely.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.620
And you apparently have
a pretty good story

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.200
when it comes to Google, right?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.790
JAMES ALTUCHER: Well,
well, so one time,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.320
I started this company.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.860
And I'm always in the mode
as soon as I start a company,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830
I want to sell it,
which is really

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.990
kind of not a good
philosophy to have.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.480
But unfortunately,
that's my philosophy.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.870
And so the instant
the company started,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.710
I basically went around
to every company--

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.460
AOL, Yahoo, Google,
Forbes, Interactive Corp--

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.130
and it was kind of like a
social media site for people

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.860
interested in investing.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.080
And I basically
said, we're for sale.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.150
And Google Finance was
just starting at the time.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.825
I don't even know
what's happening now

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:56.449
with Google Finance,
but Google Finance

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.270
was starting at the time.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.040
And I met with them in New
York, and it was great.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.800
It was in this
conference room where

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.110
it goes right into
a video screen

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.639
where the people
in San Francisco

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.160
are on the other side, so it
felt like one big conference

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.090
table.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.360
And I just remember walking
into Google in New York,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.700
and people were
skateboarding around.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.790
There was chefs making lunch.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.400
There were people
getting haircuts.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.930
Everybody had, like, three
monitors, or crazy monitors.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.370
And I'm like, oh my gosh.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.550
I really want to be here.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.760
I want to come to work here.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.140
I hadn't had a job in
12 years at that point,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.950
and I just really wanted
to just hang out there.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.160
And I remember waking up
at 2:00 in the morning,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.470
and I had that
feeling like you get

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.040
when you're on your first high
school date with a big crush.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.430
And I had this feeling like,
oh my gosh, I love Google.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.930
And so I wrote--

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.470
I think it was Katie Jacobs
Stanton that was running

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.610
Google Finance at the time.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.430
She ended up working for
Obama, then working at Twitter.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.830
I don't know where she is now.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.400
I wrote her and I said, I
really loved the meeting.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.700
I love Google.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.660
I can't wait until
our next conversation.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.410
It was like everything
you would write as,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.260
like, after your high
school crush first

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.690
date I wrote in this email
hours after I met them.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.710
And she never wrote back.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.650
I never heard from them again.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.140
But which is typical also of
that high school first date.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.980
By the way, I never had a
first date in high school.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.063
I had a first date when I
was in college, finally.

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:36.470
But I'm imagining that's what
it would be like if you had

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.590
a first date in high school.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.237
So that's my Google story.

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:42.070
JESSE: There you go.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.730
Well, any time you want to come
hang out, just let us know.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.240
You're always welcome.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.526
JAMES ALTUCHER: That's great.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:49.170
JESSE: So I want to just get
in your background a little bit

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.360
just for some context
for the people that

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.590
don't know out there.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.810
And you're very
vulnerable and open

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.340
about the adversity you've
faced in your adult life,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.940
but take us back
to the beginning.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.594
Give us a bio.

00:04:01.594 --> 00:04:02.385
Give us everything.

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:03.430
JAMES ALTUCHER: Sure.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.470
So I'll speed through it, but
I was a technologist at heart.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.450
I majored in computer science.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.970
I went to graduate
school, computer science.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.120
In fact, the last time
I was on this campus,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.830
I visited an ex grad school
classmate of mine, which

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.609
was Astro Teller, who runs--

00:04:24.609 --> 00:04:26.025
I don't know what
it's called now.

00:04:26.025 --> 00:04:27.630
It was Google X then.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.060
I don't know what it is called.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.065
JESSE: Google X Moonshots,
I think was the name.

00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:30.398
JAMES ALTUCHER: Moonshots, yeah.

00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:31.650
JESSE: Moonshot Factory.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.920
JAMES ALTUCHER: And then I got
really interested in writing.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.571
I wrote four failed
novels, which I

00:04:41.571 --> 00:04:42.820
don't know where they are now.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.220
They're thrown out somewhere.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.270
And I decided I wanted to be
in the entertainment industry,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.000
so I went to work
for HBO in New York.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.160
And from that, I was able
to combine several interests

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.090
at once.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.012
I knew technology.

00:04:58.012 --> 00:04:59.220
I knew how to build websites.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.130
In the mid-90s, no one else
knew how to build them.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.290
But I was also in the
entertainment industry,

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.510
so I started a company
that focused on building

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.107
very particular niche websites.

00:05:12.107 --> 00:05:14.190
You could probably even
tell what kind of websites

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.300
just by the way I look.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.070
But almost all of our
websites were the websites

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.230
of gangsta rap record labels.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.590
So-- that's supposed to
be a little bit funny.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.250
But we did Bad Boy Records, Loud
Records, "The Source Magazine,"

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.699
Death Row Records, Jive Records,
and AmericanExpress.com,

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.240
which most people don't know is
actually a gangsta rap record

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.000
label.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.430
And TimeWarner.com.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.130
Went We did Miramax.com,
when Harvey Weinstein was

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.630
running it.

00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:47.700
And it was funny.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.280
We did ConEdison.com's
website, and then we

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.770
made an internal
website for them

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.570
to keep track of
their Y2K stuff.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.110
And I remember asking them
in one of the meetings,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.300
where are you guys going
to be on December 31, 1999?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.000
And 100% of them was
like, we're going

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.230
to be long far away
from New York City

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.690
then, because they had no faith
in their abilities to keep

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.820
the electricity going on Y2K.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.250
But everything was fine, so
they didn't know anything.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.390
So I started that company.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.650
We grew pretty fast.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.040
And then during the
boom of everybody

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.700
was acquiring, and IPOing, and
so on, so we sold the company.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.590
I remember my sister who was in
junior high school at the time

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.290
was learning how to build
websites at that point.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.620
And I was thinking to
myself, oh my gosh.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.930
I charged HBO $75,000 to do
a 3-page website about Dennis

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.030
Miller, and now my junior
high school sister's

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.650
learning how to build
websites, so this business

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.072
is going down-- this
industry is going downhill.

00:06:55.072 --> 00:06:57.030
And within probably within
three or four years,

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.950
every single business in
that industry was bankrupt.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.220
And so I sold that company
and started a VC fund,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.070
started a hedge fund.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.250
Along the way, I
went totally broke.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.460
So I sold this
company, cashed out.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.930
It wasn't like I had paper.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.110
Cashed out for enough money
for the next three generations

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.030
of my kids, grandkids,
great grandkids could live.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.170
And then I manage to
spend every single dime.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.770
Like, there was one summer--

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.070
it was really unbelievable.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.680
And again, it wasn't
like on paper.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.550
There was one summer I probably
lost a million dollars a week.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.630
And then at the end of it,
I go to my ATM machine,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.420
and I had $143 left
in my bank account.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.972
So then I lost all this money,
and so I wrote some software

00:07:50.972 --> 00:07:52.680
to figure out, why
did I lose this money?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.340
I modeled.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.600
I did all sorts of statistical
pattern modeling, pattern

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.010
recognition on the stock
market over the past 60 years,

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.480
and started trading based on
this software that I wrote.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.570
Built up a hedge fund,
then a fund of hedge funds,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.800
then I built this kind of
social media site for investing.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.999
Sold that, started another
hedge fund after that.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.290
And then gradually, I started
doing more and more angel

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.920
investing, because I realized
I really couldn't handle--

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.020
day trading and
hedge fund investing

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.810
was so stressful
for me in every way.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.490
I remember I would
put on a trade

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.650
and the trade would instantly
go against me sometimes,

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.340
even if every software
was shouting it.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.280
And I thought I could outsource
my emotions to the software.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.420
And I would still
get so stressed.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.420
Like, I would go
across the street.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.242
There was a church
across from my house.

00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:50.450
And I'd go across the street.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.100
No one would be in the church.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.910
And I would literally go right
up to the statue of Jesus

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.290
and I would pray, please
make S&amp;P futures go up.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.320
I'll do anything.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320
And I'm Jewish.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.772
So I'm in the Catholic church.

00:09:06.772 --> 00:09:09.590
It just wouldn't work out.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.110
And so eventually, I did
a fund of hedge funds.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.230
But I decided to get out
of the hedge fund space,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.330
and I focused more
on angel investing,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.030
which was much easier--

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.770
not easier, but much
more relaxing for me.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.950
And then I had previously
written a bunch

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.140
of books in the finance space.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.600
But then suddenly, I
started writing about--

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.430
this was around 2010,
I started writing

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.470
about the things I
was feeling vulnerable

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.630
about, and the things
I was scared about.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.080
And I realized, look, this is
much more important to people.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.110
Not everybody cares
whether Apple is a better

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.650
investment than Microsoft.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.630
But everybody goes through
periods in their life

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.100
where they don't know
what they're doing,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.310
they don't know what path
they should be taking,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.350
they feel like maybe
they've made some mistakes

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.620
in their journey, and they
want to reinvent themselves.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.980
And so I became very interested
because I had reinvented myself

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.230
so many times, I
became very interested

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.640
in this process of reinventing
myself, and getting rid of all

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.620
the obstacles along the way.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.590
If anybody were to
decide, oh, I don't

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.370
want to be a software
engineer anymore.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.920
I don't want to be an
accountant anymore.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.650
I want to be an actor,
or I want to be a writer,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:25.520
or I want to be a doctor,
or work in the health care

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.060
business somehow, the
first thing everyone will

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.881
tell you is, you can't do
that, because I saw it time

00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:33.380
after time.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.860
I probably reinvented
my career 15 times,

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.450
and that's conservative.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.680
And every single time,
someone has said--

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.070
usually the first person
I spoke to, my mother--

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.930
had said, you can't do this.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.814
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.507
And you have to
figure out, well,

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:54.590
how am I going to do this?

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.660
Both psychologically
and mentally,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.127
how am I going to
learn to do this?

00:10:58.127 --> 00:10:59.960
How am I going to be
around the right people

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.469
so that they influence me
and I'm inspired by them?

00:11:03.469 --> 00:11:06.010
How do I stay healthy enough so
I have the energy to do this?

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.570
It takes a lot of energy
to reinvent a career.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:15.740
How do I spiritually avoid
the anxiety of failure?

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.460
If you say to yourself, OK, I'm
not going to work in a cubicle.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.240
I'm going to be a
professional skateboarder.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.860
Well, if you do that initially,
you're going to fail.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.170
Every day, you're going to
fail at it, because you're

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.880
going to love something enough
that you're going to realize,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.032
oh, the best people in
the world do it this way,

00:11:35.032 --> 00:11:36.740
but I'm not that good
yet, because you're

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.865
going to understand the
difference between the best

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:39.760
and yourself.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.740
So you have to get through
the psychology of how

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.490
do I keep improving, even though
it's so hard and so painful

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.007
to fail every single day?

00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:52.340
And just all these things of
the process of reinvention,

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.670
the pain of reinvention,
the pain of success

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:59.450
is very psychological, and
requires a lot of energy,

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.450
and it requires a lot of--

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.310
spirituality is the
wrong word, but a way

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:09.440
of dealing with the anxiety
of trying to improve yourself

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.000
no matter what age you are.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.760
We always think,
oh, when I'm 18,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.960
that's when I'll put
myself on the right path,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.510
because I'll study
it in college,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.160
and then I'll be
an expert, and then

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.112
I'll succeed at what
I studied in college.

00:12:21.112 --> 00:12:23.570
But what if at the age of 40
you decide you want to change?

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.450
What if the age of 60, you
decide you want to change?

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.730
And people change at every--

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.220
I don't know anybody who
has done the same thing

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.440
from the age of 20 to 60.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.960
And you have to be able to deal
with all the ups and downs.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.730
Now, some people don't,
and they stay the same,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.780
and they get gradually that
chronic level of anxiety that

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.880
just builds into their system.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.130
And then every disease
basically is related to that.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.770
That slow stress that you don't
really notice, but exists,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:59.360
as opposed to handling
the volatility of trying

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.800
to succeed at something.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.920
That volatility eventually
subsides, and you succeed,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.169
but it's very, very
difficult on that path.

00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:08.960
And so I became very
interested, and that's

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.690
why I just heard the podcast.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.190
That's why I wrote these books,
"Choose Yourself," "Reinvent

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.250
Yourself."

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.400
And "Choose Yourself"
was a great example

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.690
where I wanted to
write a book that

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.840
was a story that was for me.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.510
And I didn't want to deal with--

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.900
and of course, because the book
was called "Choose Yourself,"

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.350
I wanted to figure out,
how do I choose myself

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.950
with publishing this book?

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.390
If any of you have
written a book

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.910
or tried to write
a book before, it's

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.380
very hard to get published,
and the rewards of it

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.650
are very small.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.820
So when you submit
your book to somebody,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.560
you have to get
through an agent,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.690
you have to get through
an editor's assistant.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.650
An editor has to say,
this is a great book.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.490
A marketing team for a
publisher has to say,

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.532
this is a great book.

00:13:55.532 --> 00:13:57.490
The publisher has to say,
this is a great book.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.050
The publisher has a committee.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.710
They have to say
it's a great book.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.220
Bookstores then have to
say it's a great book.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.417
So all these steps
along the way,

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:07.750
you have to have all these
people who are not qualified,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.660
really, to tell you your
book is good or bad,

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.130
when you're the only one
who's qualified to decide.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:18.080
So I decided to skip that with
the book, "Choose Yourself,"

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.380
and I've done that ever since.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.463
And that, by the way, was
my most successful book.

00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:22.930
I've sold over a million copies.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:28.810
And again, the benefits
of not only doing

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.990
what you love doing, but
figuring out along the way

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.450
how to avoid the
obstacles that nobody else

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.990
has even thought to avoid.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.070
"Choose Yourself," I
ended up self-publishing.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.980
I self-published it through
another smaller company

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.350
down the street called Amazon.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.000
Or actually, up the street
very far, I should say.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.590
And again, with
everything you do,

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.720
there's ways to usually
choose yourself,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.450
to kind of avoid a lot of
the obstacles and pitfalls

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.690
that the gatekeepers will
always try to put in your way,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.910
the you can't do this people.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.725
So in a nutshell,
that's my background

00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:05.725
I can talk about specific
hedge fund strategies,

00:15:05.725 --> 00:15:07.660
but that's not is
as interesting,

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.370
or how to make a
website, or whatever,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.900
but that's not as interesting.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.200
JESSE: And you were writing
manuals for computer chips

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.205
at one point, right?

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:16.580
JAMES ALTUCHER:
Yeah, a long time

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.160
ago, there was a company
called Four Systems that

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.890
had the fastest chips
out there, and I

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.260
was writing their manuals.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.660
And I remember-- and I
wanted to be a writer.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.310
They hired me figuring A, I
knew computers, I knew hardware.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.400
I'll play around
with their chips.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.920
I wrote the initial
software for their chips,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.260
and then I wrote the
customer manuals.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.790
And they were so bad because
you can't do something

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.050
you're not interested in.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.977
And the CEO calls
me into his office,

00:15:48.977 --> 00:15:50.560
and he literally
said to me, don't you

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.360
take any pride in your work?

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.460
And, like, what kind of
response is that going to get?

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.310
Like, am I going to suddenly
realize, oh, you're right.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.880
I should take more
pride in my work.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.520
Immediately, I
thought to myself--

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.224
I'm nodding to him
on his suggestions,

00:16:05.224 --> 00:16:06.640
but I'm thinking
to myself, I have

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.870
to quit this job as
quickly as possible,

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.410
and that's what I did.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.210
I quit and left for HBO.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.816
Oh,no.

00:16:13.816 --> 00:16:15.940
There was an intermediate
job in between, but yeah.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.150
JESSE: So how do you go from
that, from working a dead end

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.670
job, not being
inspired, maybe having

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.350
some kind of
learned helplessness

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.930
around trying things on the
outside, to what you are now,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.830
which is an idea machine,
where you're trying things

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.430
constantly?

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.785
If you think of
something, you do it.

00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:34.910
You have your hand in
millions of different things.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.460
You're incredibly productive.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.880
How do you go from that
to where you are now,

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.940
and maybe focus on the
incremental small steps

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.230
you took in that dead end
job to get where you are now?

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.070
JAMES ALTUCHER: I mean, there's
a lot of different answers.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:55.960
I'll kind of skip ahead
20 years to answer it.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.860
Not quite 20 years.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.360
Maybe 18, 17 years later.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.960
But at one point,
I was broke again

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.320
probably for the third time.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.720
I kept making a lot of money,
and then somehow ferreting out

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.220
the fastest way possible-- it
was like it was like my life's

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.719
goal to figure out the fastest
way possible to lose millions

00:17:11.719 --> 00:17:13.099
of dollars each time.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.490
And so one time
again, I was broke,

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.400
and I remember I
was on a hammock.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.849
I had two houses on this
nice piece of property,

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.930
and there was a hammock
in between them.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.099
And it was just pouring
rain, and I realized,

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.420
I'm broke again.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.400
It's pouring rain.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.820
The IRS is literally,
like, stamped

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.861
on the wall of the house, like,
going to be seized any day now.

00:17:38.861 --> 00:17:39.860
And I'm on this hammock.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.980
I'm thinking, how could
this happen to me again?

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.310
Why is it happening to me
again and again and again?

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.515
And I realized,
well, on the way up,

00:17:50.515 --> 00:17:51.890
things were
happening differently

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.810
than on the way down.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.020
And it was what I
talked about earlier.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.690
On the way up, every time,
I had focused really hard

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.330
on physical health, which
basically doesn't mean,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.420
go to the gym every day, but
it means eat well, move well,

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.710
sleep well.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.830
Emotional health, which means
be around good people who

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.550
will support you.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.060
You need 20 or 30 positive
people in your life

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.820
to counteract 1 toxic
person in your life,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.740
and it's such an important rule.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.020
That ratio never changes.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.800
Creative health, which is
do one creative thing a day.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.350
And spiritual health,
as I referred to before.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.150
But the creative health--

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.700
now, I'm going to go
back in time a few years.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:39.800
So a prior time I had
been broke, I decided, OK.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.460
I had never been in the hedge
fund or finance space before.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.650
I had been in the
internet space.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.586
I was a technologist.

00:18:45.586 --> 00:18:46.960
I had been in the
creative space.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.602
I had shot TV shows.

00:18:48.602 --> 00:18:49.810
I had done a bunch of things.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.730
I'd written books.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.770
But I wanted to be
in the fiance space,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.200
so that's when I wrote this
software modeling the stock

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.160
markets.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.320
And I wrote to everybody
in the business that

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.140
was a hero of mine,
and I said, can you

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.062
meet me for a cup of coffee?

00:19:04.062 --> 00:19:05.770
I'll just take five
minutes of your time.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.560
Can you meet me for
a cup of coffee?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.700
I got zero response.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.990
I wrote to 50 people.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.790
I got zero responses.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.820
Because it's not as
if Warren Buffett is

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.230
going to suddenly
get my email and say,

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.230
Gladys, hold all meetings.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.210
James Altucher is going to buy
me a 60 second cup of coffee

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.510
downstairs, and I really
need to meet this guy

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.470
and let him pick my
brain for five minutes.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.300
This was probably going to
be more like an hour or two.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.890
Nobody ever says that.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.770
I don't know why I said
Gladys was his secretary.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.954
It seemed like the sort of--

00:19:42.954 --> 00:19:44.870
if you thought Warren
Buffett had a secretary,

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.100
it's like Gladys, or Bertha,
or something like that.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.840
I don't know why I think that.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.672
I don't know I
think she's a woman.

00:19:51.672 --> 00:19:53.130
I happen to know
she's a woman now,

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.900
but it could have been a
man he had as a secretary.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.920
But nobody responded, and
so I figured, you know what?

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.560
I need to get figure out--

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.417
every time something goes
wrong, the common denominator

00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:07.000
in all these--

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.660
it's not like Warren Buffett
or all of these people

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.090
were bad guys.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.650
I'm the common denominator in
50 people not responding to me.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.430
So what did I do wrong?

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.740
And you have to think about it.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.580
And so well, I was
being totally selfish.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.810
Bill Gates' time is more
valuable than my time.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.280
He's a better human
being than me,

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.290
so why should he give me
five minutes of his time?

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.070
And so I needed to
start exercising

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.990
what I call the idea muscle.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.650
Now, if you have
a bicycle accident

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.680
and you're in the hospital
bed for two weeks,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.390
you need physical
therapy to walk again.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.730
Your leg muscles will
atrophy that quickly.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.070
So it's the same thing
with the idea muscle.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.290
If you don't come up with
ideas every single day,

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.200
and even bad ideas,
you'll lose the ability

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.880
to come up with good ideas.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.250
And so I started writing down
10 ideas a day, just for myself.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.950
They could be ideas
about businesses.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.030
They could be ideas about
books I want to write.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.250
They could be just stupid
ideas, like, here's

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.512
10 pieces of clothing
I'm going to design.

00:21:11.512 --> 00:21:12.970
I don't know how
to design clothes.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.670
Here's 10 pieces of clothing.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.350
So every day, to this day, I
soak home with 10 ideas a day.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:24.640
And today, for instance,
I'm an advisor on a TV show.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.120
I came up with 10
ideas for them.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.630
And yesterday, I had
an idea, 10 things--

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.470
and this is not even
ideas for a business--

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.260
10 things I value
more than money.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.220
And I remember on the very
first list of ideas I wrote--

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.880
this was in 2002--

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.690
I wrote 10 games I
could teach people

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:53.710
to be great at in
just 3 or 4 easy tips.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.100
So the idea is I
wanted to write a book,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.140
how to beat your
friends and family

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.150
at every game in the
universe, because when

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.460
you go to Thanksgiving,
you play your friend--

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.110
after dinner, you break out
the Monopoly board or Scrabble,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.270
and you want to beat all
your friends and family,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.280
and humiliate them completely.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.270
And why not?

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.645
If you're going
to beat them, you

00:22:13.645 --> 00:22:16.326
might as well humiliate them.

00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:19.830
And so I wrote down
10 ideas of games.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.200
And then for each game,
three or four ideas

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.632
of how to win in that game.

00:22:23.632 --> 00:22:25.590
And then now suddenly,
I had an idea for a book

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.930
that I could easily
write, which I never did.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.350
Most ideas are bad.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.010
But like, take a
game like Monopoly.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.990
What's the one
thing you need to do

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.610
to beat all your friends
and family at Monopoly?

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.880
It's just one tip, and you'll
beat everyone at Monopoly.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.526
Anybody know?

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:41.484
AUDIENCE: Build hotels.

00:22:41.484 --> 00:22:41.946
JAMES ALTUCHER: Hmm?

00:22:41.946 --> 00:22:42.904
AUDIENCE: Build hotels.

00:22:42.904 --> 00:22:47.364
JAMES ALTUCHER: Build
hotels is not correct.

00:22:47.364 --> 00:22:48.640
AUDIENCE: Persuade them to--

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.890
JAMES ALTUCHER: Persuade them?

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.420
OK, if you're a good negotiator.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.756
But there's one
set of properties--

00:22:53.756 --> 00:22:54.630
I'll give you a hint.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.430
There's one set
of properties that

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.190
are far more valuable than
any other set of properties

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.720
by a factor of, like, 5.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.040
AUDIENCE: Park and Boulevard?

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.206
JAMES ALTUCHER: So Park and
Broadway, you're saying,

00:23:04.206 --> 00:23:05.370
Park Place and Broadway?

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.150
That is the most
valuable pieces, squares,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.150
but it's not the most
important to own.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.117
In fact, those are the worst
to own, I'm sorry to say.

00:23:13.117 --> 00:23:13.950
AUDIENCE: Railroads.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.930
JAMES ALTUCHER: No,
I'll tell you now.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:16.950
Nobody got it.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:21.060
The orange properties, the
New York Ave, St. James Place,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.430
and Tennessee, and
I'll tell you why.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.400
The most popular square
to land on in Monopoly

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.050
is jail, because there's
three ways to land on jail.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.230
You either land on
the go to jail square,

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.020
the dice take you to jail, or
the Community Chest has a card,

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.470
go to jail immediately.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.495
So there's three
ways to let on jail.

00:23:36.495 --> 00:23:38.244
It's the most popular
square on the board.

00:23:38.244 --> 00:23:41.280
The most popular roll
with the dice is a seven.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.770
Seven takes you to the
utility right in the middle

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.940
of the orange squares.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.450
So you're most likely to
land on the orange squares,

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.810
so you should own
the orange squares,

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.750
and then build hotels on
just the orange squares,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.830
and then you'll win.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.140
Bam, that's Monopoly.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.753
After the talk, I can
answer about any other game,

00:24:00.753 --> 00:24:03.690
but Monopoly's the
easiest to understand.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:08.970
So then I started writing 10
ideas for these other people.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.780
So I wrote 20 emails where I
really researched each person.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.896
I said, here's 10 ideas
for your business.

00:24:14.896 --> 00:24:16.270
I didn't ask for
a cup of coffee.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.550
I didn't ask for anything.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.680
With one guy, I wrote
here's 10 ideas--

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.460
he was a well-known
writer, still is--

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.320
10 ideas articles about
investing you should write.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.930
With another person, big
hedge fund manager, I said,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.970
here's 10 pieces of
software that you could use.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.450
We have a very similar
stylistic way of investing.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.600
Here's 10 pieces of software.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.210
I'll even teach your employees
how to use the software.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:42.720
They work.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.940
Here's my personal
track record with them.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.230
You could have them.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.980
And another person, I
wrote 10 ideas for him.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.116
And out of those 20,
3 people responded.

00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:54.740
You still get a very
low response rate,

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.320
but you're giving now
instead of trying to take.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.540
Ideas are all about giving.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.040
You always want to help
people with each idea.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.000
So the writer said,
these are great ideas.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.800
Why don't you write them for us?

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.470
So I started writing
for his website.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.350
It was Jim Cramer.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.120
We started for his
website, thestreet.com.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.990
And then I got a book
deal based on what

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.970
I was writing, because it was
very different type of stuff.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.970
And then I wrote
seven or eight books

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.950
about investing
after that, and I've

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.110
been on CNBC a billion times.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.390
Jim Cramer's about to
come on my podcast again,

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.710
so you build a
relationship over decades.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.850
And another person who responded
was this big hedge fund

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.750
manager.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.360
He invited me over for lunch.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.210
We got to know each other,
and he ended up personally

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.270
investing money with me, and
then I started my hedge fund.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.520
And then the third
person who responded

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.160
said, yeah, sure let's
have lunch, and talk

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.300
about these ideas.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.280
I never responded to him.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.600
12 years later I hit reply
on that exact same email

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.410
and I said, hey, can you come
on my podcast instead of lunch?

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.580
This is 2014.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.240
I hit reply on that
email instead of 2002.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.574
He responded and said, sure.

00:26:04.574 --> 00:26:06.240
It's the only podcast
he's ever been on,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.670
Nassim Taleb, who wrote
"Fooled By Randomness,"

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.342
"Black Swan," "Antifragile."

00:26:10.342 --> 00:26:12.800
And now he's coming-- when's
he coming on my podcast again?

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.220
In February.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.910
So he's never been
on any other podcast.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.080
So that's another
thing I typically

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.600
do is I'll go through my
emails from 10 years ago,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.760
and I have 280,000
unread emails.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.740
So I'll hit reply on
an email from 2007,

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.290
and just answer as if I
got the email yesterday,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:35.040
and no one has
ever not responded

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.900
to that way of
getting back in touch.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.525
You know how sometimes you don't
get back in touch with someone

00:26:40.525 --> 00:26:42.240
and you feel really
bad about it?

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:48.860
Wait 10 years, and then
reply, life hack number 867.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.230
So this idea stuff, I haven't
stopped doing it since 2002.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.590
Every single day, I'll
write down 10 ideas.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.887
But then sometimes people say--

00:26:56.887 --> 00:26:58.470
sorry if I'm answering
very long here.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.300
JESSE: No, it's great.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.800
JAMES ALTUCHER: But you asked
about the micro steps to take.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.090
Sometimes, people say, oh,
ideas are a dime a dozen.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.590
Execution's everything.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.940
People don't realize
execution ideas

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.880
are a subset of actual ideas.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.650
So I'll give an example
that involves Google,

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.420
and particularly Android.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.740
I was at a birthday dinner,
and a friend of mine

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.600
was there with his
brand new girlfriend.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.080
And I said, oh, you guys
look really cute together.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.960
And they said, oh, we
just had the conversation.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.530
We're going steady now.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.780
And I'm like, do people
still say that, going steady?

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.130
Like, is that a phrase?

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.040
And he said, yeah, we even
deleted our dating apps.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.800
So I had an idea the next day.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.510
I did 10 app ideas.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.380
And one of the ideas was,
let's make a going steady app.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.452
And a going steady would be you
download the going steady app.

00:27:55.452 --> 00:27:56.410
You link to each other.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.320
You both say,
we're going steady,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.995
and it deletes all the
dating apps on both phones.

00:28:01.995 --> 00:28:04.370
And it keeps track of all the
dating apps out there, just

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.710
in case there are new ones.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.950
And if the other side ever
downloads a dating app

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.760
or does anything tricky--

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.100
we'd figured it all out--

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.960
the other person gets informed.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.720
And so I wrote down,
what's the 10--

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.660
So then the next
day, I wrote, here's

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.070
the 10 mini execution steps.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:29.210
It's not like, oh, how will I
raise VC funding for this app?

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.070
That's the stupidest
thing of all.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.730
You don't think of ways to help
people and then immediately

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.530
say, give me money
to help people.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.290
You need to show that you're
a qualified and good person

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.640
to help people.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.360
So I thought, what are the
10 next steps in execution

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.710
that I can do to
create this app?

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:52.130
So I went on freelance.com and
I speced out the whole app.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.389
So first, I speced out
the whole app, actually.

00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:56.430
I said, this is what the
front screen looks like.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.970
This is what the sub
screens look like.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.060
Here's how you log on.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.880
Here's how two people
connect to each other here.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.588
Here's how two people
message each other.

00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:06.690
Here's the list of apps
I want to watch out for.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.950
And then I speced it
out on a freelance.com.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:14.290
I got 10 companies from
US, India, and Malaysia,

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.100
the big three, as we call them--

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.230
that was a joke.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:25.040
And everybody said, oh, we'll
do it for $1,000, or $2,000,

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.510
or $500.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.422
And then I called up
each one and I said,

00:29:29.422 --> 00:29:31.130
the one question I
have that I don't know

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.960
and I can't figure it
out with my research,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.610
the one question I
have is, can Android

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:42.470
and iOS from within
an app see what

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.270
other apps are on the phone?

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:48.680
It turns out Android,
yes, iOS, no.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:53.420
And since I didn't want to just
do it for one operating system,

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.680
I didn't do that idea, even
though I'm absolutely sure it

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.360
would have been a huge hit.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.500
But here's a case
where I had the idea,

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.260
I had the execution
ideas, I executed on them.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.840
It took me three
hours, two hours

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.850
from beginning to
end to figure out

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:16.910
to spec out the site, the app,
advertise it, to actually find

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.060
developers, call them, figure
out what my main question was,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.660
ask them, and determine it
was not a good enough idea.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.850
So execution is not as
hard as people think,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.240
but you still have to be
good at idea generation

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.680
to be good at execution
idea generation

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.590
so you know what those
micro execution steps are.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.480
Now, if anyone can
help me figure out

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.490
how to do it from within an iOS
app to see the other iOS apps,

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.260
we're in business.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:41.876 --> 00:30:46.280
But that's kind of an example
of ideas can lead to execution.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.180
They're not separate.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.420
It's not that execution's
everything, ideas are nothing.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.670
They're interwoven
and connected.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.649
So that was my huge
response to that question.

00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:55.940
JESSE: That was a great answer.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.023
JAMES ALTUCHER: Thank you.

00:30:57.023 --> 00:31:00.350
JESSE: So you've had these
kind of wild financial swings

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.960
that you just
described your life,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.840
and it's been kind of a
volatile path for you.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.570
How has that changed
your philosophy,

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.630
and how have things like
minimalism, and stoicism,

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.720
and kind of non-attachment
to material things and money

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.280
informed the way you think now?

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.155
JAMES ALTUCHER: Yeah.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:27.110
I see what I call failure porn
all over the internet now.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.020
Like, oh, I failed, so my
next thing will be a success.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.890
Oh, I failed.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.850
Here's 10 things I learned.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.380
That sort of tells me that
they didn't quite fail,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:41.060
because failure's really
insanely painful and difficult,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.560
some failures more than others.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.900
And it's really unpleasant.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.830
Like, it's an unpleasant
feeling in your stomach.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.230
Just because you hit
rock bottom doesn't mean

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.240
you're not going
to go even lower.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.074
Most people I know who say,
well, I hit bottom here,

00:31:56.074 --> 00:31:58.490
and then if I drill-- like on
my podcast, people will say,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.720
I hit rock bottom here.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.190
And I'm like, really?

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.210
Well, where were you
six months later?

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.630
And they were like, well,
then I was in the street

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:06.980
with a needle out of my elbow.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.350
Well OK, that sounds more
like rock bottom to me.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.370
So it's really painful.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.850
But I think that's
what really focused me

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.410
on at the end of
the day, I really--

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.900
and I say this to
my daughters, too--

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:28.490
A, I ask them to ask themselves,
who have I helped today?

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.820
Because if you've helped, that
means you have some energy,

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.110
and that means you
have ideas, and so on.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.240
But really, I make sure I
check the list every day,

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.080
physical health, emotional
health, creative or idea

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.470
health, and spiritual health.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.370
And the spiritual
health, again, can I

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.710
deal with the inevitable
things that I can't control,

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.580
like, oh, this business failed.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.750
It's over.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.980
There was one day-- can
I tell a story again?

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.850
Do we have time?

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:56.990
JESSE: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.270
Go for it.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.686
JAMES ALTUCHER:
So there's one day

00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:00.800
I was on the set of a TV show.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.350
Some friends of mine had
created this TV show,

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.160
and they invited me to watch
the pilot being filmed.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.790
And one of my favorite
directors was filming the pilot.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.040
Some of my favorite
actors were in the show,

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.600
having the best day.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.630
I was on the board of a company,
and my shares in this company

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.560
were worth millions of dollars.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.310
And I get this message in the
middle of the day, emergency

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.230
board meeting.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.220
And I'm thinking, great.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.050
The company got sold.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.960
I'm going to finally
cash in on these shares,

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.490
and it's going to be great.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:39.440
And I get on the call, and it
was announced right away, well,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.340
our largest shareholder, he
just told us he owes $90 million

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.630
to the IRS.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.000
He never disclosed that before.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.950
We had to tell our bank.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.070
Our bank has fired us
as the management team,

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.930
except for this
one board meeting.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.700
They're going to pick
apart the company

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.960
and just sell it in pieces
to their other customers.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.860
It was a billion
revenue company,

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.370
and they're going to
sell off each region

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.170
and dissolve the company
just so that they

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.253
can make their money back.

00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:09.440
We owed them like $15
million, which was nothing,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.120
really, for a billion revenue
company, but this was the rule.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.050
And within days, my shares
went from being worth millions

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.940
to being worth zero.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.060
And I tried on the
board on the call,

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.420
how about I buy the pieces,
or how about I find buyers

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.330
for each piece of the company,
or how about I raise money,

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.100
and we just pay back the bank?

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.580
And they were like, everything
I said, it was just too late.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.460
They've already locked
us out of the offices.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.770
It's over.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.489
And now, I get off the phone.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:45.217
And now, my favorite actor is
filming this amazing scene.

00:34:45.217 --> 00:34:47.300
If I even told you the
scene, you've seen the show

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.383
and you've seen the scene.

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:54.110
And my favorite director,
he's directed "Limitless."

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.960
He directed all
these great movies.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.840
And I just figured,
you know what?

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.270
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.730
I just lost millions
of dollars, but this

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:08.030
is the first time I'm ever on
the set of a TV show like this.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.990
I'm just going to enjoy
the rest of the day.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.380
And so I spent the next
eight hours asking questions

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.950
to the directors, the
writers, the actors.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.710
And a few months
later, I explain

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.939
to one of the writers what
had happened that day.

00:35:19.939 --> 00:35:21.230
And they were like, oh my gosh.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.521
You were the last one to leave.

00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:26.630
You were asking questions
all day long and enjoying it.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.540
And I think it's
really important.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.037
I couldn't control
anymore that situation,

00:35:32.037 --> 00:35:34.370
and I knew I wasn't going to
sleep that night, because I

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.290
was going to be
depressed and anxious.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.070
But I figured, OK.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.470
Right now, I'm
here, and I'm never

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.910
going to get this chance again.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.840
We only live one life, and
I'm going to learn a lot,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.380
and I'm going to
take what I learned

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.020
into new things, and
new opportunities.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.930
And I decided to
focus on that and not

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.300
think about this negative thing.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.000
I made an appointment to think
about it later with myself

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.890
when I got home, and that's
how I acted in the day.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.420
And I think not wallowing
in things you can't control

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.160
is a very important part of
moving forward and making

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.060
progress in life.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.810
Otherwise, you'll just
be always held back

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.442
by these negative events
you can't control.

00:36:12.442 --> 00:36:14.000
JESSE: And how do
you use failure

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.870
to hack the 10,000 hour rule?

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:17.690
So for those of you
that don't know,

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.850
Malcolm Gladwell wrote a
book called "Outliers,"

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:23.630
about 10,000 hours required
to-- or this is just part

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.230
of the book--

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:28.070
10,000 hours required to be
really great at any skill.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.950
And it does make you a
little kind of defeatist.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.530
It makes you think, I have
to be Mozart or Andre Agassi

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.080
to get really good
at a certain skill.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.750
So how do you use failure to
kind of short circuit that?

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.830
JAMES ALTUCHER: Yeah, so
that's a great question.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.890
So anytime you want to
get good at something,

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.970
I don't know how old many
of you are, but I'm 49.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.570
I'm going to be 50 in a month.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.970
And just as an example,
over the past year,

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:57.030
I've gotten somewhat obsessed
with doing stand up comedy.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.340
So I do stand up comedy
at different clubs

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.410
all around New York.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.640
I'm doing Chicago next week.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.941
I go up three to six times a
week, and it's a scary thing.

00:37:09.941 --> 00:37:12.440
It's the scariest thing and
it's the hardest skill I've ever

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.170
had to learn, and I've
learned many different skills

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.620
in my life that are
considered hard skills.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.290
And I talk to a
lot of comedians,

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.680
and they were all like, yeah
20 years, 15 to 20 years.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.660
If you're watching a
special on Netflix,

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.580
chances are that
comedian you're watching

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.560
has been doing it
for at least 15,

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.600
probably more like
20 or 25 years.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.900
And I'm thinking to
myself, oh my gosh.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.450
I want to do this in a year.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:42.500
I don't want to be doing
this when I'm 70 years old.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.640
And it's so painful
because yeah, you're

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.940
making people laugh.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.820
But before you go on,
you're really nervous.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.900
And sometimes, you bomb.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.720
And sometimes, you get heckled.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.380
And sometimes, you feel
really awful afterwards.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.100
And there's so many
subskills you need to learn.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.370
It's not just about
telling a good joke.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:02.720
There's maybe
different subskills.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.460
And by way of comparison, I'd
say becoming a chess master,

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.550
maybe there's 20 different
mutually exclusive subskills

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:14.480
you have to learn and master to
become an overall chess master.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.680
With comedy, I would say
there's about 50 subskills.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.820
And so part of this is related
to here I said to myself, well,

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.310
I've been doing all these--

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.580
I've done 300 podcasts with
amazing performers, the best

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.000
performers in the
world at what they do.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.320
Again, I'll mention Tony
Hawk at skateboarding,

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.210
or Garry Kasparov at chess,
or Astro Teller from Google

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.000
has been on my podcast.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.950
Sara Blakely is
probably the only

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:46.100
self-made female billionaire
on the Forbes list,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.480
who invented Spanx.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.340
She's been on my podcast.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.260
Arianna Huffington,
so many great writers,

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.370
actors, comedians,
athletes, entrepreneurs.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.280
Richard Branson was just on.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.210
But on the 10,000 hour
rule specifically,

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.360
I also had on
Anders Ericsson, who

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.730
Malcolm Gladwell in
his book "Outliers,"

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.790
he's quoting Anders Ericsson
on the 10,000 hour rule.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.760
So I wanted to know, so I
invite Anders Ericsson on.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.500
Anders Ericsson broke it down.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.170
It's not quite 10,000 hours.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.732
That was just a catchy phrase
that was used in the book.

00:39:17.732 --> 00:39:19.190
For some people,
it's 10,000 hours.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.720
For others, it wasn't.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.450
He said the Beatles, which
was the example in the book,

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:29.630
the Beatles performed 24 hours
a day at these German porn clubs

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:31.120
before they were famous.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.690
And that was how they got their
10,000 hours was the example

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.267
Gladwell used.

00:39:35.267 --> 00:39:37.850
Now, Anders Ericsson thought it
was more like 4,000 hours when

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.320
he calculated it out.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.350
So I figured, OK, it might not
be 10,000 hours for everybody,

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:44.570
if you have some talent and
so on, although Ericsson

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.420
doesn't believe in talent.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:51.200
And then I started
asking everybody,

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:58.220
what were common denominators in
your 10,000 hours, in your move

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.800
towards world excellence?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.970
And there's a couple of
ways that you can kind of

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.800
hack the 10,000 hours.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.980
And an important one--

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.355
I'll get to failure
in a second--

00:40:09.355 --> 00:40:11.870
but an important
one is building up

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:15.860
a strong community of
friends who are already

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.400
successful in that subculture.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.900
So anything you
want to get good at,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.608
let's say you want to
get good at tennis.

00:40:20.608 --> 00:40:22.300
There's already a subculture.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.490
Like, if you just show up
at the professional tennis

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.170
courts or whatever,
nobody's going

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.910
to talk to you, because
they don't know who you are,

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.530
and they're already friends
with all the other pros.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.666
They don't want to talk
with the weaker players.

00:40:32.666 --> 00:40:34.040
But if you can
somehow figure out

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.610
how to be friends with all
the strong people in the space

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.180
that you want to
get good at, you

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.680
can literally skip five
to eight years of work,

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.630
because they know everything
you're doing wrong.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.550
They could just look
at what you're doing,

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.070
and they say, this, this,
this, this, you're doing wrong.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.330
So as an example, I had a ping--
like many people, probably,

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.150
I had a ping pong table in
my basement when I was a kid.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:03.000
I played ping pong every day
the whole time I was growing up,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.510
an I've played ping
pong for 40 years.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.540
Then I took ping pong lessons
a few months ago from a world

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.220
class ping pong player.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.910
Like, he's world champion level.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.650
100% of the things I
was doing were wrong.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.530
So the way I held
the racket, the way

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:24.860
I swung, the way I did the
backhand, the racket itself,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.967
the way I stood, even the
way I kept score was wrong.

00:41:29.967 --> 00:41:30.800
I didn't even know--

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.416
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:32.416 --> 00:41:34.165
I didn't even know the
rules of ping pong.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.710
So just by taking a few
lessons, I immediately

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.880
was like much, much better
than I was for 40 entire years.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.585
And so that's the
importance of being around--

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:50.210
there's that saying,
you're the average

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.690
of the five people around you.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.962
Well, if everybody around
you is a chess grandmaster,

00:41:54.962 --> 00:41:56.420
you're going to be
much more easily

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.340
be a chess grandmaster
as opposed just

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.920
playing bad people all day.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.380
And that's true for
everything in life.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.970
That's one fast way
to hack a good let's

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.930
say it really is 10,000 hours,
although I think it's less.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.680
That's a way to hack,
like, at least 4,000

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.500
or 5,000 hours out
of that 10,000 hours.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.380
Now, failure is
extremely important.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.690
So let's say comedy--

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.090
I go up on stage.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.270
And one time, I go up, and
I use the same exact joke,

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.740
and everybody laughs.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.490
The second time I go up on
stage, and nobody laughs.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.320
In fact, I might
even get heckled.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.480
And I have videos of both.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.210
I videotape all the
times I go up on stage,

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.430
or most of the times
I go up on stage.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.577
So I'll take the
videos, and I'll

00:42:44.577 --> 00:42:46.160
show it to several
comedians, and I'll

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.820
say, what is the difference
between these two videos?

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.780
I don't understand.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.250
I'm not seeing something.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.130
But they've been
doing it 20 years,

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.990
so they instantly see many,
many things that I don't see.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.060
I'm completely blind.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.810
For me, I'm only asking,
is the joke funny or not?

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.110
For them, they're asking, how
are you holding the microphone?

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.957
How are you moving
around the stage?

00:43:07.957 --> 00:43:09.290
What does your voice sound like?

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.360
Are there more men than
women in the audience?

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.026
Are there more older people than
younger people in the audience?

00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:16.440
Are there more tourists or
non-tourists in the audience?

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.440
Do you have a friend in
the audience who happens

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.200
to be the first one laughing?

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.220
There's so many things
they are looking at.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.845
They might say, you may
think you said the same joke,

00:43:28.845 --> 00:43:31.220
but it's actually a different
joke in these various ways.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:34.010
You switched these
two words, or you

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.276
took two sips of water
instead of one sip of water

00:43:36.276 --> 00:43:37.400
in the middle of that joke.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.920
That was one response
that was completely 100%

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.317
the reason why the same joke
was funny one time and not funny

00:43:45.317 --> 00:43:47.150
the other is that in
the middle of the joke,

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.760
I took two sips of water
instead of one sip of water.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.310
And there was a
reason, the timing

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.490
created too much tension
on the two sips of water

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:56.750
versus the one sip of water.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.330
But it took a professional
comedian to tell me that.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.890
So again, failure
allows you to ask--

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.570
you can say, oh,
I failed at this.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.930
I'm going to quit, and
that's what most people do.

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.210
Anything that's
worth doing is hard.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.470
Else, everybody would be
a success in everything.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:20.100
So everything worth doing
is very, very difficult,

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.600
so you're going to
fail in big ways

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.230
and you're going to fail in
little ways every single day.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.220
Every single time I go on
stage, I fail at something.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.829
And I'm just speaking
specifically about comedy.

00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:32.120
I could be talking about chess.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.710
I could be talking
about business.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.800
In business, there are so
many subskills-- again,

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.230
I would probably say there's
about 30 different subskills

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:40.771
that you have to
master with each one

00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:44.090
to make money for yourself.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.460
But I'll just stick to the
comedy example for a second.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.290
I had one case where--

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.790
oh, but this is why
it's important to--

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.840
the question is, how
do you get to get

00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.397
professional comedians look
at my little stupid videos?

00:45:01.397 --> 00:45:02.730
They don't want me to be better.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:07.520
They don't want an extra person
saying he or she's a comedian.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.420
But because of my
business expertise,

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:17.180
I bought part of the comedy club
that I performed at the most,

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:20.480
now, and I have a podcast.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.100
So I could talk to almost any
comedian I want to talk to.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.710
And right in the
middle of my podcast,

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.077
oh, this is part of the podcast.

00:45:27.077 --> 00:45:28.910
Look at these two videos
of me doing comedy.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.350
Tell me where I went wrong.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.710
And it's a great
way to get feedback.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:38.030
And so I've figured out how
to hack getting professionals

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.940
to look at these mini
failures I do along the way

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.380
and give me help.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:46.250
So most people wouldn't even
guess what the most important

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.710
skill is in comedy.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.260
You would think the
obvious, which is humor.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.060
Now, by the way, humor
itself is divided

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.580
into a bunch of
different subskills,

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.780
like how you write a punchline
is different than how

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.600
you tell a funny story.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.710
A funny story in
public speaking doesn't

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.970
work telling the same
story in stand up comedy.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.220
No one will laugh.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.990
In comedy, everyone will
laugh in public speaking.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.670
But the most important
skill that many comedians

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.090
have told me is not
humor, but likability.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:20.700
And so that's why you see
many comics who are unknown.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.739
They get on stage, and they
start talking to the audience,

00:46:23.739 --> 00:46:24.530
where are you from?

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.630
Or they say, I grew
up, and I was bullied,

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.117
and here's the worst bullying.

00:46:29.117 --> 00:46:30.950
And then they try to
make a joke at the end,

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:32.940
but they're self-deprecating
in the beginning,

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.694
so the audience can
relate a little bit.

00:46:36.694 --> 00:46:38.360
That's only one way
to build likability.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.070
There's other ways
to build likability,

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.237
and you're learning
all those subskills.

00:46:42.237 --> 00:46:44.570
But like on business, I'll
give you a very important set

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:45.800
of subskills.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.810
So obviously,
product development

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.100
is an important
subskill in business.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.550
But most people think
that's the only skill.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.160
Oh, if we build a good product,
people will buy the product.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.550
VCs will invest in money.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:01.610
I have done hundreds of angel
investments at this point.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.190
I'll tell you an incredibly
important skill that

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.440
is different from any
other skill in business,

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.130
but I won't invest unless I
see that the CEO and maybe

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.860
the other investors
have this skill.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.400
It's really hard to
sell your company.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.020
Nobody wants to write you a
check that will make you rich.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.960
Nobody wakes up in the morning
and says, you know what?

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.390
Today, I'm going
to make Jesse rich.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:28.910
Nobody has ever woken up and
said that in their lives.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:29.910
JESSE: It's unfortunate.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:30.785
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:30.785 --> 00:47:34.160
JAMES ALTUCHER: No one has
said that about anybody.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.030
So having the ability to
convince somebody else, like,

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:44.300
of course selling a company is
not about making somebody rich.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.880
But the reality is, it is.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.680
And so there's all
sorts of ways you

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.860
have to have this skill
to convince people

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.550
to buy your company, and
that's a 100% different skill

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.610
than raising money, than
selling the products,

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.980
than managing employees, than
sales, than negotiations,

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.300
than building a product.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.980
All of these skills
are important.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.910
Dealing with a landlord
is almost as important

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:10.080
a skill as developing a
product for various reasons

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.690
that most people
wouldn't suspect.

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:15.350
For instance, if Google bought
a company, and I had a landlord,

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.690
my landlord has to
approve that Google's

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.190
the new tenant instead of me.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.490
And if the landlord says no,
you can't sell your company.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.190
So there's all
these little things

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:26.815
that most people
don't think about when

00:48:26.815 --> 00:48:29.180
they start a company,
and it's been

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:30.800
the cause of so many
failures of mine,

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.400
investing in the
wrong set of skills.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.980
And now, I have
one trick for it,

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.390
which is I only invest in
it alongside people smarter

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:42.260
than me.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.550
So I outsource my
thinking to people

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.360
who have big research
teams doing due diligence.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.150
And ideally, the CEO has built
and sold the company before,

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:53.810
so I know he's got the
whole skill set, and so on.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:58.550
But these are some ways in
which failure has taught me.

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:01.910
And I'll just give you one
quote from so Ray Dalio was

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:03.440
on my podcast last week.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:08.990
We haven't released the podcast
yet, but he is the founder

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:12.380
and still runs the largest
hedge fund in the world.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.080
He's worth tens of billions.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:20.030
He said in the podcast,
"Pain plus reflection

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:23.270
equals progress," and
that's a very valuable quote

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.780
relating to how you
hack these 10,000 hours.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:27.680
JESSE: Yeah.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.110
I want to get to
Q&amp;A in a second.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.450
But real quick, I want to
couple two questions together.

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.750
JAMES ALTUCHER: Sure.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:34.333
I promise I'll answer
it more quickly.

00:49:34.333 --> 00:49:35.900
JESSE: No, you're all good.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:39.170
So the two questions are, what's
your favorite podcast you've

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.580
ever done, and why?

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.461
And then the second question is,
what's your favorite life hack?

00:49:43.461 --> 00:49:44.960
Or to put it a
different way, what's

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.200
the one thing these people can
do that will have the greatest

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.870
multiplicative effect,
positive effect on their life,

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.790
whether it's sleep or whatever?

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.680
JAMES ALTUCHER: Sure.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.950
So the best podcast
I've ever done,

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.550
it's really hard to
answer, because I

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.530
learn so much from all
of these amazing people.

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:07.310
Like, I don't know how many
people grew up on Judy Blume

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:08.690
books, for instance.

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.550
Like I grew up reading--

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:14.200
Judy Blume was the best
children's writer in the 1970s.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.060
She sold 150 million
copies of her books.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.250
And I would never
have imagined when

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.350
I was in fifth
grade or sixth grade

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:24.590
that one day, I was going
to talk to Judy Blume.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.294
Like, that was an
amazing moment for me.

00:50:26.294 --> 00:50:28.460
I know it doesn't sound
like the most amazing thing.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.710
But usually the best
podcast I've ever had

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:32.150
is my last podcast,
because that's

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.466
the one that's still
so fresh in my memory,

00:50:34.466 --> 00:50:36.090
and I'm thinking
about it, and thinking

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.340
about the things they say.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.730
So again, Ray Dalio
was the last one I did.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.610
But I'll talk about the
worst podcast I ever did

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.350
and what I learned from it.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:49.130
So this was in 2014,
I did this podcast

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.635
with the rapper Biz Markie.

00:50:51.635 --> 00:50:53.210
Do you know Biz Markie?

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.830
He did that song,
"Just a Friend."

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.750
It's kind of a popular song.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:02.270
And I said to him, what's it
like that everybody knows you

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.020
primarily?

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.670
You've done a lot of songs and
albums and things in your life,

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.560
but everybody primarily knows
you from "Just a Friend?"

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.200
And he was very upset.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.900
He said, I've done much
more than "Just a Friend."

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.960
And I said, that's true, but
two things I want to point out.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:22.547
One, if I go to your
website, the song

00:51:22.547 --> 00:51:24.380
immediately starts
playing, "Just a Friend."

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.520
And if I were to go to China
right now and ask anybody,

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.220
do you know who Biz Markie is?

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.130
If they know you at all, they're
going to sing, "Just a Friend."

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.560
So he's like, yeah, but
I did "Yo Gabba Gabba"

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.310
on Nickelodeon.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:42.100
I did this song, that
song, and he hung up on me.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.500
So it's only time somebody ever
hung up on me in a podcast.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.980
And so I figured,
OK, well it's not

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.350
so fun to just put
this podcast up.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:55.670
So what I did was I had
the audio engineer play

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.540
the podcast, and then
with another person,

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.370
we analyzed what I did wrong
throughout this podcast.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.200
So we kept having the engineer
rewind, fast forward, rewind,

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.700
fast forward, and
we kept commenting

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.070
how I could have done a
better job on this podcast.

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:14.150
So I made it like a meta podcast
about doing this bad podcast.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:20.000
So everything is content.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.790
Process is art.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:27.380
Just as much as the outcome,
the process of the final outcome

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.290
is artistic in and of itself.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:33.980
We had scheduled at one
point for the podcast Jordan

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.090
Belfort, who he's famous for
being The Wolf of Wall Street.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.050
He's a criminal.

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:40.654
He once spent time in jail.

00:52:40.654 --> 00:52:42.820
He did his time, so I
shouldn't say he's a criminal,

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.540
but he spent time in jail.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.060
Leonardo DiCaprio
plays him in the movie.

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.645
But before the
podcast, he asks--

00:52:49.645 --> 00:52:51.560
it's the only the time
I was ever asked this.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.660
He asks-- his publicity team.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.506
I shouldn't say he--

00:52:54.506 --> 00:52:55.880
his publicity team
said, you need

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.010
to submit all the
questions in advance.

00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:59.600
And I said, no.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.840
Soviet Russia did that.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.660
Like, I'm not doing that.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.750
And I'm going to ask him
whatever I want to ask him.

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:06.904
And listen to my podcast.

00:53:06.904 --> 00:53:08.570
I'm never mean to
anybody on my podcast.

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:11.360
It's not like I'm
trying to trap somebody.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.060
So it shows me they didn't
their work on my podcast,

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.060
and I didn't want to--
and anyway, it wasn't

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.268
like he was a peak performer.

00:53:18.268 --> 00:53:21.830
The guy was a criminal, so they
want to have him on my podcast.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:23.530
Again, he did his time.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.400
Not a criminal.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.640
I have to say that, legally.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.410
So was that a
failure or a success?

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.530
Well, I wrote an article
mentioning that I

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:35.747
turned process into content.

00:53:35.747 --> 00:53:38.330
It was an article that appeared
on 20 different platforms, got

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:39.890
tens of thousands of views.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.729
And I don't think
he's a bad guy.

00:53:41.729 --> 00:53:43.520
It could have just been
his publicity team.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.260
I have no idea.

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.980
But everything I do that doesn't
work out, I always figure out,

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.080
how do I take this
process and turn it

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.750
into art in some other way,
or turn it into a business,

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.640
or turn it into an
opportunity, or turn it

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.620
into an idea for somebody else?

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.220
So I always repeat that
to myself every day,

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.550
process is art.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:04.580
Because whatever we
do, however we falter,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:08.400
even if I completely fail,
for instance, at comedy,

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.350
the process of failing, like,
I've written about bombing.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:17.550
And just the process of how
you deal with that becomes art.

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:21.660
And for me, art, I write
for so many different things

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:23.660
and for so many
different reasons,

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.520
it becomes connected to
all my other businesses.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.200
So now, not only am I writing
about bombing in comedy.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.560
But for one group of my readers,
I'm writing about failure.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.620
And another group of
readers, I'm writing about,

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:39.600
here's the metalanguage
of how to learn anything,

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.910
and part of the
process of me learning

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.540
something that's a hard skill.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.330
It doesn't matter
what this skill is.

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:46.500
So there's so many
different levels.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.120
When you treat process
as art, there's

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.979
so many different
ways you can use

00:54:49.979 --> 00:54:52.020
that to create new works
of art that have nothing

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.600
to do with how you started,
so that's incredibly valuable.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.910
So I think that was the answer
to, what's my favorite podcast?

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.070
So I took that Biz
Markie experience

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.200
and I made art out of
it in a different way

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.159
than I had initially expected.

00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:07.575
And then your
second question was?

00:55:07.575 --> 00:55:08.910
JESSE: Life hack, favorite one.

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:10.650
JAMES ALTUCHER: OK.

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:14.370
And this happened to
me even yesterday.

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:16.480
Somebody comes up
to me and says,

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.190
I read your suggestion
of doing 10 ideas a day.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.410
I thought it was nothing.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.930
The best life hacks
are not like, oh,

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:28.860
inject this super soldier
serum into your arm,

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.170
and you're going to
become Captain America.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.000
The best life hacks
are simple ones

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.060
that people don't realize the
compound effect of it over time

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.400
becomes a miracle.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:45.030
And so writing 10 ideas a
day improves your idea muscle

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.960
and strengthens your
idea muscle 1% a day.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:53.520
1% a day compounded
is 3,800% a year,

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.140
billions of percent
over 10 years.

00:55:56.140 --> 00:56:01.290
So your ability to compete
against everyone else

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:05.340
becomes so powerful over time,
even over the course of a year,

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.221
even over the course
of three months.

00:56:07.221 --> 00:56:09.720
If you just write 10 ideas a
day-- and someone came up to me

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.020
and told me this yesterday.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.690
He said, I didn't think
this would be anything.

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:14.564
I figured, I'll try it
for a couple of weeks.

00:56:14.564 --> 00:56:16.950
And he said it was like
magic what happened.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:19.350
It creates so many
opportunities.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:20.730
It'll create so many--

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:24.420
whether it's businesses, or
skills, or relationships,

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:28.170
or if you want to meet your
future wife or husband,

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.070
it's this one thing.

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:32.020
And I'm not even
advising people to do it.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:35.725
This is what it's done for
me, and the results of that

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:36.600
have been incredible.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.290
And then number
two, of course, is

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:44.050
making sure no toxic
people are in your life.

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:48.070
You cannot cure a toxic person.

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:51.340
You can only remove yourself
from their presence.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.910
And so be around people
you love and who love you.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:57.160
I know it sounds
corny or cliche,

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.570
but I even described
it in a simple way.

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:05.830
As a hack, to take between
4,000 and 8,000 hours out

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:10.900
of the 10,000 hour rule,
it's so incredibly important.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.810
Those two things
alone are if you just

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:17.162
do that, your life's going
to change almost overnight.

00:57:17.162 --> 00:57:19.120
And you know, we keep
toxic people in our lives

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.540
all the time.

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.430
We think, oh, I have to
deal with this person

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.980
because they're my cousin,
or they're my neighbor,

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:27.590
or they're my friend
since high school.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:30.490
Well, let me tell you something
is important about that.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:33.430
The guy who lives in another
town who you never see,

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:35.440
that's never the toxic
person in your life.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.450
It's always the
people close to you

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.190
that you think
you can't get away

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.680
from that are the toxic
people in your life.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.760
And that's the hard thing
for people to realize.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.260
Oh, no.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.940
That's my grandma.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.720
I can't avoid her.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.670
Well, I'm sorry.

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.730
You only live one life.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.640
Are you going to spend
a big percentage of it

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.830
with somebody who's
going to ruin your life?

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.370
Anyway, I don't want to end
on a negative note, though.

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:01.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:03.760
So I will say that
10 ideas a day

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.780
and being around people
you love and who love you,

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.460
that hacks' really
the 10,000 hour rule,

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.270
because that allows
you to take failure,

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:16.550
and just fling yourself
onto your idea machine,

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:18.310
and onto these
people who love you,

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:22.855
and they are the safety net
that will bounce you back up.

00:58:22.855 --> 00:58:23.980
JESSE: Awesome.

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.310
Do you guys have any questions?

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:27.835
Yeah.

00:58:27.835 --> 00:58:29.660
AUDIENCE: You alluded to family.

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:33.560
And I was just wondering in
these tumultuous ups and downs

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.820
how that affected your children,
or how did you protect them,

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:41.150
or did you want them
to be part of that?

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:43.410
And then, yeah, that's--

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:45.020
JAMES ALTUCHER:
OK, great question.

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:48.710
So the question is, when I was
having these ups and downs--

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:51.830
and they happened maybe
four or five times.

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:55.100
Let's say three where I went
completely broke to the point

00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:00.260
where I lost a home,
had tax issues,

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.820
was really depressed
and suicidal,

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.560
and there were other
times kind of in-between.

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.580
And how did this affect
my family, particularly

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.080
my children?

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.710
So I had two daughters,
and now they're older.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:19.550
I suppose ultimately, they
would know better than me

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:20.690
how it affected them.

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:25.550
But I tried very hard to
be positive around them,

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:28.560
and not let them see how
things were affecting me,

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.650
and try to put things in
the best possible light.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.930
I suppose that, to some
extent, having two daughters

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:36.350
for me, personally, inspired
me in a couple of ways

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:42.500
to keep going for their sake,
and to show them that this is--

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.170
You can't teach by
telling somebody, do this.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.480
You can only teach by example.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:51.180
And I don't know what
the final result will be.

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.820
They're 18 and 15 now.

00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.460
But I hope that by example
through all these years,

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.030
they turn out to
be-- and so far,

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.779
so good-- they turn
out to be good adults.

00:59:58.779 --> 01:00:02.270
But I always try to buffer
them from everything.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:04.540
I'm sure it worked
to some extent.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.470
It didn't work for others.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:08.930
Maybe in some ways, they're
more anxious about things

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.070
than I realize.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.030
But again, time will tell.

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.660
I did think of it, though,
and being aware of it

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.550
is the first solution.

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.490
And just doing the best you can
is, after that, is important.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.360
But I wouldn't, like,
shake them, and say,

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.290
you're two years old.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.160
We're going broke.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.901
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:25.901 --> 01:00:27.650
Like, I would never
do anything like that.

01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:33.119
For better or for worse,
their mother and I

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:34.160
did get divorced, though.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.940
I don't know if it was
related to all my failures,

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.606
but I certainly wouldn't want to
be married to me at that point,

01:00:38.606 --> 01:00:39.841
so--

01:00:39.841 --> 01:00:41.500
JESSE: Any other questions?

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.220
Yeah.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.546
Hold on one sec.

01:00:45.546 --> 01:00:50.760
AUDIENCE: In 2018, what's your
thoughts on going to college?

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.670
JAMES ALTUCHER: 2018,
what's my thoughts

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.170
on going to the college?

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:56.980
The same as my thoughts in 2005.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:00.470
So in 2005, I was a columnist
for "The Financial Times,"

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.420
and I wrote this article,
"Why Nobody Should Ever

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.860
Go to College Again."

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.100
And at the time, I was
the only person saying it,

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.340
and there was lots of people
trashing me on different blogs.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.700
I actually lost some good
friendships over this.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:21.040
And now, I think it's a
more viable discussion.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.810
I think people can have this
discussion without being

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:25.730
slaughtered by everybody else.

01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:34.430
But the way I see it is
in college, so many--

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.040
tuitions have gone up
faster than inflation

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.342
every single year since 1977.

01:01:40.342 --> 01:01:41.800
For every single
year, there hasn't

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.800
been one year where inflation
went up higher than tuitions.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.980
And in part, that's because the
government backs will lend you

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:53.540
money against your tuition,
and it's the one kind of loan

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.120
you can't get rid
of in a bankruptcy.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.430
So of course, let's give it
to every 18-year-old who's

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:01.400
totally unqualified
to borrow this money.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.730
So you create this skewed--

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:08.510
there's already there's a
problem in society where

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:10.910
rich people get
certain benefits.

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:12.440
I don't mean to sound--

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.770
this is not a political bias.

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:14.900
This is the truth.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.910
Rich people have
certain benefits,

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:19.520
and poor people don't.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.680
And that divide gets
greater and greater,

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.230
and that's why we have all this
political strife right now.

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:27.500
More than ever before, we have
all these political enemies.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.620
Like, half of Facebook
hates the other half

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.870
of Facebook, and
vice versa, because

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:35.010
of these political problems.

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:39.560
And I think in part,
it's created by some kids

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.440
go to Harvard, and their
parents can pay for it,

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:47.120
and other kids borrow $200,000
to go to a worse school.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.720
And meanwhile, there's
plenty of places online

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.780
to learn faster and better.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.580
There are so many online
educational resources

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:59.360
to learn more than you would
have learned in college that I

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.970
don't understand
why 100% of kids

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:06.010
don't just learn for free,
better, and start making money,

01:03:06.010 --> 01:03:07.430
and don't go into debt.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:10.520
It seems to me like a no-brainer
just thinking about it.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.960
Now, I have an 18-year-old.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:19.028
And so she was a senior last
year, which foreshadowing.

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:20.900
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:26.000
I kept saying to her throughout
her whole high school,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.470
we need to have
this conversation.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.120
You're not going to college.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.650
And she would just--

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.400
which wasn't really a
conversation, right?

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.860
It's like a command.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.620
And she would literally
just turn around

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.122
and start walking away.

01:03:38.122 --> 01:03:39.830
And I would say, don't
walk away from me.

01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:42.371
It's like the only time I ever
got angry about her was, like,

01:03:42.371 --> 01:03:43.880
on the topic of college.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.320
I'm like, don't
walk away from me.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.060
We're in the middle of a mall.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.310
I want to argue with you in
front of all these people.

01:03:51.032 --> 01:03:53.240
Because that's the only time
we'd spend time together

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.698
was when I would
take her shopping.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:02.220
But I realized several things.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.557
One is, A, I wasn't
being a very good father

01:04:06.557 --> 01:04:08.390
if she didn't feel
comfortable having a very

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:09.830
basic conversation with me.

01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:14.120
So again, I had to
parent by example,

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.250
and show openmindedness,
and listen

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:18.230
to what she wanted
to do with her life,

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:20.490
and offer her real alternatives.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.390
I even wrote a book, "40
Alternatives to College,"

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:27.010
and I self-published it, and
she did not read the book.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.650
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:34.280
So one time I said to her,
look, what do you want to be?

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.640
And I know she's going
to see this on a video,

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.490
but she lied to me, I suspect.

01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:43.160
And she said, oh, I want
to be a neurobiologist.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.940
And I'm like, you have
never once spoken to me

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:53.840
about anything relating to
neuro, or biology, or any ogy,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.240
or any neur.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.180
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.590
You're just not
interested in this.

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:00.476
Are you interested in chemistry?

01:05:00.476 --> 01:05:01.850
Are you interested
in statistics?

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.590
Are you interested in
all these subthings

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:04.645
you're going to have to learn?

01:05:04.645 --> 01:05:06.436
And she's like, yeah,
yeah, I'm interested.

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.330
And so I would buy her
neurobiology books.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:09.470
Did you read it?

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:12.226
Never read it.

01:05:12.226 --> 01:05:15.080
But I knew since she
was in kindergarten,

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:19.310
she's been in every single
performance in her school ever.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:23.330
So I'm like, you
want to be an actor.

01:05:23.330 --> 01:05:25.310
Why don't you act?

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:28.160
And I'm like, well, you
have to go to college

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.430
to go major in acting.

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:30.620
I'm like, no you don't.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.310
The first skill in acting
is learning how to audition,

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:35.750
so here's what
we're going to do.

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:36.999
This is what I offered to her.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:40.670
I'm going to give you in
cash, like, a brick of cash,

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:45.155
the tuition I would have paid
to that school you're going to.

01:05:45.155 --> 01:05:46.530
The president of
that school just

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:49.076
agreed to go on the podcast,
so I shouldn't make fun of it.

01:05:49.076 --> 01:05:49.990
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:56.275
And all you have to do is watch
a movie with me every morning.

01:05:56.275 --> 01:05:57.900
We'll pick a different
movie every day.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.191
You just have to watch one
movie with me every morning,

01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:03.350
and then spend the rest of
the day going on auditions,

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:05.900
because you'll learn A,
if you like the lifestyle.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.450
B, you'll learn how to get
better at auditions when you're

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:11.390
18 instead of when you're 23.

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:13.550
C, you won't have
any kind of debt,

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:19.250
or I would have saved an
enormous amount of money.

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.530
And you'll just be that much
ahead of all your peers.

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:23.488
You'll learn so much more
about acting actually

01:06:23.488 --> 01:06:24.320
being in New York.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.410
I happened to have had Broadway
producers and other producers

01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:28.290
on my podcast.

01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:30.240
It's one call for me
to get you auditions.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.350
That's the real advantage you
have, and might as well take

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:34.560
advantage of it.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.417
And she said, no.

01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:39.000
Instead, she decided
to go to college,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.730
which she's enjoying very much.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:47.666
And so I'm against it, and she's
an adult. And I figured, OK.

01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:50.040
I don't know if I did the
right thing or the wrong thing,

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.680
but I wanted to be
supportive of her.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.900
Now, she's deciding
what to major in.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.960
At least major in acting so you
learn a real skill that you're

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.510
interested in, and not learn
something like neurobiology,

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:02.180
which I know you're
not interested.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.860
It's not like being
a neuroscientist

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.800
is a fallback profession.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.040
Just learn an actual skill
that's very hard to learn,

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.810
acting, and then you could
see if you want to be an actor

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:15.230
and come to New York.

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:18.184
Now, people will
say, well, what's

01:07:18.184 --> 01:07:20.600
she going to do later on if
it doesn't work out as acting?

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.360
Does anyone here-- well, This
is a different sort of place.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.370
But most people I
know don't actually

01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:27.830
do what they learned in college.

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:29.900
I was a computer science major.

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.030
I went to grad school
for computer science.

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:35.390
And then my first real job
doing computer programming,

01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:38.450
I was so bad at
programming, I had

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:42.350
to go to remedial programming
classes for two months

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:46.250
just to be at the lowest level
of my job at programming.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.350
I went to an Ivy League
undergraduate school

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:51.470
for computer science, and I
went to a top two or three

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:53.600
graduate school for
computer science.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.821
Again, many employees here went
to the same graduate school.

01:07:56.821 --> 01:07:57.320
I know.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.940
They were my class.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.820
And it didn't help me.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.410
Only the real world helps you.

01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:08.329
So that's my two cents
on 2018, which is no.

01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:09.162
JESSE: There you go.

01:08:09.162 --> 01:08:09.630
Anybody else?

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.130
JAMES ALTUCHER:
Don't go to college.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:11.975
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:11.975 --> 01:08:14.320
JESSE: Let's pass the mic
over there, if possible.

01:08:18.775 --> 01:08:21.080
AUDIENCE: What's
your biggest insight

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.278
on relationship and dating
that most people don't realize?

01:08:25.278 --> 01:08:27.319
JAMES ALTUCHER: Biggest
insight on a relationship

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:29.210
and dating that most
people don't realize.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:33.170
And to qualify, I am
really not an expert,

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.229
but I will tell you
a couple of things

01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:38.750
I've learned through failure,
and then a couple of things

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.420
I'm trying to guess
as I go along.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.052
First off, I don't
know if you remember

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.010
this book, "The Rules."

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:47.720
It was written in the '90s,
sold 3 million copies,

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.750
great book these two
women wrote about dating.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.204
They were on my
podcast recently.

01:08:52.204 --> 01:08:53.870
And I'm not going to
discuss their book,

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:56.540
but they gave me advice.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:01.080
And their advice to me
was do online dating.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.080
And I said, no.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.060
I'm never going to
do online dating.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.600
And they said, why not?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:12.410
And I said, everything is
related to supply and demand.

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:14.420
The value of how you
look at something

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.550
is always related to
supply and demand.

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:21.770
I sort of feel for me personally
that online dating creates

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:24.800
this illusion of
infinite supply,

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.930
so it reduces the value, for me,
of a relationship, a long term

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:30.710
relationship.

01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:32.450
Now, short-term, who knows?

01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:33.740
That's not what I go for.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.240
I go for a long-term.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.330
And for me, I feel like
having just a feeling

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:41.007
of infinite supply,
well, all right.

01:09:41.007 --> 01:09:42.590
This person doesn't
like Chinese food.

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:43.090
Swipe.

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:44.399
I'm on to the next one.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:48.859
So it reduces this
value I place on really

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:50.240
getting to know somebody.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:56.420
So I prefer meeting
somebody through friends

01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.250
or through some sort
of interactions.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:02.210
But the other thing
that's really important

01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:04.910
is it's OK for--

01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:08.060
you have to have
anger compatibility

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.000
with who you go out with.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.930
You ever have that relationship
where you're arguing over here,

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:16.400
and they're arguing over here?

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.337
And somehow, you're
trying to put--

01:10:18.337 --> 01:10:19.920
I don't understand
what you're saying.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.140
You just said this,
but now you're saying--

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:24.200
you're not compatible in
the way you're arguing.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.816
There's some line of
communication completely off.

01:10:27.816 --> 01:10:29.690
Now, many people will
say, well, that happens

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:30.939
in every relationship.

01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:32.480
But I've seen plenty
of relationships

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.890
where that never happens.

01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:39.020
And they argue, and maybe
they have a serious argument.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.640
But somehow, they resolve it.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.560
So I think anger
compatibility is important.

01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:51.200
The other thing I will
say is it's one thing

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.090
when two people
are able to support

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:54.600
each other through hard times.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.166
If you're in a relationship
with somebody and they get sick,

01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.540
you help them
through hard times.

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:03.079
Or if they fail at business,
which happens to me regularly,

01:11:03.079 --> 01:11:04.370
you help me through hard times.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:10.370
But that is not the
important thing to note.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:12.020
The important
thing to really ask

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.210
is, does this other
person helped me

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:16.130
through successful times?

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:19.400
So let's say you were
dating somebody who--

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.580
I'll just use the
actress example--

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:26.480
they say to you, I
just got an acting gig.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.650
I'm going to costar in
"Ocean's 18" with Brad Pitt,

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:35.100
and I've got to kiss Brad Pitt
in the middle of the movie.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.750
Now, I think a really good
thing is to be supportive

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:41.660
of them achieving their dreams.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.790
And they, in turn, will
be supportive of you,

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:47.330
and that's a sign of an
extremely healthy relationship

01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:48.710
that will last forever.

01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:50.240
And there's even
studies that show

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.190
that that's the type
of relationship that

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:53.010
will last forever.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:55.070
Even more so than the
people who help each other

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:57.320
during hard times is the
people who support each other

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.180
during successful times.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:01.110
So I think that's
really important.

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:05.615
And then finally, I will
quote a good friend of mine.

01:12:05.615 --> 01:12:07.490
I've had both him and
his wife on my podcast.

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:13.590
Basically, he said to me,
the most important decision

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.440
you'll ever make
for your career is

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.690
who you decide to spend
the rest of your life with,

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:19.040
and I really do agree with that.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.210
JESSE: Who was that person?

01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:22.820
JAMES ALTUCHER: So
it's Brian Koppelman.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.420
He wrote "Rounders," "Ocean's
13," speaking of "Ocean's."

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.910
He wrote one of my favorite
movies, "Solitary Man."

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:30.490
He writes the TV
show, "Billions."

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:32.540
And his wife's Amy Koppelman.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.490
She's written three
excellent novels,

01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:37.730
plus the movie, "I Smile Back,"
starring Sarah Silverman.

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:39.830
And they've been
together forever.

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:44.930
We were giving a talk at a--

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:47.090
I was interviewing
him at another company

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:51.617
and he said this to me
either in the talk or maybe

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:52.700
when we were on the plane.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.572
I forget, but I
remember it, though.

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:57.682
JESSE: Do you want to
take the final question?

01:12:57.682 --> 01:12:59.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'd love to.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.810
So I'm super curious
about this, and I just

01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:04.060
felt like I had to ask.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:06.200
So first of all, I
was going to ask you

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.490
what are you most proud of?

01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:10.130
And then I was like, no,
I'm more curious about this.

01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:11.420
And I'm more curious--

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.050
JAMES ALTUCHER: I'll
answer that real quickly.

01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:13.800
I'm most proud of
speaking here at Google.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.690
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:19.280
JAMES ALTUCHER: Obviously
Google, oh my gosh.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.220
I'm speaking.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:20.970
Thank you so much.

01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:24.050
I'm speaking in front of the
best company in the world.

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:27.520
And just to add to that,
Google is such a great--

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.810
I'm going to interrupt
you asking your question.

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:30.350
AUDIENCE: No problem.

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:31.650
JAMES ALTUCHER: Is
that OK on time, or--

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:33.070
AUDIENCE: That's totally fine.

01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:35.360
JAMES ALTUCHER:
So Google, there's

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.200
one aspect of Google that
is such an important lesson

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.430
in life.

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:44.360
When you go to Google, Google's
this one page website, right?

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.530
The search engine, I'm
talking about, Google.com.

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:52.640
You go to Google, and
Google has nothing on it.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.460
There's nothing there.

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.320
But what you do is,
you type in, oh I

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.780
want to learn about
motorcycles, and Google will

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.290
as fast as possible, it'll
literally say to you,

01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:05.730
I don't know anything
about motorcycles.

01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.570
But we've determined
for you, here's

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:12.280
our 10 favorite sites and 400
million more, if you want.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.660
But here's our 10 favorite
sites about motorcycles.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.214
Why don't you go to one of them?

01:14:16.214 --> 01:14:18.380
And so they get you off
of-- they measure of success

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.160
by how--

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.890
you guys measure success
by how fast the customer

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.200
leaves the website.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:31.160
So now, if you want to find out
about, I don't know, tennis,

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.570
where do you go?

01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:35.660
Well, I remember that
other site, Google.com,

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.540
was so good helping me
find out about motorcycles.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:41.567
I'm going to go back to Google
to find out about tennis.

01:14:41.567 --> 01:14:42.650
So what's the life lesson?

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:46.550
If you're the source and
you're willing to just, hey,

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:48.050
you don't have to
give me any money.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.160
You don't owe me anything.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.090
You never even have
to come back here.

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:53.150
Maybe this is the last
time you and I meet.

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.460
But I'm going to still give
you my all and send you

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.027
to the best resources.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.360
Who are you going to go back to?

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.570
You're going to go back to
the source, which is Google.

01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:04.790
Give credit wherever you can.

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:06.470
Give ideas wherever you can.

01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:07.830
Always be the source.

01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:11.690
Be the bank of knowledge,
and information, and giving,

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:14.770
and then everybody comes
back to you again and again,

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:17.900
and that's why I'm so
proud to speak here.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:18.990
What's your question?

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.740
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.530
That was really nice.

01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:24.830
My question, and what
I'm most curious about,

01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:27.530
is what is the story
behind your hair?

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.120
Like, honestly, no lie.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.910
The first article
I ever read by you,

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:34.010
I was just like,
wow, this person,

01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:36.614
he looks very interesting,
and a little funny-looking.

01:15:36.614 --> 01:15:38.780
Like, maybe I'll read his
article and see how it is.

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:39.845
JAMES ALTUCHER: I
look a little funny?

01:15:39.845 --> 01:15:40.775
AUDIENCE: So I've just
always been curious.

01:15:40.775 --> 01:15:41.890
JAMES ALTUCHER: Do you ever
see Malcolm Gladwell's hair

01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:43.200
or Brian Glazer's hair.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.600
AUDIENCE: So I've always
been curious, because it

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.850
makes you stand out, for sure.

01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:49.141
JAMES ALTUCHER: When I worked
in a cubicle, I kept it--

01:15:49.141 --> 01:15:51.120
and wore a suit, or went on TV--

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.440
I used to go on CNBC a lot.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.990
I kept it short.

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:56.540
Now, I work from home
most of the time,

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.010
and I don't really
bathe that much.

01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:59.288
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:02.150
And I just go a little wild.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:05.320
So I had deduced most
of the activities I

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.165
do don't really require me to--

01:16:08.165 --> 01:16:08.930
I don't know.

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:10.760
I'm not dressed up or anything.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:13.910
I have only a few
outfits to my name.

01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:17.390
For a long time, I would never
have more than 15 possessions

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:18.350
to my name.

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:21.972
And I didn't really consider
myself a minimalist.

01:16:21.972 --> 01:16:23.430
I just didn't want
to own anything.

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:25.070
I didn't want to
think about anything.

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:26.450
So I didn't want to
think about anything

01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:27.680
except the things I loved.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:35.660
And just a part of that, I just
live the life I want to live.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.610
I don't need extra frills.

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:39.470
So, I don't know.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.069
JESSE: Anything you want
to plug before we go?

01:16:42.069 --> 01:16:42.860
JAMES ALTUCHER: No.

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.850
I'm just happy.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:46.750
I'm really super excited
you invited me to be here.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:49.260
I'll promote your
dad's two books.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:49.845
Can I do that?

01:16:49.845 --> 01:16:50.345
JESSE: Sure.

01:16:50.345 --> 01:16:53.609
JAMES ALTUCHER: "The
Tools" is a great book.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.150
To be honest, I read the second
book, but I forget the title.

01:16:56.150 --> 01:16:56.900
I have a really bad--

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.816
JESSE: "Coming Alive."

01:16:57.816 --> 01:16:59.907
JAMES ALTUCHER: "Coming
Alive," great book.

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.490
I think we were
planning on having him

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:03.140
on the podcast at some point.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.020
It's a great book, so
I really enjoyed both.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:08.174
But can I say one more
thing about memory?

01:17:08.174 --> 01:17:09.090
JESSE: Yeah, go ahead.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.215
JAMES ALTUCHER: And this
is related to Google, too.

01:17:11.215 --> 01:17:13.160
So I'm always
constantly worried--

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.280
because I'm preparing
so much for podcasts

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.650
and for other things, I
really forget a lot of things.

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:20.600
I'll even be, like,
out on a date and I'll

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.376
forget the name of the
woman, even if I've

01:17:23.376 --> 01:17:24.500
been dating her for months.

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:31.640
So one time, I signed up for
23andMe, which is indirectly,

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.784
I think Google is an
investor, or Google Ventures,

01:17:33.784 --> 01:17:34.450
or I don't know.

01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:35.870
There's some connection there.

01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:40.130
And I had the gene--

01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:44.042
I did the test, the DNA test,
and I had the gene, oh, there's

01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:45.500
a little bit extra
chance you could

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.760
have early onset Alzheimer's,
which is a BS statistic.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.450
If you have a 0.001%,
20% more chance

01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:55.390
doesn't really mean anything.

01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:59.410
It's how doctors
always scare people.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:02.000
So I wrote to the
CEO at the time,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.870
and I said, oh, I
did some research.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:08.000
There's all these foods you
can eat to delay the onset

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.140
of Alzheimer's.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:13.820
How about I write
the AP40e, which

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.560
is like the gene,
how about I write

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:20.090
the AP40e, cookbook,
recommending

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:22.640
all these Alzheimer's foods?

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.384
And she wrote back
instantly, that book

01:18:25.384 --> 01:18:26.300
would be a bestseller.

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.030
You know why?

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:28.580
And I wrote back, why?

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.920
And she said, because
no one would remember

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.190
if they had already bought it.

01:18:32.190 --> 01:18:32.690
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:36.671
So I give credit to her.

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:38.800
JESSE: Thank you so
much for coming here.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.700
JAMES ALTUCHER: Thank
you for having me.

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.991
JESSE: We really appreciate it.

01:18:40.991 --> 01:18:41.500
Thank you.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.850
[APPLAUSE]
