00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.280
Before I continue, I want to
introduce you to what might be

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.050
an unfamiliar concept, although
if you've taken

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.710
chemistry, you might know a
little bit about it-- it's

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.460
called a mole.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.030
This isn't the thing that grows
on your face with the

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.950
hair in it, or the animal that
digs in your backyard,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.990
although those are also
called moles.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.540
We're talking about the
SI unit called a mole.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.390
A mole is just a number.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.010
It's like saying a mole of
something means a certain

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.700
number of something, just like
a dozen-- it's like saying

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.120
that a dozen eggs is 12 eggs.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.970
Just like that, a mole would
be 6-- I always forget the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.550
exact number, but it's 6.023,
or something of that nature.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.700
You could look it up--
I think it's 6.023

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.920
times 10 to the twentieth.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.320
Let me look up the exact number,
just because I think

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.840
that 23 I'm misremembering.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:24.730
The mole is 6.022 times 10 to
the 23 of something, so it's a

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.870
very number of something.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.110
Normally, we don't deal in moles
of eggs-- I don't think

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.870
there has been a mole of eggs
ever produced in the history

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.390
of the universe.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.220
10 to the 23 is a very, very,
very large number.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.240
Where is it useful?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.280
A mole is useful for counting
atoms, and so what is a mole

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.270
of atoms or molecules?

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.450
What's that many molecules?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.220
It's 6 followed by roughly 23
0's of molecules-- a very,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.540
very big number.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.810
What's interesting about a mole
is that when I have a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.880
mole of something, its mass--
let's say its mass in grams. A

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:15.670
mole of carbon: its mass in
grams is going to be equal

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.930
to-- so if I have this many
carbon molecules, its mass in

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.970
grams is x grams. It'll have a
mass of x grams, where x is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:43.616
the atomic mass number of an
atom of carbon, although if I

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:45.750
was talking about a mole of a
molecule, I would figure out

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.770
the atomic mass of the
entire molecule.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.440
What's an atomic mass number?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.010
Let me see if I can do a Web
search on a periodic table.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.800
I'm showing you what I do here,
and it's not fancy.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.030
Let me go to Google, and let's
look up periodic table, and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.260
let's see if we can
find a good one--

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.510
this one looks good.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.410
If we go to carbon, which is
right here, we see that its

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.750
atomic number is 6, and
that's the number of

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.000
protons that it has.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.500
The atomic mass number-- it's
the mass of the entire atom.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.890
And just so you know-- we're
delving into a little bit of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.870
chemistry here-- but most of
the mass of an atom is the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.410
protons and the neutrons.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.290
The neutrons and the protons
weigh roughly the same thing,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.120
and then the electrons are
much, much, much smaller.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.110
If you factor in the mass of the
protons and the neutrons,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.090
you pretty much have the
mass of the particle.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.130
Just a little more chemistry
here is that although on

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.769
average most of the most of
the atoms have roughly the

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.970
same number of protons and
neutrons-- some don't.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.630
Some, you could have a carbon
atom that has seven neutrons,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.910
another one with five, another
one with six, and those are

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.260
actually all called isotopes,
and I won't go into all of

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.560
that-- they're just
the same atom with

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.350
different numbers of neutrons.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:47.260
In general, the atomic mass is
equal to the mass of the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.560
protons and the neutrons, and
they tend to be equal.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.570
So if the atomic number
is 6, the atomic

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.400
mass tends to be 12.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.220
So why is this useful?

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:09.390
We can say if we have niobium--
let's say I have a

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.870
mole of niobium.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.400
If we look here on the periodic
table, it has an

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.840
atomic mass number of 41, and
its average atomic mass-- if

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.770
we were to average all of the
isotopes based on the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.070
weighting of how they exist
in nature-- it's

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.920
92.9, so roughly 93.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.860
It's actually a little bit more
than double its atomic

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.600
number, but let's say 93.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.746
If we had a mole of niobium--
if we had 6.022 times 10 to

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:48.700
the 23 of niobium, it would
have a mass of 92 grams.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.560
That's pretty easy-- look
at any element.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.060
Let's say chromium: we see its
atomic mass number is roughly

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.860
52, and we see that there.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.530
If I have a mole of it-- if I
have roughly 6 times 10 the 23

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.380
three of it, that much will
have a mass of 52 grams.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.800
That's how we think
about a mole.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.930
If I tell you I have a mole of
something, I'm also telling

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.550
you how many of that molecule
I have, and I'm also telling

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.470
you what the mass of that mole
that quantity will be,

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.550
assuming that you
have a periodic

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.720
table in front of you.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.030
With that said, and with that
out of the way, let's make

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.110
some more progress with
our thermodynamics.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.990
We said in the last several
videos that pressure times

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.900
volume is somehow
proportional--

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.870
let's call that K.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.530
And this is an arbitrary number,
it's not some special

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.995
constant-- to the total kinetic
energy of a system.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:10.590
We also said that that is
roughly proportional-- that's

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:18.540
another constant-- times the
number of molecules we have

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.910
times the temperature, because
temperature we viewed as

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.960
kinetic energy per molecule.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.640
In general, we could also say
that this is proportional to

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.060
this, which is proportional to
this, that pressure times

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.100
volume is proportional.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.550
We'll use R, because you'll see
where that's coming from

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.730
in a second.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.160
It's proportional, it's equal
to some constant times the

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.360
number of molecules n.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.150
Here I just take the absolute
numbers-- if I had five

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.990
molecules, I'd put a five here,
but now this n, I'm

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.240
counting in moles.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.110
If this n is 1, that means that
I have 6.022 times 10 to

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.490
the 23 molecules.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:11.480
One mole equals 6.022 times 10
to the 23, so I'm just saying

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.590
that this is another way to
write the number of molecules,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.840
and then that's times
temperature.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.910
Then if we rearrange
it-- PV equals nRT.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.340
We have a relationship, that
if I know the pressure, the

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.750
volume, and the number of
molecules, I can figure out

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.230
the temperature, or if I know
the number of molecules, the

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.630
temperature, and the pressure,
I can figure out the volume,

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.460
assuming I know what R is.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.799
I'm about to tell you
what that is.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:46.230
R is called the universal gas
constant, and it is R is 8.31

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:53.030
joules per mole-Kelvin.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.140
That kind of tells you what
you need in this formula.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.260
This should end up being
joules, so if you have

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.930
pressure in pascals and volume
in meters cubed, you'll end up

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.050
with joules there.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:15.065
This should be in moles--
this is 8.31 joules per

00:09:15.065 --> 00:09:15.740
mole-Kelvin.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.080
And then this, as we always
said, should be in Kelvin.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.110
Honestly, if you just memorize
two things in all of

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.090
thermodynamics, you'll probably
be able to do 95% of

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.950
problems, but you actually
should have the intuition of

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:28.980
how they work.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.560
Just remember that PV over T
is equal to a constant, or

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.880
that if you change them, they
relate to each other in that

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.860
they all equal a constant, so
P1 times V1 divided by T1 is

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.130
equal to P2 times V2
divided by T2.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.440
You also should just need to
memorize PV is equal to nRT,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:00.000
where R is equal to 8.31
joules per mole Kelvin.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.660
I know you might not have a
lot of intuition of this

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.580
formula yet, because I haven't
used it, but I'm going to do

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.450
that in the next video.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.300
These are literally the two
most important things you

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.450
should know in thermodynamics,
and hopefully you have a

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.600
little intuition at this point
of what they mean.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.030
See you soon.
