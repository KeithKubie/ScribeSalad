[? LAURIE: ?]

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.340
Hello, and welcome.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.580
We are really pleased
to be able to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.050
introduce John Paul Caponigro.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.920
He's more than just a talented
photographer.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.290
He is a gifted visual artist.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.680
He shares his vision and
creativity through his images.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.830
And you'll be seeing
that today.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.080
He does lectures, seminars, and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.510
workshops as well as writing.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.150
And today, he'll share his
creative process and inspire

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.760
you in this journey
of discovery.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.560
And one of my favorite quotes
of JP's is, "How the artist

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.390
gets there is, perhaps, just
as important as how they

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.540
arrive." JP is a member of the
Photoshop Hall of Fame.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.990
He's a Canon Explorer
of Light.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.740
And he's a contributing editor
to photographic magazines and

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.070
a sought after lecturer
around the world.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.780
So we're pleased to be able
to present our series of

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.450
photographers at Google, Mr.
John Paul Caponigro.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.412
Thank you.

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:51.374
Thank you.

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:54.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.480
JOHN PAUL CAPONIGRO: Thank
you, [? Laurie ?].

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.370
And thank you, Google.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.630
Thank you guys for
coming today.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.620
And thanks for helping build
something I use every day.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.810
It's a different world as a
result of what you guys are

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.480
doing, and it's pretty cool.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.410
I wanted to talk
today briefly--

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.720
maybe, a little too
briefly, we'll

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.370
just scratch the surface--

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.620
about the creative process.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.830
There's a lot of pixel peeping
that goes on in the industry

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.580
of digital photography.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.240
And, in many ways, those
subjects can be the easier

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.150
things to discuss.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.560
Sometimes, maybe we don't talk
about the creative process,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.410
how we got where we got, where
we started, why we ended up

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.760
where we ended up.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.830
Those are, sometimes, a
lot harder to discuss.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.750
And in part, I think
that's because it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.390
a process of discovery.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.980
Particularly as artists, we
don't always know what our end

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.570
result is until we
get started.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.350
But somewhere along the way,
we start to get clues, like

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.395
solving a mystery.

00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:59.890
We find pieces that start
to fit together.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.930
And we do get into certain
creative modes and perform

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.600
certain creative operations that
are repeatable, can be

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.509
consistent, that we can share
with other people.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.880
And those are the kinds of
things I want to discuss

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.520
somewhat today.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.410
One definition of creativity--
and I know that there are a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.540
lot of them.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.300
You can find a whole collection
of quotes on

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.440
creativity on my website.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.250
I collect quotes.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.160
And I put 'em out on my social
networks including, Google+--

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.860
is to create a shift in
perspective, to see things in

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.670
a new light.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.640
And one of the things that I
wanted to do is share some of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.450
the stories behind a few of my
images, both as a visual

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.240
introduction to the kinds of
things that I do and as a way

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.590
of sharing how being engaged
in a creative process--

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.510
and I really like to talk about
it as creative process,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.570
not necessarily engaged in
photography, not necessarily

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.020
engaged in drawing, not
necessarily engaged in writing

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.490
or any of the other creative
operations, modes, media, that

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.280
I use synthetically,
holistically in my process--

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.950
when you engage in that,
your perception shifts.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.490
We do this in part to understand
the world a little

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.190
better and also to understand
what's inside of us, which is

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.750
often one of the hardest things
to bring to light and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.720
one of the reasons that
I make the types of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.500
images that I make.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000
Robert Frost said something
that I think is wonderful.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.280
No surprise to the writer, no
surprise to the reader.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.330
So I think that process of
discovery has to start here

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.840
with each of us in a creative
process, so we have to be

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.200
creative with our process, and
that each one of our processes

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.320
will change over time.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.175
And then, each one of
ours is unique.

00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:40.960
There's a different state
or a different flow

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.590
at different times.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.800
So I want to share some of the
stories that have changed the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.640
way that I think about making
images and think about

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.450
photography, or just
images in general.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.920
One of the reasons I got
involved with photography is

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.690
that photography can
show us so much.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.120
And I think one of the best
things about photography is

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.920
that it can record
so much detail.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.000
And one of the worst things
about photography is that it

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.380
can record so much detail.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.050
And the big question then is,
is what's inside the frame

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.860
significant detail?

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.970
Secondarily, how do we know?

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.550
One of the things that
attracts me most to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.140
photography is that
it can freeze a

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.579
fast-moving moment like this.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.480
I can sense these complex
relationships

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.040
dimly, perhaps diffusely.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.470
But they're moving too fast for
me to really consider them

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.030
at length and to compare them
to patterns before and after

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.130
and how they change.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.400
There's something about the
still image, being able to

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.510
freeze really complex
relationships, that's really

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.650
quite fascinating.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.340
You could look at Eadweard
Muybridge's work and how it

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.780
changed the way that we think
about time and motion, how it

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.110
answered the debate of whether
a horse's hoofs are all off

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.370
the ground as it runs.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.400
One interesting question
becomes, at what point do we

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.470
stop verifying our own
perception and rely on the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.570
documents, the objects that we
create, as a way of deciding

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.300
what's real or truthful.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.570
We're in this very interesting
time, where we're becoming

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.460
increasingly cybernetic.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.810
And we're deferring that notion
of the eyewitness to

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.880
the tools that we use.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.790
And we have to be careful about
that, because we're

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.850
deeply involved in the creation
of the tools, the

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.590
objectives, how they're used.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.638
Objectively only happens
by degrees.

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:26.370
What you know changes
what you see.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.782
What you see changes
what you know.

00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:32.970
The French psychologist Piaget
really tells us about this

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.650
whole process.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.150
And I think it's one of the
reasons why a visual creative

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.130
discipline is so important.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.936
Because the more you can
see, the more you know.

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:42.320
And the more you can see
in many ways, well, you

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.320
can see even more.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.150
I find it fascinating that
a viewer's knowledge base

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.220
changes the questions
that they ask.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.880
And I think is so important
ask questions.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.970
Photographers will often come up
to me, look at this image,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.540
and ask how did you
get that exposure?

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.620
There's very little light.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.760
I know that that long exposure,
the light on the

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.980
water, should have blurred
to this mist.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.005
How'd you get that?

00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:08.220
I said, well, I took a clue from
Steven Spielberg, and I

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.040
exposed by day and color
adjusted to make

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.405
it look like night.

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:12.870
Oh, you cheated.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.846
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:14.846 --> 00:06:18.090
JOHN PAUL CAPONIGRO: And it's a
funny statement, because we

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.100
really have to ask, whose
game are we playing?

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.130
I mean, there are rules
to the game.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.330
But there are many
different rules.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.430
One of the challenges in
photography is we have only

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.420
one word for photography.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.210
Now, are we talking about Jerry
Uelsmann's surrealism,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.670
or are we talking about James
Nachtwey's frontline

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.660
documentary?

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.370
We expect very different
practices as a result.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.900
But we have one word
for them both.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.555
And that, to me, seems
woefully lacking.

00:06:38.555 --> 00:06:41.080
We need to update our whole
concept so that we can

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.200
communicate more clearly.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.380
Look at what writers Can you
imagine having one word for

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.560
writing a screenplay,
fiction, poetry?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.945
Well, how about just fiction
and nonfiction?

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:54.650
It's a lot more elegant than
photograph and photo

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.110
illustration.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.580
What kind of photo
illustration?

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.540
For medical and forensics,
or for--

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.300
you see where I'm going.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.530
We need to update
our language.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.630
Astronomers ask me entirely
different questions.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.380
They say, where did you find
that constellation?

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.140
I don't recognize it.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.360
I said, yes, you're right.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.040
I painted it in Photoshop to
make it look more like my eye

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.290
sees and less like the hard
colored points that sometimes

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.660
streak in the camera.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.060
So based on their knowledge
base, they're looking at it

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.300
totally differently and making
different assumptions, and

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.860
bringing something different
to the game.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.400
And I think we have to
understand that our viewers

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.100
are always bringing something
to the game of looking.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.530
And it as a game.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.260
There are rules.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.360
There's a context.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.130
But also, it's fun.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.060
It's really interesting.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.740
It's like solving a mystery.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.980
We all see different things.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.650
One of the reasons this is my
favorite image, probably, is

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.680
not only because it started a
whole new relationship with

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.620
one of my, well, formal
obsessions to symmetry.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.170
It's been a great device to
suggest that other things have

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.620
a life and a spirit but also
because it highlights this

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.580
process of the viewer's
involvement, and it enriches

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.110
my understanding
of my own work.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.210
One evening in a gallery, a
gentleman reeking of Scotch

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.860
and smoke came up to
me and said, I love

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.520
your satanic icon.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.450
And I'm looking around
the room.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.290
And he leads me to this.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.770
And I kept asking him
what he was up to.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.940
But I didn't share my original
thoughts or what I was

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.300
thinking at the time, because
it changes over time.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.170
It gets more complex.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.010
It grows.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.470
Because I thought he was
sufficiently inebriated that,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.080
well, I have this deal that if
I share what I share, I first

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.289
get the other person to
share what they felt.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.350
And I don't want my

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.080
interpretation to supplant theirs.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.980
I just want the two,
the exchange, to

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.952
enrich the whole thing.

00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:48.010
A good friend of mine bought
this image, brought

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.620
it home to his wife.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.925
Look, isn't it beautiful?

00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:52.430
Where should we hang it?

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.770
You're not hanging
that in here.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.930
Why not?

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.530
It's dirty.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.650
What do you mean, It's dirty?

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.440
It's an x-ray of somebody
sitting on a toilet.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.380
Can't you see?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:04.790
JOHN PAUL CAPONIGRO:
Just keep going.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.400
Just keep going.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.350
One of the other things that
I got and one of the best

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.910
compliments of my career from
a four-year-old, who crossed

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.010
the threshold and stopped,
held his breath.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.320
I said, OK, I don't care
how often it sells.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.700
I don't care where it
gets collected.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.210
If you can catch the breath of
a four-year-old, success.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.525
And then, the arms go flying.

00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:25.500
And he starts sputtering.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.960
It was the first time I really
was happy there was glass in

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.760
front of my prints.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.130
And he says, it's, it's,
it's a giant sneeze.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.900
And I'm sitting over in the
corner of the gallery,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.690
watching this whole process,
thinking, I titled it Avra,

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.730
which is the Sanskrit
word for breath.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.235
Breath, sneeze, close enough.

00:09:42.235 --> 00:09:45.060
And it's interesting to ask just
how specifically we want

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.000
to communicate our intention and
how often it gets looser

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.610
and, yet, there still
is a common

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.845
connection, a common thread.

00:09:51.845 --> 00:09:54.210
And I think we want
to look for that.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.230
Sometimes the stories that other
people have shared about

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.120
my images changed my
reaction to them.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.420
And I'm sure that it happens
between each other.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.010
I'll just share one of
the mysteries here.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.610
This image is profoundly
challenging to me.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.990
Because the first time I
exhibited it, four women, over

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.480
the space of a weekend, came and
shared stories in front of

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.340
it about losing a significant
male figure, a

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.370
son, a father, a lover.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.400
The strange thing is this
happened more than two dozen

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.150
times over the past 15 years.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.190
I can't explain it.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.710
I can sweep it into that dustbin
called coincidence.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.920
But I think it has something
more to do with Jung's idea of

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.910
synchronicity.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.610
There's something happening in
front of that, and I don't

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.370
know what that is.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.580
In fact, I'm trying to figure it
out and explore it a little

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.250
more deeply and wondering, how
can I get into that territory

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.240
where something more universal
is shared?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.930
And how can I do work that's
a little bit beyond me?

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.870
Because that's where the areas
of greatest growth are.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.470
I think sometimes not knowing
is actually a benefit.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.710
I remember being in another
gallery show, doing the

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.370
preview with the gallery
director.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.940
He wanted to be able to
tell stories about the

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.310
images over the month.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.515
And I was only there
for that weekend.

00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:02.640
And I came in front
of this image.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.700
And I couldn't remember whether
I'd captured the snow

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.030
or whether I'd rendered
it with Photoshop.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.710
And it got me to look at
the image more closely.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.570
It got me to go and look
at other photographs

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.320
of snow more closely.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.060
And it got me to go and look
at snow more closely.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.160
For not knowing, I became
richer, because I'd looked

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.810
more carefully.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.120
And I think that photography can
offer many opportunities

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.290
for that if we'll only
accept an invitation.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.675
So there's one thing to stay up
in this visual experience.

00:11:34.675 --> 00:11:38.740
And a lot of times, that remains
intuitive and vague.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.450
It's very often useful to follow
it and put this into

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.110
words, even if the words are
just getting things going, to

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.280
have some sense of clarity of
what happened, or what we're

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.452
trying to accomplish, or
what I might do next.

00:11:51.452 --> 00:11:55.270
The first time I went to White
Sands to photograph seriously,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.140
I spent an evening
and a morning,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.600
shot 24 rolls of film.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.533
Yeah, this was back
in the film days.

00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:02.195
I came way with two keepers.

00:12:02.195 --> 00:12:05.355
I thought, OK, two
keepers, not bad.

00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:10.090
I mean, now many images do you
really make that are really

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.326
worth sharing, at least
in a gallery context.

00:12:14.326 --> 00:12:17.120
About 1% is what most of
my colleagues and I

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.030
have kind of agreed.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.820
And that doesn't mean you get to
take your camera and put it

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.910
on motor drive and
hope that one--

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.410
kind of the spray and
pray phenomena--

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.010
doesn't work as well as being
a little more considered

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.470
looking at your first shot,
figuring out how to improve

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.450
it, looking at the successes
and then how to do other

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.310
successes that might build on
those successes and even get

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.940
out of certain grooves or
out of certain ruts

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.676
and into a new groove.

00:12:41.676 --> 00:12:43.500
It's useful to be a little
more considered.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.500
But I hadn't really figured out
why I liked this image.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.230
I hung it.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.980
It wasn't quite as surreal
as some of the impossible

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.160
symmetries or floating stones
that I'm known for.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.720
It helped a lot--

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.630
well, it felt good-- when my
father came in and patted me

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.450
on the back one morning.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.840
Because I had put in my dining
room, spent some time with it.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.740
I think it's really useful to
spend time with your images,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.370
one of the great things
about prints.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.820
It's one thing to have
them in hard drives.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.860
It's one thing to have them
up on social networks.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.710
But how often do we consider
them casually, for a sustained

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.700
time, a little more officially,
like over time?

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.740
You think a lot about how you
interact with your images.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.990
So Dad came in and said,
that's a good one kid.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.880
You managed to avoid all
the West Coast cliches.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.740
I went, that feels good.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.260
That's great.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.940
But I still hadn't found
what I was looking for.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.120
Until my father-in-law, an
engineer, came in and squinted

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.500
and said, is that water?

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.570
Got it.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.915
I'm not photographing
grains of sand.

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:39.230
I'm photographing waves.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.535
Now, I had to take his water
and turn it into my wave,

00:13:41.535 --> 00:13:43.750
important to personalize
the language.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.220
But once I did that, I went
back to the same scene,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.570
photographed for the same amount
of time, then came up

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.120
with a dozen keepers.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.110
Because I was focused
along lines that

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.780
were relevant to me.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.530
And I had found a theme that
worked through almost all of

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.750
my work, the idea of waves.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.455
These were just slower-moving
waves.

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:02.550
Ironically, after that long,
hot walk, I took shelter in

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.580
the shade of the park sign and
started reading the literature

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.460
for the first time.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.450
These dunes move three
feet a month.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.550
It was there in front of
me all along, you know.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.180
And sometimes, I think
artists get into--

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.000
and we all get into--

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.680
modes where we sense things
intuitively, where we put a

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.310
lot of information together,
both things that we have

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.420
sensed mentally, physically,
the other

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.190
things that we've read.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.890
We aggregate a lot
of information.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.910
And it comes out in the
things that we do.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.840
And it's one of the reasons I
think it's so important not

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.730
just to think it but
also to do it.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.220
Because there's another kind
of understanding that comes

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.360
from actually making
something.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.790
There are a lot of other stories
up on my website.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.660
I want to shift gears here and
talk about, in this case, how

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.750
tools can change perception.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.840
There's an awful lot of dialogue
out there about the

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.130
latest megapixel count or how
many picoliters come off a

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.810
printer, or what kind of
fancy routines you can

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.300
do with your software.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.190
It's fun.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.010
I mean, we live in
an amazing time.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.440
More change to this medium of
photography in the last 10

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.580
years than in its 175-year
history.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:11.380
I remember years ago-- this
was about 15 years ago--

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.290
an analogy in Macworld.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.270
If you took the Rolls-Royce
and the personal computer,

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.870
gave the same decrease in price
and the same increase in

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.230
performance, the Rolls-Royce
would go seven times the speed

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.110
of sound and cost $0.70.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.930
Of course, that's 15 years out
of date, so I have absolutely

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.460
no idea what the new math is.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.140
Very interesting.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.720
Have our ideas about what
photography is, how we can

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.610
practice it, not
how we should--

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.210
remember, there's
no cheating--

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.020
in the arts or in anything,
really.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.100
It's really just a matter
of misrepresentation.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.580
If I put one of my surreal
composites in Time magazine,

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.070
I'm misrepresenting that it is
that kind of photograph and

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.070
belongs in that kind
of context.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.260
There's nothing cheating
about it.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.480
I think we need to just do the
work we need to do and then

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.340
start to make some interesting
statements about what happened

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.990
and decide, well, what kind of
photography is it and what

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.460
uses can I put it to?

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.380
But none of this limiting,
thou shalt not.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.030
Who wrote those commandments?

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.215
Who gave them the right?

00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:13.660
We need to all give ourselves
the right to rewrite that

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.110
playbook and play our own games,
the games that will

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.450
help us get where we want to go
in our own authentic ways.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.425
So it's great to have the
training, not only of a

00:16:24.425 --> 00:16:26.050
painter, but also of
a photographer.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.120
My dad's a well known fine
art photographer.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.000
And he taught me what I know
about black and white

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.200
photography.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.040
My mother also taught me
about offset printing.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.060
And it was a great
combination.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.060
Because ink jet, digital
cameras, it all came together.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.040
Plus, the compositing,
some of the painting.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.680
She used to be a painter,
as well.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.950
So it was a good marriage of
all of that knowledge base.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.160
But I still have to overcome
my curse of expertise.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.230
I've been trained to do certain
kinds of things in

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.850
certain routines.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.990
And I've been trained to
think in certain ways.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.790
And one of the biggest
challenges for me is to

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.700
rethink what I'm doing, how
I'm doing it, based on new

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.990
possibilities.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.140
And with this blistering pace of
change, we need to do this

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.040
now more than ever.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.170
There are some pretty
wonderful, wonderful

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.450
opportunities.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.770
So one of the big issues in
photography is learning how to

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.170
think within the frame,
how to compose, those

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.220
four essential lines.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.849
The four most important lines
are the border, what's in,

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.819
what's out, what visual
dynamics you create.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.369
What's the aspect ratio or
proportion of that frame?

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.040
But now, with stitching, we
also need to learn how to

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.810
think outside the frame.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:36.480
And it might not be creating a
panoramic format like this.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.480
Sometimes, it's just a matter
of that extra inch, a little

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.850
the left, a little to
the right, a little

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.420
up, a little down.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.160
And I constantly have
to catch myself and

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.700
develop a new habit.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.450
If I find that I'm eliminating,
I would say, oh,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.630
that's the old sacrifice
I used to have to make.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.270
And I'd just pull up or pull
over to get the information.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.170
At the end of the day, all we
really need to do is quote

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.650
Pee-wee Herman and say,
I meant to do that.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.260
That's what my artistic
intention was, like all of

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.350
those art critics some
of us went through.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.060
What is your intention
young man?

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:10.500
I don't know.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.210
You tell me.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.610
And so it's also useful to
remember these panoramic

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:20.050
formats are both vertical
and horizontal.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.125
Or if you're David Hockney,
they're all over the place--

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:26.560
a pretty interesting way of
representing what to us is a

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.870
very dynamic, fluid--

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.322
first alarm.

00:18:31.322 --> 00:18:33.590
I knew this was going
to be fast--

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.474
a very dynamic, fluid
process of looking.

00:18:37.474 --> 00:18:41.480
Now, how do we represent
that in a still frame?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.120
So I'm not going to go through
the Photoshop routine of just

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.960
merging those two.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.680
It's fairly simple.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.740
Just to remind you, and remind
myself, that there are

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.990
multiple ways to merge it.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.890
And the way that I go through
it will change different

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.820
relationships within
the image.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.570
Now, I have the question,
do I crop or do I clone?

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.150
Well, it depends on what
kind of photography

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.970
I'm trying to make.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.230
And also, I think, it depends
on whether it's relevant.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.580
If I clone in something like the
top of this sky, it's just

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.360
white texture.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.590
Is that really cheating?

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.920
Is that really
misrepresentation?

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.585
Should that no longer qualify
as documentary?

00:19:21.585 --> 00:19:24.220
I'm not sure it's
really relevant.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:33.040
On the other hand, if I take a
panoramic stitch like this--

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.090
and I know certain distortions
are involved in that, and

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.210
we'll come back to that
in just a second--

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.020
I can then decide, do I
crop, or do I clone?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.410
How much do I crop or clone?

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.680
If I decide to crop this much,
because I want to make sure

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.390
that's there and I'm left over
with this, am I willing to

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:47.690
clone that out?

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.500
If I do something like that--
and it's amazing how fluid

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.580
that is today--

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.840
so if we do something like
content over a film.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.100
And believe it or not, they've
even got stuff on mobile

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.180
platforms these days for this
kind of technology that will

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.330
sample other areas.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.830
Now, if somebody is looking at
it from a geologic standpoint

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:15.310
or from cartography, Houston,
we have a problem.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.150
I'm going to get fired
from the "Sun-Times".

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.446
Well, maybe not the "Sun-Times"
but "New York

00:20:18.446 --> 00:20:18.660
Times."

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.650
JOHN PAUL CAPONIGRO: OK, like,
in my case, though, if I'm

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.710
making a fine art print,
is it really relevant?

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.790
Does it matter?

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:27.700
Am I willing to aestheticize.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.800
Depends on the type of image
that I'm making.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:35.380
And often, I'll make multiple
kinds of images presented in

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.680
context with one another.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.610
And the clues that I do or don't
do something indicates

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.670
what kind of photograph it is.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:47.360
So what about taking an image
like this and turning it into

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.180
an image like that?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.100
Yes, of course, there are
special effects added to that.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.490
But look at the spatial
relationships in that.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.010
Now, lens profiles were designed
to cure the side

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.510
effects of lenses,
an interesting

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.740
proposition right there.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.210
So the optical system introduces
distortions, which

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.640
are OK in journalistic
contexts.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.410
Or it's useful to identify
those in forensic areas.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.200
You need to know what was
involved so you can

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.810
interpret the data.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.110
And I think that's the most
important thing, disclosure,

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.990
so we can understand what's been
done and how this thing

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.290
has been created.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:30.690
But if I start to do something
like arbitrarily change the

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.170
spatial relationships, pulling
the foreground forward,

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.515
pushing the background back,
making this feel longer.

00:21:37.515 --> 00:21:40.600
It increases the sense of
recession within the image.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.380
It compacts relationships
here.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.975
You can see this kind of
thing in swings and

00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:47.670
tilts with view cameras.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.820
Now, this is being able
do it after the fact.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.490
And one of the challenges here
is to be able to think

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.590
predictably in the field.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.312
Should I change my
angle of view?

00:21:58.312 --> 00:22:00.530
Or shall I change some
of those spatial

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.790
relationships in post?

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.070
It's got me thinking about
framing in a very different

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.570
way than I used to.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:10.910
And it's calling me to develop
a new habit to explore the

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.730
relative proportions, the
spatial relationships between

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.300
objects in the frame, so that I
can make them more powerful,

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.590
make them more expressive, fine
tune it, whether subtly

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.640
or dramatically.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.540
Sometimes, just using this just
a little bit produces a

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.760
lot of change.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.590
But it's a new habit that I
think we all should be aware

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.830
that it might benefit many
of us to acquire.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.800
This is not the way that I was
trained to think about

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.710
photography.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.830
And we just have to remember,
it's not the same photography

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.200
that it was so many years ago.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.230
For instance, will the
real photograph still

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.830
please stand up?

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.845
OK, so it's a composite.

00:22:51.845 --> 00:22:55.350
I guess none of them are
a real photograph.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.490
Now, it's a different
kind of photograph.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.250
OK, so let me rephrase
the question.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.800
See how important phrasing
the question is?

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.240
Which Is the original aspect
ratio or the aspect ratio that

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.940
I finally landed on?

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.720
I think, we'll all agree, that
we have a different visual

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.340
response to a horizontal
panorama than we do to

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.730
something that's horizontal,
square,

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.970
vertical, or vertical panorama.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.880
Now, we could do that
very convincingly.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.310
Let me show you.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.110
So I'm just going to duplicate
the layer here

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.250
and transform it.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.300
Child's play, right?

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.770
Edit, transform.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.830
We're just going to
distort the frame.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.500
Past a certain point,
you can see things

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.810
get obviously distorted.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:46.770
And if you hadn't seen the
original, would you know that

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.800
something like that had
been distorted?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.640
Probably not.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.550
After all, you've been looking
at a slightly distorted

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.260
presentation this entire time.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.646
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:56.646 --> 00:23:58.400
JOHN PAUL CAPONIGRO: But do you
see, there's more than one

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.200
way to distort it?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.090
If I came back in here and
used content or a scale

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.930
similar to the content or a
fill, is looking at the

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.540
smoother areas in the image and
compressing them more--

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.350
look at the glacier.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.380
Do you see the relationship
between the mountain and the

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.920
edge of the glacier and as that
white, dead space in the

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.000
middle gets compacted--

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.700
see how much more forceful
the image becomes?

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.300
Now, let me distort them to
the same amount, because I

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.590
want an apples to apples
comparison here

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.700
or oranges to oranges.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.400
So one has been distorted
distorting the sky and the

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.180
smooth area of the snow
more than the other.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.420
And you see the different
proportional relationships?

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.940
Certain areas have been
distorted more than another.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.900
And of course, if I was willing
to mask, I could

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:54.490
localize that distortion,
as well,

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.190
bringing them closer together.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.440
So this gets me thinking about
framing in the field a little

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.760
differently.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.685
If I see two objects that are
far apart, either top to

00:25:03.685 --> 00:25:06.970
bottom, left to right, I know
I can squeeze 'em in and

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.950
intensify that relationship
between two significant things

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:16.700
in my frame, either by changing
my angle of view.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.110
And if there is a wall or a
cliff or a body of water I

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:24.162
don't feel like getting into
after, in post, or both.

00:25:24.162 --> 00:25:26.300
See what this does
to your brain?

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.730
So that's the most important
thing, what it

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.750
does to your brain.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.780
Because you start to see more
possibilities out there.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.360
You start to think
more predictably.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.680
And that's what previsualization
is about,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.080
being aware of what your tools
are capable enough, to be able

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.940
to get the material you need to
get the final result you're

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.600
looking for.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.020
It doesn't mean there's
not a process of

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.770
discovery along the way.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.170
I'm not 100% certain that I want
one form of distortion

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.090
over the other.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.310
But I've got enough material
in my original captures to

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.400
allow me to explore both
possibilities.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.400
I can get where I want to go.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.540
And that's what we would like
to do, be aware of the

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.620
possibilities, photograph more
versatility, make more of this

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.290
situation, and be able to
enhance it further to create

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:11.260
results what we stand
behind 100%.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:16.100
So I routinely play with things
like how the frame is

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.530
divided, selectively distorting
the image, fine

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.660
tuning the proportion of it.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.870
They're very different
visual statements.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.460
And I often like to play process
of elimination, too

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:32.750
much space, too cramped, still
too much space, still too

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.440
cramped, one or the other.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.780
And this process of elimination
helps a lot.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.820
And the other thing that's
really important, to activate

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.660
all of your full visual
intelligence, is to use

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.100
interfaces that allow you to do
side by side comparisons.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.070
I could look at this thing one
at a time and flip back and

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.370
forth between the other.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.380
But I can't make those fast
decisions when you look at

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.070
both together.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.500
Contextual seeing is
really important.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.690
It's one of the things
that puzzles me most

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.420
about iPads or tablets.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.120
We're back to the
Greek scroll.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.450
What happened to two pages, the
image and text, or the new

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.810
book, web page and
text, or a video.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:15.905
You see where I'm going.

00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:16.240
I did.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.910
There's probably a technological
limitation of

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.020
putting two touch screens,
you know, how much more

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.000
it's going to cost.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.670
But to get away from that, side
by side contextuality is

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.020
a huge change in
the interface.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.780
And I think we need to think
a lot about the design of

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:33.970
interfaces.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.025
There was one TED talk that I
thought was brilliant, how it

00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:39.440
was saying that in the
1900s, the dominant

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.800
model was the novel.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.550
In the 20th century, it
was the movie or film.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.760
And in the 21st century,
it's now the interface.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.020
That's an interesting
statement.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.280
So I start to have to think more
predictably about things

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.300
like, well, the basic
building blocks of

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.250
photography, time and light.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.870
I missed my top-selling shot,
because I was still thinking

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.040
in 125ths of a second the first
time I went to try and

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.130
photograph Zabriskie Point
in Death Valley.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.760
A friend of mine shook her
finger at me and said, well,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.900
I'll bet you could do
it differently.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.760
I think she was thinking I
was going to create some

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.961
impossible symmetry, composite
something unusual into it.

00:28:17.961 --> 00:28:19.380
That's when the light
bulb went off.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.410
And I realized I
had to go back.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.160
It took me a year to get back.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.880
And, well, as I was standing
there, photographing the same

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.120
composition over the space of
45 minutes, I was thinking,

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.170
oh, no, I'm looking for dramatic
light in every area

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:32.570
of the image.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.290
There's going to be no
shadow, no contrast.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.270
I had to modify my plan
when I finally got

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.070
to putting it together.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.160
But I had harvested.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.060
I just held to my original
plan enough to get enough

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:49.040
information in enough shots to
be able to recompose that

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.920
lighting situation, which
doesn't exist at

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.050
any 125th of a second.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:56.270
It's sunrise, 45 minutes
later, 20

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.200
minutes later after that.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.620
It's asking me to think more
predictably about time and

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.820
light, those basic building
blocks of photography.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.400
And it opens up possibilities
like this.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.190
The same shots can be used to
render entirely different

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.740
versions of the same subject.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.990
This kind of step being done
routinely in product

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.800
photography, a little tougher
in landscape photography.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.130
But if you've got
passing clouds,

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.860
they're really your friends.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.910
Full open sunlight, edge of the
clouds, beautiful diffused

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.520
light, cloud for shade.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.830
So really, I think, one of the
things I like most about all

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.620
of this is the way that
it changes my mindset.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.470
And I think mindset
is everything.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.850
It prepares you for so much.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:42.690
Like for draftsmen, for a
compositor, to be able to

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.770
think about putting pieces
together, makes me think about

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.710
shooting fragments.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.130
I remember a friend of mine,
years ago, railing, you

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.950
digital photographers,
you can't take a

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:54.935
whole photograph anymore.

00:29:54.935 --> 00:29:57.720
Everything is pieces.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.490
So I had to figure out what I
wanted to do with this and

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.640
photograph a stone from half a
dozen angles, all with the

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.720
right lighting, to be able to
get it to fit together.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.360
And I had to think about how
light would create shadows,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.110
would get distorted across the
surface so they'd be harder

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.310
closer to the objects, softer
further away, and that they do

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.980
contain color.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.260
They're not just black.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.790
What was interesting is, just
like people who write really

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.645
great fiction novels spend a lot
of time observing reality

00:30:25.645 --> 00:30:30.050
and making a lot of notes,
compositors, draftsmen,

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.420
painters have to spend a lot
of time looking at the

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.190
richness of life in order
to recreate it.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:39.150
And a lot of times, this 125th
of a second fast seeing

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.760
doesn't get you to slow down and
consider things a little

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.215
more carefully.

00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:44.520
And when you bump into having
to do something like this

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.420
credibly, the more you start
to get sensitive to that

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.920
stuff, the more credible
your fictions become.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.330
A lot of fun to think about
just how you want to

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.310
recompose an image.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.080
It's so much fun to cheat.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.220
I mean, play.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.960
And, really, I do want to
celebrate that playful spirit,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.550
because it's in that play that
a lot of discoveries happen.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.270
It's also, you know, a little
bit of ingenuity.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.780
You go to the racetrack
in Death Valley.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.030
It's too wet to get out to those
rocks that slide around

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.480
and leave those mysterious
tracks.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.510
So you take the shots.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.940
And you clone out the cracks
and make your own tracks.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.960
Oh, you cheated.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.020
No, I invented.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.920
And it's also very interesting
to ask, how many ways can you

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.800
remove something from a
photograph and significantly

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.500
change the statement and/or
bring something new to it?

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.920
Interesting to think about
bowls and paths.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.750
It's their emptiness
that creates their

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.080
utility, you know?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.570
A room is useful because it has
space that can be used.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.300
When does the elimination
of something

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.210
create something new?

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.010
When is less more?

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.540
So there's a whole new visual
strategy here, just by

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.830
rethinking the game.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.310
And sometimes, you're forced,
in these situations, to come

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.240
up with new ideas, that you
hadn't anticipated getting to.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.590
And you probably have so many
ideas, you need to have a

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.100
sketch book to write all of
these things down, or a

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.050
notepad, something on your
iPhone or your cell phone or

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.290
anything to catch these ideas.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.050
The human mind can really only
hold about seven things.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.680
Unless you're Glenn Gould.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.040
And then, you can probably
hold about 5 or

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.270
10 melodies at once.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:30.780
But he's unusual.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.120
Usually, we can only hold about
seven things at any one

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.890
given time.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.490
And we need some
way to offload.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.200
See?

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:42.040
We need some way to offload that
information and free our

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.540
mind, our processing power,
up to do new tasks.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:51.750
So how we do that is just as
important as what we choose to

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.760
write down, because it will
shift the way that we think.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.710
I remember coming back from
Antarctica, sitting next to my

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.120
friend Arthur Meyerson.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.070
He was watching me sketch on my
iPad as I was working on a

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.020
composition, so I
was thinking.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.000
He leaned over me and said,
JP, your process is so

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.160
different than the
rest of ours.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.230
I said, well, it's not that
different from painters.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.330
You just need to hang out with
a few more painters, Arthur.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.280
But here was a friend who had
known me for 20 years.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.440
And he was still surprised by
how I was working things out

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.230
and developing things.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.070
And I felt OK, it was time
to bring that forward.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.465
So I put together an exhibit,
a Blurred Book to create a

00:33:26.465 --> 00:33:30.450
catalog for it, and now, just
recently released an e-book on

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.700
my creative process, many of
the things that go into it.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.590
And there's a whole section on
drawing, on composition, on

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:42.920
color, and even cell phone
photography as a way of

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.870
playing, exploring ideas.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.660
One of the things that I want
to emphasize is that very

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.955
often we suffer from a
curse of expectations

00:33:52.955 --> 00:33:54.100
that are too high.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.550
Let me ask you guys
a question.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.682
How many of you can draw?

00:33:58.682 --> 00:34:03.030
OK, so I got 10% of the crowd?

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.460
Let me ask you another
question.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.044
What happened?

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:09.600
I don't know how many of you
have read this book.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.310
David Bayles and Ted Orland has
this wonderful book called

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.610
"Art &amp; Fear." And in it, they
relate the story of a

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:21.699
colleague driving his daughter
home from school after class.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.380
She asks, so, Dad, what
did you do today?

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.190
Well, I taught my students
how to draw.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:29.040
When did they forget?

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.909
It's wonderful.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:31.760
Can you imagine a
kid not drawing?

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.060
It doesn't happen very often.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.739
And, in fact, when I go and ask
kindergartners and grade

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:39.250
school students, particularly
the younger they are, we get

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.654
an 80%, 90% response.

00:34:40.654 --> 00:34:43.070
And as they get older, sometime
between the ages of 8

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.940
and 13 or 14, they start getting
more self-conscious--

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.540
fewer hands go up--

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.350
to the point where
we get this adult

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.849
syndrome of I can't draw.

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:51.940
Maybe, I didn't phrase the
question well enough.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.679
I didn't ask you, how many
of you can draw like

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.090
Michelangelo.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.320
So maybe that's not your goal.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.280
It takes a lot of training.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.600
It takes a lot of time.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.580
I can draw like this, but I
don't get the time to put 40

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.010
hours or 30 hours into a
drawing, or even the 20 hours

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.770
it takes to do something
like this.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:11.100
I often don't find it's really
that useful to put the one

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.780
hour that it takes to do
something like this, 1 hour to

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.340
20 minutes.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.340
More often than not, I'm just
sketching on my iPad,

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:21.240
sketching ideas down, knocking
'em out in less than a minute.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.660
It was a tiny little sketch
that Edison handed his

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.550
development team for
the phonograph.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.940
It was this crawly little doodle
that he said, here

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.460
we're going to make this,
the phonograph.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.780
Think how much that changed.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.480
It wasn't a 40-page treatise.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.510
And it didn't exist yet.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.210
So how do you get ideas across
that don't exist?

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.330
Drawing is a form of ideation.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.430
And there are many
ways to draw.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.930
And we don't have
to look for--

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.520
what are we even going
to call it--

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.230
sophisticated ways of drawing?

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.000
I wouldn't even say that.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.420
Because I think you can do line
drawings that are very

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.760
sophisticated, very simple
things that have very

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.630
sophisticated thought patterns
behind them.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:05.010
We don't have to look for
finished results, if that's

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.320
not what we're ultimately
going to produce.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.920
But it can very definitely
help enhance any of our

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.150
creative efforts.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.670
I know that it does for me.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.340
When I go into a situation, I
often take inventory of an

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:17.990
environment.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.680
So I'm in Antarctica
for the first time.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.315
It's a completely surreal,
unusual environment.

00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.430
And I'm taking stock.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.990
I've got moon.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.690
I've got sun.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.900
I've got clouds.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.280
I don't have any stars, because
it's not dark enough.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:28.900
I've got mountains.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.520
I've got iceberg.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.600
I've got ocean.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.840
How many other components?

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.040
I might have an island.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.090
So I draw 'em out.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.110
Not the specific ones,
but I draw a moon.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.310
It's a cloud, a mountain,
an iceberg.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.760
Look, I'm just drawing icons
that I can then reshuffle.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.850
And what if I got
'em all aligned?

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.040
What if they were nestled, that
sense of being together,

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.860
or cradled, scattered?

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.260
I'm still looking for
this one, the

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.775
reflection of a mountain.

00:36:54.775 --> 00:36:58.760
Antarctica, being the windiest
continent, it's hard to get

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.555
smooth reflections.

00:36:59.555 --> 00:37:02.200
Maybe I'll have to
composite this.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.660
But what I didn't realize
when I was down

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.280
there the first time--

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.430
I ended up doing an editorial
body of work, and it doesn't

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.030
fit neatly into that
body of work--

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:12.950
I've had to reposition it into
a separate body of work.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.770
And along the way, other ideas
have come to light.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.180
The interesting thing is, when
you draw out the combinations,

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.160
you're more likely
to see them.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.470
So these are some of the images
that were produced

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.250
along the way.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.290
They're not the specific
compositions, but they're the

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.165
same kinds of patterns.

00:37:28.165 --> 00:37:31.580
You know how you rent or you buy
a red car and, suddenly,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:36.710
everybody's driving red cars.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.230
You're sensitizing yourself
to patterns.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.010
And you can use the power of
self-suggestion to be more

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.030
aware of certain kinds of
patterns and tell your

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:47.390
subconscious that certain
patterns are more important.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.130
And there are a lot of ways
of dealing with different

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.660
operations, which can help not
only when you're compositing

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.980
but also when you're
out in the field.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.900
How many significant variations
can I find on the

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.360
theme of a tiny little mountain
at the bottom of the

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.690
frame and a big sky?

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:05.855
Apparently, there are
a lot of variations.

00:38:05.855 --> 00:38:08.310
And I continue to
look for more.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.775
Now, this has become part
of my repertoire.

00:38:09.775 --> 00:38:11.640
It's a pattern that I'm
constantly looking for.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.380
We all develop a familiarity
with

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.970
certain kinds of patterns.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.450
It's kind of our groove.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.820
Because we can see them
very quickly.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.730
And we can get more successful
images that way.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.270
We start to understand
'em better.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.900
We learn how to make
those stronger.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.020
We practice.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.280
Practice makes better.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.540
Forget about perfect.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.700
And some patterns won't
come as easily.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.290
But if you can identify
the pattern and

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.510
practice, it's easier.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.410
Strange thing.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.250
If you write something down,
you're 72% more likely to take

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.600
action on it.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.860
So if you sketch something out,
I'm not sure what the

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.220
percentage is, but you're far
more likely to recognize that

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.345
pattern, to learn
new patterns.

00:38:48.345 --> 00:38:50.040
See, it's all about pattern
recognition.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.390
It's about recognizing
the pattern.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.720
And it's also about creating
patterns, as well.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.020
I want to leave on a note that
I think is very important.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:04.290
It's very hard to be spontaneous
in any arena that

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.070
we have a high degree
of expertise in.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:14.542
To play, to be spontaneous
in that, is challenging.

00:39:14.542 --> 00:39:16.930
It's one of the reasons I
love cell photography.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.110
I challenge myself to take on
a number of experiments and

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.700
photograph things I normally
wouldn't photograph, things

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.240
that don't reinforce my brand.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.890
This is just for play.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.590
I have no idea what I'm
going to use them for.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:28.870
I'm simply enjoying looking.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.650
But I'm challenging myself
to try and look

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.600
in different ways.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.410
This is a selection of
images that all have

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.240
this painterly look.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.090
And I'm wondering if it's the
frustrated painter in me

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.030
coming out.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:43.020
Or is it a desire to look more
broadly, to not get hung up on

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.790
the details, to have a more
spontaneous quality to it.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:48.350
I'm not sure.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.670
I'm still figuring that
out as I continue.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.890
I do know that sometimes
they plant the

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.010
seeds for other things.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.730
Most the time, it's
just visual play.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.430
It keeps me sharp.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.130
I enjoy it.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.540
It's fun to communicate
with people.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.980
Once in a while, I'll find a
seed that might be worth

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.226
developing, a shot that I made
a couple years ago at Point

00:40:06.226 --> 00:40:08.196
Lobos with my iPhone.

00:40:08.196 --> 00:40:09.600
And I've set something
in motion.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.630
Because I have returned here
this spring and shot with my

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:16.290
DSLR in a very focused way and
was able to be very productive

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:19.770
in three short sessions and
bring a certain kind of

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.270
intensity and understanding,
because I'd done some of the

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.120
visual research.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.690
I strongly recommend that you
allow yourself to play, not

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:30.050
only to rekindle that creative
process, that spirit.

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.910
Because we get involved in
creative lives, because it

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.340
reinvigorates us.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.770
It refreshes us in
so many ways.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.010
It not only freshens
our perspective.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:39.120
It puts energy into
our system.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.870
It keeps our minds stimulated
in interesting ways.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.740
But along the way, we often
discover some things that are

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.860
personally relevant, that
are resonant within us.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.380
Sometimes it surprises
us what we discover.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.180
And I think it's important to
give ourselves permission,

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.430
make a little space in our
lives, to be a little less

00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:01.062
results-oriented, to be a
little more authentic.

00:41:01.062 --> 00:41:04.420
We go some places we never
expected to go, because that's

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.520
part of the process
of discovery.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.150
I think photography is
just one component in

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.820
a process of discovery.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.940
It may be the area that I have
a degree of expertise in.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.320
It might be what I do
professionally.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.690
But I have to watch my curse of
expertise and remind myself

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:26.090
to rekindle that little kid who
could draw, that little

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.620
kid who could.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.990
Picasso said, it takes a long
time to grow young.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.190
I don't think so.

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.590
We were kids once.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.345
We could all draw.

00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:38.265
We were all spontaneous.

00:41:38.265 --> 00:41:40.790
You ever met a kid who's
not creative?

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.050
You ever met a kid who doesn't
ruthlessly, mercilessly push

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:44.670
the envelope?

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.965
Hey, Dad, you know that rule
that you said yesterday?

00:41:46.965 --> 00:41:48.160
Does that still apply today?

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.670
Let me test that.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:51.020
They reconfirm, right?

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.150
They're natural-born scientists,
you know.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:58.150
Theory, test, reconfirm,
all right?

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.360
Endlessly inquisitive.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.590
And, I think, if we can rekindle
that spirit and allow

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:07.240
ourselves to move into modes
that are less focused, we

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.530
might discover more.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.030
Part of the issue is
being able to get

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.850
outside of our box.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.680
The thing that is really neat
is that we can adopt many

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.000
different boxes, create boxes
of our own creating, switch

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.110
out the box.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.260
I mean, in order to think
outside the box, you first

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.250
have a box, right?

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:27.060
But you don't have to play with
one box your entire life.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.670
And you can mix and match.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:32.590
And it can be very inspiring
to do that.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:38.080
So I encourage you to engage
in those ideas and allow

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.910
yourself a little time to find
out what your photography is,

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:44.670
certainly to be aware of what
the new possibilities are.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:48.510
Because they're very
expansive.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.020
We have this embarrassment
of riches today.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.660
And rather than doing
everything, I think we have to

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.800
make some choices as to what's
most relevant for us.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.600
But a little bit of exposure to
what's possible out there

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.930
will help you make better
choices along the way.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.360
And it's certainly stimulating
and a lot of fun.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.280
Thank you for coming today.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.925
And I'd be happy to answer
questions after this.

00:43:08.925 --> 00:43:11.830
I wish you good photography
or a visual life.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:17.082
