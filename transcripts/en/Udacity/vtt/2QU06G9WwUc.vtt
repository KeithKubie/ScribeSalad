00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The first approach I'll talk about--I'll call it Solution #0

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because it's really not even approaching a solution--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is to have pairwise shared keys.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the idea here is for everyone who ever might want to communicate

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to get together and form keys between them,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so let's say this is Alice, Bob, Colleen, Diana,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
someone whose name starts with E, and someone whose name starts with F.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And Alice would set up a pairwise shared key, secretly communicating

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with each of the other people.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Bob has a shared key with Alice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Bob would find a shared key with all of the other people

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that he might want to communicate with, and Colleen needs to find

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a shared key with the remaining people, and so forth.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And you would have a key between every pair of people,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and so whoever wants to communicate, well,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
if it's between Colleen and Edgar, they would have a shared key

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that they've previously established to communicate.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This might work for a small number of people.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If we have a large number of people, this gets to be ridiculously expensive,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so we'll have a short warmup quiz to see how expensive.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The question is how many keys would we need

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
if there was a group of 100 people, and any of pair of them

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
should be able to communicate secretly with each other?
