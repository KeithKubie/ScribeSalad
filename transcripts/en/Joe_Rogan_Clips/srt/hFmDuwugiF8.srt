1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,270
The mistake of doing yesterday,

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,930
I watch ace Ventura pet detective with
my eight year old and my 10 year old

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,050
seen that in since they
came out with a good still,

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,440
I didn't realize how Trans
phobic that fucking movie is.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,573
Boiler alert.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,280
The whole premise is that
there was a venture vegetated,

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,040
I gotta split alert myself cause I
forgot the whole premise was wet.

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:26,920
This guy steals a dolphin
and when he steals a dolphin,

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,890
ace Ventura fines,
cause he's a pet detective,

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,100
finds a tiny ruby that's at the bottom
of this dolphin tank that is missing from

11
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,290
a Miami dolphins ring.

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,770
And he finds out through this exhaustive
search that the one guy who he couldn't

13
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:49,390
account for his ring was a kicker
who fucked up the world series or the

14
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:54,310
Superbowl rather. Yeah. So this, this guy,

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,580
this guy that they've found out is Sean
Young in the movie who's gorgeous and

16
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,120
then in the movie,
take that down please.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,270
So in the movie at the end of it,

18
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:11,070
the reveal is that Sean Young is really
this football player who wants to get

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,650
back a Dan Marino because Dan Murray,

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,830
he's goes psycho because the world
hates him because he blew the kick.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,570
So He's a guy,

22
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:22,400
pretended to be a woman in Ace Ventura
made out with them and just like everyone,

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,700
all the cops are throwing up. Everyone's
throwing up. You can't own or no,

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,990
it's off the charts at the end he
pulls her top off and shows and she has

25
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,180
breasts. He was like trying to show
that she did well yeah, breasts.

26
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,670
And she did and he's like, well
anybody can get those in an afternoon,

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,750
but what about this?

28
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:42,430
And he pulls her pants down and then he
goes by and then everybody sees her and

29
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,830
she's got her legs together
so you can't see your penis.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,750
And then from behind you see her junk
is pressed up against their butt cheeks

31
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,400
cause she's tucked her
penis and her vagina.

32
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,330
So the cops all start throwing
up and then cops start cleaning.

33
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,880
Cops had made out with her and
start cleaning their mouth off.

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,380
They start chewing giant wad
there. That's her, the scene.

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,830
So watch all the cops see that. And he
points to the fact that Sean, you look,

36
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,020
they all start throwing up.
Look, everyone's throwing up.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,260
This is Dan Marino's throwing
up. They also see, oh,

38
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,930
he's getting his mouth because
he made out with her tone.

39
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:16,990
Loke the dolphins freaking out.
Everyone's freaking out.

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,350
It is so insanely trends.

41
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,750
Okay.

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,810
So what the left would say is the reason
that they're right is that a movie like

43
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,570
this won't get made anymore. And
isn't that a good thing? Maybe.

44
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,850
But should they pull it should go, should
it be illegal to have that on iTunes?

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,720
Of course.

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,380
Maybe someone on the world cleft might
disagree with you right now. Yeah,

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,931
they might.

48
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:41,931
You Trans phobic for defending this
horrible cisgendered heteronormative shit

49
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,740
movie.

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,060
That's horrible. And what's crazy,
and I guess this is a great thing.

51
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:53,061
I mean the re moralization project
is working because when I saw that,

52
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm sure is, I don't know what year
did that come out to? 95 four. Okay.

53
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,830
So when I saw that as a 12

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,020
I don't know.
I was born in 84 I can't do math.

55
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,500
I want to say [inaudible] 93 I want to
say it was before I came to Hollywood.

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,840
When I saw that movie I was 10
transphobia was not a thing. No, no.

57
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,540
It is a thing. That's good. That's good.

58
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,480
When things are changing so rapidly,

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,530
but the question is where are the lines
being drawn and is the Overton window

60
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,390
being shrunk too small?

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,870
How do you feel about them pulling the
dukes of Hazzard off the air for the flag?

62
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,630
I don't know about that. You didn't know
about that? No, they pulled the deuce.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,790
Do you understand? Do you understand how
many of these there are a day? Yes, so no,

64
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,590
I don't know that one.
What's that one? This one.

65
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,830
They've yanked the dukes of Hazzard
off television forever because the

66
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:43,280
confederate flag was on the roof of
the generally did not follow that.

67
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,030
I didn't know that. You cannot
watch the dukes of Hazzard anymore.

68
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,670
You cannot watch it.
It's not on television anymore.

69
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,570
It used to be on TV land all the
time. Can you get it on? No. Fuck no,

70
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,220
no chance. They're not going to
show that God damn awful flag.

71
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,390
We have a poster in the bathroom over
there of a Leonard Skinner from like 1970

72
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,780
[inaudible] and they have a giant
Janis Joplin I thought in the bathroom.

73
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,580
Other bathroom. Good jazz shopping.
Oh, that's the other bathroom. Yeah,

74
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,720
there's different boundaries. I like
that one. Yeah, that's great one.

75
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,210
That's her mugshot. I love it.
Yeah, that's right. Um, but the,

76
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,150
the Leonard Skinner one, they have
a giant confederate flag on stage.

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,690
Huge,
enormous in the background that was there,

78
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,020
like southern pride,
this idea of southern pride.

79
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,120
It was okay to have that flag.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,250
I'm basically for trying to,

81
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,980
when it comes to the realm of art
and movies and books, leave it alone.

82
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,660
Try to leave it alone as much as possible.
It's generally a very good strategy.

83
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,810
I agree. Don't want to be in the
book banning movie banning TV,

84
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,630
banning business or editing.
They, they tried to mobile.

85
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,470
I think they did successfully, at
least in some venues. Edit. Uh,

86
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,570
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn because the n
word was used prolifically, you know,

87
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:03,550
I mean the guy's name was nigger Jim.
That was the name in, in, in the book.

88
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,500
Cause that's how people talk back then.

89
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,860
And I think we need to keep that stuff
as a time capsule to show how racism was.

90
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,700
So normative. Yes. Yes.
It's important to, to,

91
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,210
to show the progress like
a Centura up like you,

92
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:26,980
she like for Trans people, keep
him for history, for Trans People.

93
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,900
And it's amazing that no
one's ever brought this up.

94
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,970
I mean I feel like this is something
that's never been discussing on from you.

95
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,890
Joe Rogan, the time I got shit
to do. I got, I got jokes right,

96
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,600
but fuck, this is, you've got an
Israel trip that I'm planning, Barry,

97
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,110
what are you doing to be married?

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,570
I'm not dragging you want to take you on
an amazing trip and then we're going to

99
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:51,850
go to the West Bank and you're going to
see all this stuff and you're going to

100
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,590
come away with loving certain parts of
it and not liking certain parts of it.

101
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,130
And you're going to realize it's a country

102
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,650
just like any other country.
Right.

103
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,280
But it is a democracy and it's trying
to do its best in a really rough

104
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,060
neighborhood and we'll go like, I want
you to see what the occupation looks like.

105
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,280
Like I think that's something
that's really important to see,

106
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,420
to get a full picture of it.

107
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,570
I think you're probably right.

108
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,990
I think it is an important
thing for people to see. Um,

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,340
I think there's a lot of parts of the
world that I need to see to really get a

110
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:20,580
grasp. Where do you want to go?
Where you're going next in the world?

111
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,660
You travel a lot. Yes. Um, I don't know.

112
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,770
I mean I'm,
my family and I,

113
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:29,990
we do a European vacation trip at that
doesn't really count. We just loud.

114
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,350
It's just fun. Um, went to Thailand last
year. That was fascinating. Oh, cool.

115
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,410
Thailand was fascinating because,
and that was kind of a vacation trip too.

116
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:42,411
But that's such a unique culture
because Thailand is run by the king.

117
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,480
Like if he even criticized the
king, you're, you're fucked.

118
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,080
Like you're in real trouble. And
his pictures everywhere, everywhere.

119
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,730
There's pictures of him and the throne,

120
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,540
like wearing like super nice
clothes and looking good. Um,

121
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,210
but the people are so kind.

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,620
They're so friendly and they're always
smiling and they have, you know,

123
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,200
there's a lot of people that you'll
run into that have very little,

124
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,010
but yet they don't seem to be having a
problem with that. They wear flip flops.

125
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,270
You're on the highway.

126
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,510
There's three people on a motorcycle
is a baby in a basket and I'm not

127
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:15,450
bullshitting.
No helmet.

128
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,300
And a friend that just went
to Thailand and she was like,

129
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,830
but the people are so nice. They're so
nice. They're so kind. It's so anew.

130
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,070
And you know, me and my family, we had,
we always, whenever we go somewhere,

131
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,090
we always have these real
long conversations. Um,

132
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,480
about like what was interesting about it
for you? Like what, what did you think?

133
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:36,880
Like I tried two kids, eight and 10, the
young ones. And I have a 22 year old too.

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,600
Okay. Um, all girls Holla. I'm
from four girls. Woo. Yeah,

135
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,280
it's in the genes. But
the um, the, the, the,

136
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,390
what's fascinating to me
about it is first of all,

137
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:51,360
I love exposing these little people
to different parts of the world.

138
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,510
So they get to see like what this is like,
you know,

139
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:58,590
like here we are like show him on the
map. This is American. We're over here.

140
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
We're way the fuck to
15 hours to get here.

141
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,110
The plane that goes 500 plus
miles an hour. It's crazy.

142
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,420
And just to realize like human
beings are the same but different.

143
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,040
We're the same everywhere,

144
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,610
but there's a different way we
choose to interact with each other.

145
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:19,350
And one of the things that happens is
we fall into their way when we go there.

146
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,070
Like if we go to Italy,
we say [inaudible], you
know, we started, I try to,

147
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:27,840
you try to start in learning, we'll just
start trying to learn some of the words,

148
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,410
you know, that, you know, these people
use in their culture and then, oh,

149
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,810
I forgot how you say it. Cup soon. Crop.

150
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,120
I think that's how you said it's like
thing like hello, good morning. Yeah. And,

151
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:42,570
but they all say that and everyone
makes a lotus flower with their hands.

152
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,730
It's so common.
Everywhere you go,

153
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,990
people greet you and they do this
and it's such a warm, friendly,

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,330
peaceful way of greeting each other.

155
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,760
And so one of the things that we
talked about it, I was like, you know,

156
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:57,810
that's how everybody is like way more
friendly and like greeting and this thing

157
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:01,320
about clasping your hands together and
they all agree to do it and everyone sort

158
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:01,710
of,

159
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,710
it's like this unique pattern that people
can fall into and people fall into all

160
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,544
sorts of patterns.

161
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,690
They fall into like really aggressive
patterns of honking at people on the road

162
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:16,260
and driving real fast. And then they
fall into these peaceful patterns.

163
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,770
And some of it's dictated by culture,
some of it's dictated by climate,

164
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,030
some of is dictated by the
economic situation in the
world they're in. But it's,

165
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,860
it's such a weird trip to go to different
places and see like, okay, yeah,

166
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,600
if I lived over here,
this is how I rock it.

167
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,240
I'd be wearing flip flops
and shorts and you know,

168
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,000
I'd get around this way and this is
the kind of food that I would eat.

169
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,630
And real spicy because you know,
you kind of have,

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,560
have those spices actually protect
against bacteria because they're there.

171
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:46,830
They're actually antibacterial.
Was the food grade fucking amazing.

172
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:50,910
We took some courses, we took classes,
we learned how to cook over there. Yeah.

173
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:55,200
It was amazing. It was amazing. But
my kid got lit up by bugs. Whew.

174
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,970
There's a thing there called tsetse flies.
I think that's what they're called.

175
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:00,661
I forget what they're called,

176
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:05,520
but my youngest had a horrible allergic
reaction to some of the bugs over there.

177
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,040
You get and you, you know, you think like,
okay, like, uh, what about, uh, you know,

178
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,950
there's,
there's fucking diseases that kill people.

179
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Malaria's killed malaria has killed
more people than anything ever.

180
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,750
Like more people have died from malaria
than anything. Oh, I know. Yeah. Well,

181
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,880
that's why gates made
its, yeah, totally. Yeah.

182
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:30,150
And so you go over there like we were
going to go to Africa is one of the things

183
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:30,961
that we're going to go to,

184
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:35,670
but I'm not giving my fucking eight
year old malaria shots. Just know,

185
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,710
just like it's really bad dreams.
I've had some friends that Dave Foley,

186
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,570
who was like the sweetest
guy on the planet earth.

187
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,540
He was from kids in the hall
who was on news radio with me.

188
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,430
Dave Foley was on malaria medication
because he was going to visit his kids in

189
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,680
Egypt. So we had to take this
stuff and he was drinking,

190
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:57,040
you're not supposed to drink on
it. And uh, he, he was going crazy.

191
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
He doesn't even remember anything,
just going crazy,

192
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,030
taking reporters a microphone or as a
tape recorder away and put it in a drink.

193
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,710
It was like losing his marbles.

194
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,860
Like I had to protect him yelling at a
guy and like Crowl I'm like calm down.

195
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,210
Meanwhile the sweetest, kindest,
nicest guy you would ever meet.

196
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:16,620
And meanwhile he was like, like super
aggro was crazy. It didn't make any sense.

197
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:17,970
And it's the medication.
