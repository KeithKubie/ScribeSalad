00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.680
Sometimes you’re at the airport and it’s
too thunderstormy, so you have to stay on

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.680
the ground.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.680
I get that.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.360
But sometimes it’s just hot, or cold, or
cloudy!

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.059
What’s going on planes?

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.289
Why can’t you fly?

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.279
Flight seems simple, though it is anything
but!

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.449
Planes are expected to traverse so many different
climates and conditions, and yet, they aren’t

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.000
magic, they’re based on science and engineering.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.019
So, we try to break them.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.660
Manufacturers flood the engines of their planes
to see how much water they can ingest flying

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.340
through a storm before failing.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.470
They fire dead birds into engines to see how
many it takes to break the internal workings.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.230
Test flights are done in varying levels of
ice, snow, and rainfall.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.300
Engineers even figure out how long the runway
needs to be at different altitudes for planes

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.730
to stop safely.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.850
But sometimes, nature gets in the way of best
laid plans.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.670
For example, during a heatwave, planes can’t
even get off the ground.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.830
Remember when temperatures soared to almost
120 degrees in Phoenix back in June 2017?

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.690
Planes were grounded all over the place.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.650
When a plane is grounded for heat, it has
less to do with hot planes, and more to do

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.430
with hot air.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.690
Airplanes fly when the air moving over the
wing is less dense than the air moving under

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.470
the wing, creating lift.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.250
Hot air is less dense than cold air meaning
there are fewer molecules for the airplane’s

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.250
wing to fly on top of.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.590
To get lift, the plane will need more speed
to get the air moving fast enough to generate

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.680
pressure on the underside of the wing.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.550
In Arizona, the airport just didn’t have
a long enough runway to get planes going fast

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.860
enough when it’s hot!

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.100
So there’s no way to leave the ground.Cold
can also cause problems.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.870
It’s very cold at 30,000 feet and above
-- so you’d think planes would be okay with

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.870
cold…

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.870
But not entirely.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.060
The main issue is still about air moving around
the wing.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.720
If ice builds up on a wing, it can change
how air moves -- screwing up lift, just like

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.770
with the hot air.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.430
But also, jet fuel can, in fact, freeze if
it gets too cold.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.990
There are jet fuel types, just like gas for
your car, and regular Jet A fuel freezes below

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.890
negative 40 C and the Jet A-1 fuel below negative
47 C!

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.580
You probably won’t get that cold even in
a Michigan winter, but in Russia or Antarctica?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.310
It can be an issue.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.799
Airplane manufacturers test their planes to
make sure pilots and engineers know what the

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.120
craft can and can’t do.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120
Just like some planes can fly higher or faster,
some don’t take off well in high winds,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.540
or fly well with a strong tailwind.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.129
Planes are even tested for turbulence tolerance!

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.249
Which ultimately comes down to how far the
wings can flex.

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:36.069
To test that, they put the wings through this
terrifyingly incredible test.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.040
This is a stress test on a wing of a Boeing
777.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.300
They built a machine to simulate the plane
carrying more and more weight, and it finally

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.469
snaps at 154 times what it was designed to
lift.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.480
FYI: there is no way a wing would bend like
that or fall off in regular flight.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.299
We have a video about it.

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.180
The goal of all these tests are to get the
plane to fail under more stress than the plane

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.790
will likely experience.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.189
That way they know it won’t break under
normal flight and landing, and if something

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.319
does go wrong in extreme conditions, we understand
how and why it happened.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.540
All this gives airlines the limits in which
the plane can fly to keep everyone safe.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.540
And it works!

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.290
Commercial flying is still the safest way
to travel.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.359

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.309
Have you ever wondered why some planes look
bigger on the inside?

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:28.309
We talked to some engineers about the tricks
they use to that, you can check it out here.

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:33.400
I love flying in big planes, the windows,
the design… it’s so cool to be in a giant

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.139
tube in the sky and not feel like it!

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.139
