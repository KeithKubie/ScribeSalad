really on like times as
 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.240
really on like times as
events and also are usually these

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250
events and also are usually these
 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.659

cases could be using identification for

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150
cases could be using identification for
 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.420
cases could be using identification for
asynchronous or and directed information

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430
asynchronous or and directed information
 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.350
asynchronous or and directed information
but but in in these cases we recommend

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360
but but in in these cases we recommend
 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.680
but but in in these cases we recommend
developer to allow user to up in or out

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690
developer to allow user to up in or out
 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.610
developer to allow user to up in or out
to that that kind of notification so so

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620
to that that kind of notification so so
 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.939
to that that kind of notification so so
when not to display identification so

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949
when not to display identification so
 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.070
when not to display identification so
they are they're actually quite a field

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
they are they're actually quite a field
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.550
they are they're actually quite a field
like scenarios you probably don't want

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560
like scenarios you probably don't want
 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.379
like scenarios you probably don't want
to use on the dictation one example is

technical operations shouldn't be

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710
technical operations shouldn't be
 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.640
technical operations shouldn't be
included in the notification as well and

included in the notification as well and
 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.490
included in the notification as well and
and sometimes like when you have errors

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500
and sometimes like when you have errors
 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.770
and sometimes like when you have errors
that think that that your application

that think that that your application
 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.310
that think that that your application
can we cover those those are the stuff

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320
can we cover those those are the stuff
 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.100
can we cover those those are the stuff
that probably not a good candidate for

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
that probably not a good candidate for
 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.999
that probably not a good candidate for
notification and finally if you if you

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009
notification and finally if you if you
 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.640
notification and finally if you if you
create if you just think about like

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650
create if you just think about like
 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.409

rebus on those are not good candidates

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020
rebus on those are not good candidates
 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.740

for notification again and in those

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750
for notification again and in those
 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.540
for notification again and in those
cases you probably want to consider

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550
cases you probably want to consider
 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.839
cases you probably want to consider

your user engage with your application

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940
 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.600
so so what's new in jellybean in terms

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610
so so what's new in jellybean in terms
 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.770
so so what's new in jellybean in terms
of notification features on so 11 main

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780
of notification features on so 11 main
 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.140
of notification features on so 11 main
thing we introduced in jellybean is we

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150
thing we introduced in jellybean is we
 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.930
thing we introduced in jellybean is we
we add which notification support and

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940
we add which notification support and
 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.320
we add which notification support and
and I will talk in detail about that

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330
and I will talk in detail about that
 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.170
and I will talk in detail about that
later

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180
later
 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.890
later
um so and another important thing

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900
um so and another important thing
 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.040
um so and another important thing
developers should be aware of is now in

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050
developers should be aware of is now in
 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.760
developers should be aware of is now in
jelly bean or later a user can now

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770
jelly bean or later a user can now
 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.740
jelly bean or later a user can now
disable a notification per application

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750
disable a notification per application
 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.279
disable a notification per application
so so that that's really actually give

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289
so so that that's really actually give
 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.760
so so that that's really actually give
developers I'm incentive to to to do

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770
developers I'm incentive to to to do
 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.879
developers I'm incentive to to to do
notification properly because now we use

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889
notification properly because now we use
 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.730
notification properly because now we use
our tenth completely dislike disable

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740
our tenth completely dislike disable
 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.170
our tenth completely dislike disable
your your your notification another nice

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180
your your your notification another nice
 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.620
your your your notification another nice
things we add in in notification is in

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630
things we add in in notification is in
 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.950
things we add in in notification is in
jelly bean is we added priority so in

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960
jelly bean is we added priority so in
 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.580
jelly bean is we added priority so in
the past developer has t probably choose

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590
the past developer has t probably choose
 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.710
the past developer has t probably choose
to use ongoing education in order to

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720
to use ongoing education in order to
 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.100
to use ongoing education in order to
keep the vacations sticky on on the

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110
keep the vacations sticky on on the
 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.960
keep the vacations sticky on on the
screen but now we have a better

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970
screen but now we have a better
 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.939
screen but now we have a better
mechanism to to handle different angle

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:36.949
mechanism to to handle different angle
 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.560
mechanism to to handle different angle
on the defecation dick tip and priority

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.570
on the defecation dick tip and priority
 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:49.480
on the defecation dick tip and priority
so notification up we dunno if you like

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.490
so notification up we dunno if you like
 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.430
so notification up we dunno if you like
that your parking permit and with we're

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440
that your parking permit and with we're
 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.990

really mean definitely it ok so I think

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000
really mean definitely it ok so I think
 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.480
really mean definitely it ok so I think
ok so for our before we talk about with

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.490
ok so for our before we talk about with
 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.969
ok so for our before we talk about with
notification let's talk about the

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:03.979
notification let's talk about the
 

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:06.129
notification let's talk about the
standard the basic layout for

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:06.139
standard the basic layout for
 

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:09.760
standard the basic layout for
notification so this is what are we we

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:09.770
notification so this is what are we we
 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.350
notification so this is what are we we
have big priority jelly bean so it's

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360
have big priority jelly bean so it's
 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.279
have big priority jelly bean so it's
really um the feel like components in in

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:18.289
really um the feel like components in in
 

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.920
really um the feel like components in in
a notification the content title there's

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:20.930
a notification the content title there's
 

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.100
a notification the content title there's
a lot I con on the left arm come and

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.110
a lot I con on the left arm come and
 

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.050
a lot I con on the left arm come and
also you can put some text under the

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.060
also you can put some text under the
 

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.950
also you can put some text under the
title and also sometimes content

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960
title and also sometimes content
 

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.749
title and also sometimes content
information in the lower right corner

00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759
information in the lower right corner
 

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.180
information in the lower right corner
you can add a small icon and also the

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.190
you can add a small icon and also the
 

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:40.620
you can add a small icon and also the
time of your notification so good next

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.630
time of your notification so good next
 

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.370
time of your notification so good next
talk about which notification so this is

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:44.380
talk about which notification so this is
 

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.610
talk about which notification so this is
again introducing jelly bean and and now

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:48.620
again introducing jelly bean and and now
 

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.850
again introducing jelly bean and and now
one thing kind of special is in the past

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:51.860
one thing kind of special is in the past
 

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.430
one thing kind of special is in the past
we you need to create a

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440
we you need to create a
 

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.690
we you need to create a
we will be able to to create my actions

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:57.700
we will be able to to create my actions
 

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.670
we will be able to to create my actions
but now actions are reading first class

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680
but now actions are reading first class
 

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.920
but now actions are reading first class
citizen in the independent notification

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:02.930
citizen in the independent notification
 

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:08.170
citizen in the independent notification
framework it also a lot more flexible in

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.180
framework it also a lot more flexible in
 

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.900
framework it also a lot more flexible in
terms of science size and layout it can

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:10.910
terms of science size and layout it can
 

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:16.450
terms of science size and layout it can
grow up to 256 DP in height which is

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:16.460
grow up to 256 DP in height which is
 

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.300
grow up to 256 DP in height which is
what we call for unit of notifications

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:19.310
what we call for unit of notifications
 

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:25.840
what we call for unit of notifications
so in in the past is 64 d period of / /

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:25.850
so in in the past is 64 d period of / /
 

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.540
so in in the past is 64 d period of / /
/ notification so you can have four

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.550
/ notification so you can have four

they were just being used as a as a way
 

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.250
they were just being used as a as a way
to do showcase instantaneous information

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:26.260
to do showcase instantaneous information
 

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.840
to do showcase instantaneous information
like hey you have an instant message but

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:28.850
like hey you have an instant message but
 

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.210
like hey you have an instant message but
you can see with all of this capability

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:31.220
you can see with all of this capability
 

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.010
you can see with all of this capability
that we're adding into rich

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.020
that we're adding into rich
 

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.430
that we're adding into rich
notifications it's a lot more than just

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440
notifications it's a lot more than just
 

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.110
notifications it's a lot more than just
conveying you know instant information

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120
conveying you know instant information
 

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.210
conveying you know instant information
you can see here in this screenshot we

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:40.220
you can see here in this screenshot we
 

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.610
you can see here in this screenshot we
can see the the list of gmail

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:42.620
can see the the list of gmail

conversations Tony talked about the fact

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440
conversations Tony talked about the fact
 

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.150
conversations Tony talked about the fact
that we can have actions on there and

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160
that we can have actions on there and
 

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.860
that we can have actions on there and
what that really means is that users are

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:50.870
what that really means is that users are
 

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.540
what that really means is that users are
able to interact with your app without

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:52.550
able to interact with your app without
 

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.000
able to interact with your app without
actually switching into your app so it's

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.010
actually switching into your app so it's
 

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.470
actually switching into your app so it's
a really great way to keep them engaged

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480
a really great way to keep them engaged
 

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.780
a really great way to keep them engaged
without having them go in and out of

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:58.790
without having them go in and out of
 

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.500
without having them go in and out of
apps all the time yeah so you really

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:02.510
apps all the time yeah so you really
 

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.230
apps all the time yeah so you really
want to for some of the simple tasks

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240
want to for some of the simple tasks
 

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.610
want to for some of the simple tasks
that are

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620
that are
 

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.550
that are
user can quickly handle within the

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560
user can quickly handle within the
 

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.530
user can quickly handle within the
notifications and then those are

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.540
notifications and then those are
 

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.350
notifications and then those are
actually what but those the action

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360
actually what but those the action
 

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.990
actually what but those the action
buttons are for um and for the complex a

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000
buttons are for um and for the complex a
 

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.450
buttons are for um and for the complex a
task is still recommended to do how to

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:23.460
task is still recommended to do how to
 

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.180
task is still recommended to do how to
be direct on user to your to your

be direct on user to your to your
 

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.450
be direct on user to your to your
application to do this way are ambiguous

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:29.460
application to do this way are ambiguous
 

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.390
application to do this way are ambiguous
like complex tasks and for simple stuff

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:32.400
like complex tasks and for simple stuff
 

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.490
like complex tasks and for simple stuff
you can really enhance the user

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500
you can really enhance the user
 

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.240
you can really enhance the user
experience if you give you if you create

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:38.250
experience if you give you if you create
 

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.320
experience if you give you if you create
actions like within the notification so

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.330
actions like within the notification so
 

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.269
actions like within the notification so
so let's talk about how to create a

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279
so let's talk about how to create a
 

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:48.560
so let's talk about how to create a
simple notification so one thing are we

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:48.570
simple notification so one thing are we
 

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.370
simple notification so one thing are we
add later in in our API in so we have we

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380
add later in in our API in so we have we
 

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.390
add later in in our API in so we have we
now have a builder or two to build

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.400
now have a builder or two to build
 

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.400
now have a builder or two to build
notification so and also we we also

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:00.410
notification so and also we we also
 

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.810
notification so and also we we also
introduced something called notification

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820
introduced something called notification
 

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.290
introduced something called notification
compat in the support library so that

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300
compat in the support library so that
 

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.320
compat in the support library so that
that makes your notification

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.330
that makes your notification
 

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.810
that makes your notification
implementation like backward compatible

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820
implementation like backward compatible
 

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.310
implementation like backward compatible
um so in it it doesn't uh it's not in

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320
um so in it it doesn't uh it's not in
 

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.560
um so in it it doesn't uh it's not in
the sense like all the autumn in which

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:18.570
the sense like all the autumn in which
 

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.690
the sense like all the autumn in which

big field so we have a field 10 plates
 

00:13:23.589 --> 00:13:26.130
big field so we have a field 10 plates
so so one of them is called in box style

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:26.140
so so one of them is called in box style
 

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:32.340
so so one of them is called in box style
so you can use the compatibility library

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:32.350
so you can use the compatibility library
 

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.280

things i'll just add with the inbox

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.250
things i'll just add with the inbox
 

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.160
things i'll just add with the inbox
style is that you can actually add

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.170
style is that you can actually add
 

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.230
style is that you can actually add
multiple lines of text there's a method

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240
multiple lines of text there's a method
 

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.690
multiple lines of text there's a method
called add line and it's quite

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:42.700
called add line and it's quite
 

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.829
called add line and it's quite
interesting in the way that it works

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839
interesting in the way that it works
 

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:46.590
interesting in the way that it works
with whereas with big big text it will

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600
with whereas with big big text it will
 

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.250
with whereas with big big text it will
actually automatically wrap the line and

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:49.260
actually automatically wrap the line and
 

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.079
actually automatically wrap the line and
try and put as much of the text in that

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:52.089
try and put as much of the text in that
 

00:16:52.089 --> 00:16:54.720
try and put as much of the text in that
view as possible with inbox what it will

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:54.730
view as possible with inbox what it will
 

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.600
view as possible with inbox what it will
do is for each line if that line is too

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:57.610
do is for each line if that line is too
 

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.400
do is for each line if that line is too
long it won't wrap the line it will

00:16:59.400 --> 00:16:59.410
long it won't wrap the line it will
 

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.139
long it won't wrap the line it will
ellipse eyes it so basically what that

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:01.149
ellipse eyes it so basically what that
 

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:03.720
ellipse eyes it so basically what that
means is it will truncate the text and

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:03.730
means is it will truncate the text and
 

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.309
means is it will truncate the text and
put a dot dot dot at the end of each

00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319
put a dot dot dot at the end of each
 

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.010
put a dot dot dot at the end of each
line so just a subtle difference there

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:08.020
line so just a subtle difference there
 

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.329
line so just a subtle difference there
that's also worth noting yeah there's no

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:12.339
that's also worth noting yeah there's no
 

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:17.189
that's also worth noting yeah there's no
time um so one thing uh probably you

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199
time um so one thing uh probably you
 

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:21.000
time um so one thing uh probably you
want to pay attention is when when when

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.010

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.570
parameter of the notification ID or you
can cancel all the notification you

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:24.580
can cancel all the notification you
 

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.320
can cancel all the notification you
create so this is particularly useful

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.330
create so this is particularly useful

notification intelligently we talked

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:33.460
notification intelligently we talked
 

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.300
notification intelligently we talked
about that by in some of our talks

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:36.310
about that by in some of our talks
 

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.050
about that by in some of our talks
before to create intelligent

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.060
before to create intelligent
 

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.350

notifications like one example is if if

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360
notifications like one example is if if
 

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.290
notifications like one example is if if
there are any if there are some events

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:45.300
there are any if there are some events
 

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.270
there are any if there are some events
that's that is already in the past like

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280
that's that is already in the past like
 

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.110
that's that is already in the past like
calendar like could be a calendar

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120
calendar like could be a calendar
 

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.790
calendar like could be a calendar
application you may want to actually

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:53.800
application you may want to actually
 

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.200
application you may want to actually
remove some of the irrelevant

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.210
remove some of the irrelevant
 

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.120

that the events so also need method will

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520
that the events so also need method will
 

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.650
that the events so also need method will
be useful for taking care of one of our

be useful for taking care of one of our
 

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:15.120
be useful for taking care of one of our
expired notification so just to

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.130
expired notification so just to
 

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.470
expired notification so just to
summarize again um so one thing is using

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480
summarize again um so one thing is using
 

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.000
summarize again um so one thing is using
notification judiciously primarily you

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.010
notification judiciously primarily you
 

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.070
notification judiciously primarily you
want to only use notification but I'm

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080
want to only use notification but I'm
 

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.480
want to only use notification but I'm

that involve like people and keep in

that involve like people and keep in
mind to make notification optional

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:38.290
mind to make notification optional
 

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.190

user can completely disable it so your

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:44.530
user can completely disable it so your
 

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.920
user can completely disable it so your
app should not have really features that

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:46.930
app should not have really features that
 

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.590

in the in the notifications so that's
 

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.220
in the in the notifications so that's
very important and finally use

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:56.230
very important and finally use
 

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.250
very important and finally use

use of notifications as if you have an

the notification is certainly not the

the notification is certainly not the
 

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.380
the notification is certainly not the
place where you would do that there are

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:43.390
place where you would do that there are
 

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.030
place where you would do that there are

something like a download because a

something like a download because a
download is something that a user has

explicitly initiated so in a web browser

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.190
explicitly initiated so in a web browser
 

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.870
explicitly initiated so in a web browser
for example there it kind of makes a

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880
for example there it kind of makes a
 

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.160
for example there it kind of makes a
little bit more sense because they might

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.170
little bit more sense because they might
 

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.750
little bit more sense because they might
be waiting for that file to come through

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760
be waiting for that file to come through
 

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.670
be waiting for that file to come through
but certainly you shouldn't be doing it

00:21:59.670 --> 00:21:59.680
but certainly you shouldn't be doing it
 

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.560
but certainly you shouldn't be doing it
just for periodic updates or anything

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:01.570
just for periodic updates or anything
 

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.360
just for periodic updates or anything
like that it's those two points about

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:03.370
like that it's those two points about
 

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.880
like that it's those two points about
being time-sensitive and and involving

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:05.890
being time-sensitive and and involving
 

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.420
being time-sensitive and and involving
sort of either the user or or people

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:09.430
sort of either the user or or people

that the user is familiar with it's a
 

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.529
that the user is familiar with it's a
it's quite an important

00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:13.539
it's quite an important
 

00:22:13.539 --> 00:22:17.549
it's quite an important
point right so so two things that can

00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559
point right so so two things that can
 

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:20.190
point right so so two things that can
help you too if you're really worried

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200
help you too if you're really worried
 

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.190
help you too if you're really worried
about the user experience so two things

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200
about the user experience so two things
 

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.789
about the user experience so two things
you can that can help you to do is to do

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799
you can that can help you to do is to do
 

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:29.669
you can that can help you to do is to do

notifications like up a no optional so

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:37.690
notifications like up a no optional so
 

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.869
notifications like up a no optional so
the user had choice to do it the other

00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:39.879
the user had choice to do it the other
 

00:22:39.879 --> 00:22:41.849
the user had choice to do it the other
thing is if you think some of the

00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:41.859
thing is if you think some of the
 

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:46.589
thing is if you think some of the
notification may be too low level or not

00:22:46.589 --> 00:22:46.599
notification may be too low level or not
 

00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:49.859

fantasy world so you're building farms

00:23:15.089 --> 00:23:15.099
fantasy world so you're building farms
 

00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:17.399
fantasy world so you're building farms
and your your training Army's and

00:23:17.399 --> 00:23:17.409
and your your training Army's and
 

00:23:17.409 --> 00:23:19.859
and your your training Army's and
researching better swords and so on they

00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:19.869
researching better swords and so on they
 

00:23:19.869 --> 00:23:21.570
researching better swords and so on they
had an interesting use of notifications

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:21.580
had an interesting use of notifications
 

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.099
had an interesting use of notifications
where because the game is very much

00:23:23.099 --> 00:23:23.109
where because the game is very much
 

00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:24.989
where because the game is very much
based on real time so it will say

00:23:24.989 --> 00:23:24.999
based on real time so it will say
 

00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:27.389
based on real time so it will say
something like you can only build one

00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:27.399
something like you can only build one
 

00:23:27.399 --> 00:23:28.799
something like you can only build one
building at once and it's going to take

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:28.809
building at once and it's going to take
 

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:30.719
building at once and it's going to take
two hours to build it they use a

00:23:30.719 --> 00:23:30.729
two hours to build it they use a
 

00:23:30.729 --> 00:23:33.539
two hours to build it they use a
notification to let the user know that

00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:33.549
notification to let the user know that
 

00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:35.519
notification to let the user know that
hey the building is done so you kind of

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:35.529
hey the building is done so you kind of
 

00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:37.379
hey the building is done so you kind of
remind you to get back in the game it's

00:23:37.379 --> 00:23:37.389
remind you to get back in the game it's
 

00:23:37.389 --> 00:23:40.049
remind you to get back in the game it's
a little bit more engaging now that was

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:40.059
a little bit more engaging now that was
 

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:41.729
a little bit more engaging now that was
kind of a nice way to do it for that

00:23:41.729 --> 00:23:41.739
kind of a nice way to do it for that
 

00:23:41.739 --> 00:23:43.589
kind of a nice way to do it for that
game and it's you know in those

00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:43.599
game and it's you know in those
 

00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:45.060
game and it's you know in those
situations you definitely want to have

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:45.070
situations you definitely want to have
 

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.369
situations you definitely want to have
that setting like Tony said to have an

00:23:47.369 --> 00:23:47.379
that setting like Tony said to have an
 

00:23:47.379 --> 00:23:49.549
that setting like Tony said to have an
option to turn that sort of stuff off

00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559
option to turn that sort of stuff off
 

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:52.109
option to turn that sort of stuff off
but that was a clever way of doing it

00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:52.119
but that was a clever way of doing it
 

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:53.549
but that was a clever way of doing it
because it were the getting the user

00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559
because it were the getting the user
 

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:56.489
because it were the getting the user
engaged more with that title you don't

00:23:56.489 --> 00:23:56.499
engaged more with that title you don't
 

00:23:56.499 --> 00:23:58.619
engaged more with that title you don't
want to do it in just a you know a

00:23:58.619 --> 00:23:58.629
want to do it in just a you know a
 

00:23:58.629 --> 00:24:00.659
want to do it in just a you know a
periodic daily hey have you come and

00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:00.669
periodic daily hey have you come and
 

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:02.669
periodic daily hey have you come and
launched my app recently or anything

00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679
launched my app recently or anything
 

00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:05.159
launched my app recently or anything
like that but you know think about

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:05.169
like that but you know think about
 

00:24:05.169 --> 00:24:07.320
like that but you know think about
really we always at Google we always

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:07.330
really we always at Google we always
 

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.330
really we always at Google we always
talk about putting the user first but

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:09.340
talk about putting the user first but
 

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.519
talk about putting the user first but
think about what is it that will add

00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:11.529
think about what is it that will add
 

00:24:11.529 --> 00:24:15.509
think about what is it that will add
value to the user from your app yeah so

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:15.519
value to the user from your app yeah so
 

00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:18.029
value to the user from your app yeah so
I think for for the application another

00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039
I think for for the application another
 

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.979
I think for for the application another
thing that may also come to them and

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:19.989
thing that may also come to them and
 

00:24:19.989 --> 00:24:22.049
thing that may also come to them and
what they are doing is they can holy

00:24:22.049 --> 00:24:22.059
what they are doing is they can holy
 

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:25.470
what they are doing is they can holy

to your way of getting the details of

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:27.670
to your way of getting the details of
 

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.180
to your way of getting the details of
the individual items that they've you

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:30.190
the individual items that they've you
 

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.770
the individual items that they've you
know paid for and stuff so just going to

work out how i would do that without

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:33.100
work out how i would do that without
 

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.460
work out how i would do that without
having to store each one in a database

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:35.470
having to store each one in a database
 

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:40.440
having to store each one in a database
on my server yeah so typically the i

mean you when you do restore

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:43.930
mean you when you do restore
 

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.310
mean you when you do restore
transactions you are getting the

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320
transactions you are getting the
 

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.690
transactions you are getting the
transactions back right like the

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:48.700
transactions back right like the
 

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.130

information aren't you i don't think so

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:52.630
information aren't you i don't think so
 

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.380
information aren't you i don't think so
i mean the the callback message that

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:55.390
i mean the the callback message that
 

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.480
i mean the the callback message that
gets called just seems to return a

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:57.490
gets called just seems to return a
 

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.560
gets called just seems to return a
response object that says yes or no i'm

trying to work out which part of the API

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.130
trying to work out which part of the API
 

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.640
trying to work out which part of the API
actually provide elicited so what it's

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:05.650
actually provide elicited so what it's
 

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.960
actually provide elicited so what it's
supposed to tell you is hey does that

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:06.970
supposed to tell you is hey does that
 

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.880

purchase mean purchased or not right is

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:08.890
purchase mean purchased or not right is
 

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:13.350
purchase mean purchased or not right is
that is that correct I guess what what

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360
that is that correct I guess what what
 

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.790
that is that correct I guess what what
information are you trying to glean out

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:14.800
information are you trying to glean out
 

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.500
information are you trying to glean out
of it in your in your app because the

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:16.510
of it in your in your app because the
 

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.140
of it in your in your app because the
way the way managed item the way restore

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.150
way the way managed item the way restore
 

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:21.600
way the way managed item the way restore
transactions for managed items works is

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:21.610
transactions for managed items works is
 

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.010
transactions for managed items works is
that it basically tells you hey these

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:23.020
that it basically tells you hey these
 

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.180
that it basically tells you hey these
are the list of items that have been

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:24.190
are the list of items that have been
 

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.790
are the list of items that have been
purchased and just for the audience

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:26.800
purchased and just for the audience
 

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.860
purchased and just for the audience
managed items are typically one off

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:28.870
managed items are typically one off
 

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.620
managed items are typically one off
purchases they're not the consumable

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:31.630
purchases they're not the consumable
 

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.450
purchases they're not the consumable
type of purchases so once you know that

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:33.460
type of purchases so once you know that
 

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.130
type of purchases so once you know that
you've purchased a particular item you

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:38.140
you've purchased a particular item you
 

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.320
you've purchased a particular item you
know that it should be unlocked in your

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:40.330
know that it should be unlocked in your
 

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.970
know that it should be unlocked in your
app or available in your app throughout

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980
app or available in your app throughout
 

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.070
app or available in your app throughout
so it won't give you necessarily all the

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080
so it won't give you necessarily all the
 

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.080
so it won't give you necessarily all the
same level of detail that you get when

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.090
same level of detail that you get when
 

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.710
same level of detail that you get when
you purchase the item for the first time

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720
you purchase the item for the first time
 

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.930
you purchase the item for the first time
but it should at least tell you the API

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:54.940
but it should at least tell you the API
 

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.850
but it should at least tell you the API
should be telling you hey that this

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:56.860
should be telling you hey that this
 

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.009
should be telling you hey that this
particular item ID has been purchased

00:26:59.009 --> 00:26:59.019
particular item ID has been purchased
 

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:03.180
particular item ID has been purchased
and pretty much on a restore workflow

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.190
and pretty much on a restore workflow
 

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.769
and pretty much on a restore workflow
that that should be enough to get you

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:04.779
that that should be enough to get you
 

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:07.740
that that should be enough to get you
through you if you want to store the

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:07.750
through you if you want to store the
 

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.810
through you if you want to store the
extra information that we do on the

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:09.820
extra information that we do on the
 

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.330
extra information that we do on the
initial purchase and you do need to

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:12.340
initial purchase and you do need to
 

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.730
initial purchase and you do need to
store it on a server but I guess I'm

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:14.740
store it on a server but I guess I'm
 

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.490
store it on a server but I guess I'm
trying to understand is there is is

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:17.500
trying to understand is there is is
 

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.470
trying to understand is there is is
there something critical that's missing

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480
there something critical that's missing
 

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.240
there something critical that's missing
on that restore transaction that that

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:21.250
on that restore transaction that that
 

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.240
on that restore transaction that that
you're not getting you're just going to

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.250
you're not getting you're just going to
 

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.039
you're not getting you're just going to
work out which bit has that list of

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:26.049

so that you'll be able to see this all
right so I pulled up the decoder test

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:01.870
right so I pulled up the decoder test
 

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.260
right so I pulled up the decoder test
and below that decoder test class which

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:04.270
and below that decoder test class which
 

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.090

explains media codec and how do you each
 

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.650
explains media codec and how do you each
lies that how do you create the output

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:07.660
lies that how do you create the output

kind of follow a similar pattern at

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:13.540
kind of follow a similar pattern at
 

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.320
kind of follow a similar pattern at
least this is the encoder these are the

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:16.330
least this is the encoder these are the
 

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.510
least this is the encoder these are the
encoder API calls so you can probably

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:18.520
encoder API calls so you can probably
 

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.100
encoder API calls so you can probably
look at this and see a doll or something

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.110

look at this and see a doll or something
let us know how that works free all

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:26.260
let us know how that works free all

let us know how that works free all
right cool yeah Andrew I just wanted to

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:28.780
right cool yeah Andrew I just wanted to
 

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.220
right cool yeah Andrew I just wanted to
follow up on that on your question and

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:32.230
follow up on that on your question and
 

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.620
follow up on that on your question and
if this isn't sufficient we will take it

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:34.630
if this isn't sufficient we will take it
 

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.380
if this isn't sufficient we will take it
will take it offline but basically what

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:37.390
will take it offline but basically what
 

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:38.580
will take it offline but basically what
should be happening is that you should

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:38.590
should be happening is that you should
 

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.920
should be happening is that you should
be when you do a restore transactions at

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:40.930
be when you do a restore transactions at
 

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.480
be when you do a restore transactions at
some point you should be getting an

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:42.490
some point you should be getting an
 

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.270
some point you should be getting an
intent saying purchase state changed I

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:45.280
intent saying purchase state changed I
 

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.690
intent saying purchase state changed I
would actually the same intent that you

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:48.700
would actually the same intent that you
 

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.520
would actually the same intent that you
received when you first made the

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.530
received when you first made the
 

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.890
received when you first made the
purchase no worries I've got that method

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:52.900
purchase no worries I've got that method
 

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.330
purchase no worries I've got that method
over it and so yeah maybe actually see a

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:54.340
over it and so yeah maybe actually see a
 

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.240
over it and so yeah maybe actually see a
bit more testing yeah yeah it sorry that

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.250
bit more testing yeah yeah it sorry that
 

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.950
bit more testing yeah yeah it sorry that
that part of the workflow should be the

00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960
that part of the workflow should be the
 

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.360
that part of the workflow should be the
same whether it's the initial purchase

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:00.370
same whether it's the initial purchase
 

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:05.400
same whether it's the initial purchase

is actually some I pointed that
 

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.740
is actually some I pointed that
developer also towards some code that

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:18.750
developer also towards some code that
 

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.770
developer also towards some code that
they could add in their app where at

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:21.780
they could add in their app where at
 

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.750
they could add in their app where at
startup they could check statically

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760
startup they could check statically
 

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.870

check whether the map activity classes

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880
check whether the map activity classes
 

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.750
check whether the map activity classes
available and if it's not then degrade

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760

the experience so that their app doesn't

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440
the experience so that their app doesn't
 

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.950
the experience so that their app doesn't
crash but it doesn't provide the the map

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960
crash but it doesn't provide the the map
 

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.610
crash but it doesn't provide the the map
capability that that might be there so

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620
capability that that might be there so
 

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.000
capability that that might be there so
we were able to resolve that the the

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.010
we were able to resolve that the the
 

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:42.770
we were able to resolve that the the
other question that we had last week

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:42.780
other question that we had last week
 

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.260
other question that we had last week
that was unresolved what had to was also

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.270
that was unresolved what had to was also
 

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:50.120
that was unresolved what had to was also
to do with referrals so if you've got an

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.130
to do with referrals so if you've got an
 

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.890
to do with referrals so if you've got an
installation referral and you pass in

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:51.900
installation referral and you pass in
 

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.580
installation referral and you pass in
referral ids about that not being passed

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:55.590
referral ids about that not being passed
 

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.649
referral ids about that not being passed
around so that they weren't able to

00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659
around so that they weren't able to
 

00:32:57.659 --> 00:32:59.840
around so that they weren't able to
track when actually coming were

00:32:59.840 --> 00:32:59.850

installed as a result of other apps

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:01.710
installed as a result of other apps
 

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.370
installed as a result of other apps
referring them basically the the

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380
referring them basically the the
 

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.750
referring them basically the the
resolution there was that they needed to

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760
resolution there was that they needed to
 

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.260
resolution there was that they needed to
use a URL as opposed to an intent the

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:09.270
use a URL as opposed to an intent the
 

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.120
use a URL as opposed to an intent the
information that's passed in an intent

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.130
information that's passed in an intent
 

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.740
information that's passed in an intent
is is not necessarily used and what they

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:15.750
is is not necessarily used and what they
 

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.810
is is not necessarily used and what they
should be doing is passing in a play URL

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820
should be doing is passing in a play URL
 

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.659
should be doing is passing in a play URL
with the extra parameters at the end

00:33:20.659 --> 00:33:20.669
with the extra parameters at the end
 

00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:23.389
with the extra parameters at the end
and then the referral ID will should get

00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399
and then the referral ID will should get
 

00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:27.649
and then the referral ID will should get
passed through correctly so that's all

00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659
passed through correctly so that's all
 

00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:30.830
passed through correctly so that's all
