00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.080
All right.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.160
Hi, I'm Bruce.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.104
I'm an engineer on the Google
Play Game Services team.

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:16.020
And today, I'd like to
share a little bit more

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.561
on some new features
that we've built

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.090
to help you to automate
your game publishing

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.200
processes to the Google
Play with our new APIs.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.060
So first, a little bit
more about our team.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.920
So what's Google
Play Game Services?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.390
It's a bunch of cloud
services such as achievements,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.840
[INAUDIBLE], online multiplayer,
cloud save, and quests.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.420
A shameless plug, I
recommend checking it out

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.480
if you have not.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.230
So let's say you're
building a game

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.575
and you wanted to push your
game to alpha every day

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:45.600
to your alpha testers.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.460
So maybe you wanted to localize
your game to many languages.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.210
Or maybe your designer
just went crazy,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.880
and he has tons of
achievements he wants to add.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.920
So previously, you'd probably
go to the Google Play Developer

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.870
Console and pretty much add
this metadata one by one.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.760
And we've heard your piece.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.310
A lot of developers had a lot
of tedious times doing that.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.140
So we've added two
APIs to help you out.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.320
The first is the Google Play
Game Services publishing API.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.810
And the second is the Google
Play Developer Publishing API

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.385
Edits.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:22.760
And these two can
help you manage

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.660
your game services and your
Play Store data, respectively.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.230
So to begin using these APIs,
the first thing you need to do

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.090
is to go to the Developer
Console, and click on Settings,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.750
and then go to API Access.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.520
From there, you can follow
the steps to setup the API.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.460
Once you do that, you
should be able to get access

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.370
to all these APIs.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.630
For example, this is an
achievements API that we have.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.050
You can get, update, delete,
insert, and list them.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.500
And we also have an
API to upload images

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.300
for those achievements.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.350
So let's say you have an
achievement already setup

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.530
and you wanted to get an API
so you get the achievement.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.950
Here is an example.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.250
You make an HTTP request
with achievement ID,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.620
and you can get the
JSON response for it.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.900
And pretty much the
same thing for updating.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.800
It's the same URL.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.390
It's just that
it's a put request.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.849
And you can just change
the JSON data and update.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.890
So one tip is that you
should always get [? it ?]

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.556
before you update,
because that's how we

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:29.060
deal with concurrent updates.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.540
So here's an example for the
Google Play developer APIs.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.440
You have to create what we
call edit, which is basically

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.120
a change list.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.440
And you can commit the edit.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.400
So going back to
the example earlier,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.830
let's say you want to
push your alpha every day.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.230
All you need to do is create
an edit, upload your APK,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.680
set your APK to the
alpha track, and then

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.560
finally commit that edit.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.570
And you can do many other
steps in between as well.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.610
So here's a list of other
things that you can do.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.310
You can change your screenshots.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.010
You can change your Play Store
details, manage your testers,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.420
add more localization,
or do staged rollouts.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.500
So by now, you might
be wondering what

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.010
if other developers
can access your data.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.440
So no worries about that.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.030
We take permissions
very seriously.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.330
You can manage it in the
Developer Console as well.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.290
And only the owners of your
games can access the data.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.090
So we have also two main ways
to authenticate from the client.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.070
So the first is an OAuth
Client with this OAuth code.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.180
One common mistake is to
lift this [? code ?] up.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.650
So do include that.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.820
And the second is to
use a service account.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.460
So a service account is
basically another account

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.370
that you can grant
your rights to.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.010
And this is very useful because
you can set up a built server

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.880
and then use that service
account to run your publishing

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.270
processes.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.940
Not to forget, Google Play
Games is also cross-platform.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.820
So when you update
your achievement data,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.340
it goes out to all
your platforms,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.040
and you don't have to
worry about it anymore.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.870
So with that, you should be
able to automate your game

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.630
publishing processes.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.450
And hopefully, that will
save you a lot of time,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.180
a lot of money, and you
can finally use that time

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.702
to maybe eat some cake.

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:28.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.670
If you still have problems,
check out our GitHub samples.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.600
We have Python and JavaScript.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.900
And we also have Java samples
for the Google Play Developer

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.570
API Edits.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.935
Thank you very much.

00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:44.850
