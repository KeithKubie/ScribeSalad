00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.670
MALE SPEAKER: Steven Pinker is
a Johnstone family professor

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.870
of psychology at
Harvard University,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.900
chair of the usage panel of the
American Heritage Dictionary,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.630
and one of the world's
foremost writers

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.390
on language, mind,
and human nature.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.140
His research has won prizes
from the National Academy

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.880
of Sciences, the Royal
Institution, of the American

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.350
Psychological Association,
and the Cognitive Neuroscience

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.850
Society.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.570
He has also received
several teaching

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.950
awards and many
prizes for his books--

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.400
"The Language Instinct," "How
The Mind Works," "The Blank

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.810
Slate," and "The Better
Angels of our Nature:

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.320
Why Violence Has Declined."

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.520
He has been named
humanist of the year,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.430
Time's 100 most influential
people in the world today,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.915
and foreign policy world's
top 100 public intellectuals.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.910
He has written for The New York
Times, Time Magazine, the New

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.670
Republic, the New Yorker,
and other publications

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.780
on consciousness, genomics,
morality, war and peace,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.110
and of course, language.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.588
Ladies and gentleman,
Steven Pinker.

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:24.719
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.302
STEVEN PINKER: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.950
Why is so much writing so bad,
and how can we make it better?

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.250
Why do we have to
decipher so much legalese,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.060
like "the revocation by these
regulations of a provision

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.800
previously revoked
subject savings does not

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.215
affect the continued
operations"?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.080
Why is it so hard to understand
an academic article, like, "it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.600
is the moment of
non-construction, disclosing

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.200
the abstention of
actuality from the concept,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.206
in part through its invitation
to emphasize, in reading,

00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:58.205
the helplessness of its
fall into conceptually"?

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.640
Why is it so hard to set the
time on a digital alarm clock?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.639
Well there's no
shortage of theories,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.660
and the most popular theory is
captured in this cartoon, where

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.696
the boss says to the
tech writer, good start,

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:15.570
needs more gibberish.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.130
In other words, bad writing
is a deliberate choice.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.026
Bureaucrats insist on gibberish
to evade responsibility.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.570
Pasty-faced nerds
get their revenge

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.440
on the girls who turned them
down for dates in high school,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.675
and the jocks how kicked
sand in their faces.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.330
Pseudo-intellectuals try
to bamboozle their readers

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.080
with highfalutin' gobbledygook,
concealing the fact

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.830
that they have nothing to say.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.820
Well I have no doubt that
the bamboozlement theory

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.300
is true of some writers,
some of the time.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.670
But in my experience it
doesn't really ring true.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.870
I know plenty of
scientists and scholars

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.880
who do groundbreaking
work on important topics,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.280
they have no need to impress
and nothing to say-- still,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.480
their writing stinks.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.145
Good people can write bad prose.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.170
The other theory
that is frequently

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.650
routed to explain bad
writing is that digital media

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.980
are to blame for
ruining the language.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.270
I'm sure you've all seen this--
Google is Making Us Stupid.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.960
The Dumbest Generation has been
stupefied by digital media,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.785
and they are
jeopardizing our future.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.683
Twitter is forcing us to think
and write in 140 characters.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.990
Well I think there's some
problems with the dumbest

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.470
generation theory as well,
because it makes a prediction

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.700
that it must have
been very different

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.680
before the advent
of digital media.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.640
Say-- And those of you who
were around in the 1980s

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.630
can surely remember
that back then teenagers

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.880
spoke in fluid paragraphs.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.600
Bureaucrats wrote
in plain English,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.270
and every academic
article is a masterpiece

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.730
in the art of the essay.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.040
Yes, that's the way
it was in the 1980s.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.830
Or was it the 1970s?

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.560
The truth is of course that bad
writing has burdened readers

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.730
in every era, such as 1961, in
which one commentator wrote,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.690
recent graduates, including
those with university degrees,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.810
seem to have no mastery
of the language at all.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.280
Well maybe you have to go back
before the advent of television

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.209
and radio, say to 1917.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:28.750
When someone wrote
from every college

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.860
in the country goes up the
cry, our freshman can't spell,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.870
can't punctuate.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.800
Every high school
is in disrepair,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.690
because it's pupils are
so ignorant of the nearest

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.680
rudiments.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.010
Well maybe you have to go
back to earlier centuries

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.440
when literacy was prized.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.410
Well in 1785, they were
saying, our language

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.870
is degenerating very fast.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.100
I began to fear that it will
be impossible to check it.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.990
And then of course there are
the ancient grammar police,

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.790
like the commentator who
said, oh for crying out loud,

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.276
you never end a sentence
with a little birdie.

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:02.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.940
I think a better theory comes
from a observation by Charles

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.330
Darwin that man has an
instinctive tendency

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.670
to speak as we see in the
babel of our young children.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.970
Whereas no child has an
instinctive tendency to bake,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.620
brew, or write.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.950
Speech is instinctive,
but writing

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.580
is, and always has been, hard.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.480
Your readers are unknown,
invisible, and inscrutable.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.630
They exist only in the
writer's imagination.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.760
They can't react if
something is unclear,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.206
break into the conversation
or ask for clarification.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.090
So writing is an
act of pretense,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.855
and writing is an
active craftsmanship.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.020
Well, what can we do to
improve the craft of writing?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.780
For many decades that
question had a single answer--

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.630
you hand students this.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.840
The iconic Elements Of Style,
by Cornell professor William

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.200
Strunk, Jr., and his
former student, E.B. White,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.160
also known as the New
Yorker essayist, and author

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.290
of "Charlotte's Web"
and "Stuart Little."

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.050
You will notice by the way that
the junior member of this pair

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.670
was born before the turn
of the century, that

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.585
is before the turn
of the 20th century.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.520
There's no doubt
that there is plenty

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.690
of good sense in "The
Elements Of Style."

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.400
And it is well
worth consulting--

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.580
it has pithy, little
advisories such as use

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.990
definite, specific,
concrete language.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.115
Write with nouns and verbs.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.900
Put the emphatic words of
the sentence at the end.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.920
And in another little gem
of self-exemplification,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.610
omit needless words.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.575
Which, indeed, omits
needless words.

00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:41.000
On the other hand,
there are number

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.280
of reasons why "The
Elements Of Style" can't

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.640
be the sole basis of writing
advice in the 21st century.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.795
For one thing, it's filled
with a lot of baffling advice.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.620
Such as, the word,
people, is not

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.370
to be used with words of
number in place of persons.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.750
That is, you may
not say six people.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.510
Why not?

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.660
If, of six people,
five went away,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.060
how many people would be left?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.480
Answer, one people.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.740
Did you follow that?

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.930
It would also rule out things
like three children, 32 teeth,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.990
does not seem to
make much sense.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.490
How's this?

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.120
To contact is vague and
self-important do not

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.170
contact people-- get
in touch with them,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.660
look them up, phone them,
find them, or meet them.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.700
Well yes, but what
if you don't care

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.910
how one person is going to
get in touch with another,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.480
and what if it was just as
acceptable if they tweet them,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.020
instant message them, email
them or any other medium?

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.670
The basis for this advice
was that the verb to contact

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.970
happened to be a neologism,
when White was a young man,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.780
and so it graded on his ears.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.610
In the many decades
since then, to contact

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.330
has become an unexceptionable
part of the language,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.810
precisely because it
serves a need-- mainly,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.590
sometimes you don't
care how one person is

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.100
going to get in touch with
another one unless you do so.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.840
So you don't want to specify
phone them, meet them,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.844
and so on.

00:08:07.844 --> 00:08:08.760
Or how about this one?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.080
Note that the word clever
means one thing when

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.870
applied to people, and other
would applied to horses.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.530
A clever horse is a good-natured
one, not an ingenious one.

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:22.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.960
The problem with traditional
style advice is that it

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.280
consists of an arbitrary
list of Do's and Don'ts based

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.280
on the tastes and
peeves of the authors.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.120
It is not based on a principle
understanding of how language

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.419
works, and as a
result, users have

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.390
no way of understanding and
assimilating the advice,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.970
and much of the advice, as I'll
show you, is just plain wrong.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.440
I think we can do better today.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.400
We could base writing
advice on the science

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.240
and scholarship of language.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.500
On modern grammatical
theory, which

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.206
is a marked advance over
the traditional Latin-based

00:08:55.206 --> 00:08:55.705
grammars.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.080
Evidence-based
dictionaries, and grammars.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.200
Research in cognitive
science on what

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.990
makes sentences easy
or hard to read.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.890
And historical and
critical studies of usage.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.915
And this is what I've tried
to do in the sense of style.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.460
It begins with a model
of effective prose.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.970
As I mentioned, writing
is an unnatural act,

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.370
and good style, above all,
requires a mental model

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.470
of the communication scenario.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.445
Who is the reader, and
what are you as a writer

00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:28.320
trying to accomplish?

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.120
My favorite model of the
ideal communication scenario

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.470
comes from a wonderful
little book called

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.830
"Clear and Simple as the
Truth," by the literary scholars

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.060
from Francis-Noel Thomas,
and Mark Turner, who

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.505
outline a model of communication
they call classic style.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.510
The model is that prose is
a window onto the world.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.260
The writer sees
something in the world,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.060
the reader has not
yet noticed it.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.610
The writer positions the
reader so that the reader

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.980
can see it with her own eyes.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.530
The writer and
reader are equals,

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.120
just that the writer
knows something

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.170
that the reader has
not yet noticed.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.750
The goal is to help the reader
see an objective reality,

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.890
and the style is conversation.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.390
Well this all sounds
pretty obvious.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.020
What is non-classic style?

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.670
Well there are many
alternatives to classic style,

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.960
they-- Turner and Thomas
describe contemplative style,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.270
oracular style, practical
style, and a number of others.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.840
But the ones that academics
and other professionals

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.830
often write in is
a style they call

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.390
postmodern or self-conscious
in which the writer's

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.770
chief, if unstated concern
is to escape being convicted

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.845
of philosophical naivete
about his own enterprise.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.590
They explain, "when
we open a cookbook,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.530
we completely put
aside, and expect

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.780
the author to put aside
the kind of question that

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.910
leads to the heart of certain
philosophical traditions.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.030
Is it possible to
talk about cooking?

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.790
Do eggs really exist?

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.560
Is food something about
which knowledge as possible?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.760
Can anyone ever tell us
anything true about cooking?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.020
Classic style,
similarly, puts aside

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.910
as inappropriate, philosophical
questions about its enterprise.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.740
If it took these
questions up, it

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.800
could never get around
to treating its subject,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.920
and its purpose is exclusively
to treat its subject."

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.570
And I believe that-- let
me-- since classic prose

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.350
is about showing
something to the reader,

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.060
it's only fair that I show you
an example of classic prose.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.350
So here's an example from
an article in "Newsweek"

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.130
by the physicist Brian
Greene explaining

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.740
the theory of
inflationary cosmology,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.810
and one of its implications--
multiple universes,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:41.830
or the multiverse.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.540
Greene writes-- "If space
is now expanding, then

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.500
at ever earlier
times, the universe

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.470
must have been ever smaller.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.480
At some moment in the
distant past, everything

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.970
we now see, the
ingredients responsible

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.050
for every planet, every star,
every galaxy, even space

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.960
itself, must been compressed
to an infinitesimal speck,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.700
but then swelled outward,
evolving into the universe

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.110
as we know it."

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.450
The Big Bang theory was born.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.350
Yet scientists were aware that
the Big Bang theory suffered

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.190
from a significant shortcoming.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.000
Of all things, it
leaves out the bang.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.980
Einstein's equations
do a wonderful job

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.500
of describing how the universe
evolved from a split second

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.510
after the bang,
but the equations

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.260
break down similar to the
error message returned

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.840
by a calculator when you try to
divide one by zero when applied

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.680
to the extreme environment of
the universe's earliest moment.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.740
The Big Bang thus
provides no insight

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.520
into what might have
powered the bang itself.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.550
Now this covers some pretty
sophisticated physics,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:48.030
and abstruse mathematics, but
Greene presents it in a way

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.140
that you can see everything for
yourself in your mind's eye.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.130
If you know that
space is expanding,

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.300
then you can mentally
play the movie in reverse,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.690
and extrapolate back to the
singularity at which space

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.900
was infinitesimally small,
and imagine it then,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.940
the movie, going
forward, in return.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.740
The abstruse concept of
an equation breaking down

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.330
can be appreciated by the
reader either by pulling out

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.499
a calculator and
dividing one by zero,

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:21.165
and sure enough, your calculator
will give you an error message.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.120
Or, you could
even-- the reader is

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.220
welcome to try to imagine
what it could possibly

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.160
mean for one to be
divided into zero

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.000
parts, or some number of
parts, each of which was zero.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.110
And so the reader
can see for herself

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.900
exactly what Greene
is trying to show.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.980
I believe that many examples
of good writing advice

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.470
are implications of the
model of communication

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.490
behind classic prose.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.890
For example, the
focus of good writing

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.970
should be on thing
being shown, not

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.880
on the activity of studying it.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.600
The following is-- that
is, the writer's job, peer

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.470
group, daily
activities, and so on.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.710
Now I am daily-faced with
reading papers and articles

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.000
that begin in the following way.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.430
"In recent years, an increasing
number of researchers

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.930
have turned their attention to
the problem of child language

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.890
acquisition.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.110
In this article recent
theories of this process

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.300
will be reviewed."

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.850
Well, no offense, but
not a whole lot of people

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.050
are really interested in how
professors spend their time.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.120
A classic way of introducing
an article on the same topic

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.300
would be, "All children
acquire the ability

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.850
to speak and
understand a language

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:42.350
without explicit lessons, how
do they accomplish this feat?"

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.690
A corollary is to minimize
the kind of apologizing

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.280
that suffuses academic prose.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.590
Again, this should
be all too familiar

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.940
to those of you who have read
academic review articles.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.490
"The problem of
language acquisition

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.080
is extremely complex.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.080
It is difficult to give
precise definitions

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.170
of the concept of 'language'
and the concept of 'acquisition'

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.040
and the concept of children.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.170
There's much uncertainty
about the interpretation

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.690
of experimental data, and
a great deal of controversy

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.330
surrounding the theories.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.380
More research needs to be done."

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.050
Well, classic prose
gives the reader credit

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.940
for being smart enough to
know that many concepts are

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.940
hard to define, and
many controversies

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.260
are hard to resolve.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.390
The reader is there to
see what the writer is

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.420
going to do about it.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.180
Another corollary of the
model behind classic prose

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.540
is to minimize the
kind of hedging

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.010
that professional writers are
apt to indulge in, where they

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:40.900
drizzle their prose with
mushy little qualifiers.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.930
Like-- somewhat, fairly, nearly,
seemingly, in part, relatively,

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.515
comparatively, predominately,
to some extent, so to speak,

00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:47.140
and presumably.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.940
And the similar
device using shutter

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.250
quotes, to imply that
they don't really

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.160
mean what they are saying.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.440
I'll give you an example from
a letter of recommendation

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.250
that I received.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.250
She is a quote
"quick study" and has

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.880
been able to educate herself
in virtually any area that

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.930
interests her.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.450
Well are we to understand this
as meaning that this young

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.040
woman is a quick study, or
that she is a quick study,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.300
namely someone who is kind
of rumored or alleged to be

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.595
a quick study, but maybe isn't.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.610
And what is that
virtually doing?

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:25.060
Is it that there are some areas
in which-- that interest her

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.590
where she just never
bothered to educate herself,

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.470
or was unsuccessful in doing so.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.760
The use of hedges has become
so reflexive in professionals

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.230
and academics that at
one point I approached

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.120
a distinguished
scientist and I asked her

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.070
how she was and she
pulled out a picture

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.210
of her four-year-old
daughter and she said,

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.503
we virtually adore her.

00:16:50.503 --> 00:16:51.003
Aw.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.790
Why the compulsive hedging?

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.660
Well there is a saying
among bureaucrats

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.750
that you must always follow
the imperative CYA, Cover Your

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.329
Anatomy.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:05.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.730
And there is an alternative--
namely, "So sue me!"

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.119
That is, it's often better to
be clear and wrong, than fuzzy,

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.510
and as the physicists
say, not even wrong.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.260
Even when you don't, one can
count on the cooperative nature

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.990
of ordinary conversation to
avoid unnecessary hedges.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.970
If someone says that they
are moving away from Seattle

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.490
because it's a rainy
city, you understand them

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:38.080
not as implying that it
rains there 24 hours a day,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.580
seven days a week,
52 weeks a year.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.390
But just that is
relatively rainy,

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.960
and she didn't have
to actually say,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.450
Seattle is a relatively
rainy city for you

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.990
to understand it in that way.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.280
Another implication
of classic prose

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.470
is that since it is
a window, the writer

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.690
must work to keep
up the illusion

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.830
that the reader is
seeing the world,

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.530
rather than just
listening to verbiage.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.480
And for that reason, it is
imperative to, as they say,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.290
avoid cliches like the plague.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.630
You're all familiar with
the kind of writer who

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.270
dispenses verbiage
like this, "We needed

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.730
to get the ball rolling in
our search for the holy grail,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.887
but found that it was neither a
magic bullet, nor a slam dunk.

00:18:21.887 --> 00:18:23.470
So we rolled with
the punches, and let

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.261
the chips fall where
they may, while seeing

00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:26.560
the glasses half full.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.410
Which is easier said than done.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.709
AUDIENCE: Don't
they turn a corner?

00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:32.750
STEVEN PINKER: Pardon me?

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.850
Or, of course, they turned
a corner, absolutely yes.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.020
At the leading edge, after they
found the low-hanging fruit.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:50.220
If you just ladle out
one cliche after another,

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.780
either your reader will simply
shut down their visual cortex,

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.210
or if they keep
it awake they will

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.750
get derailed by the
inevitable mixed metaphors.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.040
Like this one from another
letter of recommendation.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.270
"Jeff is a renaissance
men, drilling down

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.825
to the core issues and
pushing the envelope."

00:19:07.825 --> 00:19:10.525
Not clear how you can do
both at the same time.

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.710
No one has yet
invented a condom that

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.250
will knock people's socks off.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.440
And you may also be eligible
for membership in an AWFUL--

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.330
Americans who figuratively
use literally.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:29.350
Now it's OK to say
she literally blushed,

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.090
it's a little more problematic
to say she literally exploded.

00:19:33.384 --> 00:19:35.925
And it's very, very bad to say
she literally emasculated him.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.380
Classic prose is about
the world, not about

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.740
the conceptual tools with
which we understand the world.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.200
And so classic prose,
avoids meta concepts,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.500
namely concepts about concepts.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.190
Like approach, assumption,
concept, condition, context,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.950
framework, issue, level, model,
perspective, process, role,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.320
strategy, tendency, variable.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.170
And admit it, haven't you
seen these words a lot

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.180
in professional prose?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.020
For example.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.503
This is from a lawyer--
a legal scholar writing

00:20:08.503 --> 00:20:10.396
in "The New York Times."

00:20:10.396 --> 00:20:11.770
I have serious
doubts that trying

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.370
to amend the Constitution
would work on an actual level.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.040
On the aspirational level,
a constitutional amendment

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.192
strategy may be more valuable.

00:20:20.192 --> 00:20:21.650
In other words, I
doubt that trying

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.210
to amend the Constitution
would actually succeed,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.060
but it may be valuable
to aspire to it.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.100
Or, it's important to
approach the subject

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.870
from a variety of strategies,
including mental health

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:35.510
assistance, but also from a
law-enforcement perspective.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.790
That is we need to
consult psychiatrists,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.985
but we also may have
to inform the police.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.330
Classic prose narrates
ongoing events,

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.970
we see agents performing
actions that affect objects

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.940
just as we do when an
event unfolds in real life.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.850
Non-classic prose tends
to thing-ify events

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.690
and then refer to them
rather than narrating them

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.170
in real time.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.310
And there is a dangerous
rule of English grammar

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.690
that makes this all too
easy called nominalization.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.380
Where you take a
perfectly spry verb,

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.610
and you entomb it as a noun.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.500
So instead of appearing,
someone makes an appearance.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.160
Instead of organizing
something, you

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.260
bring about the
organization of it.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:28.370
Helen Sword, an English scholar,
refers to them as zombie nouns

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.930
because they kind of
lumber across the stage

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.320
without any conscious
agent actually directing

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.650
their motion.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:42.270
And turgid professional prose
is full of nominalizations

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.520
like, "prevention
of neurogenesis,

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.860
diminished social avoidance."

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.850
Meaning when we
prevented neurogenesis,

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.665
the mice no longer
avoided other mice.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.520
"Subjects were tested
under conditions

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.980
of good to excellent
acoustic isolation."

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.960
To which, "We tested the
students in a quiet room."

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.060
Now the use of meta concepts,
and nominalizations-- it almost

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.730
defines the stereotype
of "academese"

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.790
in the public imagination.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:15.190
As in this editorial cartoon
by Tom Toles, in which he shows

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.040
an academician
explaining the reason

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.760
that verbal SAT scores
are at an all time low.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.790
"Incomplete implementation
of strategized

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.200
programmatics designated
to maximize acquisition

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.270
of awareness and utilization
of communication skills,

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.500
pursuant to standardize
review and assessment

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.221
of languaginal development."

00:22:34.221 --> 00:22:35.596
Any interrogatory
verbalizations?

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.390
It isn't just academics
who use meta concepts

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.660
and nominalizations,
it's also politicians,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.880
As when Rick Perry-- when
the Republican National

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.080
Convention was threatened
by a hurricane,

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.750
said, "Right now there
is not any anticipation

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.562
that there will be
a cancellation."

00:22:55.562 --> 00:22:57.020
In other words,
"Right now we don't

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.090
anticipate that we will
have to cancel it."

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.180
And corporate consultants,
a man explained

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.060
to a reporter what
he did for living,

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.770
he said, "I'm a digital and
social media strategist,

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.380
I deliver programs,
products, and strategies

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.290
to our corporate clients across
the spectrum of communications

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.660
functions."

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.890
The reporter kept pressing
him as to what that meant.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.940
And finally he said,
"I teach big companies

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.140
how to use Facebook."

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.374
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:22.374 --> 00:23:23.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you!

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:27.045
STEVEN PINKER: And
product engineers.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.190
Portable generators used to
have the warning sticker that

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.470
said, "mild exposure
to CO can result

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.560
in accumulated damage over time.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.790
Extreme exposure
to CO may rapidly

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.270
be fatal without producing
significant warning symptoms."

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.450
Yeah, Yeah.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:49.060
And what began to happen is
that every year, several people

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.700
asphyxiated themselves
and their families

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.080
by running them indoors.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.340
And so they changed
the sticker to read,

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.075
using a generator indoors
can kill you in minutes.

00:23:58.075 --> 00:24:00.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.250
STEVEN PINKER: So classic
prose is literally

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.070
a matter of life and death.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.850
Yes, literally.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:15.150
OK, so how does understanding
the design of language lead

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.500
to better writing advice,
as I promised at the outset?

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.500
Well another contributor
to zombie prose,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.490
is the passive voice.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.940
The difference between
the dog bit the man

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.800
in the active voice,
and the men was

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.660
bitten by the dog in
the passive voice.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.930
And it's well known
that the passive voice

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.580
is overused by academics.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.340
"On the basis of
the analysis which

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.130
was made of the data
which were collected

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:43.390
it is suggested that the null
hypothesis can be rejected."

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.760
And by lawyers, "If
the outstanding balance

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.260
is prepaid in full, the
unearned finance charge

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.370
will be refunded."

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:56.950
And political officials, this
is the recently ex-director

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.740
of the Secret Service, who
in explaining to Congress how

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.580
it was that an armed men managed
to vault the fence of the White

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.110
House, sprint across
the lawn, and now waltz

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.890
into the White House.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.640
She admitted,
"Mistakes were made."

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.890
What linguists call
the evasive passive.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.080
And not surprisingly, all
the classic style manuals

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.670
warn writers away from
the passive voice.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.140
As Strunk and White advised,
"Use the active voice.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.650
The active voice is usually
more direct and vigorous

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.840
than the passive.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.500
Many a tame sentence can
be made lively and emphatic

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.240
by substituting a transitive
in the active voice

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.267
for some perfunctory expression
as there is or could be heard."

00:25:44.267 --> 00:25:46.725
And do you notice something a
little odd about this advice?

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.070
Yes, it uses the
passive voice to advise

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.380
against the passive voice.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.580
George Orwell, in
the other classic bit

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.680
of writing advice that is handed
out to every college freshman

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.950
also advises against
using the passive.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.030
He notes that, "A
mixture of vagueness

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.300
and sheer incompetence is the
most marked characteristic

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.010
of modern English prose.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.690
I list below various
of the tricks

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.510
by means of which the
work of prose construction

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.420
is habitually dodged.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.570
The passive voice is wherever
possible used in preference

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:25.310
to the active, a bit of
advice that has not one,

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.650
but two passives to warn
readers away from the passive.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.250
Well this self-contradiction
tells us something.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.760
The passive could not survive
in the English language

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.570
for centuries if it did
not serve some purpose.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.590
Why can't we do without it?

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.410
The answer comes down to
the very design of language.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.150
You can think of
language as an app

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.320
for converting a
web of knowledge

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.110
into a string of words.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.940
Now cognitive psychologists
model a person's knowledge

00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:00.540
as a semantic network, a kind
of mind-wide web, where there

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.630
are nodes that
correspond to concepts

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.940
and there are connectors,
or links, or relationships,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.200
that stand for logical and
conceptual relationships

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.960
among them.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.730
So this is a tiny and
simplified fragment

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.130
of a semantic network that
captures a person's knowledge

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:23.240
of the tragic story brought to
life by Sophocles in "Oedipus

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.060
Rex."

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.940
Now what happens when
you have to communicate

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.820
a bit of your knowledge
to another person?

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.440
Well you have to convert
it into a sentence.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.500
What is a sentence?

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.390
It is a linear string of words.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.000
Such as, in Sophocles play,
Oedipus married his mother,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.210
and killed his father.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.260
One word after another.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:51.110
Well this linearization of
this high-dimensional web

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.650
means that language is saddled
with an inherent problem.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.430
The ordering of
words in a sentence

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.040
has to do two things at once.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.230
It has to serve as
a code for meaning,

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.780
signaling to the reader
who did what to whom,

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.050
but it also necessarily presents
some bits of information

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:10.450
to the reader before
others, and thus affects

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.120
how the information is absorbed
into the reader's mind.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.450
In particular the earlier
material in the sentence

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.440
naturally pertains to the topic,
what the sentence is about,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.270
what the reader is in
effect already looking at.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:28.210
The later material is the focus
or focal point of the sentence,

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.590
and it's what the reader
should now notice.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.790
Any prose that violates
these principles will feel,

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.725
as we say, choppy.

00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:36.670
Or disjointed, or incoherent.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.420
So this now helps us
understand the main function

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.610
of the passive, it
allows writers to they

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.030
the same semantic information,
namely the same information

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.990
about who did what to whom but
with a different surface order.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.080
That is it allows the writer
start with the done-to

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.950
rather than with the do-er.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.760
Which is why avoid the
passive is bad advice.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.660
The passive is the
better construction

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.770
when the done-to is currently
the focus of the reader's

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.110
mental gaze.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.570
And let me give you an example.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.520
This is a passage taken
from the Wikipedia entry

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.390
for "Oedipus Rex" which
describes the climactic scene

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.770
in which the awful truth
behind the Oedipus story

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:27.464
is brought to light-- spoiler
alert, and here's how it reads.

00:29:27.464 --> 00:29:28.880
Describing--
narrating this scene.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.670
"A messenger arrives
from Corinth.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:35.130
It emerges that he was formerly
a shepherd on Mount Kithaeron,

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.800
and during that time
he was given a baby.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.780
The baby, he says,
was given to him

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.680
by another shepherd
from the Laius

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.030
household who had been told
to get rid of the child."

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:49.320
Now notice that this passage
has three passes in a row.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.170
First, all eyes are
all the messenger.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.490
The passage begins,
a messenger arrives.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.920
So we're looking
at the messenger.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.800
It's natural then
to use the passive

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.520
and say, "He was given a baby."

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.920
Well now our attention
is focused on the baby,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.110
so you start the next
sentence with the baby,

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.900
and that will require that
it be in the passive voice.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.815
"The baby was given to the
messenger by another shepherd."

00:30:12.815 --> 00:30:14.000
Hey, another shepherd.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.660
Now we're looking at
the other shepherd,

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.620
so it's natural that
the next sentence begins

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.690
with the shepherd.
"The other shepherd

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.740
had been told to get
rid of the child."

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:29.850
So it's a coherent passage
where the anonymous writer has

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.990
kept in mind where the
reader's mental gaze is

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.540
directed at every stage.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.920
Now imagine that he
had followed the advice

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.770
to convert the passage
to the active voice.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.250
The passage would
read as follows,

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.140
"A messenger arrives
from Corinth.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.770
It emerges that he was formally
a shepherd on mount Kithaeron,

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:51.281
and during that time
someone gave him a baby.

00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:53.030
Another shepherd from
the Laius household,

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:57.100
he says, whom someone had
told to get rid of a child,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.670
gave the baby to him.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.030
Now that is much
harder to follow,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.630
because your characters
are parachuting in,

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.910
in a order that
doesn't correspond

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:12.130
to the natural order of
gaze from one to another.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.790
More generally, English
syntax provides a writers

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.120
with constructions that
vary the order in the string

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.940
while preserving meaning.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.340
Oedipus killed Laius.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.020
Laius was killed by Oedipus.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.480
It was Laius whom
Oedipus killed.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.570
It was Oedipus who killed Laius.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.690
And so on.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.375
And writers must
choose the construction

00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:32.960
that introduces ideas to the
reader in the order in which

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.020
she can most naturally
absorbed them.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.040
Well this brings us back to
the original question of,

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.690
why is the passive so common in
bad writing given that there's

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.280
some circumstances in
which the better choice?

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.150
Well it's because
good writers narrate

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.120
a story that are
advanced by protagonists

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.950
who make things happen.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.880
Bad writers work backwards
from their own knowledge,

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.590
writing down ideas in the order
in which they occur to them.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.220
They know how the
story turned out,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.210
so they begin with
the outcome, and then

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.730
they throw in the cause
as an afterthought

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.230
and indeed the passive voice
makes that all too easy.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.010
Part three, why do writers
fall into that trap?

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.560
Why is it so hard for
writers to use language

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.900
to convey ideas effectively?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.670
My favorite explanation is
a psychological phenomenon

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.675
that has been called
The Curse of Knowledge.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.200
The inability that we
all have to imagine

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.270
what it's like for someone
else not to know something

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.870
that you do know.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.560
Psychologists also call it
Mind Blindness, Ego-centrism,

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.460
and Hindsight Bias.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.160
The classic illustration
is a experiment

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.170
taught to every
psychology student.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:55.120
A child comes into a lab, the
experimenter hands the boy,

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.630
a three-year-old boy an
M&amp;Ms box, he opens it,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.110
and he's surprised to
find ribbons inside.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.200
So you stuff the ribbons back
into the box, close it back up,

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.530
put it back on the table.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.856
Now he watches as
a second comes in.

00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:10.300
We'll call him Jason.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.110
And you say to the
first boy, what

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.560
is Jason think is in the box?

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.800
And the boy says, ribbons.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.880
Even though Jason has no
way of knowing that the box

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.670
contains ribbons.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.386
He's just walked into the
room for the first time.

00:33:23.386 --> 00:33:24.760
In fact, if you
say the boy, what

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.450
did you think was in the box
when you came into the room?

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.530
And the child will say, ribbons.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.460
Now that he knows
what the box contains

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:37.360
he could no longer entertain the
original mental state in which

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.540
he did not know
what was in the box

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.080
or the mental state of
a naive third party.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:53.520
Now we adults grow out of this
limitation-- kind of, a bit.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.200
Because many studies have
shown that adults to,

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.030
are apt to project their own
knowledge on to everyone else.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.780
If you give students
a list of words

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.630
and you ask them which
words are likely to be

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.759
in the vocabulary of
your fellow students,

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:09.300
they will guest at
the ones that they

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.530
know are the ones that
other students will know,

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.989
ditto with factual knowledge.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:19.230
If you have people who
vary in their familiarity

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.370
with the gadget, such
as a cell phone and you

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:25.199
ask them to estimate how long it
will take someone else to learn

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.820
how to use the cellphone.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.190
The more adept you
are at using it,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.469
the less time you think
it'll take other people

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.560
to learn to use it-- because it
just seems so obvious to you.

00:34:35.678 --> 00:34:37.219
I believe that the
Curse of Knowledge

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:40.130
is the chief contributor
to opaque writing.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.130
It simply doesn't
occur to the writer

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:46.370
that the readers haven't
learned the jargon, don't

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.699
know the intermediate
steps that to the writer

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.870
seem too obvious to mention.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.960
They can't visualize
a scene, that

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.560
in the writer's mind's
eye, is as clear as day.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.280
And so the writer doesn't
bother to explain the jargon,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.000
or to spell out the logic, or
to supply the concrete details

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.970
that allow the scene
to be visualized.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.180
Just to give you
an example, here

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.980
is a passage of prose from a
review article in a journal

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.810
called "Trends in
Cognitive Science"

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:19.030
that is meant to be
read by a wide audience

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.780
of cognitive scientists
such as myself.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.202
I read it, and I had no idea
what they were talking about.

00:35:24.202 --> 00:35:25.160
And here's the passage.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.750
It's from an article
on consciousness.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.350
"The Slow and integrative
nature of conscious perception

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.580
is confirmed behaviorally by
observations such as the rabbit

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.480
illusion, and its
variants, where

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.100
the way in which a stimulus
is ultimately perceived

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.100
is influenced by
poststimulus events

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.250
arising several
hundreds of milliseconds

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.485
after the original stimulus.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.110
Well the writer has
clearly expected

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.570
that every reader would know
what the rabbit pollution is,

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.945
but I've been in this
business nearly 40 years,

00:35:53.945 --> 00:35:55.070
and I've never heard of it.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.270
Nor was it clear what
the rest of the passage

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:04.400
meant, what a stimulus was,
what does the way in which

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.630
a stimulus is perceived
mean, and so on.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:11.745
So I did a bit of digging,
went to my books on my shelf,

00:36:11.745 --> 00:36:13.620
and I found that there
is such a thing called

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.400
the cutaneous rabbit solution
that works as follows.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.960
If someone closes
their eyes then

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.450
someone else taps them three
times on the wrist, three times

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.230
of the elbow, three
times on the shoulder.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.220
It feels like the series
of taps running up

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:32.150
the length of your arm, kind
of like a hopping rabbit.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:36.520
The significance is where you
perceive the early taps depends

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.280
on the later taps, so
consciousness doesn't simply

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.070
track events in real time, but
it retrospectively edits them

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.790
so the way in which you
perceive the tap on the elbow

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.710
affects where you perceive
the tap on the wrist.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.150
Well that's kind of
interesting, but why didn't they

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.640
just say that?

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.860
Instead of stimulus this,
and poststimulus that?

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.830
It would've taken no
more words, and it

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.040
would have been more scientific,
rather than less scientific,

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.600
because now a reader has a way
of evaluating the argument.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.040
Does that really show
that conscious perception

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.290
is slow and integrative,
or might there

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.785
be some alternative explanation?

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.870
The dangers of the Curse
of Knowledge, for me,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.940
are best-illustrated
by an old joke.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:28.060
Where a man walks
into the dining room

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.640
one of the old
Catskills resorts.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.700
And he sees it bunch of
retired Borscht Belt comedians,

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.190
sitting around a table.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.750
He joins them, and
listens to what's going.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:44.110
And one of the old
timers says, 37.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.510
And everyone else erupts
in uproarious laughter.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:51.400
Another one says, 112,
again, peels of guffaws.

00:37:52.262 --> 00:37:53.720
I can't figure out
what's going on,

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.640
so he asked the guy next to
him, what's happening here?

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.560
Guys as well get these guys have
been around each other so long

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.740
but they all know
the same jokes,

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.212
so to save time they've
given each joke a number.

00:38:04.212 --> 00:38:06.670
And now, when they want to tell
a joke, all they have to do

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.220
is recite the number.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.990
Guys says, that's
ingenious, let me try it.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:14.040
So he says, 121.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.810
Stony silence.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.910
27.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.120
Then everyone stares at
him, and no one laughs.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.930
He sinks back down to his
seat, and he asks the guy

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.550
next to him, what
happened, what I do wrong?

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.470
The guy said, oh, it's
all in how you tell it.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.380
But anyway, giving jokes
numbers is what all of us

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.380
do, all too often without
realizing that others have

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.550
no way of knowing
what they refer to.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.960
Well how do you exercise
the Curse of Knowledge?

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.230
The traditional
solution is to always

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.750
keep in mind the reader
over your shoulder.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.430
Remember who you
are writing for.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.650
Well this is good
as far as it goes.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.110
But it doesn't go terribly
far because psychologists

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.180
have shown that we're actually
not terribly good at guessing

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.840
other people's knowledge,
even when we try.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.750
None of us is blessed with
the gift of clairvoyance,

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:10.350
and people are often
over-confident in their ability

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.870
to define the mental states
of other individuals.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.890
But still, it's a start so
for what it's worth, hey,

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.560
I'm talking to you, your readers
know much less than you think

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.070
they do and unless you try very
hard to imagine what you know

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:30.760
that they don't know who you
are guaranteed to confuse them.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.270
But a better way to deal
with the Curse of Knowledge

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:37.600
is to actually get a
real live other person,

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.310
show them a draft, and
see if they can follow it.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:45.890
All too often, one will discover
that what's obvious to you,

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.510
is not obvious to anyone else.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.550
You can also show
a draft to yourself

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:54.480
after some time has passed,
and it's no longer familiar.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.890
If you're like me you
will find yourself saying,

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:01.130
that doesn't follow,
what did I mean by that?

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.440
And all too often,
who wrote this crap?

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.990
Most advice on writing
should be interpreted

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:12.890
not as advice on how to write
but as advice on how to revise,

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.130
something that you can
only realize once you have

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.590
enough distance from
the prose to recognize

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.620
your own curse of
knowledge and then

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.520
to apply all of your
cognitive efforts

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.520
on improving the clarity
of the prose itself.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.830
Finally, how should we
think about correct usage?

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:36.220
The issue of language that
probably draws more attention

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.290
than all other writing
issues put together.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.170
Now some usages
are clearly wrong.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.300
When Cookie Monster
says, me want cookie,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.240
the error is so obvious that
it's the basis of the humor

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.245
that even a preschool
child can appreciate.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.980
Similarly, I Can
has Cheezburger,

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.720
if we did not recognize that
that was a grammatical error,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.360
there would be nothing
funny to the extent

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.950
that there is anything
funny about lolcats

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.765
and similar internet memes.

00:41:12.765 --> 00:41:15.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.100
"Is our children learning?"

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.060
This is so obviously
a grammatical error

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.640
that even President
George W Bush,

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.980
in a self-deprecating speech
called attention to it

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.905
as an error in making
fun of himself.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.200
There are other usages though,
or alleged usage errors

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.450
that are not so clear.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:41.480
And just to be bipartisan, in
1992 Bill Clinton while running

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.100
for president, had as
one of his taglines,

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.670
"Give Al Gore and I a chance
to bring America back."

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:54.040
The despised "between you and
I" error which language purists

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.242
pointed at the time
as a damning sign

00:41:58.242 --> 00:41:59.450
of his linguistic ineptitude.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.120
Another democratic
President, Barack Obama,

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.670
recently said "No
American should

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.660
live under a cloud
of suspicion just

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.360
because of what they look like."

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.920
The supposed
singular "they" error

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:18.240
in which the plural pronoun
they has a singular antecedent,

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:18.740
no American.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.330
"To boldly go where no
man has gone before."

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.330
The infamous split infinitive.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.760
"You think you lost your love.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.060
Well I saw her yesterday.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.850
It's you she's thinking of,
and she told me what to say."

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:39.170
The preposition at the
end of the sentence.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:44.900
And then the urbane, suave,
sophisticated talk show host

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.170
from the 1970s, Dick Cavett, in
a recent article for "The New

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.240
York Times" describing what
it's like to go to his college

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.400
reunion said, "Checking
into the hotel

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.100
it was nice to see a few of my
old classmates in the lobby."

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.036
Any of you spot the
grammatical error in that one?

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.700
It is the dangling
participle for those of you

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.520
who went to school in
the 1960s or earlier.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.270
Well contested issues
like this have given rise

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.440
to what journalist sometimes
called The Language

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.740
War between-- allegedly
between the prescriptivists,

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.970
and the descriptivists.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.880
According to this,
construction on one side

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.860
there are people
who prescribe how

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.490
other people ought
to speak and write.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:35.860
Their credo might be summarized
as follows, "Rules of usage

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.300
are objectively correct.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.090
To obey them is to uphold
standards of excellence.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:42.710
To flout them is to dumb
down literate culture,

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:47.040
degrade the language, and hasten
the decline of civilization."

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.940
On the other side are
the descriptivists,

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.180
who describe how people
do speak and write.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.200
Their credo might be
that, "Rules of usage

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.590
are the secret handshake
of the ruling class.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:00.360
The people should be liberated
to write however they please."

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.310
Well if this was
a genuine debate,

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.080
and I suspect it is not,
then the prescriptivists

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.630
should have said that
the Beatles lyrics should

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.820
have been "It's you of
whom she's thinking."

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.350
And the descriptivists
should insist

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.710
that there is nothing wrong
with, "I can has cheeseburger."

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:23.070
Well, this doesn't seem
to be a productive way

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.320
to analyze problems of usage.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.100
And indeed, I think that
this is a false dichotomy.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.830
We need a better way of
thinking about usage.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.400
Well are rules of usage?

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.090
What does it mean
to say that I Can

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:41.150
has Cheezburger is a grammatical
error or for that matter,

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:44.890
give Al Gore and I a chance
to bring America back.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.690
These rules, whatever
they are there

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:50.090
are not an objective fact
about the physical world

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.890
that a scientist could go out
and observe with instrument.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:01.380
Nor are they theorems of logic
that a logician could prove.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.510
Many people believe
that rules of usage

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.830
are stipulated by a governing
body, such as the editors

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.170
of dictionaries, and I can
speak with some authority

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.500
here to say that
this is not true.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.950
I'm the chair of the usage
panel of the American Heritage

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:23.050
Dictionary and when I joined,
the first question I asked

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.150
of the dictionary's editors
was, how do you guys

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.735
decide what goes
in the dictionary?

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.220
And the answer was "We pay
attention to the way people use

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.160
words."

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.410
That is, when it
comes to English,

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.000
there's no one in charge.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.585
The lunatics are
running the asylum.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.950
So what then are
rules of usage given

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.530
that they are not objective
facts about the world,

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:52.580
logical truths, or stipulated
by a governing authority.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.200
You can think of them as
tacit-evolving conventions.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.030
Convention is a
way of doing things

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:03.110
that has no inherent
advantages other than the fact

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:07.070
that everyone else has agreed
to abide by them as well.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.690
An obvious example
is paper currency,

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:13.910
why there's a green, rectangular
piece of paper have value?

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.240
It's because everyone else
thinks that it has value.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.060
Why do we drive
on the right, not

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.064
because there's anything
superior about the right as

00:46:22.064 --> 00:46:23.480
opposed to the
left, but there are

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.970
very good reasons to
drive on the same side

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:27.680
than everyone else
is driving on,

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.750
whichever side it happens to be.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.360
There's a joke
about man commuting

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.290
to work who gets a cell
phone call from his wife.

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:38.950
She warns him, honey, I've
been listening to the radio,

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.560
you should be very careful.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.880
There's a maniac on
the highway, he's

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.500
driving in the wrong
direction on the expressway.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.952
And he says, one maniac?

00:46:47.952 --> 00:46:48.910
There are 100s of them.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.530
And the conventions
of usage are tacit,

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.580
that is they are not
legislated by a governing body,

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.290
say like the Rules Committee
of Major League Baseball.

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.360
But they emerge as
a rough consensus

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.410
within a virtual community
of careful writers

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.811
without any explicit
deliberation, agreement,

00:47:07.811 --> 00:47:08.436
or legislation.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.490
And it's an evolving
convention in that

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.590
that consensus may
change over time.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.900
So should writers
follow the rules?

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.190
And the answer is, it depends.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.360
Some rules simply extend the
logic of everyday grammar

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.530
to more complicated cases.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.930
Why do we say that, "Is
our children learning?"

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.600
is grammatically incorrect?

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.500
Well, it is equivalent to
"Our children is learning,"

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.150
and everyone agrees that,
"Our children is learning."

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.410
is gramatically incorrect.

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:41.960
Similarly, "The impact of the
cuts have not been felt yet."

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.390
There, it's a little
harder to spot the error,

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:48.570
but when you simply take out the
intervening phrase of the cuts

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.770
you get, "The impact
have not been felt yet,"

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.250
and again it pops
out as an error.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:57.800
The writer was misled by
the adjacent noun, cuts,

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.300
which is plural into
using a plural verb.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:03.040
Whereas in fact the subject
of the sentence is, impact,

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.080
a few words upstream,
which is singular.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.090
When you get rid of that
intervening phrase then

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.180
the violation pops out at you.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:18.800
Now you all recognize the
notorious green wiggly line

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.830
of Microsoft's grammar checker.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.510
Probably most of the
green wiggly lines

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.870
that you will discover
in your drafts

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:30.850
consist of errors
of number agreement

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:34.780
that you may fail to have
spot because the sentence is

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.610
inverted, or a few
words get in between.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.794
But we can all agree that
these really are errors

00:48:39.794 --> 00:48:41.210
and they really
should be avoided.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.520
Also there are some
prescriptive rules

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.800
that make important
semantic distinctions.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.240
Namely, if you are addressing
a literate leadership,

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.490
they may have different
interpretation

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:57.100
than the one you had in mind.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.100
For example, the
word fulsome is not

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.630
a fancy synonym the word full.

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:08.520
If you were to thank someone
for the fulsome letter

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.360
that they sent you, would
not be praising them,

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.000
you would not be
praising yourself,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.070
because fulsome
does not mean full,

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:18.560
it means insincere
or excessively

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.165
and insincerely flattering.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.580
Likewise, simplistic is
not a fancy-schmancy way

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:30.600
of saying simple, simplistic
means overly or naively simple.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.610
Fortuitous in the expectation
of most literate readers

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.810
is not another way
of saying fortunate.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:42.420
And if someone is
meritorious, I advise you not

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.320
to call them meretritious.

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.580
If you're not sure why,
look it up in a dictionary.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:52.240
In general, English does
not tolerate synonyms

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.250
that share the same root,
but vary in their suffixes,

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.300
and so one should
resist the temptation

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.000
to try to sound
posh on the cheap

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.700
by using a hoity-toity
version of a familiar word.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.190
If you do, you might
elicit the reaction

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.560
that Vizzini did in
the Princess Bride

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.580
when he kept using the
word inconceivable to refer

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:17.790
to things that just happened.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.580
You keep using that word.

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.920
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:28.280
On the other hand, not
every grammatical pet peeve,

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.540
or bit of folklore, or
dimly-remembered lesson

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.530
from Ms. Thistlebottom's
classroom

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.410
is a legitimate role of usage.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.510
Many of the alleged roles in
fact violate grammatical logic,

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:43.080
are routinely flouted
by the best writers,

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.180
and have always been
flouted by the best writers.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.880
An excellent example
being singular they.

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.270
In a recent rant in a
conservative magazine,

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:56.310
one language grump
argued that singular

00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:00.230
they was an innovation brought
on by radical feminists,

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:04.020
and that we should
all try to insert

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:08.360
a gender neutral monstrosity
into the English language,

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.600
and that we should ignore
these radical feminists

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.845
and instead go back to the pure,
crystalline language of Jane

00:51:16.845 --> 00:51:17.345
Austen.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.150
Well a scholar named
Henry Churchyard

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:24.580
in an article called "Everyone
Loves Their Jane Austen"

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.990
actually went back to
the crystalline prose

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.440
of Jane Austen and found
that she used singular they

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.990
no fewer than 87 times.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.710
So what's a writer to do?

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.230
How should a careful writer
distinguish legitimate rules

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.420
of usage from the bogus ones?

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.180
Well the answer is
unbelievably simple.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.110
Look them up.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:45.740
Look them up in a modern
dictionary or style guide.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.740
Many sticklers and snoots
and peasants and peevers

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.520
assume that any rule
that they remember

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.870
will be backed up by the major
dictionaries and style manuals.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.690
Whereas in fact,
these reference books,

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:02.980
which do pay close attention
to English as actually

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.680
used by competent writers are
the most adamant debunkers

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.800
of grammatical nonsense.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:13.090
If you look up split infinitive
in the Merriam Webster

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:15.650
unabridged, for example,
here's what you will find.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:17.520
"It's all right to
split an infinitive

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.380
in the interest of clarity.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.530
Since clarity is the usual
reason for splitting,

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.130
this advice means
merely that you

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.980
can split them
whenever you need to."

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.920
And you'll get similar
device from American Heritage

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.110
Dictionary, the Encarta World
English Dictionary, the Random

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:33.640
House Dictionary, and so on.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.740
Modern dictionaries
and style manuals

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.310
do not, in fact, ban
split infinitives,

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:42.410
singular they, prepositions at
the end of sentences and so on.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.400
They represent the difference
between reasoned evidence based

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.540
usage advice versus kind of
smarty pants one-up-manship.

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:55.590
Also, correct usage should
be kept in perspective.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:58.630
So I think it is well
worth keeping in mind

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:00.370
correct and incorrect usage.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.680
It's the least important
part of good writing.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.470
You can obey every rule
that has ever been rooted,

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.430
and you can still be
a wretched writer.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:12.320
It is far less important
than classic style,

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.230
overcoming the
Curse of Knowledge.

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.450
To say nothing of
factual diligence,

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:18.845
and keeping ideas and
arguments coherent.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.480
Also, even the
most irksome errors

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.620
are not signs of the
decline of the language.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:31.690
And this is best captured
by an XKCD cartoon

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:33.700
by the now bestselling
author Randall

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.850
Munroe, in which he has a ghost
visiting a language purist

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:39.640
and says-- the
ghost says I bring

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.000
a cautionary vision
of things to come.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:43.860
This is the future.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.840
And this is the
future if you give up

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.305
the fight over the
world literally.

00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:51.410
That is, they are
exactly the same.

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.050
So to sum up, I think
that modern linguistics

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.210
and cognitive science
provide better ways

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.220
of our enhancing our prose.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:02.420
A model of prose communication,
namely classic style

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.470
in which language is a
window onto the world.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.180
An understanding
of the way language

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.550
works, in particular
the way that it

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.690
must convert a web of thoughts
into a linear string of words.

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:17.110
A diagnosis of why good
prose is so hard to write,

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:20.255
namely the Curse of
Knowledge, and a way

00:54:20.255 --> 00:54:22.730
to make sense of
rules of correct usage

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:26.380
as tacit, evolving conventions.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.036
Thank you very much.

00:54:28.036 --> 00:54:29.410
Any interrogatory
verbalizations?

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.160
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.230
If you have a
question, please step

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:45.780
to the stuff to
the microphone so

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.790
that you can be heard
on the recording,

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.010
and in remote offices.

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.790
I do apologize, we won't
have time for many questions,

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.740
maybe two or three
just because we had--

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.080
you cannot have too
much of a good thing,

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.480
I enjoyed it myself, even though
we went overtime a little bit.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.560
So, go ahead.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.660
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for a great talk.

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.000
I have a question,
I've always been

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.880
interested in how you have
all these curious examples,

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.110
not just in this presentation
but also in your books--

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:17.430
and I'm curious
how you index them?

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:20.100
Do you keep them in your
head or you search for them

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.160
specifically for
a particular case?

00:55:22.927 --> 00:55:23.760
STEVEN PINKER: Both.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.540
So I have-- for many
years, actually--

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.250
literally for
decades, literally.

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:32.260
I have-- in the
old days of paper,

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.730
I used to read
with the scissors,

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:37.630
and when I'd come across an
interesting example or a joke I

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:40.960
would cut it out, circle it,
put it in a couple of files.

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.610
Now I can cut and paste
or save digitally.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.570
For examples of bad prose,
I have the huge advantage

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:53.040
of being an academic.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.280
So I swim in the stuff.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.290
That was the easy part.

00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:02.240
And then there are some sites
that I took advantage of.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.590
It turns out there's a Pinterest
site, in which a woman just

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:10.960
collected every cartoon or
sticker or t-shirt she could

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.090
find that was about
grammar, and so that

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:18.700
was a rich source of grammatical
humor that I can wander.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.650
And as I was writing
the book, I especially

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:27.010
kept an eye open for examples
that would illuminate a point.

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:28.758
So a bit of everything.

00:56:33.209 --> 00:56:35.125
AUDIENCE: Hi there,
thanks for the great talk.

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.791
I'm looking forward
to reading the book.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.210
Just a small thing
I would say first,

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.797
but you reminded me
that 15 years ago when

00:56:42.797 --> 00:56:44.755
I was shopping for a
dictionary in a bookstore,

00:56:44.755 --> 00:56:46.880
I actually was digging
through the dictionaries

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.420
and rejecting all the ones
that had incentivize in there

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.940
as a word, because
it's not a word.

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.300
But I guess it is
because people use it.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.410
STEVEN PINKER: Yes
in fact it is a word.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:56:59.650
AUDIENCE: Darn it!

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:03.000
And also figuratively
versus literally actually

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.720
has been misused for
a really long time,

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.270
there's a lot of
history on that.

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:12.210
But I was wondering, you
kept talking about language,

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:13.810
and I kept wondering,
well this is--

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:15.476
you're talking about
language but you're

00:57:15.476 --> 00:57:16.610
talking about English.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:20.230
Have you explored anything with
other linguists about problems

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:23.390
like this that are similar
in other either Latin based

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:25.235
languages, or not
Latin based languages?

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.440
STEVEN PINKER: I imagine
that much of the advice

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.880
would carry over.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.100
We all comprehend things
using the same brains

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.070
and the advantage of
allowing your reader

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:43.350
to visualize something as
opposed to just spooning out

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:46.460
cliches surely holds
in every language.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:52.310
And indeed, classic style which
is the central image from which

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:58.369
a lot of these bits of advice
are theorems, are implications.

00:57:58.369 --> 00:57:59.785
According to Thomas
and Turner, it

00:57:59.785 --> 00:58:02.640
was actually invented by
the great French essayists

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.830
of the 17th century.

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:06.220
And even though French
style is in many ways

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.760
different from English
style, they credit writers

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.700
like Descartes, and
[INAUDIBLE] with coming up

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:15.310
with this conceit of pretending
that you're describing

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:18.200
a world all the differences
between the French language

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.700
and English language
clearly did not matter.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:25.020
There are, to be sure, there
must be some differences,

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:31.020
especially when it comes to the
way in which the linearization

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.170
of words in syntax conveys
a tangled web of ideas.

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:38.330
Because there there are some
obvious cross linguistic

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:39.150
differences.

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:41.734
In German for example,
the verb comes

00:58:41.734 --> 00:58:43.900
at the end of the sentence
instead of the beginning.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:49.090
And so the tips on how to engage
the reader's mind in real time

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:51.450
would have to be
modified accordingly.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:53.750
I'll find out when
this book is translated

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:56.880
into other languages
how many questions I get

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.220
and how the translator
will deal with them.

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:03.950
As far as the words-- new
words like incentivize go,

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:06.850
incentivize actually turns
out to be a pretty useful word

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:10.420
because there's
no-- remember, one

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.040
of the guidelines for writing
is omit needless words.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.210
And if you say something
like layout incentives for,

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:19.260
that's an awful lot
of needless words.

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:25.270
Moreover, when you compress
a phrase into a verb,

00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:27.780
it adds a semantic difference.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.770
Namely that it implies
that there's something

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:33.870
that you are directly
and immediately causing.

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:38.010
And as we become more aware
that policy changes that

00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:41.450
may have been thought up
and implemented to achieve

00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:45.580
some abstract goal may
have perverse results.

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.700
Because as soon as they
lay out the incentives,

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.440
people will follow
the incentives.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.210
Perhaps doing
something the opposite

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.010
of what the writers
of legislation intend,

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:57.540
the verb incentivize reminds
you that in doing something

00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:02.270
you are automatically changing
the landscape of options

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:04.870
and so it conveys an
additional meaning

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.867
above and beyond
creating incentives for.

01:00:06.867 --> 01:00:08.325
AUDIENCE: Right it
makes it active.

01:00:09.229 --> 01:00:11.270
STEVEN PINKER: Exactly,
it's active, it's direct,

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.940
it's causal.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.815
AUDIENCE: As opposed to
providing incentives.

01:00:14.392 --> 01:00:15.350
STEVEN PINKER: Exactly.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.310
AUDIENCE: Which does
sound kind of passive.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.359
I've gotten over it,
it was 15 years ago.

01:00:19.359 --> 01:00:20.150
So I'm over it now.

01:00:21.522 --> 01:00:23.730
STEVEN PINKER: In fact so
what you are going through,

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.271
and probably many
people in this room

01:00:25.271 --> 01:00:28.480
have gone through
our own lifetimes

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.950
is what E.B. White never went
through in the transition

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:38.340
from to contact as a neologism
to a part of every day English.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.780
And so this happens.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:42.780
Whether or not you're
convinced by my arguments

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:45.180
that incentivize
is a useful word,

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.630
it doesn't matter what we think.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.700
If people use it, it becomes
entrenched in the language.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.310
Yes, the dictionary
writers will include it,

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.500
they have no choice.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.380
There are selling a product
that has to be useful.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.680
What does useful mean?

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.590
You write according to the
way that your readers will

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.660
expect words to be used.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.520
What we do int he American
Heritage Dictionary is

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.340
that because it's
not-- generally,

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.520
when you look something
up in a dictionary,

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.240
you don't care about how
any old person on the street

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240
uses language.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.890
You have in mind a kind of
virtual audience of readers

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:23.280
who care about language, who
expect the writer to take care

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.820
in their choice of words.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.110
So we assembled a sample,
called the usage panel

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:35.100
of about 200 journalists,
linguists, sports writers,

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.010
poets, novelists, kind
of a sample of people

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:40.750
who just have shown
they care about words.

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:45.390
And we pole them, we ask them,
what do you think incentivize?

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:48.400
And their decisions
will determine

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.730
what goes into the dictionary.

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.700
And in cases where it's
too close to 50-50,

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.720
there will be a usage
note that just explains

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.870
the history of the word,
explains the current reaction,

01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:02.842
and you-- the writer can then
make an informed decision.

01:02:02.842 --> 01:02:04.425
AUDIENCE: I went
through my dictionary

01:02:04.425 --> 01:02:07.226
and put post-it notes on all
my favorites usage notes.

01:02:07.226 --> 01:02:08.600
STEVEN PINKER: Of
very good, yes.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.470
AUDIENCE: To be
graduated from college,

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:12.339
as opposed to
graduating from college.

01:02:12.339 --> 01:02:14.130
STEVEN PINKER: That's
an excellent example,

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:16.120
because there, again,
the language is changing,

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.660
there are purists who would
say it has to be graduated

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.710
from college, but that's not
the way people talk anymore.

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:24.451
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much.

01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:26.075
STEVEN PINKER: Thank
for your question.

01:02:26.645 --> 01:02:29.020
MALE SPEAKER: I apologize,
I'm afraid we'll have two more

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.435
questions, and then
we'll have to move on.

01:02:32.534 --> 01:02:35.200
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming,
it's so great to have you here.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.925
I studied you a long time ago
in a linguistics course at UCLA.

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:44.490
I-- on the subject of usage
and things becoming popular

01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:48.270
convention, and pet peeves,
I don't know how much

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.660
you're exposed to what
I call corporate ease ,

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:57.130
but I think this group knows
that people have started using

01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:02.630
verbs as nouns, or nouns as
verbs like top asks are top

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:04.677
asks in the meeting,
or are learnings.

01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:05.510
STEVEN PINKER: Asks.

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:07.040
AUDIENCE: Asks-- yeah, plural.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.970
It's very, very, irritating.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.860
Or the learnings that
we got from the trip.

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:18.430
Or to architect
something, make it a verb.

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:23.240
I want to know if this bothers
you as much as it does me,

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.870
and if you might consider
making a PSA demanding

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:29.920
but this be abolished.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.940
STEVEN PINKER: Well
the uh, I can't do it.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.690
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:36.719
I'll tell you why.

01:03:36.719 --> 01:03:38.010
AUDIENCE: You heard this right?

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:38.843
STEVEN PINKER: Yeah.

01:03:38.843 --> 01:03:39.920
Oh yes absolutely.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.300
And I have a Dilbert
cartoon where

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.780
the boss with the pointy hair
asks one of his employees,

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.310
I would like to task
you with the deliverable

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:50.490
and she and she
completely freaks out.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:52.960
My world is falling
apart, task is not a verb.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.420
A couple of observations--
one, it's not new.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:01.249
This has been going on, probably
for many number of centuries,

01:04:01.249 --> 01:04:03.290
probably at least since
the Middle English period

01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:05.430
or at least early
modern English.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:07.830
Again the reason that Strunk
and White had a problem

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.620
with to contact is that contact
for them was only a noun,

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.320
and it was turned into a verb.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.445
Now, do any of you have
a problem with contact?

01:04:15.445 --> 01:04:17.070
I don't have a problem
with to contact.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.360
And in fact, if you were to go
through any passage of prose,

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.670
you would find
probably about a fifth

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:27.260
of the verbs started
out life as nouns.

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.030
We notice the new ones,
but it's a process that's

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:31.810
been going on for
a long, long time.

01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:34.150
it's one of the things
that makes English English.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:38.180
And you often forget how many
verbs from nouns there are.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.960
To chair a meeting, to table
the motion, to pen your memoir,

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.090
to hand me the cookies,
to foot the bill.

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:51.590
There are-- it's only the new
ones that get under our skin.

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:54.960
It's not that it's inherent
to the English language

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.830
that verbing a noun
leads to a monstrosity.

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:01.740
Then there's a--
but I agree, there's

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:06.210
a lot of corporate
prose that is annoying,

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.150
especially when
it's unnecessary.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.190
But there are ones
that will earn

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:14.320
a foothold in the language
because as with incentivize

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.450
they not only capture a meaning
while omitting needless words,

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:22.770
but they add the extra
meaning that this is now

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:26.190
a conventional,
direct, causal process.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:29.780
And that's why task
started to creep in.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.810
Who knows whether it will last,
or be a fad word like some

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:35.740
of the ones for
the "Mad Men" era.

01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:42.290
But there's nothing we
can do, some new verbs

01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:45.506
will come from nouns
and vice versa.

01:05:45.506 --> 01:05:46.925
AUDIENCE: Trying to [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:46.925 --> 01:05:48.175
STEVEN PINKER: [LAUGHTER] Yes.

01:05:48.817 --> 01:05:50.240
Last question.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.650
Maybe say the serenity
prayer, accept the changes

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.920
that you can't do
anything about.

01:05:57.074 --> 01:05:59.240
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
literally a couple times,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.286
and how horrifying it can be.

01:06:01.286 --> 01:06:02.660
And there's also
some other words

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.450
like that have evolved to use be
used the opposite of what they

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:08.710
mean, like peruse, people use to
mean scan quickly when it means

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:10.410
to pour over in detail.

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:11.600
STEVEN PINKER: Yes, peruse.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.599
AUDIENCE: I'm all for the
evolution of language,

01:06:13.599 --> 01:06:15.370
but it seems like
not really productive

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.580
to have words evolve to mean
the opposite of what they mean.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.630
And I was wondering what
you think about that.

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:21.504
STEVEN PINKER: Right.

01:06:21.504 --> 01:06:24.780
Well there is this
category sometimes called

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.340
a contranyms or autoantonyms.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.450
Things like to dust,
which can either

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:33.260
mean to put dust on,
as in crop dusting,

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.915
or to take dust
away as in a duster.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:39.135
To sanction, to table.

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.490
Often what happens
is that words will--

01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:48.170
a word will start off and then
have varies near synonyms that

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.010
have slightly different
meanings and then

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:53.590
one meaning will give rise
to another until they meet

01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:57.860
and have sentences that
are the direct opposite.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.710
It doesn't happen all that
often and usually these things

01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:03.280
are clear in context.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.350
The vast majority of words
have more than one meaning.

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:08.390
You just flip over
dictionary to any word,

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.670
and it's meaning one,
meaning two, meaning three,

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:14.530
and generally they are
distinguished by context.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:19.790
They can survive side by
side, so the word literate

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:23.350
can mean either actually
capable of reading,

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:25.590
or it could mean sophisticated.

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.770
Conservative can
mean on the right

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.550
of the American
political spectrum

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.259
or resistant to change.

01:07:32.259 --> 01:07:33.800
And so you have
conservative liberal,

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.360
and it's not an oxymoron.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.935
So word meanings can coexist.

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.940
In terms of doing
something about it

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:49.270
I quote the famous exchange
between Margaret Fuller who

01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.050
once wrote, I
accept the universe.

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:55.490
And Thomas Carlyle who
said, god, you better.

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:57.700
Language change is
going to happen,

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.570
and there's almost nothing
that one can do about it.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.430
It doesn't mean that language
degenerates or deteriorates

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:10.610
though because often the
sloppy meanings that we dislike

01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:13.860
can survive side by side
with the precise meaning

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.000
that we do like.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.899
And it's interesting to go
back in the history of usage

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:21.460
and find the same issues
that annoy people today

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.880
were annoying people
a century ago.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.510
So if you're one of the
people-- one of those who likes

01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:30.890
the word disinterested to mean
without a vested interest as

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:32.649
opposed to being a
synonym for bored.

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:36.979
And you worry if people use
disinterested to mean cored,

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:40.120
we're going to lose that lovely
word disinterested meaning

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.214
unbiased or without
a best interest.

01:08:42.214 --> 01:08:43.880
But people have been
using disinterested

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.890
to mean bored for
centuries, and we still

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:51.290
have the more precise meaning
without a vested interest in.

01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:56.790
So language change does not
imply language degeneration.

01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:58.950
Often the more precise
word is available.

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:01.930
And literally is another
example, a lot of people

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:04.073
use it to me as a kind
of an intensifier,

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:04.864
a bit of hyperbole.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.290
But there's still cases
in which you use literally

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:09.980
to mean literally
it's clear in context

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.479
that that's the way
you're using it.

01:09:13.058 --> 01:09:15.224
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
very much, Professor Pinker,

01:09:15.224 --> 01:09:16.160
it's been a joy.

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:21.450
And thank you all for coming.
