Treat yourself to,
you know,
you masturbate ally,

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.870
you enjoy yourself.
You know,

9
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:37.750
you should spend your money on your bed and you should spend your money on your

10
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:41.030
masturbation instead of like,
you could go out to tea,

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.890
did get some beers and pay for the same price that you would for our flashlight

12
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:48.040
and you'd get so much more enjoyment out of like just having eight beers and a

13
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:51.840
shot at Applebee's,
you know?
Okay.
You lost me there somewhere.

14
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.870
Some way lost me.
I was with you.
I was trying to,
I was rooting on Ya.

15
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.140
I was hoping you going to pull it out.
Can I of an Applebee's flashlight asshole.

16
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:02.920
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
They had all,
they have the asphalt paving a mile,
two days in a row,

17
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.430
two asshole questions in a row.
I think that's why I just,
I don't know.

18
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.520
Good question,
Mandy.
Ever since I've been doing the podcast where you guys,

19
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.010
when I first got here,
they just had one size fits all.

20
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.300
Now you know they've expanded the flashlight,

21
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:16.570
so I want to know how long once they've expanded.
Yeah,

22
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.530
they've gotten miles vampire miles.
They've got all kinds of freak shit.

23
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.590
I should have been a vampire sucking dick like a savage.

24
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.510
The erotic ness of erotic next.
Is that a word?

25
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.480
Just get some brain field rotation.

26
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.090
The teeth sliced by your Dick with blood coming out of her fangs.
Gary's,

27
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.760
Ooh.
Sucking your helmet.
Tremendous.
Would she be able to do it and not hurt you?

28
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.740
Yeah,
those vampires could do it all.
Fucked professional.

29
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.750
That's why they lived in a 2000 though.

30
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.700
Fucking worthless after fucking 80 yee.
Ah,

Entering the code named Rogan.

32
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:58.840
Dirty bitches were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,
n n I t.

33
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.470
Makers of Alpha brain.
Get up on it.
Yeah,
it,
uh,

34
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.930
what Alpha brain is is a dude.
You should be ours.
We got to buy it today.

35
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.190
He's crazy.
This,
um,

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.700
go to [inaudible] dot com and explore all the different products.

37
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.600
Alpha brain is the nootropic.
It's a,
uh,

38
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.080
essentially what nootropics are as vitamins and minerals that have been shown to

39
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:23.380
enhance cognitive function.
There's some,
uh,

40
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.130
some debate about all this stuff and there's some controversy behind it.

41
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.610
So go and Google it.
I personally believe in that had been,

42
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.390
I'd been taking nootropics,
nootropics rather before,
uh,

43
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.590
I had ever taken Alpha brain and Alpha brain is without a doubt that all the

44
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.850
stuff I've tried,
my favorite,

45
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.450
but there's a lot of other good stuff out there to build.
Roman [inaudible],

46
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.450
that guy,
he has one.
We talked about this,
Joey called neuro one,

47
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.820
and I believe he came up with his,

48
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:52.330
because he had suffered a bunch of concussions,
right.

49
00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:55.780
And he was trying to get himself some nutrients that it would help his brain

50
00:02:55.781 --> 00:03:00.010
function.
So that was him.
Um,
in Roman law scans a really good

51
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.560
<v 2>one,
that neuro one,
but Alpha brain is the one we sell.</v>

52
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.310
If you're interested in it and you order it and you the first 30 pills,

53
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.360
there's a 100% money back guarantee.
If you try it and you're like,

54
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.870
this doesn't,
I don't feel anything.
Fuck this.
This is stupid.

55
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.850
You get your money back.
I,
that's how much we believe in it as much.

56
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.040
How much people who use it enjoy it and order it again.

57
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.140
And because we don't want to rip anybody off.

58
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:27.220
I don't want anybody feeling like somehow or another they got fucked.

59
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.020
So it's real simple.
30 days or 30 pills rather,
the first 30 pills,

60
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.930
you don't even have to return them.
You just say this stuff,
socks,

61
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.430
you get your money back.
It's that simple.
Um,
we have a shroom tech sport,

62
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:41.320
which is,
uh,
an athletic supplement.

63
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.070
A and endurance supplements got a lot of B 12 in it and cordyceps mushrooms.

64
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.210
And it's uh,

65
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.210
based on the idea that there's certain mushrooms that actually can aid in your,

66
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.130
your body's ability to process oxygen.

67
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.120
Like people in high altitudes would eat these mushrooms to help them give them

68
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.710
energy to at high altitudes and um,
controversy behind that too.

69
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.860
I like it.
It's great stuff.

70
00:04:03.861 --> 00:04:06.130
There's a lot of B 12 and eight which is also excellent for you.

71
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.340
And then the shroom tech immune and then a new moon,

72
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:13.390
which would say five HTP and l tryptophan supplement,

73
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.020
which can enhance your serotonin levels.
All interesting stuff.

74
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.560
Go to [inaudible] dot com and just check it out.

75
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.600
<v 3>How many levels of trip,</v>

76
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.110
how much strip the fan is that like if I have a problem sleeping,

77
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:28.790
if I take check trip to fan,
I'm pass out for a few weeks.
No,
no,
no,
no.

78
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:31.820
For the first few weeks when people said you take trip to fan,

79
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.760
you know when you're a high strung,
you take it home at night for the first week,

80
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:37.640
eight days it works.
Then you outgrow it.
Like anything else.

81
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.120
If I take that with a trip to find the daytime.
Well,
I feel tired.

82
00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:43.940
Have you taken it a day?
I only take it at night.
Okay.
That's,
yeah.

83
00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:47.090
I take it before I go to sleep.
I'm not trying to be cute,
you know?
No,
no,
no.

84
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:48.560
I know what you're saying.
Yeah.

85
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.850
You say you're gonna take Melatonin if you can't go to sleep.

86
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:55.370
Do you ever taken I used to.
I used to.
Well,
Tom is nice,
but it lasts eight days.

87
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:59.030
You,
I'll do it.
You got to start a new cycle every like 10 days or it right.

88
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.010
You have to eat too many of them,
but it does work.

89
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.640
What's the Turkey Turkey's trip to fan trip to.
Okay.
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.850
<v 2>I just,
I think right now it was,</v>

91
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.950
<v 3>yeah.
Yeah.

Anyway,

Dirty freaks.

Mad Flavor,

94
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.040
Aka Joe Diaz.
Let's get the party started.

95
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.260
<v 4>The Joe Rogan experience.
Try my day.</v>

96
00:05:30.261 --> 00:05:32.870
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

97
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.873
Bam.

98
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.580
<v 3>Ladies and gentlemen,
the one and only the king of swing.</v>

99
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.920
Remember when,
uh,
Mitzi was calling you fat baby for awhile.
A long time.

100
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:50.754
I loved it.

101
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.260
And I would walk past her and she'd blow my stomach out or they have fingers.

102
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:57.980
You make believer was a needle.
Do you remember that?
In her world?
I would walk

103
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 5>by and she'd stopped me,</v>

104
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.990
all fat baby and she poked me like she had a needle in her hand and by yourself

105
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.620
she'd go.

106
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.620
So like if the air was coming out of my stomach in her own head and she would

107
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.640
giggle to herself that she did that for the rest of my life.
Baby,

108
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.670
she had a 40th anniversary on Saturday.
Uh,
the club,

109
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.560
which a part of me got sentimental Yami autonomy jerked off on my pillow,

110
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:22.394
you know what I'm saying?

111
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.280
But like the comedy store always be a part of our lives.

112
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:29.180
It's like Vietnam for some people.
They went,
they'll never go back.
It's that.

113
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:32.960
It's good.
We'll just leave it there and our memory.
But yeah,
it's installations.

114
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.510
It was a huge part of our lives.
No doubt about that place was,
uh,

115
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.880
there was,
uh,
a real workshop.
But you know what,

116
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.380
I'm still recovering from Atlanta.

117
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.240
I just got rested yesterday from Atlanta pitchers especially fry and I thank you

118
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.870
very much.
If you came out to the shows,
the support Joe Rogan and this taping,

119
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.170
it was fucking brilliant.
I mean,
when we had Duncan stuck,

120
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:57.020
I had a serious,
you know,
I don't do that shit.

121
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.670
I didn't go on stage and try to be cute.

122
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.000
I just stuck my head out to see what was out there.

123
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.420
I had never been in this seat before.
You know,
before you bungee jump,

124
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:08.360
you talk a lot of shit before you do anything in life.
You talked a lot of shit.

125
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.720
Then you're there and you look in.
That's what it felt like to me guys.

126
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.540
It was like going,
yeah,
I'll jump off that diving board.

127
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.570
And you run up to the top and when you get up there,

128
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.780
you look over and you're like,
Ooh.

129
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.410
That was a little bit more when I looked into that tabernacle fucking theater

130
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.440
and it just wasn't one level.
It was two levels.

131
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:26.150
Then that third fucking level guys,

132
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:29.240
and they started cheering and you ran in with Jeff and you're like,

133
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.160
what happened?
Did you go on stage?
I didn't go on stage.

134
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.740
Me and Duncan just popped her fucking heads out there.

135
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.220
At that point I knew it was all fucking up pill because the energy was alive,

136
00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:41.070
but we didn't have to do nothing.
We didn't say a word,
no cock sucker,

137
00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:41.841
no being cute.

138
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:46.010
We just went like that to look just to see if everybody was seated.

139
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.680
So if you came out to the Tabernacle,

140
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:53.120
you rocked my motherfucking world last week.
First year I was nervous as fuck.

141
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.800
And uh,
you know,
I love it man.
I love getting nervous though.
Like a little kid.

142
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.700
That's what it's all about.
So I had a great time in Atlanta.
Downtown was great.

143
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:04.810
Thank you very much for taking his Joe.
Thanks for coming.
What a great fucking,

144
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.410
you know,
I've always been in the suburbs.
Whenever we do the punchline,

145
00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:09.890
the laughing whenever you always out in the fucking suburbs.

146
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:13.130
I was the first time I was in the heart of Atlanta,
chocolate city.

147
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.470
They had hot black chicks,
hot white chicks.

148
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:17.890
I sat down one morning fucking make a believer.

149
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:21.380
I was smoking fucking weed and I'm just watching these women walk by me.

150
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.770
Oh my God.
They were hot in the morning going to work and shit.

151
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:28.340
It was fucking amazing guys.
They're really was.
Who was the limo driver?

152
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.430
How far you're right though.
I'm fine.

153
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.960
[inaudible] after I tackled the and Shit,
I'm just listening to you.

154
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.060
That was funny that you said concussions because for somebody who's got a lot of

155
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:38.571
concussions,

156
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:42.260
you don't act like it because I think the crazy has overcome the concussion.

157
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.950
Who for me?
No,
for real.

158
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.560
[inaudible] like some people you see them after they got 20 concussions and

159
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.450
their little fucking robots,
but this guy,

160
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:51.860
how many concussions do you think you've had?

161
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.550
I heard stories at that motherfucker.
You you've had me.
Yeah.

162
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.760
I had walked to two to nothing from violence,

163
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:04.470
football and a motorcycle accident.
What does the housing,
both pretty violent.
No,

164
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:07.520
I,
you know,
you just talk bro.
Sometimes you just tackle somebody,

165
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.170
you think you're doing your job and all sudden you walk away and you're like,

166
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.820
Ooh,
I know,
but listen to what you just said.

167
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.730
Nothing from football or motorcycle racing to super violent things.
Oh No,
no,
no.

168
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.340
I put you man.

169
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.520
Didn't want people to think I got hit and everybody records held by a person.

170
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.970
One time I was on an Xr one 25 and I was racing by the swaps where they built

171
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.600
the Meadowlands and I turned my head and there was a pipe sticking.
I might just,

172
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.870
I didn't want to believe I didn't even bleed.
I just,

173
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.810
it just want to hit the floor so it wasn't as bad as Jesus.
Listen Bro.

174
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:39.090
Those concussions,
those,
when he shot me,

175
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.920
<v 2>the,
the,
the limo driver,
remembering the limo driver.</v>

176
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.580
When you were talking about weed or something like that and you were just like,

177
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:45.690
smelled this nug yeah.

178
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.240
<v 5>Oh,
that's right.
Oh,
that's right.
You videoed that.
Oh,</v>

179
00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:51.850
we had such a good time with him when I was telling you we can't put that out

180
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:53.170
there because they want to get him in trouble.

181
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.870
If the audio we can play right now,
if you're black,

182
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.030
you just stopped going to Africa.
I remember we went off on that shit in the car.

183
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.720
Just go to St Louis.
Yeah.
I mean this is the truth.

184
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.630
You black stop going to fucking Africa.
You can just kind to get scared.

185
00:10:04.631 --> 00:10:07.540
It gets too real.
Go to St Louis where they keep it.

186
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:11.980
Moderate brothers or people at Mater.
That's the woods.
Richard Pryor from Peoria,

187
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.590
Illinois.
Those areas there.

188
00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:17.200
That's where a Malcolm x and all those brothers are from.

189
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.350
That's the heartbeat of Africa right there.
Just keep it to that right there.

190
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.600
I think Red Fox grew up with Malcolm X,
one of those guys.
Really?

191
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.410
It was either Red Fox or a or a rich,
I think it was Red Fox.
I'm sorry.

192
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.970
Red Fox at Malcolm x grew up together.

193
00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:33.130
What about the dude in New York that caused all the problems?

194
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.050
He was somebody who's tour manager or something,

195
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.580
wasn't he James Brown's 12 manager.

196
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.790
What's the black guy that always gets involved when somebody black gets in

197
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:44.510
trouble?
He just lost a lot of ways.
These controversial I'll show up to.
Yeah.

198
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.590
Yeah.
James Brown's tour.
Somebody.
Yeah,
look at his resume.

199
00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:50.700
Somewhere along the line he was involved with something.

200
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.540
That's how he got his claim to fame at first.

201
00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:55.810
Somebody House Sharpton get his claim to see and look and see.
I may be wrong,

202
00:10:55.811 --> 00:11:00.690
I could be wrong,
but I'll Sharpton did something with James Brown or somebody

203
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.350
<v 2>that you need your own Google search engines.</v>

204
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.920
You can just type in like like something sharp.
Damn.
Fuck sorry guys.

205
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.410
<v 5>I'm just going to look.
James Brown up here.
Yeah,
they'll put it out.
Sharpton.</v>

206
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:14.580
So you see what it says?

207
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.160
He became a tour manager for James Brown in 1973 wow.
Wow.

208
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.160
How fuck you never know.

209
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.550
<v 2>I never do that to get up.
Hey,
he's hustling man.</v>

210
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.720
He's out there hustling.

211
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.550
Look a lot of people shit on Al Sharpton as far as I can tell al Sharpton and

212
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:31.990
hurting anybody.
And guess what,

213
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.730
even though maybe sometimes he's imbalanced with,
uh,
his,
uh,

214
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.330
his,
uh,
his racialism,
you know,

215
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.460
the way he goes after the racial angle and every sort of story,

216
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.570
even though he's imbalanced,

217
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.310
I think we probably need a little bit of imbalance to check some of the white

218
00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:49.960
people in America.
That's a fact.

219
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.550
I really think that knowing that a Jesse Jackson or an al out is out there,

220
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.990
these bulldogs of,
of anti black racism.
I mean,

221
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.910
I think the unnecessary,
I don't,
you know,

222
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:03.910
I don't think Jesse Jackson is the same.
I don't think Al Sharpton's the Saint,

223
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.150
but I think they're playing necessary role.
I know that sounds ridiculous,

224
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.270
but how are they any more ridiculous than Newt Gingrich or this Guy John Davids

225
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.110
that was running for president?
What's his name?
Davis.
I don't know.
The white guy.

226
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.230
We talked about him yesterday.
God Damn it.
What the fuck is his name?

227
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.130
Is that his name?
Tony Man.
Just go to CNN.
No,
just,
you know,

228
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.770
the problem is

229
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.340
<v 1>seriously,</v>

230
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.120
there's only so much room on the Goddamn hard drive and there's more information

231
00:12:30.121 --> 00:12:34.110
coming in every day.
What the fuck is the dude's name?
He's in the news right now.

232
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.800
We need to upgrade our brains.
We need to be able to do that.

233
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.690
They need to figure that out where we can start putting more dead people's

234
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.470
brains in our bodies or something.

235
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.190
Dead peoples like swapping out or just adding to it.
You know,

236
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.250
it's really hard to get your body to absorb other people's stuff like organs and

237
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.640
like they've had hand transplants and most of them fail,

238
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.670
but it doesn't give me rejects them.
Isn't your brain really just electricity?

239
00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:03.210
Isn't there a way we can maybe put it on a battery of some kind and then just,

240
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:04.650
you know,
put it in the back of your head.

241
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.600
<v 2>This might be the dumbest size conversation at all times.</v>

242
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.130
If the scientist is listening to this right now,

243
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.490
like I don't talk to Steve Listens to the podcast sometimes.

244
00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:17.540
If he's listening to us right now,
I'd like you fucking eat it or he's just like,

245
00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:21.440
Holy Shit.
You figured it out.
Battery brain batteries.
No,
I don't.

246
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.450
I don't hate anybody out there who's successful.
John Edwards.
John Edwards.

247
00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:31.250
Thank you John.
Thank you.
Have Fun.
Get Ya.
Nice.
Beautiful.
Um,
yeah.

248
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.550
That guy,
John Edwards,
I mean,
he's,
he's got damn ridiculous too.

249
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.630
Everyone's ridiculous.
There are no more ridiculous than Al Sharpton.
He's,

250
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.800
he's just like them.
They're all the same.
It's no big deal.
It's not,
it's not bad.

251
00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:45.280
It's just,
it is what it is.
It's anybody that puts themselves into that,

252
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.240
but sort of nomination.

253
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:48.900
You know how you get rid of the whole Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.
Oh,

254
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.970
what an envelope.
That's what I love about,
yeah.
Come up black.

255
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.170
This motherfuck preach it.
That's his answer.
Thank you.

256
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.650
What do I need to do?
Just go away.
Yeah.

257
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.650
And they just a fucking piano and I don't blame the legal shop.
I'll,

258
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.710
I'll yell and scream until somebody fucking,
here's me.
Yeah.
They get contracts.

259
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:12.320
I don't have any problem with it,
man.
It's extortion.
It's a part of the game.

260
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.230
It's,
that's what it is.
It's a part of the game.
You know,

261
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:19.370
if you want his endorsement,
that's what he's,
it's,
it's a business.
Okay.

262
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.060
Nobody rides for free.
He likes shrimp cocktail.
He likes flying first class.

263
00:14:23.061 --> 00:14:27.620
You know what I'm saying?
Why and why shouldn't it is a man of culture and he's,

264
00:14:27.621 --> 00:14:32.000
he's so famous that he's sort of given up on completely like saying all his

265
00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:36.990
words.
He's like given up on pronouncing them everybody else's way.
Like,

266
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.540
like they used to play that on,
was it Conway and Steckler I think?
Yeah.

267
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.570
Conway and Steckler in La used to have this thing called,

268
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.050
it would be a game called,
what would Jesse Jackson say?
I apologize if it wasn't,

269
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.100
if it was someone else

270
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.320
<v 1>and I'm crediting to them because of my shit memory,</v>

271
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.310
but I believe it was kind of weighing Steckler who are really great guys who had

272
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:02.150
a radio show in La and I think they might still do on on am,
but a,

273
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:07.151
they would play a Jesse Jackson clip and then you would try to try to figure out

274
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:09.430
what the fuck he said,
you know,

275
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.860
the people would call up and they would give up their guests and everybody was

276
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:17.060
wrong and then he would say,
what do you actually,
what the actual words were.

277
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.420
It was hilarious.
It was like people really could,
couldn't understand them.

278
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:25.340
That's how bad ass Jesse Jackson is.
He says his own words,
his own way.

279
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:31.310
You know like Mike Tyson.
Everybody does fuck them.
No.

280
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.180
What do they really want to talk about this?

281
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.530
What is it shady morph going off on me.
Is He still on his Twitter?

282
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.340
He's still going off.
All right,
go check out Jay Morrison.

283
00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:43.140
He's saying all these things right now about me.

284
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.300
Like one he said I offered you a job.

285
00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:47.460
You lied and said I asked you to buy me shit.

286
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.330
Weird obsession more has with you Jay.

287
00:15:51.331 --> 00:15:53.970
More a just to attack you out of nowhere on Twitter.

288
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.340
I wasn't for higher and maybe he's not talking about me.

289
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.310
Comics leave you because of you.
You're not respected by your peers.

290
00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:02.750
Change Your label name to exodus.
What?

291
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:08.390
Why you respond to that by even respond to that because it's weird.

292
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.680
It's certainly weird.
It's unhealthy.
Weirdest thing ever.
You you grow up,

293
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.630
you know watching Jay Mohr and movies,

294
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:18.780
you've never met the guy once and now there's a guys have assessed the value.

295
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.090
Well,
I don't know why he is,
you know,
I don't think Jay is a bad guy,
you know?

296
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.280
I know.
I don't know.

297
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.850
I know people have had issues with Jay and I know you've had issues with Jack

298
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.710
and I know I have never had an issue with Chai,
so as far as I'm concerned,

299
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.390
you know,
me and Jay more cool.

300
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:41.490
I don't like that he does this adult like I,
but people are crazy.

301
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.860
People that are comedians are crazy.

302
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.340
There's a percentage of whatever the fuck is going on in your head that's just

303
00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:49.230
not right.
It causes you to say shit.

304
00:16:49.231 --> 00:16:53.000
You shouldn't say it causes you to react to when you become,

305
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.270
you're an impulsive person.
I mean these are,

306
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.290
there's things that comedians do that are right here.
Right.

307
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.280
[inaudible]
you know,

308
00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:05.250
it's this,
the beauty of this,

309
00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:08.190
the beauty of the animals and it's imperfect wasn't,

310
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.780
he's not a bad guy though.
Radio station.

311
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.920
No.
I don't know if you wanted to talk about,
I don't know.

312
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:21.330
I don't know if it's true.
Yeah.
Sorry,
I can't say what else.
Go on the blog,

313
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.570
but here's my point.
If you,

314
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.320
if he's like spending his time and effort lashing out at you like that,

315
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.110
you know that's not healthy.
Yeah,
but that other things true.

316
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:33.040
They need to doing it to you also.
I don't know if it's true flirting.

317
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:38.680
I don't even care if it's protecting him.
The guy's going crazy on me.

318
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.750
I haven't said one to think too.
I'm not protected them.

319
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.710
I'm just letting him be himself.
I'm letting everybody be themselves,
man.

320
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.340
It's no judgment sort of.
That's such a weak thing to say.

321
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.210
No judgment because he better judge things stupid.

322
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.560
You know you a lot of things that you'd need to judge.

323
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.080
You can't just walk around and say,
hey man,
no judgment.

324
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.540
You're being a butterfly right now.
You though,
Katie,

325
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.140
I'll try to be a butterfly as much as I can,
but it's not in my nature.

326
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.140
Jaymar if you are listening to this right now,

327
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:10.680
I don't know why you're freaking out anymore.
Big Hug.

328
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.730
I think you're a very talented actor and a very fine standup comedian.

329
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.860
There's no need for all this nonsense.
What did you just posed?
Cares.
Tell him.

330
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.830
He's probably,
if he's listening right now and he is,
he may be very well.

331
00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:24.990
We love you Jay.
Get it together.
Hey Jay,

332
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.130
here's an interesting thing that the month before,
uh,

333
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.620
are you going into history?
No,
no.

334
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:35.970
The month before Tom Sager and Christina [inaudible] escape.
I left death squad.

335
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.980
Uh,
I said,
hey,
we should get Jay more on a podcast.
And Tom was like,
really?

336
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.160
You do that?
I'm like,
yeah,
ask them.
So ask Tom about that.

337
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.150
I have no problems with Dj,
so I don't know why you're freaking out.
Okay,

338
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.700
so let's do a podcast with him.
Maybe he wants to do a podcast.

339
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:55.050
We can do like a east coast,
west coast comic beef would be Clive.

340
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.000
If Tait Fletcher comes with me,
that'd be awesome.

341
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.380
And it went no fucking Jay.
More karate.

342
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.100
That's hilarious because that's still works,
right,
Jay?

343
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:06.900
Mohr karate would still work.
Yeah,

344
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.330
I've been doing karate in Malibu at this place.
Yellow belt.
What is,

345
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:14.670
what to yell about that?
Hi.
It's for a little girl.

346
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.350
It really little kids get yellow if really that's not a real thing.
No,
it is.

347
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.360
It's the,
it depends on every,
the belts,
different racking systems.

348
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:26.820
But in Jujitsu,
yellow and green are just for children.

349
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.650
Well then that was an awesome joke.

350
00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:33.570
I was the best silly belt you can come up with.
But if,
uh,
you know,

351
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:36.960
in karate there's,
there's different ones.
Like some of them go like yellow,

352
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.350
they go white,
always white to yellow.

353
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.400
The way taekwondo would go as white to yellow,
to green,
to blue,

354
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.400
to red,

355
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.170
<v 5>red to black.
Brown.
No,
there was no ground.</v>

356
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.690
There was no brown.
It was red to black and taekwondo.
Um,
but yeah,

357
00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:00.350
the extra,
then I added the two extra belts.
The milk get to your fucking 90.
Yeah.

358
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.540
This is,
they got all of them and Polenta.
They got all different fucking,

359
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.280
what's that color?
But genuine HSA,
but budget the belt.
Now in Jujitsu,

360
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.560
they had all these belts and get you for an extra yard.
Stick those cards.

361
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.030
Yeah.
That's hilarious.
Hysterical.
When you join,
most,

362
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.070
especially taekwondo is the Koreans figured out.
They said,
fuck this shit.

363
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.770
I mean all slipping here.
Like there's a gym or we'll share,

364
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.160
we'll show it by labrea.
You have to pay them.

365
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.510
So you a black belt up front,
don't take monthly payments.

366
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.180
They have the three year acceleration program.

367
00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.780
Are you paying for three years of suckers walking?
Then give them,
you know,

368
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.040
eight thousand nine thousand with a check and they joined for three years in

369
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.460
front.
Not knowing the unknown,

370
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.210
not knowing the Mayans are showing up in the fucking six months or whoever the

371
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:47.770
fuck they pay for three years for an accelerated plan.

372
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.370
<v 3>And at the end of the three is they get a fucking black belt.
Wow.</v>

373
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.370
They have that today.
That exists.
That's kind of crazy.
You know,

374
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:57.230
even Greg Jackson had it.
The fucking color belt system to is,

375
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:02.380
is going Jyutsu and shit like guide Jujitsu's.
Everybody's adding a call,

376
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:06.450
a belt,
you know.
Fuck it.
It's an extra yard.
Stick out to you.
Well,
I don't know.

377
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.300
No,
so I've only go for it.
Are actually charged.
Greg Jackson.
No,

378
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:13.840
I'm just talking about window.
That was a big thing,
man was charging for belts.

379
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.560
Oh yeah.
They charge you for testing belts.
If you fail the patch,

380
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.960
you know they work.
Those Koreans ain't fucking around no more.

381
00:21:19.961 --> 00:21:21.070
They got federations,

382
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.480
they put together federations and associations and they bang you,

383
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.790
you know that bringing and you don't want give a seat.

384
00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:30.360
Like when they come over and all of these white kids get together and that bound

385
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.390
at the grand master and the guy don't speak no Japanese and no car,
no English.

386
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.550
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
He's got like a transplant and they're like,

387
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:39.250
you know,
welcome him to our school.
You know,

388
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:43.030
thank them for coming in the fucking Koreans.
Like suck my Dick.
Where's my check?

389
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.820
You know what I'm saying?
I didn't fly here to fucking give you a yellow belt.

390
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:49.180
You fucking suck is give us the look on their face when they fly over there.

391
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:52.270
Like,
I can't believe I did this for the small fucking nickel.

392
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:55.900
Come over here to see these little white kids doing form number three.

393
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:58.630
I need this shit.
They would always bring masters.
Yeah.

394
00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:02.430
They always bring masters and they don't speak no English.
And we as a society,

395
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.480
we bow like there was a big deal at our taekwondo school when,
uh,
uh,

396
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.310
Korean master would come on please.

397
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.690
Those fucking people lose their mind is the master.

398
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.190
We work on our farm and we polished the mirrors so they're all shiny shit.

399
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.980
That dude don't give a Fritchman fuck.

400
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.140
He smiles and he nods and he fucking does everything.
And on the way out,

401
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.830
you see him get a big old envelope.

402
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.550
It's so interesting how when we were kids that um,

403
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:32.610
martial arts became directly connected with like Asian men,

404
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.210
like these Asian men,

405
00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:38.350
these Asian men were like super respected as being like the greatest martial

406
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:40.600
artists ever.
You know,
that's like,

407
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.660
that's an interesting thing to say about their culture.

408
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:45.670
That before anybody had ever figured out fighting,

409
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:50.320
everybody was terrified of like black belts.
Everybody was terrified of karate,

410
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:51.730
Blah.
Bousquet a Bolo,

411
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.900
Bolo a muscular fucking Chinaman come and actually with a black fuck,

412
00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.060
I had traps I hit that motherfucker stole walking around Hollywood yoked.

413
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.980
I've heard that a couple times that he used,
he hasn't aged.

414
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.350
He still does movies from time.

415
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:10.940
They still paying them to go to Bulgaria and shit.
Wow.

416
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.300
Still get to check the other guys around too.

417
00:23:13.301 --> 00:23:17.020
I heard the guy that had the cut on his face when that Bruce Lee kicks through

418
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:19.510
the fucking toe rope wall.
He's around.

419
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:25.110
I'm gonna have to super foot Wallace.
Bob Wall is a real estate guy.
He,

420
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.130
he owns the building that my dentist,
uh,
has his practice in.

421
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.810
And so,
uh,
I uh,
I met him at a,
a couple of different,
it was good.
Yeah.

422
00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:37.800
He looks good,
right?
Very nice guy.
Yeah.
He was telling you,

423
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:40.230
he'll tell you the old days about karate and you know,

424
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.540
you know about his spinning back kick,
you know,

425
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.130
and all the things that guys are doing wrong and MMA,
it's awesome to hear,

426
00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:48.280
you know,
you know,
it's very,
when I talked to you about it,

427
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.740
you're receptive to what we talked about.
Uh,
uh,
you know,
Lauren,

428
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:55.760
Joe and now I went to his father.
Now what?
I went to his father.

429
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:01.030
This was the success of the Green Hornet and me get hit in the head and central

430
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:03.680
park because when the green one,
it came on,

431
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.130
American kids were starting to lose their mind.
People don't remember,

432
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.450
I go deep with this shit.
I go deep.
And all of a sudden it wasn't Bruce Lee,

433
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:15.560
it was a movie by the name of five fingers of death that the guy's palm would

434
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:18.300
get red at the end and he would hit you with the,
you know,

435
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.700
with the iron palm technique.
That was the first one.
And then,
uh,

436
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.850
which whatever,
we're going to start arguing fist of fury,

437
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.250
what the American name is,
Chang,

438
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.250
whatever the flux that first one came out where he's in the factory and it's in

439
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:33.020
Thailand.
And that was it.

440
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.880
Like I remember like even then there was maybe a Jujitsu school in a tristate

441
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.310
area,
but it was basically goes,

442
00:24:40.311 --> 00:24:45.140
you karate Galician rule wing Chun Kung Fu.
And it just blew up.

443
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.950
Well,
he made a bluff.
It just made a bunch of people.

444
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.980
He made a bunch of people want to be like that solemn,

445
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.600
quiet guy who says nothing and sit in the back and waits for trouble to come to

446
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:01.310
him.
You know there was like a,
a silent mysterious gave you this quality.

447
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.420
Yeah.
What was the biggest obstacle?

448
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.440
The biggest admin and all the kids magazine wins.

449
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.480
Don't get sand kicked in your face.
All right,

450
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.910
Joe Weeder for a dollar 99 Joe Wieder would send you a poster that you hung on

451
00:25:13.911 --> 00:25:18.050
your wall with all the techniques you had to do the lift and be strong in 14

452
00:25:18.051 --> 00:25:18.740
days.

453
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.880
Plus he sent you a trophy for an additional dollar of a guy like this with a

454
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:25.340
chicken hanging off of him at the beach.
You don't think I own it?

455
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:28.130
That mother fucker take time.
You want me to bullshit you?

456
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:31.220
I had 10 of those posters,
Joe.
We'd was the shit when we were kids.

457
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:35.300
When I was in high school,
before I had taken tag window,
there was this one dude,

458
00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:39.020
and I'll never forget this guy.
He was a,
he had this girl,

459
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:43.270
he was from another school and he had a girl that he was dating from our school

460
00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:44.240
that was really pretty,

461
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.090
she was one of those pretty girls that didn't get recognized as being pretty,

462
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.120
but she couldn't sort of snuck through because she was kind of [inaudible] but

463
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.430
she was really printing.
And so this dude came by to,
uh,

464
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.760
to pick her up at school and he was like,

465
00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.200
obviously like being looked at by all these kids from this school that you know,

466
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:01.060
he didn't belong to.

467
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.220
So he had adopted this like really intense sort of posture and he,

468
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:12.560
you know,
he had a,
like a Jean Jacket on and he was practicing karate,

469
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.360
practicing karate like on our,
in our school,

470
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.930
like there's like a little patio area,
you know,
there's like a little,
little,

471
00:26:20.931 --> 00:26:24.470
a breezeway in between buildings as you're walking from building to building to

472
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:27.800
go to your classes.
Not a patio,
but you know,
just telling an open grassy area.

473
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.610
This is motherfuckers out there throwing kicks and kicking his hands and shit.

474
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.360
Doing a lot of these like inside crescent kicks kicking his hands and making

475
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:39.560
this loud noise and looking really intense.
And I remember thinking like,
wow,

476
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:42.410
like what a weird guy.
And I was thinking,
man,

477
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.980
I wonder if he really can fight cause I didn't

478
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.040
<v 2>know and I couldn't.
I had,
I hadn't figured anything out yet at that time.</v>

479
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:51.480
You know,
I didn't really,
I had done like very little martial arts so I was,

480
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:53.550
I was maybe sort of kind of impressed by him.

481
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.970
I was like maybe this guy is like some crazy martial arts master but I'm my
boob.

482
00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.380
Why is he smoking cigarettes?
You know,
this is weird but I,
I'm that guy.

483
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:04.080
I'll never forget that guy.
Cause as I got older and I,

484
00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.120
I would go through my database of things that I saw in my life and seeing how I

485
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:14.320
saw people behave and whether or not they make sense that one always stands out

486
00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:15.720
and it's like a glaring one.

487
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:20.570
Like what a weird God because somebody will just go up to them to smack them.

488
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.020
That's what's happens in those things.
Go,

489
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.890
motherfucker comes out and is having a bad day.
Like oh you'll find a yet.

490
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.460
Let's sparkle.
I went to a very easy high school.
It wasn't,

491
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:33.420
it wasn't dangerous at all.
It was Newton South High School in Newton,

492
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:37.710
Massachusetts and they bused in a lot of kids from uh,
from other schools.

493
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:40.590
But the kids were pretty happy to be there from the bad neighborhoods and they

494
00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:43.080
were usually pretty cool cause it was a nice neighborhood.

495
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:44.910
It was in Newton was like real quiet.

496
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.420
So like the shit that kids are dealing with today in high schools,

497
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:49.530
especially in cities.

498
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:54.450
I mean that's just like a prison yard and there's craziness going on in high

499
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:57.730
schools today man.
And what they're doing to try to combat it.
I mean we,

500
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.760
we talked about that one a place in Connecticut that had done that raid on the

501
00:28:02.761 --> 00:28:07.410
kids' classes and pretended there was a shooter in the building.
They,
they,

502
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.000
they were looking for drugs.

503
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.270
So they tell the kids that there's a shooter in the building and to get in the

504
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:14.580
corner of your,
your classrooms and huddle up.

505
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.990
Why didn't they just say something like,
Hey,
we're having a fire drill.
Yeah,
why?

506
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.170
You should have said they should've said,
sit down.
We're searching.
You're,
you're,

507
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.200
you know,
you're,
we're searching for pot.
Let's be honest.

508
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.450
Let's be honest about we're done.
But so saying that you have a shooter said,

509
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.270
but that's how crazy they are.
Know they,
I mean this is the kind of shit that,

510
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.420
you know,
we never had to deal with that kind of shit when we're kids.

511
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:39.450
When was the last time when we were growing up?
There was no school shooters.

512
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.770
There was no one like go into schools and shoot anybody up until Columbine.

513
00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:44.880
That was like unheard of.

514
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.840
I mean there've been some mass shootings at the one that was in Austin,

515
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:53.700
the guy on the tower,
which was that there was a sniper,
I forget,

516
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.170
I forget that case,
I forgot what it was.
But there's,
there's hat has been some,

517
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:02.460
you know,
mass shootings and shit like that before,
but never like at schools.

518
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.450
I've never had problems like that at my high school.
Now in hindsight,

519
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.501
I'll tell you what,

520
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:11.640
my grammar school was alive and kicking and I had two kids and my seventh grade

521
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:15.390
class that today are in prison for murder.
One we,
Charlie gives you that.

522
00:29:15.391 --> 00:29:18.150
I should've known that because whatever appointed would go by,

523
00:29:18.151 --> 00:29:20.970
he would always get on top of his desk and shoot it down.
Like you would go

524
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.920
in his mind and him and his brother killed the guy with that bands,

525
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.520
this neighborhood that we know five corners because it got five goals.

526
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.600
I always knew like I knew kids like that.
See what we were in school,

527
00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:38.601
they would hold you and grab a school to you with 16 so these motherfuckers,

528
00:29:38.661 --> 00:29:41.100
we're just looking to quit.
So they would just sit in the back.

529
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.970
But in reality they was

530
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.340
<v 5>just gangsters,
you know?
They would tell the teacher to fuck off and shut.</v>

531
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:47.830
The teachers couldn't really get it together when they're 16 and they,

532
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.540
there was called the pilot program.

533
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.370
Once you were driving through the eighth grade,

534
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.840
they had a fucking send you the high school.

535
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:55.870
But these kids were in no danger going to high school.
They hadn't seen.

536
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:59.530
Now you have to be 18 with a consent and your parents have to sign you out of

537
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:01.480
school.
It's tough to quit fucking school today.

538
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.750
So it wasn't tough when we went to school.
You just had a sign in yourself.

539
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:08.960
16 parents didn't even have to sign.
Yeah.
So it's a different fucking world now.

540
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.780
They have to be involved for you to drop out.

541
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.260
You don't see no commercials with dropouts no more.
When we would kid,

542
00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:17.440
you see in a lot of commercials with dropouts and hemophilia,
whatever happened,

543
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:20.200
the emo feel JAKKS and just moved the fuck on.

544
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.920
When I was a kid that was a hemophilia,
I bleed,
not TV.
Every 10 minutes.

545
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.640
Remember that commercial with himself with a needle.
Hi on my hemophilia.

546
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:31.380
What the fuck happened to those people they've done.
There's no more hemophilia.

547
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.680
They would just bleed to death,
prick them and shit.

548
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.840
I was always asking my mother and I haven't met Maya hemophiliac cause I don't

549
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:40.660
want nobody bumping into me.
We come to a Chinese restaurant,

550
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.050
I'm eating Sushi and next thing you know I'm bleeding the fucking that consume

551
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.980
Manson.
Remember that would have to the hemophiliac.
They just passed the fuck on.

552
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.390
What a fucking shit disease to have to just walk around like a water balloon.

553
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.750
You know?
Just hoping that nobody pricks your skin or you'll,

554
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.590
you'll leak out and you can't stop it.
You're going to put,
you do,

555
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.300
what do they do?
What did they did they have to know that evolved member?

556
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.400
They would.
That was the treatment that I get money and shit like that.

557
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.000
That's fucking nuts.
But yeah,
kit schools had chain.
Listen man,

558
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.210
I'm scared of high schools right now.
If I was a parent,

559
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.780
I would be scared if I was a parent at home,
but what am I fucking options?

560
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.100
I called the school and then what?
Then my kids are fucking Momo.

561
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.790
He don't know how to [inaudible] days.

562
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:25.800
I bet you there's software that can homeschool year where every day know they're

563
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.900
raise you kids are going to get dragged into it.

564
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:33.220
What am I so what about my social fucking net?
What about socializing with kids?

565
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.390
This is something you do.

566
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.090
You can't socialize with your brother and sisters all your life.

567
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.650
That's why the school learning relationships,
learning how to,
I'll agree.
Yes,

568
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:45.910
I agree with whatever.
I would go on fake dates with my kids.
You know,

569
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.010
it's like you were talking about a Altadena.

570
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.770
I have a friend that lives in Altadena has a beautiful home.

571
00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:54.070
I mean his wife have three children,
Nice family.
My wife works with the wife.

572
00:31:54.071 --> 00:31:56.590
I go over there from time to time,
they have three kids.

573
00:31:56.591 --> 00:31:57.970
You got to see this block,
Joe Rogan.

574
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.470
What you and I would do as kids to have this block,
we would kill.

575
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:06.250
You know those blocks with a little slant?
Just a little one,
not a beeper.

576
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.970
You can make ramps.
You can do a thousand things dog.

577
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:11.550
You know how many times I've gotten on the barbecue?

578
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.940
There's not one kid on the street,

579
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.600
so I would knock on all the doors if I was a stay home parent,
like as a pan.

580
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.670
I go every,
all the kids got to get out of the house.

581
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.650
I don't want play stickball put a recreation for this block just for this block.

582
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.900
Half of you just don't fucking work in the afternoon.

583
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.290
Get these kids out of the house to learn social skills,

584
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.500
which is a computer is great and you learn a lot.
And you know,

585
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:35.320
when I was a kid they said if you read the New York Times for four years,

586
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.950
you got a better education.
If you went to college,
that was the big thing.

587
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.220
Fuck College.
Read the news,

588
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.090
the Wall Street Journal for four years every day and you'll learn more than New

589
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.940
York Times.
I'm sorry.
Now you're going to get these fucking kids out.

590
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:49.550
There's no kids at Joe Rogan drive around your neighborhood.

591
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.820
I'll give you a fucking dollar for every kid you say you come home bro.

592
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.990
But a kid outside,

593
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.250
nothing that's not even paper routes to teach a kid how to flip a buck,

594
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:03.710
which is the most important thing when a kid is 13 and 14 it is a weird time

595
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:06.770
that we live in the,
you can't just have your kids run around and your plan.

596
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.050
You've got to monitor them like a hawk,
like a fucking whore.
And when,

597
00:33:11.051 --> 00:33:15.250
when we got lucky.
Really.
I mean it's,
you know,
I don't think it's just an la,

598
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.740
are they still kids on the street?
I mean,
now here it is completely different.

599
00:33:20.741 --> 00:33:25.180
Really?
Yeah.
Ohio is just like exactly how it was when I was like,
oh,
hi.

600
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.120
I was like the 1950 [inaudible] America.
It's like a Tom Hanks movie.
Why?

601
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:33.170
It's like an old sweater that you'll put on sit before the fireplace in most

602
00:33:33.171 --> 00:33:36.570
places are,
you know,
kids are more educated.
Yeah.

603
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.240
When I was a kid and you were a kid,

604
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:41.600
we had to fucking get her botanic encyclopedia looks up them up.
But that shit,

605
00:33:41.601 --> 00:33:45.220
Joe Rogan Britannica,
we had a steal a page out of the library and bring it home.

606
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:48.650
We'll do a third paper.
Yeah.
Now all with a flip of a button.
I can,

607
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.590
if I'm 13 I find that what a blow job is.
Yeah.

608
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.920
I'll find out what the fuck fucking explosive is and how to make c four and I

609
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:58.130
can learn it.
I'm fucking line,
you know?
Yeah.
We didn't have that shit.

610
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.580
I don't want these kids in the fucking house.
They got to get some vitamin D.
Dot.

611
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.220
They got to get some satellite,
these fucking kids.

612
00:34:04.221 --> 00:34:07.250
And now you've become a vampire.
Well,
I think it's unhealthy.

613
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:09.710
Certainly it's the way we did it was healthier,

614
00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:13.370
but it was also more dangerous just to be able to wander around the street.
What,

615
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.400
how old were you when you were at monitoring anymore when you can just leave the

616
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:19.040
house on you?
I think it's safer now in some ways with cell phones.

617
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.000
How old were you?
Five.
Six.
You go in front of the house.
Oh,

618
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.570
so Dadeo they call it.
You stay right there.
Yeah,
I remember it.
No,

619
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:28.160
don't cross Broadway.
Okay.

620
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:32.810
I remember very clearly get in a fist fight with my cousin when I was five and

621
00:34:32.811 --> 00:34:33.591
he lived down the street.

622
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:35.930
So I was wandering down the street when I was five years old.
No,

623
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:39.470
I wasn't even five.
I don't think I was like somewhere between four and five.

624
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.850
Okay.
But remember when you were wandering down the street,
this is Rogan down.

625
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:44.551
Mrs Rogan,

626
00:34:44.551 --> 00:34:48.440
your mom was friends with Mr Mary Magic Katya that had the third blog down the

627
00:34:48.441 --> 00:34:51.050
corner.
And she had a boy and three doors from her.

628
00:34:51.051 --> 00:34:54.740
You had Mrs. Wilson and she had a boy.
Right,
so all those moms are watching you.

629
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.760
It was a network of moms.
Remember Rick Case?
What's that expression?

630
00:34:58.761 --> 00:35:03.500
To raise a village.
You had people that were watching you so I could say to you,

631
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.150
eight,
you're going to go over by Joe's house yet.

632
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.290
Tell it when you're going over to,

633
00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:09.200
Joe is have his mother called my house and we miss a scan.

634
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:12.110
We still put a scam together.
He's coming to my house.
I'm going to your house.

635
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.250
But there was little,
I see kids not,
I don't see him outside of that concerns me.

636
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.410
The next generation is going to be on computers.
Yeah.

637
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:21.560
They've got to be very intelligent and don't know how to fucking reprogram or a

638
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:24.710
bomb if they need to,
but the social aspect of it,

639
00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:27.980
we're going to get lost socially.
Maybe.
I don't know.
I hate to say it.

640
00:35:27.981 --> 00:35:31.850
I don't know.
Yeah,
but you can't fucking homeschool a child.

641
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:34.610
I wish I could full time so he wouldn't be out.

642
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.620
You know when your kids leave to go to school now you have to have a fucking

643
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:42.150
doubt,
but so our parents believe it can happen.
I think a fucking happen.
We just,

644
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.220
Joe,
we were so lucky.
We were so fucking lucky.

645
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.650
You know,
I can sit here and tell you I've never been fucking,

646
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:52.920
one time a guy went for my dick when I was in the eighth grade,

647
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:55.200
I could tell you all the times that she could have happened.

648
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.560
Those stories I took about peep shows stick in my head that I was in the eighth

649
00:35:58.561 --> 00:36:00.300
grade brother.
I was in eight grade.

650
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:04.220
I'm 42nd street somebody cause he just grabbed me and took me in the back and

651
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.500
butt fucked me the debt,
you know,

652
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:11.510
I mean I was playing three card Monte on 42nd street and 20th she returned to

653
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:16.210
the phone.
I swash we turned it on to do the interview with the computer guy.

654
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:21.230
It's just a very fucking weird how I was just very lucky compared to a lot of

655
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:23.300
people were both very nice.

656
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.790
You've got a call from hard to engage AFLAC,
AFLAC representative.

657
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.100
The Marshall Plan,
Bryce.

658
00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.790
<v 6>Oh,
have you seen the,</v>

659
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.590
these photos of Rihanna cutting lines of cocaine on her body guards head?
What?

660
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.360
Yeah,
check this out.
It's a,

661
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.960
it's on a LB times.com and supposedly it's Rihanna like doing is,

662
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.510
she's like sitting on,

663
00:36:49.511 --> 00:36:51.700
what does that call it when you're sitting on the person's back?

664
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.640
Are you piggybacking piggybacking shoulders.

665
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.250
And he's the bald head guy and there's just photos.

666
00:36:57.251 --> 00:37:00.430
I've heard like the big pile of cocaine on his head and she's just cutting up

667
00:37:00.431 --> 00:37:03.730
lines on it.
So allegedly allegedly,

668
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:08.470
that also looks like it could be like cheese and she's got a Dorito chip in her

669
00:37:08.471 --> 00:37:11.660
hand.
Yeah.
Maybe she's eating some Chili con case in finding clarity.

670
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:16.360
Kind of the bottom looks like cheese to me.
Finding,
sorry.
That's cheese.

671
00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.253
Jodi is,

672
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:21.340
<v 5>Geez.
No matter how you look at it again,
I'm sorry I fucked a rash.</v>

673
00:37:21.341 --> 00:37:24.060
She went back with that fucking dude with Chris Brown.
Yeah.
Yeah.

674
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:26.040
They're friends again or something.
That's crazy.

675
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:31.041
I don't think that's [inaudible] he fucked up for sure,

676
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.270
but I think yeah,
but I think uh,
he maybe he learned from that fuck up.

677
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.800
You know she's got a great fucking ass.
She really does.
Who knows,
man.

678
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:45.230
What am I speculate?
I speculate way too much on this goddamn show.
[inaudible]

679
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.670
it's too much.
Goddamn talk.
Fuck it.

680
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.240
We should have at drawling podcast where just all draw.
I was talking,

681
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.720
what the fuck are you talking about?
That is the dumbest idea ever.

682
00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.380
We should have a podcast that people listen to what we're just drawn.

683
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.100
Show your things to the people.
Cause pause a bunch of,

684
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:08.640
one part of the Joe Rogan experiment is to let people know about higher

685
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:11.490
consciousness.
You know you showed me a little pen that you had.

686
00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:14.330
So I want to show people how we're doing.
Is the camera on,
you know,

687
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.380
a little fucking sticker you had the other day.

688
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.820
This is what's going on right now.

689
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:21.390
And I didn't know about this Joe or these guys tried to turn me onto vapor years

690
00:38:21.391 --> 00:38:23.790
ago and I didn't like it cause you got to cut the wheat with the scissor it and

691
00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:27.750
put it a little fucking thing and add a smoke 29 buckets and then my buddy

692
00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:31.110
turned me on for this.
Do you Rica fucking vape gun,
right?

693
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.500
It comes in a little package and an eighth of weed in this tube can show you

694
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:39.530
actually smoking.
I can't open it to that citizen.

695
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.190
And you go like this,
you take this off.

696
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:48.643
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

697
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.420
<v 1>And you take this fucking two people and you put it in here.</v>

698
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.890
This is like you're putting together a silent day and you go like this Jesus

699
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:57.020
Christ,

700
00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:01.820
that contraption and you were looking at [inaudible] like a tiny lightsaber.

701
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.970
<v 5>That's how we're doing it bitches.
So while you're waiting for that Canadian,</v>

702
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:16.900
but to come down I was smoking Skywalker.

703
00:39:16.901 --> 00:39:21.190
Oh g and it's an indycar.
They have an old fucking sativa the boot to listen.

704
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.040
I'm going to blow that in the store.
This is faced next week.

705
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:26.620
You know what I'm saying?
That's how I'm rolling.
It doesn't smell like anything.

706
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:28.990
Nothing,
nothing dog.
This is the fucking future.

707
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.300
And I'll tell you why I'm here with this fucking thing.

708
00:39:31.301 --> 00:39:32.440
I be a strictly honest with you.

709
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.170
I suffered from high blood pressure when I had the lease swelling.

710
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.800
I had to go to the doctor every day.
So I said,
let me fuck with his doctor.

711
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:41.710
Shaw was just smoking that before I would go to the doctor,
do I?

712
00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:45.340
When I'd walk in,
it was one 30 over 80 like a motherfucker.

713
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.580
So this vapor isn't really affecting like my smoker.

714
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:50.410
When I would smoke in the morning,
walk into the doctor,

715
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.370
I'm walking in that one 60 over a hundred percent I'm smoking,

716
00:39:53.371 --> 00:39:54.280
they're heavy duty.
Boy,

717
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.620
<v 1>here's my problem.
Here's my problem with them.
Is that that uh,</v>

718
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.130
it does,
doesn't still,
it seems for price wise,

719
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:05.520
it just doesn't seem like I'd rather have a real joint

720
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.520
<v 5>$30 $30 I got a date,</v>

721
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.890
the last two I've smoked the last meal a week.

722
00:40:10.891 --> 00:40:12.840
What was the last time you had an eight?
Even less than a day.

723
00:40:12.841 --> 00:40:17.350
It might actually pot in the thing.
No,
it's it's hash oil.
That's right.

724
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.760
30 27%.
They have it 31% for,
Oh gee,

725
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.160
they have a 27% for Sky Walker.

726
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:27.150
This is like smoking without the stems and the seeds because you see what Obama

727
00:40:27.151 --> 00:40:32.040
said recently,
what we say done.
Oh good.
Joey smoking from the fucking vaporize it

728
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:36.960
<v 1>no best.
It's,
he was talking,
there's a rolling stone article where uh,</v>

729
00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.460
the interview them and they asked him about pot,

730
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.380
asked him about what's up with the crackdowns on pot and he said that although

731
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.440
we're not going to go after the person who's using it to,

732
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:53.140
uh,
alleviate some symptoms for a legitimate medical condition,

733
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.880
we're not going to go after them,

734
00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:00.060
but we're certainly not going to allow large scale marijuana operations and that

735
00:41:00.611 --> 00:41:05.410
it's still an illegal federal drug.
Federally.

736
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:10.411
It's illegal even though it's medicine and I think it's like 16 different states

737
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:14.710
now.
Right?
Isn't it
anybody,
Brian,

738
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.630
I haven't seen a center use streams that we don't get paid.
Yeah.
Joey,
you can't,

739
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.290
can't smoke that thing on the air.
I ain't smoking.
Think get matters.

740
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:22.810
They've been mad at us.

741
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:25.803
<v 4>Jesus,</v>

742
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.070
<v 5>dude,
I'm sitting there for an hour.
The thing is,</v>

743
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.510
<v 2>we become friends with the dude who owns,
I love to too.</v>

744
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.750
I respect the guy that's local.
Are they?
I'm just,
you know,

745
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:40.610
tell them the truth is the Joe Rogan pockets.

746
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.390
This ain't got me this fucking Cuba saying,
I got a medical marijuana license.

747
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:47.330
What,
what,
what?
Speaking to communist Cuba.
That,
uh,

748
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.010
Hector Lombard signing,
he's going to come to the UFC.
That's going to be crazy.

749
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.780
I'd dude's a bombshell.

750
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.590
Washed all his fights at Bella [inaudible] and he was supposed to come to the

751
00:41:57.591 --> 00:42:01.370
UFC a long time ago,
but there was something they couldn't work out.
God Damn,

752
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:05.660
that guy's good though.
He's scary.
Scary dude.
He throws bombs,

753
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:09.670
man for your mom's.
Oh,
he's fast too.
He's fast.

754
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:14.510
He's got fucking hammers in the hands and he's a real good judo guy to real hard

755
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:16.460
to take down.
He's an interesting fight.

756
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.780
It's going to be interesting to see him step into the high levels of,
uh,
of the,

757
00:42:20.781 --> 00:42:24.170
you know,
the UFC middle weight division.
I don't know.

758
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.770
They don't think they've decided yet,
but it's going to be someone good.
I'm sure.

759
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.140
You know they're going to put them right in with someone real good.

760
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.390
He's a bad motherfucker though.

761
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.070
There's a few guys over there at Bella tore that are really good.

762
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.970
Eddie Alvarez.
That guy's good.
He just been shit jokey.
He just,
yeah,

763
00:42:41.971 --> 00:42:45.350
he beat Aoki.
And then Mike Chandler,
the dude who beat him,

764
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:50.010
he's fucking good to man.
That kid's a beast.
That kid's really good.
He's,
uh,

765
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:54.070
his fight with Eddie Alvarez was crazy.
That was a nutty,

766
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.760
and they caused Alvarez and there's the lucky fight to leave to go to camp,

767
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.230
you know,
so it wouldn't be distracted when they know their stuff from,
you know,

768
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.620
his home life to really dedicate himself for six weeks.

769
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.920
So he went down and he was,
I think he did some training with the blacks,
aliens.

770
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.910
And uh,
he,
uh,
he looked fucking tremendous.
He,

771
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:14.360
he was just so focused against Aoki.
Speaking of tremendous,

772
00:43:14.361 --> 00:43:18.710
that card Saturday night.
What a great card.
How good was that?

773
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:22.700
Good at it from a to z.
From Travis Brown to the fucking,
yeah.

774
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.080
Matt Brown fight to,
to,
you know,

775
00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:29.810
to fucking mad harmonic mark homenet getting jumped like that by the Filipino

776
00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.870
when they had them on the side with the Q tip of his nose.

777
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.580
He looked like my friend Ed was saying,
why would a joint this mouth?

778
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.410
He really fucking did I call it Edward,
right for the thing,
like,

779
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.260
are you watching this Filipino?
He's like,
yeah,
that mother fucker took it.

780
00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.660
Dominic.
I mean,
there was some Great Rory Macdonald.
I mean there,

781
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.570
which is great fucking fight,
you know.

782
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:51.350
So thank you very much for taking this Jon Jones Against uh,

783
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.240
our boy Rashad Evans.
We had a great time that we not ready.

784
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:57.980
<v 1>Yeah,
that was awesome.
That was awesome.
Jon Jones ever fight,
uh,</v>

785
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:02.060
Silva Anderson Silva?
No,
no.
He's definitely not fun.

786
00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:07.160
But it seems like those two together would be like watching the matrix.
I mean,

787
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:12.040
they both seem very calculated how they fight very like a couple of steps,
uh,

788
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.640
faster than the other guy almost.
Well,
yeah,
I mean,
I see what you're saying.

789
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:20.030
A lot of people want to see that fight,
but Anderson and him,

790
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.630
there's a bunch of issues.
One Anderson is a 185 pounds.

791
00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.170
He has no problem making 185 pounds.
That's his weight class.

792
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:27.861
That's the way class.

793
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:31.260
He's been a champion and although he's had a couple of fights at two oh five,

794
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.010
you know,
he fought

795
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.670
<v 2>forest Griffin and two oh five.
And um,
he uh,</v>

796
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.700
also fought James Irvin at two oh five knocked both guys out here.

797
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.910
It's not as natural way.
What does he walk around?
Can you just get heavy?

798
00:44:41.911 --> 00:44:45.420
Probably walks out around around that about tool fine.

799
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:50.450
Maybe even bulked up a little bit to get up there for a James Irvin and for um,

800
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.970
Forrest Griffin.
But he definitely looked like a little thicker.
But the,

801
00:44:54.971 --> 00:44:55.741
the issue is like,

802
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:59.790
he's really a much smaller guy if they were really the same size when he's,

803
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.400
when he's fighting at two oh five,
that's really is what he's weighing.

804
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.560
He might wait to 10 and it gets down into a five.

805
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:08.250
Jon Jones is like lean to 30.

806
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.440
He's a lean athletic two 30 and he died himself down.
And then,

807
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:13.681
you know,

808
00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:17.160
he's very disciplined and then cuts the weight and then gets on the scale and

809
00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:19.170
then he's good and he can make two oh five.

810
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:23.640
But Anderson Silva is never going to be a lien to 30.
You know,

811
00:45:23.641 --> 00:45:26.490
they're just different frames.
That said,

812
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:30.420
it's still exciting because Anderson is dangerous off his back.

813
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:34.200
He finished his guy's off his back with triangles and things along those lines.

814
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.790
I mean,
he did it to Chael Sonnen.

815
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.630
He did it to Travis Luter who is a fucking killer man.

816
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:44.280
Travis looter is a vicious Jujitsu guy,
like one of the best in the,

817
00:45:44.281 --> 00:45:47.070
at at the time,
like in one of his,
um,
when,

818
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.540
when Travis was going overseas and he was competing in like Abu Dhabi and those,

819
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.300
he's like one of the best Americans at the time.

820
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:58.090
Like Travis looters has really high level Jujitsu and Anderson Condom and a

821
00:45:58.091 --> 00:46:01.740
triangle.
I don't care how tired he is.
I'm not catching him in the triangle,

822
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.390
you know?
You know what I'm saying?
Like I,

823
00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.650
I couldn't imagine in my wildest dreams Kaching Travis Luder and trialed and

824
00:46:06.651 --> 00:46:10.890
Anderson,
Ken Anderson can catch really good high level guys.

825
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:15.450
He's a legit black belt and I think people sleep on that,
you know,
like his,

826
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.400
his ground game,
his fucking good.

827
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.670
Even though Chael Sonnen was on top of him for four rounds,
beaten him up,

828
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.490
he never got fucked up.
His face was never cut.

829
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.510
If you look at him like he rolls with Shit,
he turns with things,

830
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:32.040
he's got good defense,
you know,
Anderson Silva's a threat to any man.

831
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.300
I just think if you look at like the size and you look at the attributes like

832
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:39.900
Jon Jones is such a good wrestler.
He's so good at getting guys down.

833
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:41.700
I mean even the way he,
Rashad Evans,

834
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.990
he grabbed Rashad Evans by his neck and tripped him almost like disrespectfully,

835
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:49.350
almost like disdainfully,
you know,
the way he grabbed it,
like choked him,

836
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.410
grabbed his neck and tripped them at the same time there's,

837
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.570
he's done some nasty shit.

838
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.110
He's getting better all the time and his,

839
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:02.670
his style is like the worst style for a guy.
Like Anderson,

840
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:07.230
like stylistically,
he's a really tall long guy who's was hard to hit,

841
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.730
who throws a lot of kicks,

842
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.720
separates himself by a lot of distance and he's a nasty wrestling.

843
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:17.820
Let me ask you this.
That's it.
I would love to see it.

844
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.070
That's two types of Jujitsu.

845
00:47:19.071 --> 00:47:24.071
How you taught me there's Jujitsu and there's a major Jujitsu correctly discuss

846
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.460
this.

847
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:30.160
Like the shit that he does is basically as high level as it gets

848
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.460
<v 1>because I never looked at it that way.
He was on the bottom for four rounds.</v>

849
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:38.290
He didn't get caught.
Yeah.
So basically his fucking MMA Jujitsu is really,

850
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.860
well,
he knows how to take a shot too,
man.
He knows how to roll with things.

851
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:45.290
And then there's a video of him and uh,
Jorge Rivera,
um,

852
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.810
when they fought in cage rage and Anderson and him,

853
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:52.930
they tie up and Jorge can fucking punch man.

854
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:57.580
He punched his heart and he hit Anderson in a tie up with like four or five

855
00:47:57.581 --> 00:48:00.730
clean punches.
Anderson just looked at him,
stared at him,

856
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.320
stand at them and took the shots.
It's like kind of creepy how good he is.

857
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.980
I haven't really dumb stupid.
What if MMA question for you,

858
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.040
what if Anderson Silva put on right before the weigh in he put on like really

859
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:16.630
heavy mercury fillings and his mouth.

860
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.900
Is that legally like why would you do that?

861
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.120
Just so he could be make weight without actually getting
out of here?

862
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.630
No,
I mean pick those fillings.
You'd have to be no,

863
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:31.920
I mean if he had ultimate over Brian Moment.
No.

864
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.020
Like if you have mercury teeth like around they way,

865
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.840
I don't know but one little piece,

866
00:48:36.841 --> 00:48:39.940
it weighs a lot and he only needs to make what?
15 pounds,
20 pounds.

867
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:43.810
And if he had all mercury in his mouth,
like fillings are,
first of all silly.

868
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:48.260
This is this a real question of course it's not a real but no,
no.
I mean Megan,

869
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:52.080
would it be legal though led in your head?
Cause it was,

870
00:48:52.081 --> 00:48:54.370
it'd be a filling if he had mercury fillings.

871
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:59.820
Look no one could stop you from taking a big lead pipe and stuffing it up your

872
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:03.030
ass to make weight.
So if you can help.

873
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.730
So I don't pick up that led up your ass because nobody wants to get heavier.

874
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:08.890
They want to be lighter.
No.
But if somebody like that,

875
00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:13.090
that doesn't want to put on the,
I guess so what are you talking about Brian?

876
00:49:13.091 --> 00:49:15.100
Or you're confused the shit out of me.
Cause you're,
you're,

877
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.950
you're posing this as if it's a real question.
No,
I just,
first of all,

878
00:49:17.951 --> 00:49:22.600
you have mercury in your fucking mouth.
It's poisonous.
Like why not say,
you know,

879
00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:24.540
if you could go to the surface of Pluto and come back,

880
00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.540
it isn't that more of a like a long,
a longterm effect though,

881
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.590
being around mercury for a long periods of time.

882
00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:31.480
Like you're getting knocked in the head,

883
00:49:31.481 --> 00:49:35.290
I think like a week and having mercury in your face.
It's probably horrible idea,

884
00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:37.060
but,
but I don't,
first of all,

885
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:40.450
if you had enough weight in your mouth to actually make you heavier,

886
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.700
your fucking head wouldn't be able to move.
Right.

887
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:45.340
It would take you a year to get used to the new dynamics.

888
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.220
We would take it out right after weighing in at night.
You could you take it out?

889
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:50.390
<v 5>Why are you watching them,
Joe Rogan.</v>

890
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.990
Someday you're going to shoot this fucking kid and the cops are going come and

891
00:49:56.991 --> 00:49:59.720
you're gonna go.
I shot him and they're going to go,
we heard the podcast.

892
00:49:59.721 --> 00:50:04.360
We're not here to shoot in the fucking bullet.
Why?
You answer them now?

893
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.510
But I didn't shut up.
Shut up.
Wait,

894
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:11.540
so wouldn't be legal to do that or would it be legal to do that if they wanted

895
00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:11.721
to?

896
00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:15.040
So they don't put your fucking mouth when you go up to her Mazzagatti whatever's

897
00:50:15.041 --> 00:50:18.590
hurting.
[inaudible] feelings.
No,

898
00:50:18.591 --> 00:50:21.610
he touches your fucking died.
He touches your are Muslim,

899
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.340
whatever his fucking name.
But I know the other Cox slapped.

900
00:50:24.341 --> 00:50:27.760
I showed up with his cousin last week.
Remember there was tools at the name.
Oh,

901
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:28.450
Mario.

902
00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:31.400
<v 3>Y'all showed up with a cousin like date.
I got bad news.
I got,</v>

903
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.370
I got to show up with my fucking cousin and he's on the ball here.

904
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.300
So now you got to,
I don't find they open your mouth right band.
No,

905
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.690
you're allowed to.
I fell he's but not when you look like fucking,
Nah.

906
00:50:41.691 --> 00:50:45.410
The guy that used to catch 22 bullets and wild world of sports when we were
kids.

907
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.510
Does that get really tangible to his face?
I don't know.

908
00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:52.530
Fucking [inaudible] fucking die.

909
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:55.580
You you fuck.
That's how he died.

910
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.910
They put the mouthpiece in his mouth and he would catch the 22 and splitting the

911
00:50:58.911 --> 00:51:02.580
fucking fry pan.
How is it possible that Bro,
everything's fucking possible.

912
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.360
I mean,
could you imagine you're letting a guy 22 you in your fucking mouth.
Whoa.

913
00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.190
How do your job?
She'd slipped out,
hit it,
hit it.
Brian,

914
00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.800
what are you too will find the guy from the wild world of sports?

915
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:17.900
1973 cause that's in the old days he was together with closed the big karate

916
00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:19.040
tournament in New York City.

917
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:24.170
It was Aaron close by getting shot at them in Madison Square Garden.
Aaron backs,

918
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:25.210
whatever his name is.
Yeah,

919
00:51:25.211 --> 00:51:28.610
it was the [inaudible] gonna have a huge thing on a Saturday in July.

920
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:29.930
And what closed it?

921
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:34.090
The closer the headliner was him and then they put it on while water sports.

922
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.590
One year,
so it's gotta be on fucking Youtube.
I'm not making this up.

923
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.600
I do not know how the man died.

924
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:41.510
I thought somebody finally caught him with a fucking BB gun.

925
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:44.380
Was that the broken heart?
He was practicing and you know,
uh,

926
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.690
was a real legit karate guy.
That lot of people don't,
don't,

927
00:51:47.691 --> 00:51:49.370
don't really appreciate Billy blanks.

928
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.070
Billy blanks is a real legit point karate guy.
Cause I,

929
00:51:53.071 --> 00:51:56.630
I grew up in Boston and everybody thinks of him is like the Tae Bo guy.

930
00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:00.110
I got to see him fight line a bunch of times,
especially back then.

931
00:52:00.111 --> 00:52:05.060
He was so whoa,
these point fighting guys would get giant dude.

932
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:07.430
They were fucking huge.
They were these,

933
00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.380
they were like NFL running backs like,

934
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.140
like to what do you got there buddy?
Wild rose sports.
What'd the guy shoots?

935
00:52:15.141 --> 00:52:15.974
It's way too

936
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.140
[inaudible] that looked like it.
Brian.
That's fucking,

937
00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.330
<v 7>well you asked for it.</v>

938
00:52:23.331 --> 00:52:26.690
I want you to watch the answer to this first question here with a very sharp by,

939
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.450
and I'm going to see how long it takes you to figure it out.

940
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:32.960
There's comes from William Harris of Waterbury,
Connecticut.

941
00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:37.060
<v 3>Would you turn that off?
[inaudible] I read an hour a day.
He says,</v>

942
00:52:37.061 --> 00:52:40.510
you asked for catching a bullet with teeth.
No,
no,
no.
It's gotta be color.

943
00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:43.570
It was the seventh.
Why does anybody do that?
What's that?

944
00:52:43.571 --> 00:52:46.220
Who's impressed with you catching a bullet with your teeth?
I mean,
how does that,

945
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:50.110
how does that,
how does someone's life go down that path?
Who swallows a sword?

946
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.660
Who Wakes up one morning and says,
you know what,

947
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:57.430
today I'm going to swallow a fucking sword and be a magician and code around.

948
00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:01.330
How does that work?
Sorry,
where's it go?
It's just you,
you,
you,

949
00:53:01.331 --> 00:53:05.110
how you position your position or your neck just makes it completely straight

950
00:53:05.111 --> 00:53:08.380
tunnel all the way down of right when you had someone who just fucking ran out

951
00:53:08.381 --> 00:53:11.380
of the crowd and tackled you right in this sword was deep in your head.

952
00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.340
Who watched the fucking HBO thing?
About the wall lenders,
but the grandson,

953
00:53:15.341 --> 00:53:18.550
the fuck them while I'm doing,
and the guy killed himself in Puerto Rico.

954
00:53:18.551 --> 00:53:20.070
He was gone and of the grandfather,

955
00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:23.200
the grant Wallenda the dude was gone back to Puerto Rico.

956
00:53:23.201 --> 00:53:26.280
He went back to do with his grandfather died doing

957
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.480
<v 5>better yet.
He took his mom to meet them halfway.
Oh my.
The rope.</v>

958
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:33.290
It was on Hbo Sports,
Hbo Sports.

959
00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.910
You've got a fucking problem because they could make weight.

960
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.890
They could make ice skating look interesting on Hbo Sports.
Okay.

961
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.250
His mom and go hit the fucking youtube,
the flying Wallendas on Hbo.

962
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.620
The fucking great.
It's a family business.
They showed up.

963
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.800
They would practice without a net.
The grandfather stressed it.

964
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:55.740
You practice without a net because that's the only way you really fucking

965
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:59.460
learned.
The lenders are fucking interesting as shit.
Interesting.

966
00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:02.370
I read about him years ago and I'm like,
where are these fucking much,
you know,

967
00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:02.900
climbing,

968
00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:07.470
putting up fucking wires in places where they just had the great grandson or the

969
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:11.280
grandson to the motherfucker that went to court and they showed the footage on

970
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.910
Hbo.
They show 1973 San Juan,
Puerto Rico.

971
00:54:14.911 --> 00:54:19.140
Why Wireless Watch and he had been waiting.
Ah Shit.
He fucking dies.

972
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.350
So the grandson been doing it for years,
so now he's gone.

973
00:54:22.351 --> 00:54:27.090
He went back to Puerto Rico to the exact same building at the Hilton Hotel and

974
00:54:27.091 --> 00:54:32.010
he got out one side.
His mother got on the other side and they met in the middle,

975
00:54:32.011 --> 00:54:35.250
and then they crossed each other with one fucking rope.
Joe.
Oh,

976
00:54:35.251 --> 00:54:39.720
my mother almost lost it.
Grabbed her in the middle.
I gotta watch it tonight.

977
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.160
It's been on all fucking week.

978
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.530
The fucking flying Melendez ain't fucking around Doug.

979
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.090
They're like the Wu Tang clan.
That is insane.

980
00:54:48.091 --> 00:54:52.230
The mother and the fucking sun passed each other on the wire.

981
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:59.070
Fucking Christ.
Right.
She started to lose it.
Oh Man.
He held her.
Oh Man.

982
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:03.170
Hell God told her.
But she was fine that he went the other way.

983
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:08.100
He went the other fucking way and got all his hands.
Is that that isn't,

984
00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.500
that's the most people that have a hard time and a stop sign.

985
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:15.420
You know what I'm saying?
These fucking Willis.
Imagine if we all lived on wires.

986
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:17.520
There would be the baddest motherfuckers of all time.

987
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:20.450
The world was just a series of wires and Plat.

988
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:25.230
You got to see the family practicing Joe Road.
It's like it taken the whole,

989
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:29.280
the whole platoon outside to the yard and walking across on ropes all
afterwards.

990
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.690
It has to be your whole life,
your whole life,
your whole life.

991
00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.090
You can't fuck around with that.

992
00:55:33.091 --> 00:55:37.030
Very brilliant and being so good at standing on a wire.
What does,

993
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.440
what a terrifying fuck.
Love makes you wake up in the morning and go,

994
00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:43.320
I'm going to live on while I'm going to know and here's okay,
Laurie listed.

995
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:47.700
You want to go up the yard and get a treat and tied to the fucking rain gutter

996
00:55:47.701 --> 00:55:50.720
and walk across.
I'm with you,
but if go to Atlanta,

997
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.090
check into a hotel and tie a fucking string across the street.

998
00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.270
Walk across where?
Where do you get your balls?
Where the flooding,

999
00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.830
when you get your balls from,
tell me.

1000
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:03.570
It's just some people just always want to take things to the next level,

1001
00:56:03.571 --> 00:56:06.780
next level.
Even to the point where it's not,
it's not a smart thing,

1002
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:08.640
but we want to find out what people can do.

1003
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.810
I know where you got your boss from where?
That's right.
Motherfucker.
Wait,

1004
00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:17.550
look at that.
What are you get you fucking Joey do you can't show it on Ustream,

1005
00:56:17.551 --> 00:56:21.480
Brian and now obviously no Google hand.
Did you see that?

1006
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:23.980
Did you see the new cover to put a new one

1007
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.020
<v 2>up to dancing?</v>

1008
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:30.230
The first cover Joey put up on Facebook was his balls and the the title is where

1009
00:56:30.281 --> 00:56:31.300
I got my balls.

1010
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:34.010
That's the title of his documentary and one of those veins looking like the risk

1011
00:56:34.011 --> 00:56:36.850
and you send me some thick blood and all this.
Some big fucking done.

1012
00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:41.000
It was just like they did like,
like it was a road that had been shut down.

1013
00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:45.440
The fifties get fuckers,
just carbs
fucker.

1014
00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:50.840
Any mother fall over?
Oh Shit.
Yeah,
pumping.
Pumping.

1015
00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:56.070
You're very fiery.
Manage idea wasn't the flavor going through your body.

1016
00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.210
You know how we'd do it?
Flavor refund.

1017
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.910
You've had more nicknames than anybody I've ever met in my entire life.

1018
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:05.050
They were the only ones that I ever allowed a man to have their self imposed.

1019
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.270
I've had friends that have tried to call themselves something you like,

1020
00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:10.000
shut the fuck up.
You're not the black Hornet or whatever,
you know,

1021
00:57:10.001 --> 00:57:14.260
whatever the fuck you trying to be.
But with Joey Diaz,
it was always mad flavor.

1022
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.790
Planet Rock.
He was planet rock for a little bit.
Fat Babies here,
you know?

1023
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.490
Yeah.
Mitzi with your fam pain me.
Oh,

1024
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:28.510
so handsome.
She wanted to lick my nuts out.
It's,
yeah,
I love you.

1025
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.240
That was a,
yeah,
it was,
it was really too bad.

1026
00:57:31.241 --> 00:57:33.040
We couldn't have gotten to that 40th anniversary thing.

1027
00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.300
I just want you guys to say or once camp man,

1028
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.730
no one there that you would even know.
It doesn't matter.

1029
00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:44.920
It's just not my place anymore.
Not My spot to hang out.
I just,
uh,
I fucking,

1030
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.510
I didn't take it to do it again and it's,

1031
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:51.460
I have no idea why much animosity with the people that caused that issue.
This,

1032
00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:52.210
you know,
this,

1033
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:57.160
there's always a problem whenever club is legitimately in the,

1034
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:58.270
in the,
in the wrong,

1035
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:03.250
in a situation like that where someone is trying to step in and stop some shit

1036
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:05.710
from happening.
That's been happening a lot.
That's like,

1037
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:09.970
it's really obviously bad and this is also going to get a lot of attention and

1038
00:58:09.971 --> 00:58:12.130
it's going to be good for the club because people are gonna want to come down to

1039
00:58:12.131 --> 00:58:14.680
the club.
Like all the things were in place for them to do the right thing

1040
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.120
so I can never go back there.
Nah,
I'm done.
Done.
I would,

1041
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.880
I wouldn't even consider you,
but I'm happy.

1042
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.890
I'm happy for them and I hope it stays open forever.

1043
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.430
It's a great club needs in 1972 they were doing,
you know,

1044
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.430
which you have to really appreciate what you did and what you put after,

1045
00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.330
but you know,
people have to move on in life.
Yes,
exactly.

1046
00:58:34.331 --> 00:58:36.340
I feel great that I put in my time there.

1047
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:40.600
It was a very important for my development as a comedian,

1048
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:43.220
but after that's over,
it's over.
You know,
I,

1049
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:48.160
I think it's important to have chapters in your life.
You know,
I would never,

1050
00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:51.700
I considered it a month ago just stopping in.

1051
00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:55.300
I think Ari was Dan reg band and I was like,
you know what?
You can't go back.

1052
00:58:55.570 --> 00:59:00.570
I always feel like I paid my tribute [inaudible] we did a lot of time there.

1053
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:02.590
I did a lot of free shows there.

1054
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:05.000
I did a lot of free shows that we pumped up on Myspace,

1055
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:09.040
never got a penny from them and I replaced the sound system.

1056
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.720
So I felt like what I did,
I was like,
I pay,
I,

1057
00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:16.120
I gave to what the comedy store was to make so I can leave,

1058
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:21.260
I can leave it,
I paint,
I don't wish them ill.

1059
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:26.030
And I at my soul is still one of the greatest clubs just to go in in all of the

1060
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:28.610
world.
As far as like the history of standup comedy,

1061
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.050
there's only a few places like the,
the comedy Magic Club in Hermosa.

1062
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:36.350
That's a crazy one man.
You walk around those walls in the back and he's got,

1063
00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:38.530
first of all,
that Guy Mike Lacey,

1064
00:59:38.531 --> 00:59:42.860
he owns a comedy Magic Club is the nicest guy on the face of the amazing guy.

1065
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:47.950
And he's got a back room where the comic sit and they feed you gourmet mashed

1066
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:51.410
potatoes,
delicious desserts there and they're so generous.

1067
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:53.840
And so kind that all the writing on the walls,

1068
00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:55.460
they have brick walls where comedians sign it.

1069
00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:57.260
They ask you to sign it the first time you worked there.

1070
00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.230
All the writing is positive,
all of it.
That's crazy.

1071
01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:04.370
Most clubs you go to and it's like,
you know,
Cock Fox sock Dick,
you know,

1072
01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:07.670
like all like all these favorite is the punchline in Atlanta.

1073
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:11.210
I took a photo of it.
It was my favorite thing I ever read in a green room.
Said,

1074
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:14.720
stop trying to be Hicks.
Whoever you are there.

1075
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.870
God bless you sir.
God bless you sir.

1076
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.790
There's very few things more annoying than when you see a dude trying to be

1077
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:26.680
Hicks.
You're like,
Ooh,
no.
You smell it.
Comment.
Find your

1078
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:31.530
own way.
Like,
oh,
it's so sad.
Oh,
do it.

1079
01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.720
Being at the store hosted for the 10 o'clock show for a year or two Joe noses.

1080
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:40.340
You don't have any Hicks.
One of bees I see walking in,
there's always dead.

1081
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:41.360
That night that you were there,

1082
01:00:41.361 --> 01:00:45.800
that Ultraman referred the kid and the kid came in and actually his second joke

1083
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:48.350
was,
why would Jesus come back?

1084
01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:50.750
They'll that why people wear with crosses around their neck.

1085
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.390
He went right into the second joke.
He didn't,
he a sergeant titty,

1086
01:00:54.391 --> 01:00:57.970
you'll think of bank yet stole the joke,
right?
The jump,
Bam.

1087
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.350
And I'm in the Mitzi gone give him the fuck out.
Right?
Yeah.

1088
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.580
That'll often went up to her to do.
I tried to be cute,

1089
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:07.250
like get home from referred me,
but he's right.
I shouldn't belong it.

1090
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.250
You just did a stolen joke.
Obvious one.

1091
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:14.360
You didn't even fucking try to hide it in masculine.
Yeah,
well that's,
that's,

1092
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:16.340
that's always going to be the case like that.

1093
01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:20.260
But the amount of people that wanted to be Hicks because he,

1094
01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.530
he had such a weird impact on comedians more so than any comedian than I'd ever

1095
01:01:24.531 --> 01:01:25.340
seen because no one,

1096
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:29.090
no comedian made you want to change your behavior the way Hicks did.

1097
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.830
Like Hicks was so charismatic and so confident in what he was doing and his

1098
01:01:33.831 --> 01:01:35.120
material was so unique.

1099
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.380
Like the subject matter was so unique that all these dudes wanted to start

1100
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:43.700
acting like him.
They wanted to start,
they literally adopted his philosophies.

1101
01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:46.130
You could see it and when you talk to them,
they were like,

1102
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.300
they were like from the Church of Hicks.
And I,
and I thought about,
I'm like,

1103
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.270
Kinison never did that.
Like Candice who made you laugh,

1104
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:57.830
but it was always ridiculous shit about like cadavers getting fucked and you

1105
01:01:57.831 --> 01:02:01.850
know,
and Jesus screaming when he's on the cross.
It was ridiculous fun stuff.

1106
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.120
But Hicks literally almost enticed a school of thought and a bunch of people

1107
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:11.930
started being like,
he is,
you kind of have the same thing.

1108
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.140
Well it's very different.
I mean I,

1109
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.760
I've unquestionably was influenced by that guy.

1110
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:19.830
There's no question and I would never deny it.
Um,
I think,

1111
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.340
I think every person influences every person around them.
You know,
I've,

1112
01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:27.900
I've been influenced by Joey.
Um,
I've been influenced by Dunkin.

1113
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:31.110
I've been influenced by Ari.
I mean,
I think we all influenced each other.

1114
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.520
<v 6>But your style of comedy,
I remember when I first saw you,
it was very,
very like,</v>

1115
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:39.600
I've never heard anyone talk this kind of way about certain topics.

1116
01:02:39.601 --> 01:02:41.450
And it was kind of like the whole,

1117
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.340
like almost on like a religion almost where that was,

1118
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:45.810
it was so different than seeing,
you know,

1119
01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:48.780
like fucking Steve Martin with a fucking Dan Joe on the stage,

1120
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:50.430
which is what I thought comedy was.

1121
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:50.941
<v 2>Well,
why,</v>

1122
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:55.470
right after my first series of mushroom trips is when I started writing shit

1123
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:59.790
about the d evolution of human beings and where the pyramids came from.

1124
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:01.200
And you know,
where society's young,

1125
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.320
like I started writing shit that was just so much different than anything I'd

1126
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:05.220
ever written before.

1127
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:10.490
But it was a direct result of my own psychedelic experiences before that.

1128
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:13.560
Everything I was talking about,
which is like simple base shit.

1129
01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:15.450
Cause that's really all I was thinking about.

1130
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.920
I mean I might've had complex thoughts bouncing around in the back of my brain

1131
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.130
that I could do,
couldn't figure out how to put together and to anything,

1132
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:26.490
you know,
coherent that I could bring on stage.
But once I,

1133
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.370
once I started doing mushrooms,
once I started smoking pot too,

1134
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.990
that could just completely changed my comedy 100%.
Uh,

1135
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.610
I think,
um,
that's been,

1136
01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.400
if I had to say what's the biggest influence in my career?
It's pot.

1137
01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.930
It's funny that,
you know,
people don't want to admit that,

1138
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:45.900
but I think you have to be honest.
You have to be honest.
I mean,

1139
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:49.230
I first so for sure have done the work myself for sure.

1140
01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.790
I've sat many an hour in front of the computer in front of a notepad and many

1141
01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:56.420
times on stage performing and many,
you know,

1142
01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.570
many travels on many different airplanes.
I've done all that stuff too,

1143
01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:04.980
but God damn weed helps.
You know,
you could do a lot of the work,
but we,

1144
01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:09.000
we'd most certainly helps.
It's,
it's comedy for it.
Steroids for comedy rather.

1145
01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:13.750
<v 5>We should,
let's say,
it's amazing how I was going to tell you this.</v>

1146
01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.460
We wanted the phone about a month ago.

1147
01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:18.550
We were talking and we were talking about the success of the podcast.
You know,

1148
01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.920
and if you really watch comedy,

1149
01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:23.800
if you're real student of comedy and you're going to agree with me,

1150
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:24.910
we forget about this.

1151
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.120
The fucking tape that changed comedy forever was Rodney Dangerfield to specials

1152
01:04:30.461 --> 01:04:33.550
with those 10 killers from Donald,
wherever the Hicks,

1153
01:04:33.551 --> 01:04:37.840
the nice look at what those 10 guys did in history of comedy.
Robert Townsend,

1154
01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:42.200
Roseanne Barr.
Dot.
Merera Bill Hicks,
Lenny Clarke.

1155
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.240
A fucking Bob Nelson.
Yup.
You look at what those 10 guys did.

1156
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:50.350
They change the Seinfeld.
Yep.
So I thought it was on that too.
Yes,

1157
01:04:50.351 --> 01:04:53.320
he did the joke with them.
How does the hair get on the shower?

1158
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:56.770
Doesn't have his own life,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
Nobody could reach her in the shower.

1159
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:59.650
People try to call you in the shower.
He can't talk.
He's in the shower.

1160
01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:03.460
You know all that bit.
Yeah.
Look at,
look at it.
Look at the two lineups,

1161
01:05:03.461 --> 01:05:06.010
the lineups of brilliance.
Lenny Bruce,
Tim Allen on one.

1162
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.950
No dice follows fucking Bill Hicks follows dice.
Yeah,
I remember that.

1163
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:14.860
And it is the most,
if you're a comedian and you come to me,
well,
what do I watch?

1164
01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:15.521
What do I learn?

1165
01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:20.260
Just get that tape and watch it and over watch the change of energy of DyeCycle

1166
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:24.160
a 12 and a bath.
I have a mic.
You know,
when his mother,
he discovers jerking off,

1167
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:27.910
which is a great bit.
He goes,
my mother has a Migden.
Has it moved and years,

1168
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.150
you know,
you want,
what do you want for dinner?
Uh,
spinach,

1169
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:32.680
I came already that whole bit.

1170
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:37.810
He destroyed and bill Hicks went up that Bro with his demeanor.
How you doing?

1171
01:05:37.811 --> 01:05:42.640
My name is Bill Hicks.
I'm from Houston,
Texas.
That means I play in places like,

1172
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:47.770
what was that?
Enid,
Oklahoma,
I think give you my impersonation of Enid,
Oklahoma.

1173
01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.580
Woo.
It's inside the club.
You know,
he just goes up.

1174
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.380
But that's the one where he did one of my all time.

1175
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.980
This to me is my most favorite joke when he goes,
uh,

1176
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.380
fucking Vincent Van Gogh cut his ear off to send to a woman that makes like a

1177
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:06.310
desert rose.
It seemed like a booger.
That'd be,
he goes into that one and he goes,

1178
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.860
he goes,
Vince,
really Vince,
what?

1179
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:13.320
Susie called that to me when he says what soon as he called that he,

1180
01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.260
and then he goes into being,
listen to how its material then was hot.

1181
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:18.900
You talked about working at a,

1182
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:23.380
at a horror movie on Hollywood boulevard and how people would come in and sit

1183
01:06:23.381 --> 01:06:25.700
behind them.
I remember when I chopped off that guy's head.

1184
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:29.080
Then he talks about when he used to work at a shoe store,

1185
01:06:29.081 --> 01:06:31.760
a woman's shoe store and try women's shoes on it.

1186
01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.120
But then he went into the bit about,
you know,

1187
01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:37.960
I had a love and she dumped me and some day when their kids are bringing home

1188
01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:42.650
rickets and dead animals that are back there and he'll be fucking earns viles

1189
01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.970
the phlegm and fat and will be coming over her face.

1190
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:48.940
I'll be on TV doing this show.
And he took it.

1191
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:52.990
He took an infallible position because most comics were the whites.

1192
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.570
Dice Clay Angle,
forget I'm not going on.

1193
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:59.950
And he went up there and he took that energy and each just weaved it right in

1194
01:06:59.951 --> 01:07:01.900
front of you.
And to me as a comic,

1195
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:06.280
that is the most influential set I've ever seen because he took heat.

1196
01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.630
He didn't take a good set.
Watch it.
Yeah,
he took he,

1197
01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:14.790
he took a guy up there talking about pussy and cock Audi and fuck you up the

1198
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:19.100
ass.
And Ricky Ricky,
what was the nursery rhymes?
I mean Diane fired fire.

1199
01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.630
He was on fire for that.
It was Lenny Clarke and before that it was dom Irrera.

1200
01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.040
Dom Irrera was hilarious.
You never know those guys there could be missing it on,

1201
01:07:27.041 --> 01:07:31.750
but they'll still tough.
They'll fight you a one on,
hey you,
you talking to me?

1202
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:33.340
I'll fight you with one arm.
You know what I'm saying?

1203
01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:36.010
That's when he does that bit.
I love Donald Herrera.

1204
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.940
How are you doing uncle Vinny?
You know me,
I got,
I got it.

1205
01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:43.350
This my ass hole hurts my wife,
she won't bust my balls,
but you know me.

1206
01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.500
I don't complain.
I can't complain.
I can't show play.

1207
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:49.840
That shit is priceless that Lenny Clarke opens up.
Let me comes.

1208
01:07:49.841 --> 01:07:52.600
I hate doing my name is whatever he does.

1209
01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:57.010
One of my first [inaudible] ever got paid was a opening for Lenny.

1210
01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.580
Come on my second professional Gig,
but I always,

1211
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.600
I always lie and say it was my first,
but he took us working with Lenny.

1212
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:05.261
You know Joe,

1213
01:08:05.261 --> 01:08:09.280
he took a bunch of comics that were big in their regions because at that time

1214
01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:10.890
vice was selling out rascals.

1215
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:15.980
GRANDPA's dice was killing them in New York.
Seinfeld was killing them.
Hicks

1216
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.150
<v 2>was killing them in Houston.</v>

1217
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:21.050
They had all come up to the candy store now and they will all the killers from

1218
01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:25.400
their region.
Bob And a word of mouth killers is what it was.
Kennison yeah.

1219
01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.210
I was like,
I was a part of the Boston word.
Right,
right.
Got You.

1220
01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.740
Got a chance to see what it was lying with killers these times,

1221
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.690
but you know what?
If you look at it,

1222
01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:36.250
that's the same thing the podcast is doing for us and I gotta pray.

1223
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:40.430
I gotta thank you.
Rodney Dangerfield at the age of 52 he had nothing.

1224
01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:43.820
He took these comics that were right there on the brink,
Bro,

1225
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.180
and he made them stars because the next day they called fuck with candidates for

1226
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:50.990
the tonight show.
It was all of a seven minute set.
He gave them light.

1227
01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:54.560
And look what those 10 comics do with their lives.
Think about it.

1228
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:58.120
I mean the only guy that really didn't bust a TV show is dom a reverend.

1229
01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:02.810
He's still a damn good fucking comic dour.
So kills it.
Bob Nelson on that.

1230
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:07.310
My name is [inaudible].
My name is what?
Shut the fuck up.
Get over here.

1231
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.710
That's brilliant.
But you know bill,

1232
01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:12.980
I think he does well there's the connection with me there too.
Cause guess what?

1233
01:09:12.981 --> 01:09:14.420
If it wasn't for Bob Nelson,

1234
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:18.230
I would've never haven't been suspended as my manager.
How fucking crazy is that?

1235
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.850
My manager used to manage Bob Nelson and Bob Nelson and uh,
decided to,

1236
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:27.890
uh,
he'd become a Christian and he had decided to have is a prayer partner,

1237
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.690
become his manager.
And so my manager has said,
well,
all right,

1238
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.700
well I've got to go out and find new clients.

1239
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.830
So he came to Boston and just by luck I was going on stage that night.

1240
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:40.700
I wasn't even scheduled.

1241
01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:43.850
I went on stage that night cause I had a joke that I wrote that day that I

1242
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:46.280
wanted to try out.
So I asked them if I can get five minutes.

1243
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:50.220
I'd only been doing comedy for like two years.
I was still like a scrub.

1244
01:09:50.221 --> 01:09:54.080
I'll still like a rank amateur,
you know?
So if it wasn't for him,
I woulda,

1245
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.820
who knows where I would've been.
You know,
that's the,

1246
01:09:56.821 --> 01:09:59.200
the hardest thing with Comedians is that,
uh,

1247
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:03.590
someone who's a got that comic mind,
that's not the best marketer,

1248
01:10:03.591 --> 01:10:07.010
that's not the best person for getting their name out there.
You know,

1249
01:10:07.011 --> 01:10:10.460
they usually like some of the really funny people we know,
like Brian Holtzman,

1250
01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.380
you know,
I fear a world that doesn't know about Brian Holtzman Ashtray.

1251
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:17.990
I fear I fear a world that doesn't,

1252
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:20.510
that never saw the brilliance of that guy.

1253
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:23.120
Right after Susan Smith drown her kids,

1254
01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.890
that guy went on stage a week after that lady drown her fucking kids.

1255
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.310
And it was a huge case all across the country.
He goes on stage,
he goes,

1256
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:35.710
I had to a bad kids.
I had,
they didn't put away their blocks are,

1257
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.000
they spilled their milk,
they sat that close to the TV.

1258
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.110
Those kids won't be missed.
And you're like,
Holy Shit,

1259
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:45.290
I've tried to get him on so many podcasts.
Like there's so many people like that.

1260
01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:50.120
That's why I love doing podcasts because I love getting people to see people

1261
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:53.870
like Brian [inaudible],
Steve Brody,
Stevens.
Yeah.
Well your podcasts,

1262
01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:57.950
you certainly exposed Brody,
you know,
and uh,
the icehouse chronicles have and,

1263
01:10:58.030 --> 01:11:01.350
and you know,
having him on this podcast has,
you know,
and,

1264
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.080
and golf and [inaudible] loves Brody Brody's just,
uh,
he's to me like,

1265
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:09.440
just one of those little brilliant works of art that you see out there in the

1266
01:11:09.441 --> 01:11:10.550
world where you're just like,

1267
01:11:10.551 --> 01:11:13.980
you stumble upon something that's not like anything else.
And,

1268
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.450
<v 5>you know,
you got to learn to appreciate it.</v>

1269
01:11:15.451 --> 01:11:19.590
But when I get out of Brody is all positive,
you know,
especially now that he's,

1270
01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.440
uh,
he's really feeling healthy again.
You know,

1271
01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:26.540
I get out of Brody is a nice guy who has funny shit to say.
You know,

1272
01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.560
he chimes in some really,
uh,
really like personal funny shit.

1273
01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:34.830
He's just a gem is a gem of a dude guy.

1274
01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:38.040
I used to know that motherfucker from Seattle and he's a guy,

1275
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.730
he's just an amazing,
he's a crazy guy,
great guy,

1276
01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:45.810
but he's also a guy that's not the best at marketing himself and that's the only

1277
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:49.490
reason the world doesn't know exactly.
Funny comic that mock up,

1278
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:53.490
which a probably went home and got on my space at night.
You know,

1279
01:11:53.491 --> 01:11:56.250
you had to be funny by fucking making the racks in the old days.

1280
01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:58.080
You got to bang it out.
You know,
very interesting.

1281
01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:01.980
A couple of weeks ago you were saying,
uh,
you had uh,
talked to Stephen Parry,

1282
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:04.830
Joe Perry on Twitter.
Yeah.
You were thinking of getting them on the show.

1283
01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:05.883
A Arrow Smith.

1284
01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:11.090
It was 1970 fucking for the Boston red sox where everything check 1974 in

1285
01:12:11.611 --> 01:12:14.070
Boston.
The hockey team was up there.
The Celtics,

1286
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:15.480
what can I tell you about Devon 74?

1287
01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:20.310
They own the world and he has these five 30 mother fuckers rocking it.

1288
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:24.170
And also they'd put two albums out and I have to get your wings.
Uh,

1289
01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:28.200
the rumor was that they were on heroin.
You'll never see them perform again.

1290
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:31.740
And they released it.
Now they Brock's in the first cut of the owl,

1291
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:36.770
he comes out and yells back and he destroyed music forever.

1292
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.690
There was no,
there was no Twitter.

1293
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.850
They should chop that up for a fucking Twitter,

1294
01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.970
no Facebook CD that this is no nothing.
Joe Rogan,
you had to do it with talent.

1295
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.500
You had to make that much of an explosion in New Hampshire to fuck these mother

1296
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:55.850
fuckers to come and watch you.
[inaudible] what else,
man?

1297
01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:00.330
I've always been a huge Aerosmith fan.
You have a minute.

1298
01:13:00.331 --> 01:13:05.160
You call home and you put out rocks looking at in a fucking rock.
Diamonds,

1299
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.000
five diamonds,
five guys that didn't even talk to themselves,

1300
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:12.980
to guys splitting I pesticides in the house and the drummer and the Bass player

1301
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.320
talked.

1302
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.300
Everybody else didn't talk [inaudible] sign your name because they weren't on

1303
01:13:16.301 --> 01:13:19.440
the fucking age.
You had to sign your name to book the studio,

1304
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:22.470
which was the basement.
So you imagine me and you live in the same house.

1305
01:13:22.471 --> 01:13:24.670
We hate each other,
but we still in a band,
look,

1306
01:13:24.671 --> 01:13:27.210
Iraq's rocks rocked and they did this for rocks,

1307
01:13:27.211 --> 01:13:30.810
toys in the attics and something else.
Cause they got five hours.
Oh,

1308
01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:34.920
draw the line.
They got five,
five albums that I put up against any body.

1309
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:38.610
Get your wings up,
put up against rocks.
I'll put up against anybody.
Bring it.

1310
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:42.000
I'll put it up against any pink Floyd rocks.
Uh,
when they,

1311
01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:45.410
and when Joe Perry takes those heroin,
fucking put on nobody's fault.

1312
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.860
Listen to Novo.
Listen to fucking up.
Oh my God.

1313
01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:53.820
I've been listening to all kings and Queens.
Oh yeah.
Not,
not the,

1314
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:56.340
not the version on the greatest sets.
They chopped the heroine.

1315
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:59.700
Get taught the long version and knew he had Joe Perry.

1316
01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:04.620
Fucking your soul taps.
Go Perry was a bad mother fucker.
You know,

1317
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.030
there was a time when,
um,
Kurt Cobain killed himself,
that there was a,

1318
01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.980
something going on between Aero Smith.
It

1319
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.090
<v 2>was like Steven Tyler and Bob Goldthwait.</v>

1320
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:20.240
We're having some back and forth thing where Steven Tyler was talking about

1321
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.390
pretty sure it was Aerosmith and they were saying that like Nirvana,
like was,

1322
01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.250
you know,
the,
the last thing they would give a shit about was,
was,
was aerospace.

1323
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:33.290
And I remember thinking,
how can anyone say that?
Like Aerosmith,

1324
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:37.780
they became ballads for movies.
They became valid for movies,

1325
01:14:37.781 --> 01:14:42.490
but there was a period of time,
you know,
walk this way.
I mean,
come on man.

1326
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:47.500
Fucking bad ass came back to,
they were five guys that were strong,

1327
01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:51.850
so much on heroin,
even by the garage,
which was torn by the critics.

1328
01:14:51.851 --> 01:14:56.170
If you put it on,
it's a great fucking out.
It's a great arm.
That's when he left.

1329
01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:00.430
And I remember I went to see him and I went to see the Joe Perry Project Open up

1330
01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:03.730
heart,
opened up for the cheese at radio city again,

1331
01:15:03.731 --> 01:15:07.000
I was at a quail loot and I grabbed the fucking blonde by the ankle security,

1332
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:10.440
almost fucking grabbed the d.
The guitar grabbed the pitch.

1333
01:15:10.441 --> 01:15:13.150
I really like that fucking [inaudible] bitch.

1334
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:19.440
Oh,
that bitch could play.
You know it's,

1335
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:23.470
it's funny because I read that after Tyler went on American idol,

1336
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.940
everyone sold a bunch of albums but they only sold albums up to the loving an

1337
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:31.510
elevator and all that shit.
Then fucking original the blood line.

1338
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:36.850
These kids can't handle it.
You put on get your wings train kept rolling live.

1339
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.713
They mix it into,

1340
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.530
cause if he wasn't the train kept the row and that's never been done before it

1341
01:15:40.531 --> 01:15:43.330
start studio.
But it adds like what were they doing?

1342
01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:46.510
What was heart doing that made them so good when they're doing heroin?

1343
01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.220
First fucking two or three hours,
little whatever.

1344
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:56.500
Not some great Sam Barracuda is a great man.
Fucking what about bro?

1345
01:15:56.501 --> 01:16:00.550
What about Oh girl,
listen to the words on that Bro.

1346
01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:04.390
It's about a girl who's getting drilled.
Yeah cause she loves the caucus.

1347
01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:08.260
She ain't coming home billboard.
Whoa for a lot.
I'm trying to understand.

1348
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.150
Try to understand.

1349
01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.480
Try to track chat on the same [inaudible] she says that he's a magic man.

1350
01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:22.960
Mama.
That Dick is driving mama crazy.
Damn.
No Shit.

1351
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:25.480
That's a dude who's just sending home the good.

1352
01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:28.070
That's when you're 18 and you run into a 22 year olds.

1353
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:31.290
That's Ms. Fling a Dickerson,
thirsty ass.

1354
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:34.500
If you've been like fucking a cub scout,
we just bang just draped.

1355
01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:39.040
Men loves to do that too.
They love to just leave a devastating impression.

1356
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:41.560
Like you know,
it's almost like getting off stage when your dies going,

1357
01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:46.000
follow that nice like being 16 and fucking a girl and getting out of school.

1358
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.710
She's right there ready to carry your books.

1359
01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:49.510
That made you late some pipe on that bitch.

1360
01:16:49.511 --> 01:16:51.880
That's an important thing to do to in a relationship,
man.

1361
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:55.750
You got rock that check.
You never understood if it,
again,

1362
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.180
it really goes back to the golden principle of life.

1363
01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:01.390
The more things you do that make other people feel good,
the better you feel.

1364
01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:03.910
Good.
Maybe just had a card trick that looks really cool.

1365
01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:07.470
You got a rock or you got to rock you.
Like when you,

1366
01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:08.610
I'm going to hire you on silent.

1367
01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:12.200
Your mother married to a woman after to six or seven years.
You lose that spark.

1368
01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:14.790
So every once in a while you get what you need to weed.

1369
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:16.940
You got a piece of ass that's like every other week.

1370
01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:18.260
That's like just a piece of ass,

1371
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:20.750
but every two months or every month you come home,

1372
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:24.230
one night you pull up by the hair and rip the panties off and you get down.

1373
01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:26.270
You got a rocket.
You got to,
it's like Anderson Silva.

1374
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:28.100
He's got to smack somebody every 90 days.

1375
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.270
You got to smack somebody every 90 days.
You know what I'm saying?

1376
01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:33.370
That's saying this is Silva.
Did he say that?
Ooh.

1377
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:36.950
Did Anderson Silva said you smack somebody every 90 days.
Don't eat those.

1378
01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:40.060
That's what he's going to attribute that to him via Joey D.
Even if he doesn't,

1379
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.560
wasn't like,
oh,
well you will not understand.
I pop up block.

1380
01:17:42.561 --> 01:17:45.050
I bat smack in the face.
You don't know what the fuck is man,

1381
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.780
but he's smack somebody in the face every 90 days.

1382
01:17:47.781 --> 01:17:51.410
That's what he does and it's itself is living the life man.

1383
01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.160
That's a fascinating cat right there.
No,
we missed out and I got to,

1384
01:17:55.161 --> 01:17:56.780
you know they're going to have that fight in Vegas now.

1385
01:17:56.810 --> 01:18:00.100
I know you got off the fucking Hook you,
but you better be.
I wanted to go to big,

1386
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:02.570
I had a great time in Rio.
I know you had a great time of real,

1387
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:06.120
but if shit would have fucking,
that's what I was worried chuck you,

1388
01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.390
they wouldn't get like,
uh,
what's that?

1389
01:18:08.391 --> 01:18:12.890
Charles Bronson for women was going to be a fight in Rio de Janeiro,

1390
01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:17.810
Brazil in an 80,000 seat soccer arena between Anderson Silva and Chael Sonnen,

1391
01:18:17.811 --> 01:18:21.500
the most anticipated rematch maybe in the history of the UFC,
the first fight,

1392
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:26.240
four rounds of complete domination by Chell son and took him down always on top

1393
01:18:26.241 --> 01:18:29.210
ground and pound and drop and punches down.
And then the fifth round,

1394
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:31.910
Anderson Catches Him with a triangle and come from behind victory.

1395
01:18:31.911 --> 01:18:33.320
Incredible fight.
Right?
Okay.

1396
01:18:33.321 --> 01:18:35.930
So they were gonna fight and they would have a rematch in the soccer stadium,

1397
01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:39.080
but all chill sudden does is talk shit about Brazil.

1398
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.990
He's coming on the week of May 7th but we're out the date,

1399
01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:45.000
but he's going to be on because he's got a book out and if it's a child sign in

1400
01:18:45.001 --> 01:18:48.830
book,
I guarantee you with tremendous,
that dude is a funny motherfucker.

1401
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:52.250
He in my opinion is the best shit talker,

1402
01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:55.640
the best fight promoter of any sport period.

1403
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.450
If you knew that guy and he knew what he's really like and then you see like

1404
01:18:59.451 --> 01:19:03.440
what kind of a Ruckus he can stir up and how much clever shit he comes up with,

1405
01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:08.360
how great he is and answering questions and those Q and A's off the cost ticket

1406
01:19:08.361 --> 01:19:12.080
for Brazil.
So it all went well.
It went down.
This is what happened.

1407
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.820
The Ulan has a meal.
Let's first capital,

1408
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.130
let's scheduled for his attention.
We Chili Chili's don't take place in July.

1409
01:19:19.131 --> 01:19:22.070
I want to see it.
I don't want to see it though.
I want to see it in Brazil.
Oh,

1410
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:24.170
you listened.
That's dangerous to prove a point.

1411
01:19:24.171 --> 01:19:25.370
Well you shouldn't have said nothing.

1412
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:29.750
He most certainly shouldn't have said something bad about the country of Brazil

1413
01:19:29.751 --> 01:19:30.610
because when we tie something,

1414
01:19:30.611 --> 01:19:34.820
I have never seen a country as fiercely loyal as Brazil talk shit.

1415
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:39.770
Now you gotta go down,
Bang,
love,
love each other,
love Brazilians,

1416
01:19:39.771 --> 01:19:44.710
love being Brazilian man.
There are,
there is so much pride in Brazil.
It's they,

1417
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.600
it's like,
you know,
it was a lot like that too,
is Canadians.

1418
01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:50.540
There's a lot of Canadians who will come down here and they find out you're a

1419
01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:54.200
comedian and they're really excited to tell you about real funny Canadian

1420
01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:57.330
comedians like we've got,
you know,
can,
can,
I has got some really good comics.

1421
01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.500
You know,
Jim Carrey came from Canada,
you know,
like they,
they're like proud,

1422
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.650
proud to be Canadian,
but not as nutty as the Brazilians,
man.
Brazilians are they,

1423
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:07.140
I've never seen anything like it.

1424
01:20:07.141 --> 01:20:10.050
I've seen guys fight in Canada against Canadians.
The Canadians,

1425
01:20:10.051 --> 01:20:12.930
even though they were rooting for the Canadian fighter,
for sure.

1426
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.680
We're very polite.
For the most part,
to the American fighter,

1427
01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:20.640
whoever the fighter was from whatever country in Brazil,
they're chanting out,

1428
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:25.260
you're going to die.
They're chanting.
I'm talking about a whole crowd.

1429
01:20:25.261 --> 01:20:29.190
The guy gets on the scale for the way in and they're chanting out this thing.

1430
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:33.450
So I don't,
I dunno what the fuck they're saying.
And so I asked the lady,
I said,

1431
01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:37.980
what are they saying?
She goes,
they're saying,
you're going to die.
Wow.
I was like,

1432
01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:40.890
your whole crop,
the whole crowd scene,
you're gonna die.

1433
01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:46.290
And so then we're at the fight and it was,
um,
one of the dudes from,
um,

1434
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:51.750
from,
uh,
uh,
Brazil,
uh,
fuck,
I can't remember his name.

1435
01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:56.840
And he fought Mike Pyle.
Goddammit.
Coddle Punch.
Yes.
Ricardo Funche,
Ricardo Foche,

1436
01:20:56.841 --> 01:20:58.650
who actually,
I was trying to,
I'm getting confused.

1437
01:20:58.651 --> 01:21:00.030
I was connecting him with Gonzaga,

1438
01:21:00.031 --> 01:21:04.420
cause I know he trains a team link in a western Massachusetts with Gonzaga.
Um,

1439
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.130
and,
uh,

1440
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:09.030
Mike Pyle knocks him out and Mike Pyle is like bowing to everybody trying to bow

1441
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:13.380
and they're booing like at the top of their fucking lungs.
Man,

1442
01:21:13.381 --> 01:21:15.690
they're going crazy.
By the time I get into the octagon,
he's saying,

1443
01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:18.930
I just want to say that I love Brazil.
It's an honor to be in this and that.

1444
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:23.980
And they're chanting out something.
So it sounds like c Egon.
No.

1445
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.750
See you got,
oh,
and so I asked the lady,
I said,
what do they chanting out?

1446
01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:32.550
She goes,
they're champing up for junior dos Santos Sugano,
and so I go,
oh,

1447
01:21:32.551 --> 01:21:36.300
okay.
That wasn't what they were saying.
They were saying fig I know,

1448
01:21:36.301 --> 01:21:39.450
I think is how you say it,
which means faggot.
Wow.

1449
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:44.690
So 18,000 people were jetting out faggot to a guy who is bowing to them and say,

1450
01:21:45.451 --> 01:21:48.540
thank you.
I love Brazil.
I love it here.
Thank you very much.

1451
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.670
Like they were just mad that he beat a Brazilian.

1452
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:55.110
They are so passionate and nationalistic that if child son in one,

1453
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.500
my God,
I feel be reasonable.
Why I was worried about you.

1454
01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.950
The only one I'm worried about you wouldn't Goldie,
you know,
I said,
yeah,

1455
01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:04.110
well they had a wall of security around him.

1456
01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:07.290
He was just in Brazil recently and they had a wall of security around him.

1457
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:10.890
It's either Robert Armor.
Yes.
It would have been just like that.

1458
01:22:10.891 --> 01:22:13.830
I have to wait or you whatever was fucking bad noise.
Yeah.
Well,

1459
01:22:13.831 --> 01:22:17.660
it could have been,
man,
we could have seen him get a password.
That's not a joke.

1460
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:21.790
That's all you.
Ah,
ah.
What happens on the phone?
Got a towel.

1461
01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.860
No.
Yeah.
That's all you would have heard,
I think from now on.

1462
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:29.580
All UFC used Japan.
Yeah.
Japan was very polite.

1463
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:32.460
Japan was the most polite place I've ever been in my life.

1464
01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:36.390
Have you been following this shit lately about the reactor?

1465
01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:41.070
Last couple days I've been following what appears to be an article that's

1466
01:22:41.071 --> 01:22:43.170
written on one of those fear sites.

1467
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:46.860
It's like the end of the world's coming and apparently according to a lot of

1468
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:50.370
people that read it on Twitter,
the science is not correct and it was.

1469
01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:53.490
It doesn't make sense,
but that said,

1470
01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:58.200
I'm just repeating shit that I read.
I don't really have any,
I hope not,
man.

1471
01:22:58.201 --> 01:23:02.070
I want to knowledge whatsoever,
but it doesn't seem like it's good.
I mean,

1472
01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:05.000
what's going on with that fourth reactor is that thing melting down too.

1473
01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.630
I read something about the fourth reactor.
I was like,

1474
01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:09.280
Jesus Christ is that a possibility?

1475
01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:12.880
Does that he imagined they have four reactors that melt down and turn that whole

1476
01:23:12.881 --> 01:23:16.900
place and just a a radioactive.
So two people are saying when that fear thing,

1477
01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:19.940
they were saying that California was already getting fucked.
Yeah,

1478
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.500
well they're saying that we have higher levels of radiation than,

1479
01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:25.060
than ever before and they're attributed to Fukushima.

1480
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:28.540
They're saying that it's getting,
it's in boulder,
Colorado.
They're saying it's a,

1481
01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.810
it's essentially all over the country.
You can't stop it,
you know,
it just,

1482
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:33.030
it just flows over the,

1483
01:23:33.031 --> 01:23:36.490
the question is how much of it can we absorb before it becomes dangerous?

1484
01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.160
That's a question.
I don't know.
I don't know.

1485
01:23:39.161 --> 01:23:42.550
But they are saying that we are experiencing higher levels of radiation than

1486
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:45.880
usual because of these Japanese reactor.
Is there,
I think it's the whole country.

1487
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:50.380
Any kind of like on it type shit that,
that yes.
Help you.
Yes.

1488
01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:53.710
Potassium,
iodine,
potassium,
iodine is,

1489
01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:58.540
it offers protection to different parts of your body.
A,
especially your,

1490
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:02.140
um,
your thyroid gland can be adversely affected by radiation.

1491
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.190
How there's been a lot of thyroid cancers lately.
And thyroid disease.

1492
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:09.070
I don't know,
something that's been since the reactor,

1493
01:24:09.071 --> 01:24:12.580
but I mean there's a lot of environmental factors and genetic factors that can

1494
01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:16.090
contribute to that too.
Right?
So you needed to have a zombie away for on it.

1495
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:20.710
That's just that away.
Seriously keep you from getting fucked by radiation.

1496
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:24.370
Yeah,
well I would so,
yeah,
maybe,
I don't know.
Um,

1497
01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.680
I don't know what the fuck the future of energy is,
man,

1498
01:24:26.681 --> 01:24:30.400
but it's real scary that something like that Fukushima Shit can ever happen

1499
01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:35.260
because we're looking at such a small time frame.
Okay,
we're looking at,
here's,

1500
01:24:35.261 --> 01:24:37.090
here's the earth in 2012 right?

1501
01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:40.630
Picture this in 2012 a hundred years ago,

1502
01:24:40.631 --> 01:24:44.200
there was no nuclear power at all.
There was nothing like it.
Okay?

1503
01:24:44.201 --> 01:24:46.630
That's 100 years ago.
They had not figured that out yet.

1504
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:51.970
Just the idea that in a hundred years you can have Chernobyl.

1505
01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:55.120
You can have five mile,
three mile island,

1506
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:59.590
you can have Fukushima,
you can have all those take place.
Huge,

1507
01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:04.650
gigantic disasters that fuck those areas beyond repair for a hundred thousand

1508
01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:07.451
plus years.
Just a fact.

1509
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:11.050
You can have three of those inside a hundred year period where nuclear power

1510
01:25:11.051 --> 01:25:14.290
exists.
How long do you think nuclear power is going to last?
You mother fuckers,

1511
01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.710
nuclear power is going to last with thousands of thousands years.

1512
01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:19.570
You're going to accumulate a certain amount of these fucking disasters and the

1513
01:25:19.571 --> 01:25:20.021
more you do,

1514
01:25:20.021 --> 01:25:22.390
the more you're going to have unlivable spots everywhere in the world.

1515
01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.780
If you want your disaster,
there's your fucking disaster.

1516
01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:29.270
There's an almost inevitable disaster we don't know about.
What do we think that?

1517
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.860
Well,
how about the storage of the stuff?
That's the real issue.
They don't know.

1518
01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:34.450
They don't know where to store the waste.

1519
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.900
They store it in Nevada and that's one of the reasons why you get the gambling

1520
01:25:37.901 --> 01:25:40.180
in Nevada is that they did a lot of tests.

1521
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:44.080
They did a lot of nuclear tests and they also did do a lot of nuclear storage

1522
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:48.060
and so these deals that they've made a right on top of the Mandalay bay.

1523
01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.400
Even that shit.
Look at Van Nuys.
We might be breathing it right now.

1524
01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:53.860
You know what's crazy football?
Did you guys see that?

1525
01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:57.830
The kid from Japan found that in Alaska.
Yeah.

1526
01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:00.900
They found the soccer ball.
That shit's already there.
My friends,

1527
01:26:00.901 --> 01:26:03.230
that soccer ball didn't show up by itself.
We will then

1528
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:07.740
<v 3>send them proof that radiation is hitting our shores because shit north shore,</v>

1529
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.090
they've said,
they've said that they've already,
you know,
they,

1530
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:13.730
they can actually track it in the Gulf stream.
They know where the radio,

1531
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.910
you know,

1532
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:17.960
cause they had a poor millions of gallons of ocean water on the reactors to cool

1533
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:20.540
them off and they're still doing that.
They're still doing the same thing.

1534
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:25.700
So they're just wantonly polluting a huge area of ocean to stop their issue and

1535
01:26:25.701 --> 01:26:29.120
there's no other solution.
I don't know how else they're going to cool it off.

1536
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:31.810
I don't know what the fuck they could go.
I mean it's almost like they,

1537
01:26:31.811 --> 01:26:35.810
they need science to come up with some incredible innovation to stop the

1538
01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:40.670
meltdown of this thing.
Who would have ever thought that that's how a reactor is,

1539
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:44.360
is that there's no way to stop it,
is that once you run out of power,

1540
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:47.390
like literally you can't contain the energy and it just eats through its

1541
01:26:47.391 --> 01:26:49.820
containment cell and it becomes incredibly toxic.

1542
01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.270
Like who would have every thought that they would make something that seems so

1543
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:57.920
likely to fail.
So likely.
What if it got hit by a meteor?

1544
01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:02.690
We're fucked.
You know,
really.
You know,
why would anybody let them build that?

1545
01:27:02.691 --> 01:27:03.130
It's almost,

1546
01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:07.010
it's almost like they had something and they were sure that they would have it

1547
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:08.600
completely harnessed in 20 years,

1548
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:11.990
but just launch it today and cross our fingers at the power doesn't go off for

1549
01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:12.710
20 years,

1550
01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:14.960
but in 20 years from now we're going to know how to deal with this stuff the

1551
01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:15.794
fuck we are.

1552
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:18.440
We might not ever be able to figure out how to deal with nuclear waste.

1553
01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:21.140
It might be just one of those things know not enough,

1554
01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:23.650
but maybe not at least start talking half life.

1555
01:27:23.651 --> 01:27:26.750
So it's like a hundred thousand years.
Don't get not to mention that.

1556
01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.670
Or we have all of this radioactive shit.

1557
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.490
What about all the oil that's been hitting the ocean?

1558
01:27:31.491 --> 01:27:34.310
What about the shit that happened last year?
All the shit accumulates.
Yeah.

1559
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:37.730
This is all,
this is all effected off bucket cheat one way or another.

1560
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.490
This will all this shit pollution,
oil in the water.

1561
01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.860
We're not catching a break from any fucking direction.

1562
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.040
The only one who's really catch a break and limited fucking Montana where they

1563
01:27:46.041 --> 01:27:49.340
found the teeth of those dinosaurs.
That's it.
I mean not,
what else can we,

1564
01:27:49.341 --> 01:27:51.260
you can't drink ocean water to fucking 20.

1565
01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:53.090
We don't know what we're drinking two years ago.

1566
01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:55.790
They do the thing that there's drugs in the water that you drink,
you know,

1567
01:27:55.791 --> 01:28:00.290
small percentiles of uh,
you know,
fucking value or whatever the fuck they found.

1568
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:02.900
You know,
which doesn't affect me.
I don't give a fuck.
It adds to my party.

1569
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:06.060
But I'm just talking about this,
a ton of shit out there that we don't even know,

1570
01:28:06.061 --> 01:28:09.320
but that's what we know about.
We know about that.
What about all these?

1571
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:12.440
What about when we talk about rocky flats and Colorado?
We did.

1572
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:14.360
Those people were out there because they're making that up.

1573
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:15.760
Those people were real intelligent,
aren't they?

1574
01:28:15.761 --> 01:28:19.370
And they said that shit was leaking for years.
They had proof of rocky flats.

1575
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:22.840
So we sit here for hours and talk about bold and all this shit out graders.

1576
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.570
But those people had proof that there was leakage update in that beautiful

1577
01:28:26.571 --> 01:28:28.190
fucking area.
We have you.

1578
01:28:28.191 --> 01:28:31.670
Have you ever gone to rocky flats when you drive to rocky flats?

1579
01:28:31.671 --> 01:28:34.910
You know you're somewhere that you're not supposed to be member of that show.

1580
01:28:34.911 --> 01:28:38.360
The hitchhiker on Hbo,
he'd be hitching and there's nothing out there.

1581
01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:41.720
Just flat land.
That's it.
How beautiful is Colorado one?

1582
01:28:41.721 --> 01:28:45.260
Have you ever seen a flat part of Colorado when you hit rocky flats?

1583
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:49.160
The mountains a fall,
the fuck away and whole areas flat.

1584
01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:54.170
Very.
The air is thinner.
Like there's a little fucking guy in a security thing,

1585
01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:56.780
like an RBG by himself.

1586
01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.950
This is the entrance to like a Stephen King movie.
It's like a state.
It's,

1587
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.430
it's like the continuation for this shiny,
like it's gray out there.

1588
01:29:05.431 --> 01:29:08.880
When you go out there,
Colorado Sadia like I've told you before,

1589
01:29:08.881 --> 01:29:12.340
boldly gets as much sunshine as a Wai Honolulu.
Hawaii.
Yeah.

1590
01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.480
When you go out to rocky flats and even feels gray,

1591
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.080
it's probably the government man.
It's good.
I probably shoot that harp shit.
Now,

1592
01:29:19.081 --> 01:29:20.760
where's the place where you go underneath?

1593
01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:25.740
What's the name of that in Colorado for us has a norad,

1594
01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:29.610
I'm sorry,
normal rounds in Colorado.
Where is it?
Not Norad in Colorado.

1595
01:29:29.611 --> 01:29:33.300
Can they check for me please?
Yeah,
sure.
This nor gods in Colorado.

1596
01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:37.080
You know like when you go on bold Gloria,
where the fuck his door,
right,
exactly.

1597
01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.280
And they have a place to devil stomach,

1598
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:43.860
bold North American Aerospace Defense Command.
How's that?
Norad?

1599
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.400
I Dunno.
Defense Command n a underneath.

1600
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:51.600
That's why they always said if you live in boulder in Colorado it's great.

1601
01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.000
But the first places I like going to get bombed,

1602
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:57.690
it's going to be Colorado because you going to try to destroy norad even though

1603
01:29:57.691 --> 01:30:02.280
it's just a fucking,
they have 20 zero rads and we have more,
uh,
uh,

1604
01:30:02.710 --> 01:30:06.870
hire a fucking whatever one's now nor had was built.
God knows when.

1605
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.090
I mean by now we must have other caves that are fucking stronger,

1606
01:30:10.091 --> 01:30:13.770
but they've always said that norad is one of the first places they'll take out,

1607
01:30:14.130 --> 01:30:15.220
look at it,
read about it,

1608
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:20.390
nor had as one of the first Colorado Springs is located at Patterson Air Force

1609
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:23.490
Base.
If you've ever been in Colorado Springs,
Colorado Springs.
He was like,
aw,

1610
01:30:23.491 --> 01:30:25.020
military man,
all military.

1611
01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:30.020
Oh military in 1985 the number one growing city in the country and number three

1612
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:34.770
for crime at the same time.
The [inaudible],
Colorado Springs,

1613
01:30:34.771 --> 01:30:36.930
there's no fucking joke in any five cause I almost moved there.

1614
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.580
That's how I ended up in boulder.
On the plane,

1615
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:41.510
somebody say you don't want to go to Colorado Springs has a Gi town,

1616
01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:46.190
they'll get you boulder with some bitches.
It's a,
it's a Gi Gi talent.

1617
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.630
It's also really religious town,
very religious.

1618
01:30:48.631 --> 01:30:52.350
Their religious Colorado Springs is where Ted Haggard is from.

1619
01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:56.750
That dude had that crazy minister and was winding up doing crystal meth and

1620
01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.650
<v 6>it's probably easy to get religious when you lived there just because of all the</v>

1621
01:30:59.651 --> 01:31:02.920
beauty around you.
You know,
you probably have liked.
Yes.
There is a maker of this.

1622
01:31:02.921 --> 01:31:04.570
This is amazing and gorgeous.

1623
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.480
<v 3>It's also easy to get religious in a,
um,
uh,
an army town.
You know,</v>

1624
01:31:09.481 --> 01:31:12.180
that's just a fact.
I'm a military towns,
you know,
there's no,

1625
01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:15.480
there's no atheists in foxholes.
That's an old expression to Colorado.

1626
01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.860
It made me want to smoke more fucking briefing.
Yeah,
that'd be honest with you.

1627
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.910
I became a reef ahead professionally.
I was always a reef ahead.

1628
01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:25.980
Once I moved to Colorado,
I'm like,
I get it now.

1629
01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:29.010
You're in God's while the fucking,
it really is God's country.
You know,

1630
01:31:29.011 --> 01:31:32.280
when you're driving through the mountains,
like I always just describe to the,

1631
01:31:32.281 --> 01:31:34.530
the feeling that you get is just like something,

1632
01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:36.810
if you're looking at the most incredible work of art,

1633
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.140
if you looking at a beautiful,
like incredible work of art,

1634
01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:43.410
like that feeling of awe and inspiration and just a,

1635
01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:46.530
and then really a wave of happiness washes over your body.

1636
01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.140
That's what it's like when you're driving around in boulder.
I mean,

1637
01:31:49.141 --> 01:31:53.160
that's how crazy it is.
You know,
if you've ever seen core d'alene,
Idaho,

1638
01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:57.690
you had been in school.
This Jesus Christ.

1639
01:31:57.691 --> 01:32:00.910
Is it beautiful up there?
Oh my God,
Dude.

1640
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:05.110
I looked at some photos online and I'm like,
this doesn't even look real.

1641
01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:05.921
These people,

1642
01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:09.550
there's a town up there and apparently it's like Alanna real like fat cats and

1643
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:12.570
it's like,
um,
where's that one place in Wyoming?
It's like a,

1644
01:32:12.571 --> 01:32:16.810
a famous place in Wyoming.
I like Dick Cheney.
He's got a ranch and Cheyenne,

1645
01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:21.730
I dunno where.
No,
no.
Well how about this?
Let's,
I'll just type in rich people,

1646
01:32:21.731 --> 01:32:26.440
Wyoming,
but they all have this,
uh,
the,

1647
01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:29.000
they have like a,
a town up there where it's like,
oh,

1648
01:32:29.001 --> 01:32:31.240
like bankers and billionaires and shit like

1649
01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:36.380
<v 2>that.
Come on,
I can't find it.</v>

1650
01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:42.360
Which people live in Wyoming and Wyoming.
[inaudible] seven

1651
01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:46.620
<v 3>Jackson Hole.
Jackson is Jackson Hole.
That's it.</v>

1652
01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:52.400
[inaudible] we're all rich people live.

1653
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:55.190
You know,
that's what they did and they pieced it together.
There was a spot,

1654
01:32:55.620 --> 01:33:00.350
you know,
we're,
it's like,
it's all like mansions and ranches and she ever looked,

1655
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:03.470
you go online just for a goof and like look at real estate and different sounds

1656
01:33:03.471 --> 01:33:06.090
amazing.
I like to do that.
I like to say I went to Cheyenne,

1657
01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:09.610
I went to Jackson Hole,
Wyoming and my roommate,
not my roommate,

1658
01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:13.910
the guy that lived next door to me in Snowmass village and 83,

1659
01:33:13.911 --> 01:33:14.900
his father died.

1660
01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:18.200
So he came through it and he goes up in the bind that really needed like 600

1661
01:33:18.201 --> 01:33:19.750
bucks in my plane ticket.
I gave it to him.
I said,

1662
01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.920
don't worry about your father died when he came back.
He goes,

1663
01:33:21.921 --> 01:33:24.890
I really want to do something nice via,
he was the manager of sport.

1664
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:27.950
Katelyn sport can lose a big ski shop and Aspen at the time.

1665
01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:31.310
And he used to get demos.
He's the guy who first taught me how to ski.

1666
01:33:31.311 --> 01:33:32.840
This guy did a lot for me and one day he goes,

1667
01:33:32.841 --> 01:33:35.630
I want to take you on a trip to uh,
him and his wife.

1668
01:33:35.631 --> 01:33:38.450
We would take me to a trip to Jackson hole ski.

1669
01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.680
At the time I was pretty decent on one 85 but I wasn't fucking good at all.

1670
01:33:42.681 --> 01:33:47.000
I say 85 180 you know your skis,
one of the fives,
two oh five so I was okay.

1671
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:50.570
These motherfuckers took me to Jackson hole and my president wants to go on a

1672
01:33:50.571 --> 01:33:54.140
helicopter and jump out of a helicopter into snow and guys,

1673
01:33:54.141 --> 01:33:59.080
I ain't a straight fucking do it that you couldn't do it and I wouldn't feel

1674
01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:03.080
your smart.
Fuck you.
I should've done it.
Oh fuck yeah.

1675
01:34:03.230 --> 01:34:06.050
I shouldn't eat mushrooms.
And Jay was just 20 foot drop.

1676
01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:10.880
It was just a 20 foot drop.
And you're dropping into
doctor Steve,

1677
01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:14.350
my buddy 80 inches.
Yeah,
I fucked him this morning.
Are you?

1678
01:34:14.351 --> 01:34:17.660
You're jumping into 180 inch base of snow,

1679
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:21.170
so you basically landing in 30 feet of snow.
Nothing's going to happen to you.

1680
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:23.300
You're just going to go down a little bit into the mountains.

1681
01:34:23.301 --> 01:34:24.200
This when you shoot,

1682
01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:27.890
but that's the present you 30 feet of snow and you're on the top of it.

1683
01:34:27.891 --> 01:34:31.280
Who Know How fucking much based there isn't the top of a mountain of snow.

1684
01:34:31.281 --> 01:34:34.000
30 feet has got to be 20 feet.
It's those all fucking,

1685
01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:37.240
you know when you're going to look right now,
what's the base of Aspen?

1686
01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:40.940
They'll give you 114 inches.
Whatever the fuck they give you is debates are,

1687
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:43.960
what does it feel like to be in an avalanche?
Imagine that.
I couldn't,

1688
01:34:43.961 --> 01:34:46.850
he was one recently where when you look back a mesh,
it's chasing you.

1689
01:34:47.150 --> 01:34:50.360
But you know when you go skiing,
even ski,
like I listened,
uh,

1690
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:53.540
three years ago I shot a movie in Colorado and I went up there and they gave me

1691
01:34:53.541 --> 01:34:56.030
a ski pass for the day and it was great.
I got on the Gondola,

1692
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:58.100
I put skis on and I skied

1693
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.700
<v 5>around the top and I was up there for too long.
I got oxygen,
sickness,
you know,</v>

1694
01:35:01.701 --> 01:35:05.610
high level,
whatever it was to fly parks,
whatever it was.
You get dizzy and shit.

1695
01:35:05.611 --> 01:35:08.180
So I went down,
but my skiing days are over.

1696
01:35:08.181 --> 01:35:11.540
But if you ever get the chance and you're young and your knees and whatever you

1697
01:35:11.541 --> 01:35:14.870
eat a mushroom,
cause that's what those people do.
They mushrooms and go skiing.

1698
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:18.920
Apparently a snowboarding is easier to learn snowboarding.
It's easy.
It's great.

1699
01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:21.980
It really is.
I don't think so.
When you went this last time,

1700
01:35:21.981 --> 01:35:24.660
did you see your children's ski?
What's your children's ski there?

1701
01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.320
Google too young.
I you were saying that they uh,

1702
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:32.200
they call them ski bunnies and they take them when they're three and they teach

1703
01:35:32.201 --> 01:35:35.710
them how to ski and Hey,
you are 20 years old,
you've been lifting weights,

1704
01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:40.400
drinking protein shakes and here you all walking like a Zombie and these little

1705
01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:44.120
fucking four year olds go by.
You're doing Nightingale that stops you.

1706
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:48.050
Shouldn't you feel like a fucking moron?
You're like,
look at the,

1707
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.090
but there are lower,
they lower the gravity so it's easier for them to talk and,

1708
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:57.320
but [inaudible] easier for me to,
you know,

1709
01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:02.140
lower gravity.
It took me three hours to walk from sport Katelyn to the lift,
bro.

1710
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.090
I grew up in three hours cause I put the skis on.

1711
01:36:05.091 --> 01:36:06.730
I thought I was going to be like,
oh no.

1712
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:10.850
I kept falling and falling and you're walking with the skis on the fucking Momo.

1713
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:15.080
You know like trying to project ski poles.
The pole you are doing cross country.

1714
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.150
Yeah.
That's a different type of skiing.
Skiing with you guys anytime you want.
No,

1715
01:36:19.151 --> 01:36:23.420
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You Ski.
I grew up skiing.
He grew up ski club.

1716
01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:27.340
I neither he did when he was younger.

1717
01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:32.120
[inaudible]

1718
01:36:32.130 --> 01:36:34.370
it's just leaning left to right.
It's not that big of a deal.

1719
01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.090
When you're a kid and you go skiing,
you'd these a fucking nothing.

1720
01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:41.360
Get Carla just strong,
strong.
You just bounce.
Like I said,
you don't twist.

1721
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.840
It's when you get old to that.
Don't skis cross you fucking history.

1722
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:48.080
I never fucked with anything.
When I was growing up that involved the cold.

1723
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:51.730
I didn't want to play hockey.
I don't want to fuck you.
I hate the cold.

1724
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.210
I really enjoy is amazing.
I really enjoy it.
Seems like fun.

1725
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:58.100
I had never done it in Jersey because why would you do it in Jersey?

1726
01:36:58.410 --> 01:37:02.200
Bravo says it's like close to sex.
It is when you're flying,

1727
01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.660
that wind goes and then you realize it's you.

1728
01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:08.740
Your body is like a car and you're just going to realize it's,

1729
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.600
you asked and you'd see like all this,
like you're in the forest.
I think it's,

1730
01:37:11.601 --> 01:37:16.250
it's,
it's,
you can't trust myself,
man.
I'm too fucking impulsive.

1731
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:17.870
There's what?
What happened to me,
Joe Rogan.

1732
01:37:17.871 --> 01:37:21.620
I would go jump off the Gondola and I would start skiing and go and talk,

1733
01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:22.610
you know?
But Brian,

1734
01:37:22.611 --> 01:37:27.230
I would talk and get great stance and I'd be balanced and all of a sudden I

1735
01:37:27.231 --> 01:37:32.180
realize I'm going a little bit too fast and I would fucking crash my own.

1736
01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:36.190
Like I'd be scared.
I scanned myself like I'm going to fucking fast white.
No,
no,

1737
01:37:36.191 --> 01:37:38.470
no,
no,
no,
no.
And I fucked him.
Plow and tech.

1738
01:37:38.471 --> 01:37:41.060
I told you I would take out ski lines.
I would just take out a line,

1739
01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.670
talk to my fucking head and go for Brooklyn Woods.
You really

1740
01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:49.400
owe a couple dog.
I'm embarrassed to say it,
but it's easy to freak yourself.

1741
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:52.400
It's easy to freak yourself out.
You Freak yourself out.
You're like,

1742
01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:57.700
what should people next to you?
And like they start goal
and you're like,
oh no,
no,

1743
01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:01.350
no.
Because you know what the results are.
How many times have you fallen?

1744
01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:03.610
You ski is two miles up.
The fuck is,

1745
01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:06.870
you got to fucking climb up with those boots and go get you don't know how many

1746
01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:10.590
times I've got a gondola with like three old and I call him God,
who was,

1747
01:38:10.591 --> 01:38:12.990
I'm sorry,
the lift.
You don't know how many,
what's the difference?

1748
01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.690
The Gondola has a hot and it's warm and you could smoke dope and air and people

1749
01:38:17.710 --> 01:38:20.610
still abroad as like a little house.
It's like a little house.

1750
01:38:20.611 --> 01:38:24.150
So you don't know how many times I swear to God I got an a gun onto it and you

1751
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:28.680
know,
hi,
I'm Brian.
I you mind?
No,
no,
no.
Come on in.
And where you guys from?
Texas.

1752
01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.620
Oh,
nice.
Where are you from?
Jersey.
Uh,

1753
01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.780
what do you got to do with doctors and all of a sudden right before you're ready

1754
01:38:33.781 --> 01:38:38.400
to tip off,
they're like,
do you mind if we spoke a joint?
You're like,
come on.

1755
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.490
Yeah,
we'll go to this bar.

1756
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.410
Sometimes they give you a money that's still going on like that.
People listen.

1757
01:38:43.411 --> 01:38:47.150
It's like anything else on vacation they go to lose their fucking,
yeah,

1758
01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.970
and by the way,
it's going to make it feel better.
You know,
pops rooms,

1759
01:38:50.971 --> 01:38:53.050
the mushrooms and they go to pray skiing,

1760
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:55.780
which you sit in the Jacuzzi and talk to people from five to seven.

1761
01:38:56.490 --> 01:38:59.780
I don't do that stuff even though he's really weird with educated.
He's,
no,
no,

1762
01:38:59.790 --> 01:39:02.870
not me.
I'm just saying that's what they do.
Attack you.

1763
01:39:02.871 --> 01:39:05.700
You skied till four and it's called apt.
Pray skin.

1764
01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:09.720
I pray skin is where people go and they mingle and they'd talk shit and they sit

1765
01:39:09.721 --> 01:39:12.810
around you and you have a waitress who comes and brings you drink.

1766
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:16.650
That's what I pray.
Scan is,
it's nothing bad.
I manage a Jacuzzi's or nothing,

1767
01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:19.110
but I like the skiing part.
You know,
I had a ski pass.

1768
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:22.740
I worked that I'm not in a Jacuzzi.
Yeah,
I worked at Mr Video,

1769
01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:27.360
so he gave me a ski pass so the video store wouldn't open until 12 so I would

1770
01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:30.780
hit the slopes from nine to about 1130 go home,
eat the sandwich and go to work.

1771
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.870
I had a three mountain slow,
I would never go to Ajax.

1772
01:39:33.871 --> 01:39:38.871
Ajax is like this dog that's not for Uncle Joey and you ate is like this with

1773
01:39:39.181 --> 01:39:41.280
lumps.
So you don't know what

1774
01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:46.190
is like this.
You'll like,
you know rock like you can't pass up.

1775
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:50.190
Hey Jackson is like this.
Like this mother motherfucker's locks.

1776
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:54.240
So people jump off the land type of shot.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1777
01:39:54.241 --> 01:39:58.830
I went one time and I thought,
stop this right now.
Get me back.
I'm going down.

1778
01:39:58.831 --> 01:40:02.550
I ain't,
I ain't afraid to tell you Aspen Mountain bike and ski and Snow Mass.

1779
01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:05.760
I was the king because have you ever seen videos of those guys going down the

1780
01:40:05.761 --> 01:40:08.430
side of a mountain and an avalanche is chase and I'm like,

1781
01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:15.820
whoa.
That's a fucking crazy thing to do with your time.
Joe Rogan.

1782
01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.510
One time I was living in Aspen,
I was planning a jewelry heist.

1783
01:40:18.511 --> 01:40:22.470
There was a jewelry store at Snowmass village for I destroyed the Snowmass

1784
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:26.910
village mall Christmas Eve.
If you can look up that paper,
look up,
uh,

1785
01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:31.980
Snowmass paper,
whatever it is,
1983 let,
why not?
It's 30 years ago.

1786
01:40:31.981 --> 01:40:35.310
It's going to be 30 fucking years because the statute of limitations run their

1787
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.070
stuff.
Fuck.
The statute of limitations ran out of meat bitch.
Right?

1788
01:40:38.071 --> 01:40:41.520
So I was up Aspen Mountain one night and I,
and I got kicked out.

1789
01:40:41.521 --> 01:40:44.850
I just started opening up doors and the next day in the paper,
Christmas Day,

1790
01:40:44.851 --> 01:40:48.510
they had a thing that said snow mass more burglarized Christmas Eve.

1791
01:40:48.511 --> 01:40:50.670
So I was like,
there's a jewelry store.
I'm gonna rob up there.

1792
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.980
They were up there for years.
I'm going to rob mother fuckers.
And at the

1793
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.790
<v 3>time I had the guy that I was an electrician.
I was a an apprentice electrician.</v>

1794
01:40:57.791 --> 01:40:58.630
I bet.
Uh,

1795
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I was a residential Wyman and I also bent pipe for the fucking to the commercial

1796
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:06.280
guys.
So I asked all your attrition is like,
Oh,

1797
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:10.690
can you help me fucking get this wire?
And so he looked at me,
he goes,

1798
01:41:10.691 --> 01:41:13.060
we can do it.
You could cut the wire and the alarm will go off.

1799
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.440
So the cops and they react to you.

1800
01:41:14.441 --> 01:41:18.140
So I had two weeks to go until I went back to Jersey and I went up there one
one,

1801
01:41:18.150 --> 01:41:21.130
then the blizzard.
It was a perfect man.
It's a fucking place.
It,

1802
01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.540
the cops can't get up to that to me.
I get up there and cut the fucking wire.

1803
01:41:25.541 --> 01:41:29.550
I break the glass and some may actually turn around and they see the cop cars,

1804
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:34.090
Audi's.
They had not outbeat sobs.
Sobs.
Then I seen the lights,

1805
01:41:34.091 --> 01:41:36.610
but then they didn't have the sirens,
but they were down away from me.

1806
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:39.880
They were down on what is just to show you how smart your brother,
Uncle Joey is.

1807
01:41:39.881 --> 01:41:42.640
They went down away from me.
So it's a blizzard.
They can't catch me.

1808
01:41:42.641 --> 01:41:46.030
So I put my hood on.
I didn't rob a jewelry store,
but they're coming.

1809
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:50.560
So I start running,
I start running,
I fucking fall down the slope.

1810
01:41:50.561 --> 01:41:53.560
I cut around.
There was,
you know,
back ways to get into my house.

1811
01:41:53.561 --> 01:41:57.220
I lived on day 12 Creekside I climb into the apartment,

1812
01:41:57.221 --> 01:41:58.840
I take my clothes off and fucking,

1813
01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:02.380
I'm sitting there and within an hour I got a knock on the door

1814
01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:07.540
and I opened the door.
It's two shirts and they're like,
hi,

1815
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:11.170
how are you doing that?
Have you seen anything suspicious?
And I'm like,
no,

1816
01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:14.710
not really.
No.
Like,
yeah,
somebody tried to rob the jewelry store.

1817
01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:17.230
Time me the fucking genius.

1818
01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:21.490
I walked in the snow and made a path right through my fucking door.

1819
01:42:21.670 --> 01:42:25.360
So the guy says to me,
you haven't been out all night.
And I'm like,
no,

1820
01:42:25.361 --> 01:42:29.050
I've been home all night watching TV.
And he's like,
who's boots are those?

1821
01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:32.860
And I looked down and you can see the snow falling off a melting,
right?
The heat.

1822
01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.310
And I'm like that my boots.
And they go,
so you haven't been out on?
I go,
no.

1823
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:39.790
I had to go out to the car to get the fucking cassette out of the car.
Whatever.

1824
01:42:39.791 --> 01:42:40.301
He goes.
Well,

1825
01:42:40.301 --> 01:42:44.350
it's funny cause the path and that jewelry store leads right to that fucking

1826
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:47.200
silly bitch.
They had me,
but they'd had no charges.

1827
01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:48.610
I met disappeared two weeks later.

1828
01:42:48.611 --> 01:42:51.430
So before the cops came knocking for me two weeks.

1829
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:53.650
It takes that long to bring you to court.
They had nothing.

1830
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.790
They had no fingerprints had.

1831
01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:58.210
They just had at the time there was about 20 fucking that they can't,

1832
01:42:58.211 --> 01:43:01.300
they hadn't mixed them in cutting the last time I'll get Barry Scheck.

1833
01:43:01.301 --> 01:43:04.090
They had no tools and nothing by the time that I remember for them to come in

1834
01:43:04.091 --> 01:43:06.250
your house,
unless you let them,
they have to have a warrant.

1835
01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:10.040
So they couldn't get you on just a footprint here to your house?
No,
I couldn't.

1836
01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.610
Cause I told him I went out to the car.
I couldn't mixed into somebody else.

1837
01:43:12.611 --> 01:43:14.920
What the fuck?
I get the fence list.
What the fuck dog.

1838
01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:17.980
Don't make me call Barry Shit.
You'll help clean with these footprints.

1839
01:43:17.981 --> 01:43:21.850
Were these lag time the footprints of snow had fallen over the silent night

1840
01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.870
still yet?
There was still over.

1841
01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.530
Oh no it doesn't.
It was depressing times for some reason.

1842
01:43:29.531 --> 01:43:33.130
We had a lot of people I themselves around Christmas song,
that song,

1843
01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.600
that's the fucking problem is,

1844
01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:39.280
is people that ice themselves around holidays is it just they don't feel loved

1845
01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:44.050
and they just get,
you know,
for some people the holidays,
a lot of pressure.

1846
01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:45.760
Somebody leaves somebody you're really love.

1847
01:43:45.761 --> 01:43:48.100
I mean there's a lot of that I wish in my life,

1848
01:43:48.101 --> 01:43:51.530
I got to love somebody that once they were gone I would die.
Like you hear like

1849
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.850
<v 5>a wife dies,
the husband dies all the time.
What happens all the time?</v>

1850
01:43:55.851 --> 01:43:57.110
Cause you're probably with my grandparents,

1851
01:43:57.111 --> 01:44:01.430
we talked about it yesterday actually.
It's very sad,
but I never thought about,

1852
01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.530
you know,
Joe and all this shit.
But I went through,

1853
01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.480
I had never thought about icing myself.

1854
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:08.750
I just always considered why Christmas though?

1855
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:13.160
It seems like those like high expectations of love and then you measure yourself

1856
01:44:13.161 --> 01:44:18.140
up to you.
Yeah.
This is,
especially in Ohio,

1857
01:44:18.141 --> 01:44:20.850
you can't usually can't leave the house because of the weather area.

1858
01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:24.440
You're broke and you have to buy something for your girlfriend and your mom and

1859
01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:27.360
you're just like,
how am I going to do this?
So you're working more trying to pay,

1860
01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:30.240
make up enough money to pay for it.
Yeah.
President.

1861
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.600
I remember when people would get Christmas jobs.
Yeah.

1862
01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.920
They would get extra jobs like high school,

1863
01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.400
like high school kids would get Christmas jobs.
I hate Christmas.
Yeah.

1864
01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:41.360
I can suppress a lot of pressure because I don't have a mother.

1865
01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.370
I don't give a fuck about gifts and all that shit.

1866
01:44:43.371 --> 01:44:46.430
I get depressed because you want her birth family members on my,
in fact,

1867
01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:47.920
my mother's birthday is ward in New York.

1868
01:44:47.921 --> 01:44:50.360
I've got to bring flowers for the fucking cemetery Friday morning.

1869
01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:53.810
Where's the cemetery?
Church.
We welcome.
And that's another thing,

1870
01:44:53.811 --> 01:44:56.870
especially when you live out here,
you can't see your family.

1871
01:44:56.871 --> 01:44:58.910
So you're sitting here by yourself and you don't have a girlfriend.

1872
01:44:58.911 --> 01:45:01.760
You're fucking sitting lean po,
I don't know,
like last two Christmases.
I bet.

1873
01:45:02.050 --> 01:45:03.950
Eight lean pockets,
you know,
instead of,
you know,

1874
01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:07.520
instead of fucking just go get some healthy food.
[inaudible].

1875
01:45:07.570 --> 01:45:10.010
It's like that even makes it worse.
Lean pockets.

1876
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:16.190
Even if I'm alone on Christmas,
not fuck a rock.
I got weed,
I got pot cookies,

1877
01:45:16.191 --> 01:45:19.490
I go to Boston market and get a Turkey with the stuffing of the trimmings.

1878
01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:21.170
The solely things you could do,

1879
01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.870
it's like I've really been fucking depressed on holidays,

1880
01:45:23.871 --> 01:45:26.030
but to the extent that like I'm going to kill myself,

1881
01:45:26.031 --> 01:45:27.640
but I don't have a fucking family.
You know,

1882
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:31.430
Christmas and your birthday is when you really think about your family.
You say,

1883
01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:34.340
you know,
before we came here tonight,
I did something.

1884
01:45:34.341 --> 01:45:36.440
I showed Joe and bread band,

1885
01:45:36.441 --> 01:45:39.380
my family in Cuba and I cried when I watched the video.

1886
01:45:39.381 --> 01:45:43.230
I never met these people go,
how would you feel?
Let's talk about if you will,

1887
01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.080
49 years old and you and your fucking cousins will come to hear the record,

1888
01:45:47.081 --> 01:45:49.700
an album,
Burbank.
And my uncle called me and he goes,

1889
01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:51.530
your cousins are coming from Cuba.
They want to meet you.

1890
01:45:51.531 --> 01:45:55.580
They've seen your movies and Cuba.
They watch youtube on Cuba.

1891
01:45:55.581 --> 01:45:59.900
So they wanted to meet me and they land at fucking lax.
And the driver says,

1892
01:45:59.901 --> 01:46:03.140
do you guys want to drive in La and see what La is about?
They go,
yeah,

1893
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:06.170
and they go on Melrose and my name is on the wall.

1894
01:46:06.171 --> 01:46:07.880
At the Improv to do is show that night,

1895
01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.290
want to tell me what the chances are again,
tell me what the chances are again.

1896
01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:16.040
And they stop and they go in and thank God Rita was there.
It really goes,

1897
01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:18.410
I know who Joey D is,
is a Rita called me.
She goes,

1898
01:46:18.411 --> 01:46:21.290
I'm standing around your cousins right now.
How amazing is that?

1899
01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.340
How fucking I'm coming out of a fucking podcast with Dunkin is something and the

1900
01:46:25.341 --> 01:46:27.620
band is amazing.
Both of them.

1901
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:33.230
And I fucking go to Hyundai and I meet them and one one side of the family's.

1902
01:46:33.231 --> 01:46:34.160
Why did it be him?

1903
01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:38.660
His sister is black and we go to canter's to eat while we're in Kansas.

1904
01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:39.441
Joe Rogan,
you know,

1905
01:46:39.441 --> 01:46:42.860
every morning I played music on Twitter and sometimes people give me shit,

1906
01:46:42.861 --> 01:46:45.110
you're a comedian.
I don't play the music for that.

1907
01:46:45.111 --> 01:46:47.150
I play the music because it's an energy.

1908
01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:52.080
I never knew it till I'm with my cousins.
They can't speak a word of English,

1909
01:46:52.410 --> 01:46:54.870
but they do the words to stay away to heaven.

1910
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.720
They knew the words to 38 what's that smell,

1911
01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:02.840
Mr. Saturday night when you seen Cuban people save the fucking words.

1912
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:06.720
They don't know what those words mean.
They told me they go,
let's sing.

1913
01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.800
They Sang Leonard Skinner had Saturday I special doll with the bees.

1914
01:47:11.801 --> 01:47:14.400
Don't know what Saturday night they don't know,

1915
01:47:14.401 --> 01:47:18.540
but it sounded like edit you beautiful.
They even did the guitars in the head.

1916
01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:22.050
Even that my cousin of black would even did the guitar.

1917
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:25.370
Let's play a little bit of them.
There's a guy and a girl.
There's two.

1918
01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:28.320
We'll first put the voc cause God damn,

1919
01:47:28.321 --> 01:47:30.670
this is like some rage against the machine.

1920
01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.800
Be Wild and this [inaudible] I got high with him,
right.
How has the lyrics,

1921
01:47:34.801 --> 01:47:37.500
I don't understand what they're saying when how has the great the great lyrics.

1922
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:41.580
It's just the revolution man.
And they sing about the revolution and be free.

1923
01:47:41.581 --> 01:47:45.870
And then I sat with them and they told me how they opened up for audio slave and

1924
01:47:45.871 --> 01:47:50.010
what they said fucking yes.
Nobody knows yes round about nobody.

1925
01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.180
[inaudible]

1926
01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:58.770
they sang that and that's what I had to go outside and smoke pot.
I was like,

1927
01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.570
so you guys just live off of American music and he at least fucking maggots put

1928
01:48:03.571 --> 01:48:07.710
it down and this and this to that.
There was everything.
Aubrey was at,
uh,

1929
01:48:07.711 --> 01:48:11.970
the black keys,
I guess he was in Austin.
The black keys are now and fucking,

1930
01:48:11.971 --> 01:48:13.740
he sent me a video from his iPhone.

1931
01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:18.980
They'll fucking places huge and it's packed and people are going fucking crazy

1932
01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:24.270
and the black keys are rocking out.
And I thought to myself,

1933
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:25.610
I don't remember who it was.
Yeah,

1934
01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:30.120
I think it might've been Doug Benson that told us that he saw them at a place

1935
01:48:30.121 --> 01:48:34.030
like in San Diego years ago and the places like half full.
Yeah.

1936
01:48:34.190 --> 01:48:38.370
And you know why they sold out Madison Square Garden in 15 minutes?
You know why?

1937
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:42.440
Because they're fucking Badass.
They're undeniable bad ass.

1938
01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.220
The only ones that are keeping it alive.
Right.
That's it.
Then the meal music.

1939
01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:52.200
That is real music.
There's no,
there's no horse shit,
not music,
man.
That's that.

1940
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:54.620
And there's a reason why they just exploded with it.

1941
01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:57.160
<v 6>All right,
so here's the joy ideas.
His cousin,
if you want to go on to youtube,</v>

1942
01:48:57.161 --> 01:49:01.870
it's a the letter x and in a space Alfonzo,
and that's a l,

1943
01:49:01.930 --> 01:49:04.510
F,
O,
n,
s,
o.

1944
01:49:04.630 --> 01:49:09.490
And this is the song called Vo and a c.
It's not ph.

1945
01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.130
It's not all phones with a penis.
Ff,

1946
01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.810
<v 5>by the way.
Yes,
we are going to buy some sophisticated equipment that allows us</v>

1947
01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:21.510
<v 8>defeat this straight through your stream.
Eventually</v>

1948
01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:26.550
<v 5>government,
fucking communist government.</v>

1949
01:49:26.551 --> 01:49:31.551
Let's do these mother fuckers [inaudible]

1950
01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.550
<v 4>translate.
I'll plot line if I tell you</v>

1951
01:49:56.770 --> 01:49:58.600
that I'm living out my fucking dream

1952
01:50:01.710 --> 01:50:06.680
culture of
all the fucking ankle.

1953
01:50:11.530 --> 01:50:15.310
I don't want things
that make her feel.

1954
01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:20.890
I don't know what the fuck
ass mother fucker.

1955
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:23.083
Oh yeah.

1956
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:29.850
Where do you stand in your [inaudible]?

1957
01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:46.750
They are fucking,

1958
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:51.220
<v 3>they opened up the audio slave.
They opened up the Ozo Motley.
Are they on iTunes?</v>

1959
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:52.390
They're on iTunes I think,

1960
01:50:52.391 --> 01:50:56.920
but the classic thing they did that fucking had me crying was when they told me

1961
01:50:56.921 --> 01:51:00.040
that Fidel's assistant went to them and said,
well,

1962
01:51:00.041 --> 01:51:04.150
we do the statue of John Lennon because Fidel had a vile of respect with John

1963
01:51:04.151 --> 01:51:08.590
when you know John Lennon was a half a cow be that guy used to beat the fuck out

1964
01:51:08.591 --> 01:51:12.400
of Yoko and his first wife.
He did.
Yeah.
He's a crazy motherfucker.
John Lennon.

1965
01:51:12.401 --> 01:51:15.430
John Lennon beat the fuck out of it was violent and shit.
He's crazy.

1966
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:17.970
What did you read this a long time?
A lot of people know he would,

1967
01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.240
he would give up like Hendrix,

1968
01:51:19.241 --> 01:51:21.040
you know Jimi Hendrix used a beat up his girlfriend.

1969
01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:25.280
They led you dudes are fucking nuts,
bro.
That was one of the things in,

1970
01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:28.000
I guess it was are you experienced one of the books where I was reading,

1971
01:51:28.090 --> 01:51:31.780
because I had a conversation about whether or not Jimmy Hendrix did heroin.

1972
01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:35.280
You know when everybody always say there was acid or was heroin and what,

1973
01:51:35.281 --> 01:51:37.150
what was it,
and I've always attributed heroin,

1974
01:51:37.151 --> 01:51:39.310
did great music and some people have corrected me.

1975
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:42.580
Then I found out that Jimmy Hendrix had tested,
uh,

1976
01:51:42.610 --> 01:51:46.150
who had been arrested for heroin in Toronto.
So it was like,
okay,
no,

1977
01:51:46.151 --> 01:51:47.290
he definitely did heroin,

1978
01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:51.280
but it apparently was after he had released all of his studio albums,

1979
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:56.140
that's when he started doing heroin.
And,
um,
in this story where this guy was,

1980
01:51:56.141 --> 01:51:59.050
uh,
one of his bandmates was talking,
you know,
describing their life.

1981
01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:01.750
One of the things was about Jimmy beating up one of his girlfriends.

1982
01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:04.840
And I read and I was like,
Whoa,
man,
that's fucked up like that.

1983
01:52:04.841 --> 01:52:05.890
I didn't want to believe that.

1984
01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:09.070
I don't want to believe that Jimi Hendrix is beating up his fucking girlfriend,

1985
01:52:09.071 --> 01:52:12.700
man.
You know,
after the Beatles,
John Lennon was fucking that animal.
I mean,

1986
01:52:12.701 --> 01:52:17.380
he was a coal rider of fame by David Bowie,
which is a bang and fucking song.

1987
01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:21.490
He was the co writer,
belly of the jets,
and he put an imaginary,
you know,

1988
01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.870
has all those great fucking songs on it.
I mean,
that,
that,

1989
01:52:23.871 --> 01:52:27.160
that imagine album was fucking deep with a deep,
uh,

1990
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.110
you gotta be crazy fucking subway.

1991
01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:33.220
I mean the Motherfucka lived at the Dakota in the middle of New York City and

1992
01:52:33.221 --> 01:52:37.570
walked around without a body guard.
Wow,
that's incredible.

1993
01:52:37.630 --> 01:52:42.630
Now your cousin's sister's also has her own shit and other bad ass musician and

1994
01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:47.420
your family and her name is m.
A.
E m.
E.
Alfonzo,

1995
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:51.200
<v 6>a.
L F.
O.
N.
S.
O.
N.
Like just in that,</v>

1996
01:52:51.201 --> 01:52:53.690
if you thought that shit was bad ass,
then you have this,

1997
01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:56.690
which is just even crate.
Her voice is amazing.

1998
01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:20.380
<v 8>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1999
01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:31.220
when they see me.

2000
01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:37.270
<v 5>So the flavor just runs in your whole entire family.
That's the valve,
that side.</v>

2001
01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:39.640
That's not the DS side.

2002
01:53:39.670 --> 01:53:42.910
The as is the rich from Cabo way cube where they would doctors,

2003
01:53:43.330 --> 01:53:46.630
the Valdez side is just too fucking overwhelming.
You know,

2004
01:53:46.631 --> 01:53:50.460
we sat a cancerous and they were telling me how would they see in me on the,

2005
01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:53.650
you know,
they love that Alex Jones thing.
Oh yeah.
People look up at subway a lot.

2006
01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:56.020
His job's Ezekial pilot.
They will fucking like,

2007
01:53:56.021 --> 01:53:58.720
they don't even know what I was saying,
but they knew I was going crazy.

2008
01:53:58.721 --> 01:53:59.501
But what they told me,

2009
01:53:59.501 --> 01:54:02.800
what they watched me on stage at the Improv and it killed me.

2010
01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:05.140
They said that you've never been around your family,

2011
01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:08.650
but you're then if you went back to Cuba,

2012
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:11.860
I got the middle of the of the house and started telling stories.

2013
01:54:11.861 --> 01:54:12.730
You be about that.

2014
01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:16.420
It's like they still get together and they went and visited my sister that I'd

2015
01:54:16.450 --> 01:54:18.520
never met.
You know when I left Cuba I was three.

2016
01:54:18.970 --> 01:54:21.610
I never really remembered her and she's 10 years older than me.

2017
01:54:21.611 --> 01:54:24.940
They told her my sister that they were going to find me when they came to the

2018
01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:25.774
fucking states,

2019
01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:30.190
so they just got back to Cuba and I just emailed them yesterday and I'm probably

2020
01:54:30.191 --> 01:54:33.250
going to talk to my sister for the first time next week since my mother did die.

2021
01:54:33.251 --> 01:54:37.080
That bite [inaudible] 79 that's pretty crazy.
I'm talking crazy,
but they're all,

2022
01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:41.020
you see their parents,
they're my second cousins.
My first cousins,

2023
01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.680
their father is also a big time Cuban musician.

2024
01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:47.980
He's got a house the government does in my house.
She's got surfboards,

2025
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:51.070
they give them fucking food,
you know,
he's fat.
And Mercury fill,

2026
01:54:51.071 --> 01:54:52.750
take good care of him,
you know?
But uh,

2027
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:57.250
it's amazing seeing those people because I never do with my family.
It was about,

2028
01:54:57.370 --> 01:55:01.060
I had no fucking idea.
And they will even like talk.
We're all musicians.

2029
01:55:01.090 --> 01:55:03.700
How the fuck did you end up with this?
How the fuck did you do this?

2030
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.990
But they all said,
you your grandfather,
your grandfather,

2031
01:55:06.991 --> 01:55:11.470
the same mother fucker even.
It's amazing.
Says you look like him,
your forehead,

2032
01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:16.130
your face,
and just your hustle.
The way he raised his kids.
I'm a valid,

2033
01:55:16.190 --> 01:55:18.460
so weird when you really see where you come from.

2034
01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:23.320
As much as I thought my mother was crazy.
They Valdez,
she stabbed the dude.

2035
01:55:23.321 --> 01:55:27.310
She had an alias and came to the states.
I didn't get social security alias.

2036
01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:31.810
Like red band has a stage name.
Yeah,
yeah man.
Fuck you.
And your stage name.

2037
01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:34.450
What's he on the bar in her aliens,
man.

2038
01:55:34.451 --> 01:55:37.070
She owned the business under her alias Sophia Cecilio.

2039
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:40.320
So when the people come and go and Sophia,
we go,
I don't know.
No fucking Sophie.

2040
01:55:40.321 --> 01:55:43.900
And My mother would call Bowlby,
hit me in the attic up for you.

2041
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:49.150
<v 3>Get it together like you're supposed to know that.
I didn't know that.</v>

2042
01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.370
Then I found out,
she's like,
when I'm at work,
you know I'm Sophia Cecilio.

2043
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:54.330
That's really funny.
But when my mother died,

2044
01:55:54.331 --> 01:55:57.060
I couldn't collect social security because she had never worked on the real

2045
01:55:57.061 --> 01:55:57.894
fucking name.

2046
01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.580
So she worked on the alias and have all those businesses on their alias.

2047
01:56:01.581 --> 01:56:03.630
So something always comes back to bite you.

2048
01:56:03.631 --> 01:56:07.170
But it's really weird when you put together your fucking family tree.

2049
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.460
Did you grow up being around your mom's bar?
All,
all every day.
Every day.

2050
01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.600
That's why I don't drink.
Really?
Yeah.
I don't drink because it was there for me.

2051
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:20.820
So from the time I was,
from the time I was three to 12 I was at the bar.

2052
01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:22.250
Every day really isn't.

2053
01:56:22.251 --> 01:56:27.251
It's a way to have kids like learn alcohol around it have around.

2054
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:30.430
So it's not some sacred thing that they can't get ahold of when I was having,

2055
01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:30.901
when they're young,

2056
01:56:30.901 --> 01:56:34.740
they're really telling him bottle of wines with the foot of fucking shit on it.

2057
01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:37.020
You know,
one of those want happy.
Okay.
Kathy,

2058
01:56:37.021 --> 01:56:40.220
when I was like for my mother told me a story that she was drinking thing and

2059
01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:44.490
after she went to bed I got up and drank half the bottle and she got up and

2060
01:56:44.491 --> 01:56:45.780
called the cops.
I was missing,

2061
01:56:46.210 --> 01:56:48.410
they couldn't find me like what the fuck is he go Quito.

2062
01:56:48.411 --> 01:56:51.870
And she called the cops and the cops found me in the closet with Bupa shit all

2063
01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:55.080
over me.
So after that dog,
there was no drinking from my ass.

2064
01:56:55.081 --> 01:56:56.880
You know what I'm saying?
That it was just no fucking drinking.

2065
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.890
I puked in a cab once when I was 14 oh my pal Jimmy lawless.

2066
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:05.490
We went to some party.
We're all listening to bad company drinking Jack Daniels.

2067
01:57:05.491 --> 01:57:07.200
We were like 14 drinking Jack Daniels.

2068
01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:11.700
Not having any clue as to how much I could drink.
Just completely experimenting,

2069
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:16.830
hammered,
stumbling into things,
man,
boy,
but I was a mess back then.

2070
01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.860
I when I look back and I'm like so grateful that anybody was willing to be my

2071
01:57:19.861 --> 01:57:24.180
friend.
I look back when I was young,
you know?
Do you ever do that?

2072
01:57:24.181 --> 01:57:26.130
Like look back when you were young going,
God,

2073
01:57:26.131 --> 01:57:30.050
imagine if I had to be my friend when I was 14 and then you have that.

2074
01:57:30.051 --> 01:57:32.800
The reporter can't.
That guy we were talking about today,
the interview has,

2075
01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:36.240
he has his own podcast.
He's 13 and that kid's got his shit together.

2076
01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:41.760
He's a little band,
you know,
he's beautiful.
He's a prodigy.
Yeah,
that's his name.

2077
01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:46.890
That reporter kid toward a kid on Twitter and fucking kids.
Time for him.

2078
01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:50.190
Then when you open yourself up to a million dudes going to ask you to be on

2079
01:57:50.191 --> 01:57:53.970
their podcast,
hey,
I did because that kit's cool,
bro.

2080
01:57:53.971 --> 01:57:58.380
I do hit me up and I'll do the podcast.
You know,
if I have time,

2081
01:57:58.381 --> 01:58:01.740
I'll try to do it in day and I tried to help to out every week,

2082
01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:04.670
but like I have some people that contact me for Saturdays or Sundays.

2083
01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.130
I can't do it on Saturdays and Sundays during the fucking week,
you know?

2084
01:58:08.131 --> 01:58:11.250
Now people hit me up.
Can you do my pockets at nine o'clock at night?

2085
01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.290
You don't want me at the house at nine o'clock at night.

2086
01:58:13.291 --> 01:58:16.440
I'm smoked 80 fucking joints.
I'm burned the fuck out by nine o'clock.

2087
01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:18.370
Catch me early.
You know what I'm saying?
Cock.

2088
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:20.310
And when are you at your best in the day?

2089
01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.360
6:00 AM 6:00 AM 6:00 AM is when I'm throwing heat giggling by myself.

2090
01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.290
Fucking habits.
When you're tweeting and all the best music.
Oh please.

2091
01:58:28.291 --> 01:58:31.710
I get so fucking fired up in the morning.
Stolen when I hit that first bond.

2092
01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:34.950
Lately I've been doing this in the morning just to keep it live.

2093
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:37.710
Then this vapor fucks me up in the morning,

2094
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:41.410
but it doesn't fuck me up in the afternoon.
So it's like,
that's a Tiva for me.

2095
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:42.070
I always

2096
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.230
<v 5>smoke it early in the morning and then have to like to,</v>

2097
01:58:44.231 --> 01:58:46.310
I've got to go back to the fucking heavy duty boy.

2098
01:58:46.311 --> 01:58:47.970
That was the last time you took a day off a week.

2099
01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:52.240
Do you ever do that two days before the surgery?
Yeah,
I'll try.

2100
01:58:52.330 --> 01:58:55.450
Oh two days before then I went off for a week.
I went off for a weekend.

2101
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:59.200
Like December.
Yeah,
you have to,
you have to,
you know this date.
Listen,

2102
01:58:59.410 --> 01:59:02.050
every day I wake up and I'm like,
today I'm not going to smoke,

2103
01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:05.560
but I wake up and my house is like a fucking opium den.
I got bongs,

2104
01:59:05.561 --> 01:59:09.730
I got the devices I got,
you know,
so you like I opened up my draw.

2105
01:59:09.731 --> 01:59:10.630
I've got a computer,

2106
01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:16.060
I find loose joints and containers and hash and I find I have so much shit at

2107
01:59:16.061 --> 01:59:18.550
the house.
So this day is like if I'm going to the doctor,

2108
01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:22.450
I don't want my blood pressure.
I won't smoke till two or three weeks.

2109
01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:25.090
I'd go on there just to give you a blood pressure fucking break.
You know,

2110
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.790
there's days you got on the one on one and I've got to get high as soon as

2111
01:59:27.791 --> 01:59:31.840
possible.
You know,
like there's some days I got to get fucking high as possible,

2112
01:59:31.841 --> 01:59:33.770
bro.
You driving around the one on one or something,

2113
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:37.810
you get so frustrated in traffic.
I never seen anybody get more frustrated.
Oh No,

2114
01:59:37.811 --> 01:59:40.440
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's not worth the aggravation in life.

2115
01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:41.730
<v 2>This is my proposal.</v>

2116
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.710
Let's all get a series of houses together somewhere in Colorado.
Done.

2117
01:59:47.010 --> 01:59:48.430
Let's do it.
I'll buy it.

2118
01:59:48.490 --> 01:59:50.560
<v 5>No,
you don't have to become the landlord.
No,
no.</v>

2119
01:59:50.561 --> 01:59:53.440
You don't have to buy a fucking around.
I buy a whole box is broken.

2120
01:59:53.441 --> 01:59:54.970
It's not going to fucking go,

2121
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:57.430
so I'm going to have to deal with a reluctant witness,

2122
01:59:57.950 --> 02:00:00.670
listen to them and the victus Rogan.
At the end of the day,

2123
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.910
<v 2>she's going to have to realize that California is not going to get any better.</v>

2124
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.050
It's going to get more and more overpopulated.

2125
02:00:06.670 --> 02:00:10.150
Traffic is more and more she hasn't done well.
There's some complaints for sure.

2126
02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:12.670
There's,
first of all,
when you're dealing with this amount of people,

2127
02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:15.460
there's always going to deal with a massive amount of traffic and potential for

2128
02:00:15.461 --> 02:00:19.540
crime and you know,
Shit,
just shit along those lines.
You know,
car accidents,

2129
02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:24.250
drunk drivers,
texting,
people being fast and rude.
There's lake way more fast.

2130
02:00:24.251 --> 02:00:29.251
Cars is way more of that in a big city than there is in a small town.

2131
02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:32.850
<v 5>Yeah.
But where you move vicious Rogan before you took her out of the loop,</v>

2132
02:00:33.450 --> 02:00:35.370
you took around a civilization.
You can't do that.

2133
02:00:35.970 --> 02:00:39.790
<v 2>See that's the,
yeah,
that's the problem.
[inaudible] married is it?</v>

2134
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:43.120
If it was just up to me,
I'd be living in like Batman either.

2135
02:00:43.210 --> 02:00:46.710
I drive up to the fucking cave and the little walls would open up and I'd go

2136
02:00:46.711 --> 02:00:48.570
inside and,
and I'd be somewhere.

2137
02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.410
If my house would just clearly reflected my first shore,

2138
02:00:52.411 --> 02:00:57.411
I'd be living in the mountains 100% I would have some crazy ass military style

2139
02:00:57.691 --> 02:01:01.110
Humvee that could just get through any kind of snow so I could get home no

2140
02:01:01.111 --> 02:01:04.080
matter what.
And that's what I would drive in the winter period.

2141
02:01:04.110 --> 02:01:05.100
And I would dealt with,

2142
02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:07.890
I would relish that and I would just deal with the fact that it's going to be

2143
02:01:07.891 --> 02:01:11.130
some times where you're stuck.
There's going to be,
some times we get snowed in,

2144
02:01:11.131 --> 02:01:11.580
there's going to be,

2145
02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:15.540
sometimes we're going to have to fucking shoot a shotgun off to get a bear off

2146
02:01:15.541 --> 02:01:16.860
your back porch.
You know

2147
02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:17.311
<v 5>those,</v>

2148
02:01:17.311 --> 02:01:20.340
you know that Galong as you know that going as long as you know that you live

2149
02:01:20.341 --> 02:01:24.000
like a doomsday prepper operators.
That shit.
I would watch that show.
What is it?

2150
02:01:24.210 --> 02:01:28.350
Doomsday preppers.
I'm discovering now.
You got to start watching my feet.

2151
02:01:29.050 --> 02:01:30.560
Yes you do.
Yes you do.

2152
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:33.990
About people that are get ready for the apocalypse needs current people that get

2153
02:01:33.991 --> 02:01:38.160
ready for fuck it.
Economic downfall of the country.
It's for people.

2154
02:01:38.161 --> 02:01:39.980
It's fucking crazy.
Joe Rogan,
they

2155
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.843
<v 3>build fluff.</v>

2156
02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:46.460
You have to know you the IRS to see how the crazy world I've you really,

2157
02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:51.940
I know people that are doing that,
man.
I know people don't get house.

2158
02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:54.890
They have a thing outside their house and under water

2159
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:58.850
<v 2>ground rather bunker out in the desert out near Palm Springs.</v>

2160
02:01:58.851 --> 02:02:01.550
There's like a place where you pay and you could buy like an underground

2161
02:02:01.551 --> 02:02:05.600
apartment,
like several layers deep under the ground,
like,

2162
02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:07.040
like floors deep

2163
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:09.470
<v 3>and just talking on food.
They're stocking on web.</v>

2164
02:02:09.471 --> 02:02:11.060
I don't want to live if it gets to that,

2165
02:02:11.061 --> 02:02:15.020
this fucking guy had the nuclear bomb hits and 90% of us are dead.

2166
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:17.250
I hope I'm in the 90.
[inaudible] let's,

2167
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:18.760
let's see what comes with that fucking look.

2168
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:21.500
I'll be in the weaves store with the bomblets and when I walk out,

2169
02:02:21.501 --> 02:02:24.620
everybody's dead except me.
I'm walking around like fucking I am legend.
Like,

2170
02:02:24.630 --> 02:02:25.250
well,

2171
02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:27.740
you know what's really fucked up that I've been trying to wrap my head around

2172
02:02:27.741 --> 02:02:29.750
lately?
I mean something that I've always known.

2173
02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:34.700
<v 2>Can I take a little smoke break?
Go ahead.
What were you saying?
Um,
you know,</v>

2174
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:37.400
something I've been thinking about lately that I've been trying to wrap my head

2175
02:02:37.401 --> 02:02:41.540
around,
but it's really hard to,
you remember that,
um,
uh,
Crosby,

2176
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:45.560
stills and Nash Song,
a Woodstock.
It goes,

2177
02:02:45.561 --> 02:02:49.880
we stop,
we go,
we are star dust.

2178
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:50.930
We are golden.

2179
02:02:50.931 --> 02:02:54.950
We are billion year old carbon and we'd got to get ourselves back to the garden.

2180
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:59.090
The,
you know,
I always like would listen to that and go,
wow,
what a cool lyric.

2181
02:02:59.091 --> 02:03:00.200
We are,
star us.

2182
02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:04.310
And then as I got older I actually like did a little bit of research on,

2183
02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.730
on the carbon based life forms and really like the,

2184
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:12.140
the elements that are needed to create human beings actually come from stars.

2185
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:15.020
Like we really are exploded stars.

2186
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:19.940
Like how fucked is that that you take?
This is the most hilarious,

2187
02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.660
like I'm talking and you hear that.

2188
02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:26.510
<v 3>Yeah.
It's like a Cheech and Chong album he took,</v>

2189
02:03:26.511 --> 02:03:30.360
this starts from the skies.
We're talking about stars me,
but a human being,
I

2190
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:33.030
<v 2>literally cannot exist until a star explodes.</v>

2191
02:03:33.210 --> 02:03:37.440
And then I believe that's probably the next cycle that human beings make.

2192
02:03:37.441 --> 02:03:41.310
The stars explode all over again.
That we,
we,
we,
we get no fucking nutty.

2193
02:03:41.311 --> 02:03:44.910
Like we're doing with this Japanese thing where we have these fucking huge

2194
02:03:44.911 --> 02:03:48.570
nuclear power plants that can't be shut off or whether it's something else that

2195
02:03:48.571 --> 02:03:52.110
we're creating,
like the large Hadron collider or the next level shit,

2196
02:03:52.111 --> 02:03:55.920
anti matter experiments,
whatever.
Fucking crazy.

2197
02:03:56.010 --> 02:04:00.480
The thing that the half life video games style shit that they're actually

2198
02:04:00.481 --> 02:04:02.550
working on right now other than not telling us about.

2199
02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.270
I think that's probably the reason why human beings exist.

2200
02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:08.280
I think that's what we do by the word,

2201
02:04:08.281 --> 02:04:11.490
the end of the line before we blow the whole thing up and it starts all over

2202
02:04:11.491 --> 02:04:16.170
again and then it has to become stars and stars has to explode and that has to

2203
02:04:16.171 --> 02:04:19.560
create certain elements and then those elements have to combine and they have to

2204
02:04:19.561 --> 02:04:22.590
be water and next thing you know there's life and then that life has to evolve

2205
02:04:22.770 --> 02:04:25.620
and get more and more complex and figure more shut out until boom,

2206
02:04:25.621 --> 02:04:28.770
it blows things up all over debt.
Is that possible?
It seems like,

2207
02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:32.610
it seems like that really might be what it is.
It sounds ridiculous,

2208
02:04:32.611 --> 02:04:35.310
but it might be really what it is.
Star dust,

2209
02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:39.510
you need started to explode to make a person what the fuck sounds like a

2210
02:04:39.511 --> 02:04:44.340
hallmark card,
doesn't it?
Yes.
You need to start to explore to make you,

2211
02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:45.171
I mean,

2212
02:04:45.171 --> 02:04:49.740
it really is impossible to wrap your head around the amount of time involved in

2213
02:04:49.741 --> 02:04:52.410
all that.
It's impossible.
It's impossible to,

2214
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:56.340
to put it into perspective where what you're saying is not just some abstract

2215
02:04:56.341 --> 02:04:57.230
noise,
you know,

2216
02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.470
especially me because of my limited amount of education and it comes to

2217
02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:04.200
astronomy and astrology and stars and I mean,

2218
02:05:04.201 --> 02:05:07.650
everything I've known about it is just from watching documentaries and reading

2219
02:05:07.651 --> 02:05:08.730
stuff and from books.

2220
02:05:08.731 --> 02:05:11.810
I'm never really formally studied it in college or anything along,
you know,
the,

2221
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:14.430
the brightest astronomers and of the world or anything like that.

2222
02:05:14.431 --> 02:05:16.560
So when I talk about it,
it's so abstract.

2223
02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:20.060
<v 5>Well,
you don't need to,
you can put two and two together and have your own,
uh,</v>

2224
02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:23.330
take out what really happened that we all feel something different happen when

2225
02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:26.100
you know nobody fucking actually knows.
Nobody fucking knows.

2226
02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:29.750
Nobody fucking knows they can sit here.
Books are telescopes.

2227
02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:31.870
Nobody fucking knows what happened.
Where are we here?

2228
02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.620
We just have ideas of what was there before they found the fucking to,

2229
02:05:35.621 --> 02:05:37.080
to the fucking thing in Montana.

2230
02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:41.370
So obviously there was water in Montana 300,000 years ago.
That's all we know.

2231
02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:44.850
We can make a hypothesis from all we know,
but nobody fucking knows.
Nobody know.

2232
02:05:44.851 --> 02:05:47.340
If God created,
nobody knows these created by Adam's.

2233
02:05:47.341 --> 02:05:50.550
Nobody gives a fucking stock graded and they'll be willing to double block came

2234
02:05:50.551 --> 02:05:53.760
down from the fucking stars and made it with a chicken and a fucking sprinkle

2235
02:05:53.761 --> 02:05:57.480
things on the water.
How they say in Santa Rita every fucking week is different,

2236
02:05:57.730 --> 02:05:59.460
you know,
whether it's Adam's whatever.

2237
02:05:59.790 --> 02:06:03.030
It's very interesting and we each have our own fucking take on it,
you know?

2238
02:06:03.031 --> 02:06:07.700
And nobody's right and nobody's fucking wrong,
right or wrong.
Nobody's right.

2239
02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.150
Nobody's fucking impossible

2240
02:06:09.150 --> 02:06:13.650
<v 2>to know.
I think it's really fascinating though.
It seems like what human,</v>

2241
02:06:13.651 --> 02:06:14.640
the human race is,

2242
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:19.560
is a race that woke up in the middle of something in the middle of an adventure.

2243
02:06:19.590 --> 02:06:22.260
That's what I feel like since we all have these temporary lives,

2244
02:06:22.261 --> 02:06:26.040
but yet we're all connected to the lives and to the actions of everyone that

2245
02:06:26.041 --> 02:06:27.780
came before us and everyone that's around us.

2246
02:06:27.930 --> 02:06:31.740
It really is like we're waking up in the middle of a journey like we are.

2247
02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:34.740
I mean that there's any analogy that I've used before that were on a star ship

2248
02:06:34.741 --> 02:06:38.160
and we woke up four minutes before we slam into a planet and they're like,
wait,

2249
02:06:38.161 --> 02:06:40.050
what's going on here?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?

2250
02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:43.530
We are riding the momentum of all these people that have existed before us,

2251
02:06:43.531 --> 02:06:47.010
but we didn't study what they study.
We didn't follow what they followed.

2252
02:06:47.011 --> 02:06:50.640
We didn't learn what went through their mind to get to their conclusions were

2253
02:06:50.641 --> 02:06:53.880
just riding on their innovation.
We're riding on their,
their,

2254
02:06:53.881 --> 02:06:57.600
their experiments and the results of them and their inventions,

2255
02:06:57.620 --> 02:06:59.820
their electricity,
their cars,
their airplanes.

2256
02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:02.850
We're riding on all their shit and we're just keeping it moving in the same

2257
02:07:02.851 --> 02:07:05.970
direction.
I kind of feel like that's a natural thing.

2258
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.600
I got to feel like that's when I look at all the other life forms on earth and

2259
02:07:09.601 --> 02:07:13.020
everything destructive or constructive that they do from building dams,

2260
02:07:13.021 --> 02:07:16.380
to creating beehives,
whatever the fuck they do,
it's all natural.

2261
02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:19.860
And so why would we assume that what we're doing is not the same?

2262
02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:23.160
Why wouldn't we assume that the reason why we're so conflicted and weird is

2263
02:07:23.161 --> 02:07:27.360
because that's the proper mechanism that needs to be in place for people to move

2264
02:07:27.361 --> 02:07:29.550
forward in the direction that we're moving forward.
It'd be,

2265
02:07:29.551 --> 02:07:34.551
they'd be constantly chasing technology without any real clear sort of a

2266
02:07:34.810 --> 02:07:38.680
rational approach to using our resources and looking at the problems that we

2267
02:07:38.681 --> 02:07:42.760
have because we're like a bunch of little kids that have like shit all over

2268
02:07:42.761 --> 02:07:47.080
their house,
but instead we're,
we're outside working on the garden.
You know,

2269
02:07:47.081 --> 02:07:47.861
we're planting trees.

2270
02:07:47.861 --> 02:07:50.560
We're not cleaning up the shit that we piled up in the middle of the living room

2271
02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:53.650
and it keeps piling up every day and to the point where we can't even live in

2272
02:07:53.651 --> 02:07:56.680
our house anymore and we're concentrating on some shit that's not even ours.

2273
02:07:56.740 --> 02:07:59.990
<v 6>Do you think you could ever live,
you probably couldn't,
but maybe in your,</v>

2274
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:02.720
maybe say like if you didn't have kids in the big families,

2275
02:08:02.721 --> 02:08:06.100
like do you think you could ever live in like one of those stream that trailers

2276
02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.200
by myself?
Fuck yeah.
Cause I was recently,

2277
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:11.290
recently went to Joshua tree and one of those and I was thinking like really

2278
02:08:11.291 --> 02:08:14.920
this is all I really need and I can take my whole fucking house anywhere I want

2279
02:08:14.921 --> 02:08:16.580
and the new ones have like nice woods

2280
02:08:16.650 --> 02:08:21.620
<v 2>floors and have some of expand out.
You know there's,
there's been um,</v>

2281
02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:22.290
you know,

2282
02:08:22.290 --> 02:08:26.190
a lot of people that are moving towards minimalist house is really small houses.

2283
02:08:26.490 --> 02:08:27.151
Like there's a bunch of,

2284
02:08:27.151 --> 02:08:30.270
of all online that show like how certain people live and it's kind of

2285
02:08:30.271 --> 02:08:30.751
interesting,

2286
02:08:30.751 --> 02:08:33.420
you know like one guy figured out a way to have like this little tiny cooking

2287
02:08:33.421 --> 02:08:36.120
area and he pulls the bed out in the bed,

2288
02:08:36.121 --> 02:08:38.970
comes out of the wall and lives by himself and he has like some storage up in

2289
02:08:38.971 --> 02:08:42.000
top like toilet paper and things along those lines.
But it's a tiny,

2290
02:08:42.001 --> 02:08:42.900
tiny little house.

2291
02:08:42.901 --> 02:08:46.500
And a little kitchen dinette area and you know the ideas that like,
really,

2292
02:08:46.530 --> 02:08:50.040
why do we have to have this giant fucking footprint of House that we live in?

2293
02:08:50.041 --> 02:08:50.740
You know,
and yeah,

2294
02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:54.190
<v 5>and these guys are getting paid.
Bitch,
if I want to live in a fucking cell,</v>

2295
02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:57.460
I'm living a fucking sound like a monkey.
I'm going to live on a fault up bed.

2296
02:08:57.640 --> 02:08:58.590
Like I'm James Bond.

2297
02:08:58.591 --> 02:09:01.270
Like some fucking Puerto Rican that gets a check on the fifth.

2298
02:09:01.271 --> 02:09:04.570
Go Fuck your mother.
If you got paid,
you live in a fucking house.

2299
02:09:04.690 --> 02:09:07.930
I'm going to live in a Mike Rowe fucking out.
What?
A little kitchen to cook.

2300
02:09:07.931 --> 02:09:10.900
Like I got a black guy bagging me in the fucking ass.
I don't need that.

2301
02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:14.860
You spread out even me.
I'm no millionaire.
I've got a big fucking kitchen,

2302
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:17.110
a micro house.
What are you fucking people talking about?

2303
02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:20.110
I just not thought of his dog.
You can't take me into those deep waters.

2304
02:09:20.111 --> 02:09:24.250
Like [inaudible] Rica fucking killed my brother right now.

2305
02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:28.030
A fucking house with a bed upside down.
Fuck that shit.

2306
02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:30.670
I'm trying to save vantage.
You.
Fuck you.
You get paid.

2307
02:09:30.671 --> 02:09:33.940
You fucking live like a normal person.
Go to Trump and say,
hey wig.

2308
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:37.300
Moving to a fucking thing to say about it to see if you don't slap you.

2309
02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:40.630
If you don't have a Russian bitch slapping in the fucking mouth was fired.

2310
02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:44.020
The fuck are these people,
micro houses in the fucking desert.

2311
02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:47.980
You play it out to the world that like a doctor like a doctor.

2312
02:09:47.981 --> 02:09:50.530
You live your fucking life.
You're right.
Dooms Day.

2313
02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:54.670
I'm going to put a can of tomato soup under my span is the wait for the Martian

2314
02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:56.380
to come.
When it's over,
it's over.

2315
02:09:56.381 --> 02:09:59.350
You got one day when your Dick out and you take your fucking chances like a man.

2316
02:09:59.530 --> 02:10:03.280
I'm gonna live like I fucking old.
$20 to a bookmaker downstairs in my house.

2317
02:10:03.610 --> 02:10:07.370
Get the fuck out of my face.
I want to live in one.
This out there are struggling.

2318
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:10.780
Brian's down.
Joey's not.
I think we have a real clear line.

2319
02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:14.720
<v 6>See me feel like you're in one.
When you're in there,
it's,
it's,
it's pretty</v>

2320
02:10:14.850 --> 02:10:18.630
<v 5>until somebody farts and you're in full fucking speak Fisa and you're like,</v>

2321
02:10:18.631 --> 02:10:22.770
I paid $10,000 so I can smell your asshole.
Get the fuck Outta here.

2322
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:25.180
Cause everything's great in a small space.
They'll,

2323
02:10:25.190 --> 02:10:26.720
somebody blows a fucking floor.

2324
02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:30.030
You will walk into a bathroom at some of the Oh shit fucking bothers you.

2325
02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:33.000
Even if they're your mother,
you look at them like you dirty fucking Dicks,

2326
02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:36.350
a candle,
something.
Even if you,
you don't want to sell,
you don't want to live.

2327
02:10:36.351 --> 02:10:40.340
Nothing small.
Fuck that Shit Bro.
Especially,
I'm never home though.
You know,

2328
02:10:40.341 --> 02:10:43.160
like I worked so much I,
I'm never hide.
You always fucking call.

2329
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:46.100
I'm home to sleep.
And here's a technical question.
When you light a fire,

2330
02:10:46.130 --> 02:10:48.830
when a match in a bathroom,
after someone took a shit,

2331
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:53.660
does it burn up all the methane in the air or does just the smell of the mache

2332
02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:55.780
mask?
What am I smelling?
Not a science guy.

2333
02:10:57.020 --> 02:11:01.150
Covers candle just covers this.
Now is that all of this,

2334
02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:05.090
I can be completely wrong,
but that's what I always thought.
No,

2335
02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:08.540
I get good candles or air wick ones and I like to have them.

2336
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:11.150
I like one when I go into this shit cause it's fucking Blab,

2337
02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:13.670
a backroom and a half.
I like how Joe Rogan loose.

2338
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.850
If you don't have a bathroom and a half,
you're missing out on fucking life.

2339
02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:17.720
That's what I'm dealing with.

2340
02:11:17.721 --> 02:11:21.020
Have one big back room and that's where your girl goes and puts her makeup on

2341
02:11:21.230 --> 02:11:23.480
and you tell the bitch,
listen,
you see that little corner right there?

2342
02:11:23.481 --> 02:11:27.650
It's a toilet in three feet of fucking area.
That's my shit back.
Yeah.

2343
02:11:27.651 --> 02:11:31.920
That's why shit and let my balls out of the sink and I fucking pop pimples.

2344
02:11:31.921 --> 02:11:35.210
I might nut sack and I fucking whatever you're on the phone,

2345
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:37.100
they got you jerk off material.

2346
02:11:37.190 --> 02:11:41.240
You know there's all these things that people are successful and they miss and

2347
02:11:41.241 --> 02:11:44.420
it's always bothered me.
Like if I was filthy rich,
I wouldn't get a car,

2348
02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:47.390
get a ritual and have motherfuckers drive me around.

2349
02:11:47.391 --> 02:11:51.830
That's [inaudible] can have a limo or you're going to fucking little trends

2350
02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:54.450
driving you around.
Yeah.

2351
02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:59.340
You sharpen a premiere with a ritual.
A ritual.

2352
02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:02.030
You show up in a premier with a ritual like what?
Bitch?

2353
02:12:02.190 --> 02:12:03.500
Everybody shows up when their limo,

2354
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:06.260
you've got a little fucking guy that's sweating to death.
You come on,

2355
02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:09.260
they shit that you need that people don't talk about when you feel bad for that

2356
02:12:09.261 --> 02:12:11.660
dude,
I don't.
As long as I'm getting,
as long as he's getting paid.

2357
02:12:11.661 --> 02:12:14.900
If you weren't billions and you tell a guy looking at at night,

2358
02:12:14.901 --> 02:12:18.000
you're going to drive from fucking north Hollywood,
the San Diego.

2359
02:12:18.001 --> 02:12:18.780
He's going to be all around,

2360
02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:21.110
but they could tell you about if you are an MMA fighter,

2361
02:12:21.111 --> 02:12:23.210
that would be a great fucking training,

2362
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:25.100
a great night of conditioning for your legs.

2363
02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:28.760
You can really get some good conditioning.
They still have dumb shit like that.

2364
02:12:28.761 --> 02:12:32.150
Like they have a people who will own that.
They still remember that business.

2365
02:12:32.151 --> 02:12:35.090
They started in Hollywood where if you didn't want to drive drunk,

2366
02:12:35.091 --> 02:12:38.270
somebody would pick you up on a motor scooter and they have all these.

2367
02:12:38.271 --> 02:12:39.410
Do you want to drive drunk?

2368
02:12:39.411 --> 02:12:41.670
Some of them pick you up at the school if you didn't want.

2369
02:12:41.930 --> 02:12:45.350
Like they have all these little fucking only weren't,
they try shit like that,

2370
02:12:45.351 --> 02:12:48.690
but that's what,
he's smart and they take you home and it's cheaper than a cab.

2371
02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:52.040
Is there things you miss out on?
Like if I was fucking filthy rich,

2372
02:12:52.041 --> 02:12:55.460
I have a big back room just for myself when I'm a day and have one of those

2373
02:12:55.461 --> 02:12:59.300
Japanese things where the water comes out,
washes your ass hole for you.

2374
02:12:59.301 --> 02:13:01.190
What would you have in your fucking back room?

2375
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:05.770
That's success having shit that me having an iPhone that don't do dick for me.

2376
02:13:05.771 --> 02:13:09.080
You know?
And if you are one machine gun,
yeah,

2377
02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:13.250
an iPhone that turns into a machine,
that's fucking what I want.

2378
02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:14.270
You did this to him.

2379
02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:19.100
You know what happened that we found out how much weed it takes before Joey

2380
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:23.890
snuffs in the Bryan and he picks up Brian's energy.
Yeah,

2381
02:13:23.891 --> 02:13:28.190
you're beyond that,
but I've never heard you go that deep into the crazy ball.
Oh,

2382
02:13:28.191 --> 02:13:31.010
please.
I went to the bottom of the bowl and you're just scraping the,

2383
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:33.900
I'm telling you dog amount of broken pieces of pasta off the bottom.

2384
02:13:33.901 --> 02:13:37.890
I got my fucking tape.
Some of the crazy ball.
No,
but it's all the shit we do.

2385
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:42.540
We don't focus on like to be the best part of me living as that little back of

2386
02:13:42.541 --> 02:13:46.740
my head.
That's my world and I hate fucking minutes.
That's my word of Japanese.

2387
02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:50.330
Don't we shitting in my toilet.
I'm one of those guys.
Don't shit my toy.

2388
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.980
Don't piss up bucket strangle you.
That's what I'm going.
James Brown,

2389
02:13:52.981 --> 02:13:54.120
when he got arrested by the cops,

2390
02:13:54.130 --> 02:13:56.850
remember it was shooting at the cops high speed chase.

2391
02:13:56.851 --> 02:13:59.340
They blew out his tires because he came out with a shotgun.

2392
02:13:59.341 --> 02:14:02.470
Some dude was using his bathroom.
He went crazy.
Oh Bro.

2393
02:14:02.471 --> 02:14:05.480
That's some do use respect to do.
Took a shit and James Brown's draft,

2394
02:14:06.630 --> 02:14:09.050
somebody comes to the house and dumps a Douche in your bathroom,

2395
02:14:09.090 --> 02:14:12.000
like ate up the shoot that day that the shooting.

2396
02:14:12.190 --> 02:14:14.730
You know what comes out of tape ass?
That's tear gas.

2397
02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:17.370
You imagine the tape melting your fucking toilet with that way.

2398
02:14:17.371 --> 02:14:19.950
Fucking protein ass.
That's terrible.

2399
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:23.080
<v 6>I have,
I have one bathroom.
It's right next to my bedroom.</v>

2400
02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:27.520
Anytime I have a new girl come over even or an ex girlfriend or girlfriend at

2401
02:14:27.521 --> 02:14:28.270
the time,

2402
02:14:28.270 --> 02:14:32.110
like you sitting there and she's trying to cover up the sound with the water and

2403
02:14:32.111 --> 02:14:36.190
the humming and whatever she's trying to do to make and you just hear like a

2404
02:14:36.191 --> 02:14:40.300
plop and you're just like,
ah.
It's the,
the,
the grossest thing ever.

2405
02:14:40.301 --> 02:14:44.410
And I think living with one bathroom is one of the worst things in the whole

2406
02:14:44.411 --> 02:14:48.330
entire,
I hate to,
I hate it.
I fucking I my elbow,
it's gross.

2407
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:52.830
I well my own bathroom,
I got my little shit at my own toilet paper.
Magazines.

2408
02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:54.630
That's it.
I need to fucking move on.

2409
02:14:54.970 --> 02:14:59.190
<v 5>Even when you touch a magazine,
reading it with their Shitty fucking hell,</v>

2410
02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.920
like the shitty that's well touched.
Nothing.
I don't like shit in people's,

2411
02:15:02.921 --> 02:15:03.940
I don't like shooting an episode.

2412
02:15:04.210 --> 02:15:06.220
I had to shit bet on that flight next to you in Atlanta.

2413
02:15:06.221 --> 02:15:09.370
I held that motherfucker like a soldier.
You understand me?

2414
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:12.440
Just cause I roll like that.
Nobody would shit in the bathroom.

2415
02:15:12.441 --> 02:15:15.120
That's no clash on a fucking bathroom on that floor to wall.

2416
02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.610
You gotta do what you gotta do is show the fuck not fun and keeping shit inside

2417
02:15:18.611 --> 02:15:21.390
my body.
I like to let it go.
Barest dog.

2418
02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:25.570
But you know what comes out of my ass if I draw of the white or to to rather to

2419
02:15:25.571 --> 02:15:26.890
to flush.
That's the problem.

2420
02:15:26.891 --> 02:15:30.980
Joey will leave these landlock shits on top of it because especially when you

2421
02:15:30.981 --> 02:15:34.840
were even bigger,
when you were bigger,
you couldn't sit on a toilet normally.

2422
02:15:34.930 --> 02:15:37.270
So you had to be like towards the end of the toilet.

2423
02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:41.500
So he would draw off on dry land.
I'd do it on purpose.

2424
02:15:41.501 --> 02:15:44.110
I like my balls off site.
Listen Bro,
listen,

2425
02:15:44.111 --> 02:15:47.800
I like you like your balls outside like an outside cause I'm like well your room

2426
02:15:47.801 --> 02:15:49.930
for error is so small.
I don't give a fuck.

2427
02:15:49.931 --> 02:15:52.710
I don't want my balls rubbing up against some of the other guys balls.

2428
02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:57.330
Then your wife or your girlfriend have to lick it.
It's everybody's water.
Oh,

2429
02:15:57.331 --> 02:16:00.950
coil.
I always hold my balls in my hand.
I protect them.
Oh my case.

2430
02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:04.960
The Nazis drop a bomb.
I got my fucking nuts in my hand,
but when I shit,

2431
02:16:04.961 --> 02:16:07.780
it just goes long.
I was telling him Thompson Google yesterday,

2432
02:16:08.050 --> 02:16:09.640
you ever take a shit?
You look at it,
you're like,

2433
02:16:09.641 --> 02:16:14.641
I could take it up the ass if I had to [inaudible] I just showed a 22 inch piece

2434
02:16:15.071 --> 02:16:19.090
of Shit my ass.
Oh,
it always dawns on you for a second.

2435
02:16:19.091 --> 02:16:23.710
It's [inaudible].
You're like,

2436
02:16:23.711 --> 02:16:27.370
what the fuck just came out of mine.
Some people clearly like things in there.

2437
02:16:27.371 --> 02:16:29.820
I got to go live on youtube coming out.
It

2438
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:31.510
<v 3>comes out of your Richardson's illegal.</v>

2439
02:16:31.511 --> 02:16:34.170
You'd have to go to youporn 12 look at what comes out of your red.

2440
02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:37.900
Have you ever looked at your shit?
Like you look at it for a minute.
You're like,

2441
02:16:37.901 --> 02:16:41.290
you shake your head and then when you flush it and that shit breaks in half of

2442
02:16:41.291 --> 02:16:44.740
the full Patois,
your uracil because the shit is hitting the stick.

2443
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:46.900
What's that piece of shit breaks in half?

2444
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:49.420
It's like one of those fucking things that when you wave,

2445
02:16:49.421 --> 02:16:52.240
when the cops come like a Flint,
right?
When you break that one,

2446
02:16:52.241 --> 02:16:54.460
when that water hits that shit and it breaks in half,

2447
02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:58.960
that's what the essence of your asshole comes out.
You put the thing,

2448
02:16:58.961 --> 02:17:01.180
the toilet down,
they come back and hour later and pick it up.

2449
02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:05.120
He lived the bathroom.
Don't smell that last Patois of your asshole.

2450
02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:09.250
Those fumes and all those gases that was stuck in that fucking Milky Way.

2451
02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:17.200
If coming out feels good then,
but sex is 50% great.
Yeah,

2452
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:19.840
it's probably,
it's probably 100% great fuck.

2453
02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:23.860
You can get over the fact that the guy's fucking in your asking grantees or the

2454
02:17:23.861 --> 02:17:26.860
new blonde.
You know when you,

2455
02:17:26.861 --> 02:17:29.050
when you do time and you're like in county jail,

2456
02:17:29.051 --> 02:17:30.640
you got to shit in front of everybody.
Yeah.

2457
02:17:30.641 --> 02:17:32.560
I'm an imagine and let me tell you something.
You Shit,

2458
02:17:32.561 --> 02:17:34.400
the first thing they say to you like gangsters,
look,

2459
02:17:34.401 --> 02:17:38.450
you can go flush that mother fucker dog,
but some water that mother fucker,

2460
02:17:38.630 --> 02:17:40.990
but you can't even leave the shit in there for a minute.

2461
02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:44.620
You gotta take a shit and flush it because brothers or start yelling,

2462
02:17:44.621 --> 02:17:49.450
put some water in that.
I'll make a tweet about something that I think is crazy.

2463
02:17:49.451 --> 02:17:54.210
Some new scientific find some giant 30 foot bird that was like some dinosaur

2464
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.260
looking thing that ran around on two legs.

2465
02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:00.630
Didn't fly and you'll get like a couple of responses.
But just last night I,

2466
02:18:00.631 --> 02:18:03.880
I tweeted that my piss smells like tuna fish because it did.

2467
02:18:03.881 --> 02:18:07.380
Oddly I was like tuna fish with celery.
I don't know what it was to fun,

2468
02:18:07.390 --> 02:18:10.870
healthy niche,
but it smelled a lot of the tuna fish sandwich.

2469
02:18:10.871 --> 02:18:13.780
I got more retweets and more,
more responses.

2470
02:18:13.810 --> 02:18:17.080
Today you might have a yeast infection.
Well that'd be crazy.
No,

2471
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:21.360
it doesn't smell that much.
It's a slight essence.
How much?

2472
02:18:21.370 --> 02:18:26.080
A small little like,
yeah,
I'm like fucking pussy.

2473
02:18:26.350 --> 02:18:28.750
If you rub it sometime you were rubbing a helmet in the middle of the night.

2474
02:18:28.751 --> 02:18:30.430
And I was like,
if the helmet and you'll like,

2475
02:18:30.431 --> 02:18:32.020
it smells like rotten fucking pussy.

2476
02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:36.270
Like all the pussy you got in the eighties and nineties cumulates kill me.

2477
02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:39.510
He leaves.
I don't want this shit.
What I,

2478
02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:42.550
one time I had some horrible farts and I was like,

2479
02:18:42.551 --> 02:18:44.800
my farts smell like war or something like that.

2480
02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:48.880
I put that up on Twitter and do is just kept.
It became a Hashtag.

2481
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:50.860
It was pound sign,
my farts smell like,

2482
02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:54.640
and it was the most response of anything I've ever put up onto it.

2483
02:18:54.641 --> 02:18:56.740
I mean it was like for hours and hours it was just,

2484
02:18:56.741 --> 02:19:00.340
I get my farts smell like in a Hashtag I came up like 10 of them.

2485
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:04.810
People love the craziest shit.
That's real you.
It's fucking real,
man.

2486
02:19:04.811 --> 02:19:05.970
We all look at that.
Great.

2487
02:19:06.310 --> 02:19:09.760
It's so funny how willing we are to delve into silliness.

2488
02:19:10.180 --> 02:19:11.320
You know Bro,

2489
02:19:11.321 --> 02:19:14.170
I sit there at night with a sleep apnea mask because I'm a fat fuck.

2490
02:19:14.171 --> 02:19:17.980
I got sleep apnea.
The sleep apnea mass has a tiny,
tiny,

2491
02:19:17.981 --> 02:19:20.980
tiny little exhaust hole in the front,

2492
02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:25.060
tiny like sometimes the cats will come in front of it so the air blows on them

2493
02:19:25.061 --> 02:19:28.280
and they like it and stuff.
My goal at night is to Fart,

2494
02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:30.170
<v 5>to smell that far come into that.</v>

2495
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:36.230
If I could smell that far to that tiny hole.
I know my job.
I'll fucking soldier.

2496
02:19:36.710 --> 02:19:38.930
I'm a fucking soldier.
You understand me?

2497
02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:42.340
You don't know how many times I'll float like a two in the morning and our move

2498
02:19:42.341 --> 02:19:46.280
and I'll smell it and I'll giggle.
Do you take the mask off and not get it?

2499
02:19:46.281 --> 02:19:47.990
He says,
well no,
no,
no.
Sometime let's,

2500
02:19:47.991 --> 02:19:50.720
it's tremendous when you cup your ass and put it to your face like

2501
02:19:53.290 --> 02:19:56.870
fifth grade shit.
When you come,
you're a grown man that she never goes away,

2502
02:19:56.871 --> 02:19:57.320
does it?

2503
02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:58.250
<v 2>No,
no.
It goes,</v>

2504
02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:01.670
you don't know by people stopped playing is not because playing isn't fun.

2505
02:20:01.671 --> 02:20:04.550
It's cause you got too many fucking responsibilities.
You got no time to play.

2506
02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:06.180
That's not good.
Yeah.

2507
02:20:06.490 --> 02:20:10.490
Well it's also because you feel like you have to cause you have to be,
man.
I man,

2508
02:20:10.491 --> 02:20:13.010
I'm so tired of him.
I mean I've,
I've seen so many people,

2509
02:20:13.011 --> 02:20:16.010
like I've been like one of the things that I get criticized loans,

2510
02:20:16.011 --> 02:20:19.430
like you dress like a high school kid who you're I going to Bruce Lee t shirt
on.

2511
02:20:19.431 --> 02:20:20.850
Like,
what am I,
how am I supposed to supposed,

2512
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:25.820
did he give a fuck how a person dresses?
I mean,
unless someone is like going way.

2513
02:20:25.821 --> 02:20:29.840
I look right today I have just a pair of shorts on just normal GI Joe Schwartz.

2514
02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:34.820
I've got some Cammo see that shit.
Nothing spectacular.

2515
02:20:34.821 --> 02:20:36.530
But this is just what I wear.
I mean it's,
it's,

2516
02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:37.670
there's nothing outrageous about it.

2517
02:20:37.671 --> 02:20:39.980
It's not like I'm wearing skinny leather pants and,

2518
02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:44.720
but people are always looking to find some standard,

2519
02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:45.621
you know,

2520
02:20:45.621 --> 02:20:48.560
they're always looking to find some like you're not supposed to act like this.

2521
02:20:48.561 --> 02:20:50.530
You're not supposed to dress like this.
You don't supposed to be like this.

2522
02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:53.720
Why don't you grow up Joe Diaz?
What are you doing?
You Smoking Weed every day?

2523
02:20:53.721 --> 02:20:55.840
Yeah.
That's great.
What kind of a message you sent in the chip?

2524
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:58.250
The kids in the world.
Huh?
I don't want to grow up.

2525
02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:02.590
<v 5>If this means that growing up,
this goes away.
I don't want to do it.</v>

2526
02:21:02.591 --> 02:21:06.760
Probyn only child.
I've got a paraded in my head when I put,
when I smoke dope,

2527
02:21:06.761 --> 02:21:10.450
it's like giving him the engine.
I just enhance myself.
You know what I'm saying?

2528
02:21:10.690 --> 02:21:11.650
When you write at night,

2529
02:21:11.651 --> 02:21:14.300
you ever get to the zone where you actually a giggling like a four year?

2530
02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:16.630
Many times that's what success is.

2531
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:21.400
Making yourself giggle like that as a comedian sometimes if you can't do that

2532
02:21:21.401 --> 02:21:24.250
love.
Look,
I was about to tell you something before Brian,

2533
02:21:24.251 --> 02:21:27.190
one of the silliest nights me and this man had,
he's going to remember,

2534
02:21:27.610 --> 02:21:31.150
he came to the comedy store at seven o'clock.
This was way before fear factor.

2535
02:21:31.151 --> 02:21:34.540
We were giggling and the Italian kid went up on stage and me and you were

2536
02:21:34.541 --> 02:21:39.100
sitting in our chairs just watching people do three minutes and some guy came on

2537
02:21:39.101 --> 02:21:41.940
stage and he goes,
how you doing?
I'm from a big Italian family.

2538
02:21:41.941 --> 02:21:45.520
There's a picture of the porch.
Remember you went,
do you remember that?

2539
02:21:45.521 --> 02:21:50.430
How much are you when I die?
And I'm like,
what?
I'm like,
what?

2540
02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:52.900
That wasn't funny.
Yes,
it fucking was.
You know,

2541
02:21:52.901 --> 02:21:55.480
it's a picture like when Italians come out of court and people think of pig

2542
02:21:55.481 --> 02:21:57.930
genetics are the hands of [inaudible].

2543
02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:01.590
This is a picture of mine who's an PR and we were sitting back there,
hi.

2544
02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:02.500
You know what?

2545
02:22:02.501 --> 02:22:06.280
You're freed up waiting and watching three minutes of everybody and all of a

2546
02:22:06.281 --> 02:22:07.600
sudden this kid comes up and he goes,

2547
02:22:07.601 --> 02:22:10.120
I'm the town isn't impersonation that my family portrait.

2548
02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:14.550
I haven't been fucking lost.
Yeah,
we were just being silly.
That's,

2549
02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:19.600
I love that shit.
I love,
you know,
uh,
what's the Indian,
ah,

2550
02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:21.540
my name is,
uh,
you know the,

2551
02:22:21.541 --> 02:22:25.060
the old Indian from Michigan that used to be at the store sweetheart of a guy.

2552
02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:26.160
Charlie.

2553
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:30.990
<v 3>Charlie.
Charlie.
Charlie.
Charlie Hill.</v>

2554
02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:34.950
Yes.
How you doing?
My name is Charlie Hill.
My original name was mountain,

2555
02:22:34.951 --> 02:22:39.720
but I got it shortened.
Come on,
come on.
You know what I'm saying?
That's,

2556
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:42.240
that's the kind of joke that you're walking by and you're like,

2557
02:22:42.241 --> 02:22:45.910
what did he just say?
What is that stupidity that came out of his mind?

2558
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:48.960
How are you doing?
I'm a retired.
It's everything Brian says.

2559
02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:53.400
I'm originally from all day to New York.

2560
02:22:53.401 --> 02:22:57.180
We had to leave because we had a small real estate problem.
Then.
It's so subtle.

2561
02:22:57.181 --> 02:23:00.600
It's so stupid.
I liked that shit is oh,
Neda,
where Manhattan was,

2562
02:23:00.601 --> 02:23:01.434
is that what it is?

2563
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:05.040
I think it's up north if I'm correct or native native New York.
I don't know.

2564
02:23:05.041 --> 02:23:07.680
He was probably on native tribe.
Often has to do with it.

2565
02:23:07.681 --> 02:23:11.760
I know there's an old native New York by New York is the most ridiculous,

2566
02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:15.630
most ridiculous example of stuffing a bunch of people into a small area.

2567
02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:17.430
Like they apparently they're going,
oh,

2568
02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:21.090
they're trying to figure out how to finance more bridges and tunnels to get

2569
02:23:21.091 --> 02:23:23.610
people back and forth from New York to New Jersey and the governor Christie

2570
02:23:23.611 --> 02:23:26.730
wants the New York people that pay and you know,
I don't know,

2571
02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.950
there's some discrepancy,
but I was thinking about it.
I'm like,

2572
02:23:28.951 --> 02:23:31.140
what a crazy spot where there's like how many people,

2573
02:23:31.141 --> 02:23:33.450
how many millions live in New York City?
Look it up.

2574
02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:36.150
Especially like the Bronx and all the boroughs.

2575
02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:38.810
Brooklyn is the number that most people don't even know that.
You know,

2576
02:23:38.820 --> 02:23:41.820
there's the number four largest city in the country was 20 years ago.

2577
02:23:41.821 --> 02:23:44.600
The problem with Brooklyn is you have a melting pot of New York City.

2578
02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:48.420
You asking Siri,
you,
you've covered the problem with Brooklyn.

2579
02:23:48.421 --> 02:23:51.720
It's the fourth largest city in the country and it's a melting pot.

2580
02:23:51.721 --> 02:23:54.210
Now what people don't understand is that you have a city,

2581
02:23:54.211 --> 02:23:56.790
like you have the Bronx,
Brooklyn was,

2582
02:23:56.791 --> 02:24:01.791
is there 8.17 5 million while and you've got five barrows.

2583
02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:05.310
Correct.
You've got let's name real quick so I don't fuck up Staten Island,

2584
02:24:05.311 --> 02:24:10.140
Staten Island,
Long Island,
Long Island.
The Bronx,
Brooklyn,
Queens,

2585
02:24:10.141 --> 02:24:12.810
Queens,
Staten Island and Manhattan.
Five barrels.

2586
02:24:12.811 --> 02:24:15.330
Not to mention across a bridge you got New Jersey.

2587
02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:19.500
Not to mention you've got long island and Connecticut.

2588
02:24:19.501 --> 02:24:23.040
A lot of people driving in every day from climate people that you know how many

2589
02:24:23.041 --> 02:24:27.480
people that fucking is congested like that and how many people would drive in

2590
02:24:27.481 --> 02:24:30.390
from like Greenwich and places like that didn't don't like Glenn back and all

2591
02:24:30.391 --> 02:24:33.600
those guys they drive in everyday.
How long has that drives that?
An hour,

2592
02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:35.670
hour drive back and forth,
45 minutes.

2593
02:24:35.671 --> 02:24:38.880
A lot of them take car services to make life a lot easier,

2594
02:24:38.881 --> 02:24:40.140
but that's still creates a lot more.

2595
02:24:40.141 --> 02:24:42.420
But you only going back at one person in the fucking car,

2596
02:24:42.900 --> 02:24:44.820
but at least he could read and shit when you're in the car,

2597
02:24:44.821 --> 02:24:49.170
if you have a car service from you for the other angle,
but uh,
it's just amazing.

2598
02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:51.820
You gotta be able to afford a car service lead knuckleheads.

2599
02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:54.720
Do you have in those five barrows,
car services?
Fucking expensive.

2600
02:24:54.721 --> 02:24:57.110
Now thinking about,
thinking about pain of her car service every day,

2601
02:24:57.111 --> 02:25:01.310
how many people could do that fucking day?
Six days a week.
Really grind on you.

2602
02:25:01.311 --> 02:25:03.590
You.
After a while you'd be like,
you know,
why am I paying so much money?
This,

2603
02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.220
I could go out to eat at a nice restaurant every day,

2604
02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:08.190
which you probably don't have a car,
right?
So you're not paying the insurance,

2605
02:25:08.191 --> 02:25:11.490
which is high in that area.
Why would you not have a car and live in Connecticut?

2606
02:25:11.491 --> 02:25:16.440
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Let's say you from a family and your wife has a car,

2607
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:19.320
right?
You have one car,
you sold your car and you have a car service.

2608
02:25:19.530 --> 02:25:21.540
First of all,
if it's a write off into New York,

2609
02:25:21.541 --> 02:25:25.310
the back and maybe company you work for picks up half the task.

2610
02:25:25.570 --> 02:25:29.380
Very few people like especially like how about living in New York,

2611
02:25:29.410 --> 02:25:32.380
like trying to rock and like that where you,
you're just not going to have a car.

2612
02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:35.080
If you're a young guy and you're living in New York,
you're just happen.

2613
02:25:35.081 --> 02:25:38.650
Cab to cab everywhere.
Getting on the subway.
That's one of the few cities,

2614
02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:41.230
very few cities where you can live with no car.

2615
02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:44.680
I have a friend that at 48 just gave up his car.
He goes up to three years.

2616
02:25:44.681 --> 02:25:48.100
I realized,
what am I doing?
I'm paying this.
I'm leasing.

2617
02:25:48.530 --> 02:25:50.470
I just get a rental.
If he wants to go.

2618
02:25:50.471 --> 02:25:52.440
Some wants to go someplace and I just get a rental,

2619
02:25:52.450 --> 02:25:55.690
which is now that that is smart.
It just makes fucking sense.

2620
02:25:55.900 --> 02:25:58.750
I wonder what the percentage of people in New York City that don't have cars or,

2621
02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:00.430
I bet it's giant.
Well,
if you're young,

2622
02:26:00.431 --> 02:26:05.431
let's pretend you're under 30 you're insurance starts at like 2000 a year to

2623
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:07.570
2,400 $2,400 a year.

2624
02:26:07.570 --> 02:26:12.010
Insurance means you're paying an extra $200 a month on top of your car payment,

2625
02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:16.120
which if you lease or whatever,
for 600 you know,

2626
02:26:16.121 --> 02:26:20.920
gas is $4 just to have a car and the parking spot,
fucking dollars.
Plus,

2627
02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:24.820
you know,
people someday get,
when we were talking about,
uh,
values,
you know,

2628
02:26:24.821 --> 02:26:28.390
you buy a car.
Last night a car Cadillac dealer came to the show,

2629
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:31.530
just a kid who was parents on the Cadillac dealer.
We,

2630
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:34.330
we're talking about the car.
You like the $75,000 car.

2631
02:26:34.331 --> 02:26:35.620
And he goes to a lot of people who are doing,

2632
02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:40.360
is that buying the lease returns because it naturally off 25,000 off the price,

2633
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:43.840
or you still get the same quad with 5,000 that Cadillac,

2634
02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:47.890
the Cadillac cts,
cts,
it's supposed to be a fucking animal.

2635
02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:52.330
Now they have a place in Orange County that's let's fix them and make them even

2636
02:26:52.331 --> 02:26:55.030
faster.
That's correct.
You don't need to say.
Yeah,
right,
right.

2637
02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:58.760
The cts visa of something like 550 plus horsepower,

2638
02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:03.490
those are ridiculous cars.
So you look at all of these things as an American,

2639
02:27:03.491 --> 02:27:06.640
you and the,
and eventually times again,
rough and you look and you go,

2640
02:27:06.641 --> 02:27:10.420
what do I need and what can I live with that?
I mean,
I'm in this house,

2641
02:27:10.421 --> 02:27:14.520
John airstream trailer.
How Lazy Are we?
I mean,
all right,
but looking at la,

2642
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:17.380
they have a great train center.
You know,
nobody wants to take that.

2643
02:27:17.410 --> 02:27:20.170
Nobody wants to take it,
but bro,
you don't have to deal with that shit.

2644
02:27:20.171 --> 02:27:21.520
You could take the train by my house,

2645
02:27:21.521 --> 02:27:25.420
Hollywood and vine and be downtown for a late game and staples and come back for

2646
02:27:25.421 --> 02:27:28.960
a concert.
It's really fun.
It's not New York,
it's not 20 people.

2647
02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:32.680
I think the real issue though is also you're going to have to deal with all the

2648
02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:34.630
other people that are on that train.
And in California,

2649
02:27:34.631 --> 02:27:35.860
that's a God damn mixed bag.

2650
02:27:35.861 --> 02:27:38.320
And we're not used to interacting with each other like we are in New York,

2651
02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:42.610
but it's only like,
what,
five minutes,
five minutes been a,
but in New York,
when,

2652
02:27:42.611 --> 02:27:45.100
you know,
everybody goes out everywhere.

2653
02:27:45.101 --> 02:27:46.660
Like if you're walking around in New York,

2654
02:27:46.661 --> 02:27:49.510
everybody is interacting with everybody.
That's not happening in La.

2655
02:27:49.930 --> 02:27:53.510
One of the reasons why there's a lot of racism and a lot of weirdness in their

2656
02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:54.880
lanes that we don't interact with,

2657
02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:59.320
with people of all sorts of different nationalities and all sorts of different,

2658
02:27:59.321 --> 02:28:02.050
you know,
a household incomes.
We don't,

2659
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:06.010
they don't like really coexist in one big melting pot the way New York is.

2660
02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:06.761
New York,

2661
02:28:06.761 --> 02:28:10.990
like you'll see the subways and there's a dude with a fucking $5,000 suit next

2662
02:28:10.991 --> 02:28:14.050
to like a homeless guy and this a homeless guy sitting on a train and next to

2663
02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:14.884
the homeless guy.

2664
02:28:14.890 --> 02:28:18.190
There's a young kid with his Walkman and everybody's just interacting together.

2665
02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:20.410
You know,
they avoid the homeless guy,
ethanol possible,

2666
02:28:20.411 --> 02:28:24.170
but in nobody's riding anywhere with no homeless people.
You know,

2667
02:28:24.171 --> 02:28:27.620
this is not happening very often.
You're not always around them.
In New York,

2668
02:28:27.621 --> 02:28:28.454
you're always around them.

2669
02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:31.580
In New York you're always around all sorts of getting young black kids,

2670
02:28:31.581 --> 02:28:32.570
young Chinese kids.

2671
02:28:32.571 --> 02:28:35.150
There's a bunch of different people interacting with each other.

2672
02:28:35.151 --> 02:28:37.280
Whereas in La everybody's in their little box,

2673
02:28:37.281 --> 02:28:40.790
the little metal box and little rubber tires and it's rolling around their real

2674
02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:43.730
self contained environment while they give people the finger and text each
other,

2675
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.391
you know,

2676
02:28:44.391 --> 02:28:49.391
so it's that that lack of person to person interaction is one of the problems

2677
02:28:49.671 --> 02:28:53.440
with the,
the the way people act in La,
the one of the,

2678
02:28:53.441 --> 02:28:56.340
the number one problems with the way people act in La is that they,

2679
02:28:56.341 --> 02:28:59.930
they're not interacting with people like all kinds of different people,

2680
02:28:59.931 --> 02:29:01.070
a real melting pot.

2681
02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:05.120
They get in their own niche and they stick there and they stay and they,
they,

2682
02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:09.110
they surround themselves with like minded folks like we do.
You know,

2683
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:12.890
it's so weird.
I scares the shit out of me.

2684
02:29:12.891 --> 02:29:17.090
Like I always read about Tara,
things lost in New York because I got a tap.

2685
02:29:17.091 --> 02:29:18.410
Everybody's fucking phone in New York.

2686
02:29:18.411 --> 02:29:20.790
Everybody's phone is tapped in New York because that's the only way they're

2687
02:29:20.791 --> 02:29:23.750
going to find out about these types of things and it's so real.

2688
02:29:23.751 --> 02:29:24.740
How is that possible though?

2689
02:29:24.741 --> 02:29:28.130
Someone listening to every call for years to stop the for you know,

2690
02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:33.160
for the same things for years before nine 11 if you said certain words,

2691
02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:35.700
something would pay.

2692
02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:40.780
Like if you said bomb or eight ball fold it would be I t now they have more,

2693
02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:45.680
uh,
you know,
a fucking amazing ways to tape you,
but we really baffles me.

2694
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:49.490
Joe Rogan and you've seen it.
We're going to see it next week.
What if,

2695
02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:50.690
I mean you have to really,

2696
02:29:50.691 --> 02:29:54.090
what if there's a disaster in New York at five o'clock?
Yeah.

2697
02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:56.930
It would be something that I can't even wrap my head around,

2698
02:29:57.150 --> 02:30:00.020
but you can't wrap your head around the stars and all that shit.
That's great.

2699
02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:03.530
I couldn't wrap my head around.
If there's another nine,

2700
02:30:03.531 --> 02:30:06.110
11 and P and it's five in the afternoon.

2701
02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:09.260
I was there in [inaudible] 94 when the guys from Jersey City,

2702
02:30:09.350 --> 02:30:11.200
the world could blow up the World Trade Center,
the photos.

2703
02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:13.180
And I know what that was like.
I don't know.

2704
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:16.040
I was pissed because they knocked one of its hours down.
I couldn't get no coke.

2705
02:30:16.430 --> 02:30:19.300
So you couldn't pay to nobody because they knocked the towers down.

2706
02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:22.610
That thing went down.
There was no communication.
You mean the power?

2707
02:30:23.140 --> 02:30:26.720
The power down.
Well they not Obama,
but it didn't,
I'm sorry.

2708
02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:30.020
They had a cell phone tower was on top of the World Trade Center or something.

2709
02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:31.750
But that afternoon,
if something happens,

2710
02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:35.600
so all the phone systems and New York are fucked up.
In those days it was pages.

2711
02:30:35.601 --> 02:30:39.860
It was 94 pages.
Wall fucked up.
People weren't getting pages.
I drove a limo.

2712
02:30:40.190 --> 02:30:41.930
So I remember that.
That was the big thing.

2713
02:30:41.931 --> 02:30:46.540
But you think about what a fucking four 30 in the afternoon,

2714
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:49.130
something that happened,
those people underground in the subway.

2715
02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:52.130
I think about the people here with the subway.
You know,

2716
02:30:52.131 --> 02:30:55.010
cause I take the fucking thing for language.
If you ever want Pastrami up,

2717
02:30:55.011 --> 02:30:57.680
they'd get him on the bucket of Lang is downtown on Alvarado.

2718
02:30:57.980 --> 02:30:59.450
That's like the worst neighborhood in the world.

2719
02:30:59.451 --> 02:31:00.850
But it's the best pastrami sandwich.

2720
02:31:00.851 --> 02:31:04.400
We'll have in California got the second best thinking and I take the fucking and

2721
02:31:04.401 --> 02:31:07.050
I take the,
and I had been the langurs and can't fuck with cameras.

2722
02:31:07.210 --> 02:31:11.210
No flux with candidates.
I went this last week,
the people that work,
listen,

2723
02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:15.230
waitresses that worked at Canada's at night work at language and the date time

2724
02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:20.000
they'll tell you,
so I'll drop that shit.
[inaudible] is

2725
02:31:20.170 --> 02:31:24.960
<v 5>[inaudible] bed is the bread is crusty.
I went to campus last week,</v>

2726
02:31:24.961 --> 02:31:28.080
go to the next day I shit.
And it smells so rotten.

2727
02:31:28.081 --> 02:31:31.810
Pastrami was old and read.
Once it comes to your ass hole,

2728
02:31:31.811 --> 02:31:35.550
that's how fucking lag is at 12 o'clock and you see the boat bumpers and pull up

2729
02:31:35.570 --> 02:31:39.650
that take out window.
That juvenile.
Okay.
We should do,
we should.

2730
02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:43.170
We should do a a a taste.
Oh please.
I'll tell you.

2731
02:31:44.860 --> 02:31:48.570
I bet bars in the valley's very good too.

2732
02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:52.960
But the problem with modern is they don't have the bread.
Lang has got booked.

2733
02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:55.890
Is gives you crispy.
That's the same for astronomy I had at my wedding.

2734
02:31:55.891 --> 02:31:59.800
Don't tell me that.
That's the first thing that bottom went.
So lag.

2735
02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:02.990
Isn't this town somewhere.
What street is lingers on in magazines,

2736
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.880
on Alvarado and across from that park out,
whatever.

2737
02:32:05.881 --> 02:32:08.730
Parkland merch park or whatever.
I walked in there one time.

2738
02:32:08.731 --> 02:32:11.910
The first person that came up to me said,
you want to buy a passport and ID.

2739
02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:17.310
That's how real that area is.
It's a Jew Deli from 1940 at the area.
Grew up,

2740
02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:19.350
it didn't and they stayed there.
I know the daughter,

2741
02:32:19.351 --> 02:32:22.540
I know the father and I know what they fucking served and I know the mother

2742
02:32:22.541 --> 02:32:27.510
fuckers that go in there.
That's the old school fuck can is is nasty.
It's filthy.

2743
02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:31.350
Look,
I'm telling you,
this is your brother Candace is good years ago yet,
Bro.

2744
02:32:31.351 --> 02:32:32.920
You go to language and you get that motherfucker.

2745
02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:37.300
This guy don't know he's going to eat.
I'm so shocked at how aggressive,

2746
02:32:38.010 --> 02:32:40.140
listen,
315 pounds.

2747
02:32:40.141 --> 02:32:43.010
I'm from fucking mother fucking New York and nobody in this room going to stop

2748
02:32:43.011 --> 02:32:46.480
me in my mother fucking bus draw cats.
Nobody.
Can we go?
Can me hear me?

2749
02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:49.950
The cats is the best in the world is very good,
but I've been to other players.

2750
02:32:50.010 --> 02:32:50.340
Listen.

2751
02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:53.310
The good thing about New York cats is for tourists and wait and let's get out of

2752
02:32:53.311 --> 02:32:56.700
the way.
Catch is good,
but it's for tourists.
It's like this APP book place.

2753
02:32:56.820 --> 02:33:00.570
We'll all these dumb fuck come on.
Calories to eat.
I know there,

2754
02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:03.960
but it's for tourists.
It's for tourists.
I know,
I know,
I know.

2755
02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:05.280
I'm taking it to a fucking,

2756
02:33:05.430 --> 02:33:07.680
I'll take it to the lance he street and I'm getting you Pastrami.

2757
02:33:07.681 --> 02:33:10.990
That just as good.
I'm telling you this.
The truth,
that's a fucking tourist spot.

2758
02:33:10.991 --> 02:33:13.580
Now I'm telling you,
this is your brother.
I grew up in New York.

2759
02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:17.910
You can go up on 30 years.
I grew up in New York when New York was New York.

2760
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:21.930
Ain't no mother fucker to come and tell me no mother fucking had been the rails.

2761
02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:25.020
I've been to that fucking place though.
You walk over the bridge for a steak.

2762
02:33:25.290 --> 02:33:27.180
That's one of the best they plays in the countries,

2763
02:33:27.181 --> 02:33:32.181
but all but strong and this is why the fuck he top pocket Radians fucking head.

2764
02:33:32.911 --> 02:33:37.830
This guy,
he's trying to pull that sleeve.
No fucking food.
You know he knows food.

2765
02:33:37.831 --> 02:33:39.340
I mean you don't know.
I love him to death.

2766
02:33:39.490 --> 02:33:44.460
[inaudible]

2767
02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:44.971
Bitch,

2768
02:33:44.971 --> 02:33:48.330
you sent me to that nasty place on unless shrank the Shim that pizza joint with

2769
02:33:48.331 --> 02:33:51.610
the old Spaghetti Tom Loves.
That's terrible.
No,
you to set up.

2770
02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:54.870
Gordon says God listens anything they Tony's.

2771
02:33:55.450 --> 02:33:58.290
Tony's needs to shut the fuck.
Like rest in peace and love.

2772
02:33:58.430 --> 02:34:03.430
Respect Tony Little Tony says you get the stuffed pizza pizza when the regular

2773
02:34:04.801 --> 02:34:07.120
pizza blows.
Now because I'm telling you that regular pizza,

2774
02:34:07.121 --> 02:34:10.290
it's a completely different story.
They know stuff.
Pizza,
I won't adopt.
Yeah,

2775
02:34:10.291 --> 02:34:11.400
that's some ridiculous shit.

2776
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:15.510
I won't go to anything named Tony's at ever snow for Greasy Tony Crazy.

2777
02:34:15.511 --> 02:34:18.460
Tony is the only Tony as far I'm concerned.
Greaser Tony's

2778
02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:22.390
<v 3>gone respect.
I love that question.
Died recipes.</v>

2779
02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.910
Creasy Tony Crazy.
Tony from Tempe,
Arizona.
Not Boat people.

2780
02:34:25.930 --> 02:34:29.530
People via New Jersey's they've gone and done these shows on the discovery

2781
02:34:29.531 --> 02:34:31.660
channel.
They opened you up to these restaurants.

2782
02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:34.720
But now the first thing when people come from Tennessee as they want to go to

2783
02:34:34.721 --> 02:34:38.030
Katz's,
so they kind of fell off a little bit.
I want to catch two years ago.

2784
02:34:38.031 --> 02:34:40.800
It was good,
but I don't need that much meat on my fucking sound.

2785
02:34:40.801 --> 02:34:44.290
Would you go see?
I just need a little Pastrami to get my disagreement.
I do.

2786
02:34:44.291 --> 02:34:46.930
I make sure I eat even spot if I'm eating at Katz's.

2787
02:34:46.931 --> 02:34:50.610
I tried to do it on a squat day.
I try to do squats the day I eat it,

2788
02:34:50.611 --> 02:34:55.360
so I have a deep desire for flesh.
When I do squats and your body is depleted.

2789
02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:59.670
That's great.
I love the hats of policing for taking this shit.
Oh,
I,
I know.

2790
02:35:00.010 --> 02:35:03.330
I know how to handle that,
Joe.
It's called Salads.
No,
I know.
I know.
I know.

2791
02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:06.310
Everybody fucking knows.
You've got to try this.
A Kale shake that I'm doing.

2792
02:35:06.311 --> 02:35:09.150
I know that you don't get too much into that crazy shit,
but it's easy.

2793
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:12.430
It's easy to drink.
I got the fucking book.
I don't like that menu.

2794
02:35:12.431 --> 02:35:15.800
I love Bob Bocce.
I try falling.
I don't like what all and Kale.

2795
02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:19.330
I don't eat that shit in Kale.

2796
02:35:19.331 --> 02:35:22.010
Kale does not taste good on its own if you just eat it.
I like it.

2797
02:35:22.011 --> 02:35:25.450
Had a salad though.
I've had an a salad with like some lemon juice on and stuff,

2798
02:35:25.451 --> 02:35:27.520
but the way you drink it in a shake,

2799
02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:31.030
it tastes good because it's got a pair and the pair,
the pair keep,

2800
02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:34.840
I put garlic in it too.
I put four cloves of garlic raw garlic,

2801
02:35:35.050 --> 02:35:37.620
so I'm meeting with all the super,
it makes me feel really good show.

2802
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:41.710
Hey Rob Garlick everyday but this Kale,
celery,
raw garlic,

2803
02:35:42.310 --> 02:35:44.200
ginger,
raw ginger,
like a big hunk of it.

2804
02:35:44.410 --> 02:35:47.830
It's easy to drink and it's like super healthy and your shit comes out like it's

2805
02:35:47.831 --> 02:35:52.270
on a water slide Sean.
Oh that's why my shit comes out anyway.
Nice and smooth.

2806
02:35:52.271 --> 02:35:54.910
I don't like,
I don't have no residue on my asshole dog.

2807
02:35:55.150 --> 02:35:58.510
My am I eat like nine fucking apple before I go to bed.

2808
02:35:58.750 --> 02:36:02.060
I make sure before I shave in the morning,
I don't like that struggle.

2809
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:07.570
I sit down,
I got a call to the eight on that toilet and by five two I'm done.

2810
02:36:07.571 --> 02:36:11.200
Wiped fucking second wife.
You don't eat apples,

2811
02:36:11.230 --> 02:36:12.940
you've got a second and wipe your ass all fucking day.

2812
02:36:12.941 --> 02:36:16.930
I gotta pull over on the fucking,
not a friend of mine had a real good point.

2813
02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:19.720
He was talking about dogs.
He goes,
if you're seeing these dogs,
take your shit.

2814
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:22.330
I agree.
Yeah.
He goes,
how long does it take?
I go,
it doesn't take long at all.

2815
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:24.850
He goes,
well,
how long does it take for you to take your shit?
And I'm like,

2816
02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:27.700
a lot longer than that.
And he goes,
yeah,
that's not good.
He goes,

2817
02:36:27.701 --> 02:36:30.010
if you're healthy,
you should be taking a shit.
Just like a dog.

2818
02:36:30.130 --> 02:36:31.150
You Open your asshole.

2819
02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:34.350
Most of it comes out in the first barrage and then maybe there's a couple of

2820
02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:38.020
Plop,
plop plops at the end where it's sticking to the walls and done.

2821
02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:42.500
I don't know,
sitting,
taking a shit and that shit takes three hours on your ass.

2822
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:46.800
That shit about people doing good for your asshole.
I've never run this.

2823
02:36:47.190 --> 02:36:48.140
If you get to nine,

2824
02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:53.800
I don't sit down until that ass what was ready to blow once I smell that last

2825
02:36:53.801 --> 02:36:56.020
fucking shit,
fuck.
That comes out of your belly button.

2826
02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:59.740
That belly back the Muffler and comes out of your fucking belly button.

2827
02:36:59.741 --> 02:37:03.960
You sit down and get that ass on one sheet and then you do that fucking ass

2828
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:04.730
right to the other man.

2829
02:37:04.730 --> 02:37:08.800
That asshole opens up like fucking one of those boy and chicks and that shit

2830
02:37:08.801 --> 02:37:11.500
comes out like soft serve.
That's the way it should be.

2831
02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:14.860
I got to find out what the weed was that we smoke today cause that shit was

2832
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:19.850
ridiculous.
Was that shit ridiculous then is a whack you?
Huh?
How many,

2833
02:37:19.851 --> 02:37:23.450
how many hits did you have?
Like 19 how many hits did you have for I think,

2834
02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:28.730
I don't know that,
that we cracked me,
man.
I,
I was on delay for the first hour.

2835
02:37:28.731 --> 02:37:30.760
We were talking like I was talking and I was,

2836
02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:33.440
I was cognizant of what I was saying,
but I was like hearing an echo.
I was like,

2837
02:37:33.441 --> 02:37:35.510
whoa.
We definitely went too deep here.

2838
02:37:36.290 --> 02:37:40.130
I think you smoked smells from no home p off from this new fucking place.

2839
02:37:40.131 --> 02:37:43.190
I found 15 gram and they have the fucking,

2840
02:37:43.191 --> 02:37:48.090
we'd tested@statlabs.com station.
There's a weed testing lab.
Oh yet,

2841
02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:52.470
<v 5>fuck you.
Oh yeah.
It's all over at a bull's get tested there.</v>

2842
02:37:52.530 --> 02:37:55.250
That's of when you sit down on the car.

2843
02:37:55.251 --> 02:37:59.070
They'll tell you it's 21% this a NLC CPR.

2844
02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:01.500
I think it's 28% it's the highest.

2845
02:38:01.501 --> 02:38:05.340
What's Matt's Oji Kush is the highest 31 but I haven't been done in about three

2846
02:38:05.341 --> 02:38:07.410
months or four months,
so I don't know.
Everybody changed.

2847
02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:11.550
Did you say 34 at one 31 32 it was pretty,
I had the paperwork.

2848
02:38:11.551 --> 02:38:12.470
He goes magazine,

2849
02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:15.270
but now they had a new company that's doing this for the valley.

2850
02:38:15.570 --> 02:38:19.020
These guys are trying to stay decent so when the cops come,
Obama comes,

2851
02:38:19.021 --> 02:38:20.760
they're going to try to show them that what they're doing.

2852
02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:24.120
So these guys have a car.
When you go get the weed now there's a card.

2853
02:38:24.330 --> 02:38:26.670
It's signed with a phone number if you want to call the labs,

2854
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.420
and it has a percentage of weed

2855
02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:31.450
<v 3>getting it also has it for the edibles it seems.
Oh,
sorry.</v>

2856
02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:34.940
It seems that Obama's trying to do is they're trying to cut off the big scale

2857
02:38:34.941 --> 02:38:36.170
operations.
They're just,

2858
02:38:36.690 --> 02:38:39.780
<v 5>I think you're a little shiny gold and people that are fucking it up and they do</v>

2859
02:38:39.781 --> 02:38:42.740
a shit.
Okay.
Ain't doing nothing.
They ain't doing nothing.

2860
02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:46.350
I buy weed at the same fucking place for the last four fucking years.

2861
02:38:46.351 --> 02:38:48.720
People don't do it or not.
There was a big papers I know,

2862
02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.770
but the places that are selling illegal,
if you go to a decent place,

2863
02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:54.860
I haven't gone to the same place for two fucking yeah,

2864
02:38:55.010 --> 02:38:57.680
let me shut up there and that shot nothing.
These are all rumors.

2865
02:38:57.930 --> 02:39:02.200
So all stories is there full.
She has bad places that there are knocking down.

2866
02:39:02.201 --> 02:39:04.680
Ain't shit.
Look a dog fucking fail.

2867
02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:06.630
There's this looked like they're slow on this shit up.

2868
02:39:06.631 --> 02:39:10.170
Joe Rogan does this look like,
Oh Bob is slow and privates.
I stopped.

2869
02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:13.890
He ain't doing dick.
People stopped with me.
What?
You're dumb shit.

2870
02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.350
Obama was going to close the stores in 30 days.

2871
02:39:16.530 --> 02:39:20.610
You ain't doing shit because you see occupy La and occupies failed.

2872
02:39:20.850 --> 02:39:23.610
You fucking lock up these weeds.
Store now's and see the problem.

2873
02:39:23.611 --> 02:39:26.790
These mother are going to have downtown.
This'll be real.
You got people,

2874
02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:32.240
you got half a million people were drug licenses now close to a million Butte

2875
02:39:32.971 --> 02:39:37.971
ticket slowing down when they're making a fucking pen that has hash oil and it

2876
02:39:38.361 --> 02:39:42.960
that 30% yeah,
like really shutting him down.
Oh Wow.
Let's panics.

2877
02:39:42.990 --> 02:39:44.880
You stupid mother fuckers.

2878
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:49.800
Don't you understand that money supersizes everything you dumb mother fuckers

2879
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:52.650
know they're going to sit there and Washington and say,
Nah,

2880
02:39:52.710 --> 02:39:57.390
let those fucking hippies out there grow wheat.
Fuck you.
Then making billions.

2881
02:39:57.570 --> 02:40:02.400
It's keeping this stayed alive.
It's keeping the state alive.

2882
02:40:02.610 --> 02:40:07.080
These are a bunch of losers run in this date.
They closing Derek,

2883
02:40:07.410 --> 02:40:11.220
so for all you idiots at Twente me every time an article comes out that close on

2884
02:40:11.221 --> 02:40:14.070
one store a week and and the reason why

2885
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:17.190
<v 3>they closed closing this because they're out there basically Pelham the weeding,</v>

2886
02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:20.970
giving it away.
Nobody else.
They did that at Oaksterdam.

2887
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.500
I think it also down there and teaching people how to grow with the program.

2888
02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:25.140
There's a bunch of,

2889
02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:28.350
you know what to happens is Oaksterdam got a bunch of white kids that got big

2890
02:40:28.351 --> 02:40:30.660
fucking mouth shut your fucking mouth.

2891
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:33.150
That's at the prom is shut your fucking mouth.

2892
02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:36.780
Everybody wants to be a hippie and a deadhead.
Shut your fucking mouth.
Okay.

2893
02:40:37.230 --> 02:40:41.370
Shut your fucking mouth.
Stop with the butane and everything.
This is we.

2894
02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:44.490
So there's this look like Obama's slows shit down.

2895
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:48.660
I take a cap off and fucking hit it.
Does this look like it?

2896
02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:51.660
You stupid mother fuckers.
They shutting duck down.

2897
02:40:51.930 --> 02:40:54.360
It's keeping the lights on in this state.

2898
02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.160
It's not doing anything.
So forget that there's no war on drugs.

2899
02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:02.550
The war on drugs was 30 years ago and and they are shipping in what?

2900
02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:06.150
19 metric tons of cocaine by the year into this country.

2901
02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:08.400
So what war on drugs are you people talking about?

2902
02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:10.200
I heard something very interesting last week.

2903
02:41:10.201 --> 02:41:15.201
I listened to the Graham and God podcast when he was on him and he talked about

2904
02:41:15.271 --> 02:41:20.271
that with locking people up for raising our consciousness that the country is

2905
02:41:22.201 --> 02:41:25.020
locking people.
What's he talking about?
Yeah.
What's he talking about?

2906
02:41:25.021 --> 02:41:27.090
We're locking up drug dealers.
No.
Okay.

2907
02:41:27.091 --> 02:41:31.050
I'm just smoking dope for 30 fucking years.
I never got popped.
It's Bullshit Joe.

2908
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:34.470
People get caught that a user.
What do they do to you?
Especially if you're,

2909
02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:37.380
if you're using like acid or something along those lines.

2910
02:41:37.390 --> 02:41:40.920
How long were you in jail for it?
I don't know.
I live for acid.
They don't.

2911
02:41:41.460 --> 02:41:43.110
When was the last time you read about an acid?

2912
02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:46.560
Know there was a big bus recently at a college where kids were selling it.

2913
02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:48.470
They sold like a quarter million dollars where the ads,

2914
02:41:48.471 --> 02:41:52.440
that's who makes the acid is the college towns.
If it wasn't for college kids,

2915
02:41:52.441 --> 02:41:53.940
we wouldn't have those drugs.
Still.

2916
02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:58.890
It would just be blowing heroin fucking alive.
But you don't read about shit.

2917
02:41:58.891 --> 02:42:01.950
But it won't kill me.
When I was,
he made a lot of great points.

2918
02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:04.950
He made a lot of great points in his,
isn't his thing,
but I was like,

2919
02:42:04.951 --> 02:42:07.440
what is he talking about?
We gotta put drug V,

2920
02:42:07.470 --> 02:42:10.680
we have laws and we have to put drug dealers in jail.
They put me in jail.

2921
02:42:10.681 --> 02:42:12.260
I didn't go cold.
I get caught for kidnapping,

2922
02:42:12.270 --> 02:42:16.800
but it all started by raising my consciousness.
You know,

2923
02:42:16.801 --> 02:42:18.450
some consciousness you have to raise.
You know,

2924
02:42:18.451 --> 02:42:20.340
I was telling these guys at the Ice House last night,

2925
02:42:20.370 --> 02:42:24.990
I did heroin three times in 2007 before I quit to him blow it.

2926
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:29.610
I didn't do blow that whole summer and here I was thinking that the helm cured

2927
02:42:29.611 --> 02:42:33.790
my blow.
Like I was ready to call the doctor drew and go,
you're a dumb cunt.
Okay,

2928
02:42:33.791 --> 02:42:38.020
no one in the ties and white kids.
And I just did three $7 bags of heroin.

2929
02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:42.510
I thought,
hello.
I'm sorry,
what happened?
I haven't touched,

2930
02:42:42.810 --> 02:42:45.120
I haven't punched blow the whole summer.

2931
02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:50.790
It raised my consciousness red band to the level that I didn't snort coke.

2932
02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:53.250
You follow me?
I mean it was still bad.
Can you imagine?

2933
02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:56.720
You've got to quit coke by doing heroin,
but it raised my,

2934
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:59.520
anything that raises your conscious,
I'll let you know something is bad.

2935
02:42:59.730 --> 02:43:02.850
Like that whole summer I kept going,
man,
thank God I did the heroin.

2936
02:43:02.851 --> 02:43:06.840
It let me feel how bad the cocaine is.
You know what I'm saying?
Like,
but Joe,

2937
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:09.990
I'm a cure it.
I never did it again.
So it raised my consciousness.

2938
02:43:10.350 --> 02:43:13.100
Nobody put me in jail.
I didn't understand what he was tapping.

2939
02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:16.180
I understand somebody,
there's something wrong.
You get caught selling drugs.

2940
02:43:16.450 --> 02:43:20.410
But I really never met nobody who got thrown in jail because he got pulled over.

2941
02:43:20.411 --> 02:43:23.740
So we'll you're saying is that he's making it,
he's exaggerating.

2942
02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:26.440
People that are gone to jail.
The dealers,

2943
02:43:26.441 --> 02:43:30.490
not the user name me one guy that's in jail for doing drugs or find them online.

2944
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:33.470
Well,
there was a kid that got arrested recently in,
um,

2945
02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:37.690
in Texas and he had his medical marijuana on him.
It was just his,

2946
02:43:37.691 --> 02:43:39.040
and he's going to try right now,

2947
02:43:39.041 --> 02:43:42.580
they're taking him to trial and he faces a possible certain amount of years.

2948
02:43:42.581 --> 02:43:45.010
I forget what the exact number is,
but they're going to put him in jail.

2949
02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:48.490
They want to put him in jail to make an example of the fact that you can't have

2950
02:43:48.491 --> 02:43:52.360
medical marijuana and take it with you to Texas and think that your state's
laws.

2951
02:43:52.390 --> 02:43:56.710
Oh,
from Carolina,
Texas.
Yes.
So I think it's a,
it's a precedent setting law.

2952
02:43:56.711 --> 02:44:01.340
So in that kid's case,
it's,
I mean,
it wraps around the idea of the laws.
You know,

2953
02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:04.590
the,
the medical marijuana laws,
whether or not they're even legitimate,
you know,

2954
02:44:04.591 --> 02:44:07.360
there are states that won't even consider it.
They don't think it's legitimate.

2955
02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:11.590
That's why I'll stay here for now.
Yeah,
it's so,
it's so archaic.

2956
02:44:11.591 --> 02:44:13.000
It's so archaic to this.
I mean,

2957
02:44:13.060 --> 02:44:17.740
there's a goddamn mountain of information now and the information can tell you

2958
02:44:17.741 --> 02:44:21.940
that it's relatively harmless and then you compare it to all the things that are

2959
02:44:21.941 --> 02:44:24.220
legal.
No one should ever get hassled for it.

2960
02:44:24.250 --> 02:44:27.460
No one should ever get pulled over for it.
No one should ever get arrested for,

2961
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:28.780
no one should ever get fined for it.

2962
02:44:28.781 --> 02:44:33.370
It is relatively innocuous to our society and our children be able to use it.
No,

2963
02:44:33.371 --> 02:44:36.340
they shouldn't.
But guess what?
They shouldn't be able to use alcohol.

2964
02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:37.840
They shouldn't be able to use heroin.

2965
02:44:37.841 --> 02:44:40.570
They shouldn't be able to use any conscious altering thing before they get their

2966
02:44:40.571 --> 02:44:41.470
fucking shit together.

2967
02:44:41.471 --> 02:44:46.471
I agree with this 2013 and what you mean to tell me is that somebody would get

2968
02:44:47.471 --> 02:44:48.790
arrested for smoking pot.

2969
02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:53.680
They still can turn the hose and twist the 2012 2000 and Turkey and I'm fucking

2970
02:44:53.681 --> 02:44:57.160
spilled and people are still getting arrested.
How sad is that?

2971
02:44:57.190 --> 02:45:01.060
It's all the problems that we really have in this country.

2972
02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:06.050
You're going to come and fucking handcuff me for fucking having a quarter
rounds.

2973
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:07.390
What is going on in Florida?

2974
02:45:07.391 --> 02:45:10.570
I mean that thing in Florida that we talked about where the kid was arrested by

2975
02:45:10.571 --> 02:45:13.870
his girlfriend,
he thought he was,
he thought he was in love with some chick.

2976
02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:15.400
Turns out she was an undercover cop.

2977
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:17.680
She went to high school at 25 year old woman,

2978
02:45:17.681 --> 02:45:19.710
went to high school and pretended to be friends with kids.
Yeah,

2979
02:45:19.711 --> 02:45:21.540
but there's gotta be a,
by the way,
that we're going to get,

2980
02:45:21.730 --> 02:45:24.240
something's got to overturn that.
A good attorney.
Oh yeah.
They're,

2981
02:45:24.290 --> 02:45:26.280
they're going to overturn with a tiny would overturn.

2982
02:45:26.290 --> 02:45:29.110
I saw about the fact that this kid has to go to court and that anybody would

2983
02:45:29.111 --> 02:45:31.660
raced resources going after a 15 year old kid,

2984
02:45:31.661 --> 02:45:33.400
but we didn't even sell her the weed.

2985
02:45:33.401 --> 02:45:35.530
The kid didn't even sell it to where he got it to her for free.

2986
02:45:36.190 --> 02:45:38.500
She kept asking him about weed.
He didn't even smoke weed.

2987
02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:41.410
The kid was an honor roll student and let me tell you something and I'm going to

2988
02:45:41.411 --> 02:45:43.600
tell you [inaudible] you can to call it.

2989
02:45:43.601 --> 02:45:47.980
I've been involved in drugs for 30 fucking years at all levels and if you can't

2990
02:45:47.981 --> 02:45:50.950
look at somebody and put a cop uniform on them and though there were fucking

2991
02:45:50.951 --> 02:45:51.700
have the cup of cop,

2992
02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:54.940
you shouldn't be doing drugs because when you smoke a joint you should be a

2993
02:45:54.941 --> 02:45:57.880
light to see this shit.
I know when I smell a cop,

2994
02:45:57.910 --> 02:46:00.370
I smell a 15 year old kid with a boner.

2995
02:46:00.371 --> 02:46:03.520
You think should be able to tell a 25 year old hot chicks I was around.

2996
02:46:03.521 --> 02:46:04.930
Buck Hill is managing.

2997
02:46:04.931 --> 02:46:08.080
That would even be something that someone would consider instead of doing.

2998
02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:10.100
That's why I don't,
I'm not sweating.
I would

2999
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.590
<v 5>sue.
I've not only overturned that,</v>

3000
02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:16.350
but I would sue that fucking bitch and that police department and that bump

3001
02:46:16.420 --> 02:46:19.850
jurisdiction for everything.
They got that fucking townhouse.

3002
02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:23.030
We'll call it be called Joe.
We'd be is fucked in memorial park down as

3003
02:46:24.870 --> 02:46:26.760
<v 1>and with that,
ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3004
02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:31.320
let's pull this fucking boat into the beach and docket.

3005
02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:36.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
once again,
Joey DSS provided hours of free entertainment.

3006
02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:42.360
Let us stop.
Pause.
You're a goddamn classic.

3007
02:46:42.390 --> 02:46:44.920
Come see us.
Are you going to do the Ice House Friday?
No.

3008
02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:47.400
What are you doing Friday?
I got some fucking Gig.

3009
02:46:47.401 --> 02:46:49.330
I'm gonna open up a call to gang or some shit.

3010
02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:53.530
Where don and I told you they have that disco series,
Bro.
So somebody,

3011
02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:56.640
where is it?
How do we get there?
How does people,
how do people buy tickets?

3012
02:46:56.641 --> 02:47:00.070
How they find out about when you bought,
I just got the Gig.

3013
02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:03.640
<v 5>It'll be on your Twitter,
right?
Yeah,
but not bad flavor.</v>

3014
02:47:03.641 --> 02:47:05.070
Is this Twitter and late night?

3015
02:47:05.350 --> 02:47:07.720
Saturday night have an arch for joke at the end bar.

3016
02:47:07.721 --> 02:47:11.860
10 o'clock tickets on Brown paper.
Whatever the fuck it is.
Loud paper tickets.

3017
02:47:11.861 --> 02:47:14.620
Go on there.
Me and Brian are going to Columbus tickets,

3018
02:47:14.621 --> 02:47:18.580
almost sold on Columbus tickets are almost sold out in Pittsburgh and we're

3019
02:47:18.581 --> 02:47:22.510
halfway in fucking three quarters in Cleveland.
He's 17,
18,

3020
02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:25.440
19 brown paper tickets.
Joe Rogan were,

3021
02:47:25.441 --> 02:47:29.800

Fucking Thursday,

3022
02:47:29.801 --> 02:47:33.550
Friday night for whatever that five four uh,

3023
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:38.530
<v 1>When is that?
How many leases next Thursday.
It's next.
Next week.
Next Thursday.</v>

3024
02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:43.360
Wow.
Yeah.
We're in the grand ball.
Your grand ballroom in New York City on Friday,

3025
02:47:43.361 --> 02:47:45.910
which should be to know.
What's the address brother?
I do not know.

3026
02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:48.390
Can you check it for Yoko?
Joey,
you start that.
It's a,
the,

3027
02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:51.900
it's at the Manhattan Center over the hell that is,
it's fine.

3028
02:47:51.970 --> 02:47:56.110
It's Manhattan Center and it's on,
uh,
uh,
West 34th street.

3029
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:57.890
This is going to be fine.
We,

3030
02:47:57.910 --> 02:48:00.670
and we haven't been back to New York and on a least a year.

3031
02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:04.120
And then on top of that,
you know,
the coming off that Atlanta trip,
man,

3032
02:48:04.121 --> 02:48:07.390
I can't wait to get out to do another show.
That was fun.
It's so relieving,

3033
02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:11.110
having filmed the special,
get it out there and you know,

3034
02:48:11.230 --> 02:48:16.020
having just done have it an off my back,
right Joey,
woody tweeting.

3035
02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:16.913
If I'm not doing nothing,

3036
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:21.820
<v 5>I swear to God I don't tweet when I'm doing,
I'm not and they'll go,
whoa,
whoa,</v>

3037
02:48:22.210 --> 02:48:25.660
thank all you mother fuckers from making that CD number one.

3038
02:48:25.661 --> 02:48:29.590
It's still number two.
Y'all going have to in front of us as a podcast today.

3039
02:48:29.591 --> 02:48:32.500
As a matter of fact,
today I got the email officially from billboard,

3040
02:48:32.710 --> 02:48:35.980
it's a number one comedy album on Billboard magazine series.

3041
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:38.940
Go check that month and 31 on the Polish,
whatever.

3042
02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:42.200
Heatseeker we ain't fucking around but it's thanks to all of these motherfuckers

3043
02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:45.490
that gave me a chance.
I tools guy hit me up today and he goes,

3044
02:48:45.491 --> 02:48:50.200
can you do me a favor?
You dropped in the state but you're on fire in Canada,

3045
02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:54.100
the UK and they want stories so I'm going to start putting stories up there once

3046
02:48:54.101 --> 02:48:57.310
a month on iTunes.
Part of my stories.
Things from the Ice House.

3047
02:48:57.311 --> 02:49:00.370
$2 a piece down 99 you've been already got prison.

3048
02:49:00.370 --> 02:49:03.370
And I got the drug stories I did last night.
You've been number one.

3049
02:49:03.371 --> 02:49:07.000
You're number one for weeks,
weeks.
How crazy did that feel?
What was that?

3050
02:49:07.230 --> 02:49:10.050
Did it feel like nothing because I didn't expected Joel.
I tell you the truth,

3051
02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:12.630
but it felt like something to me.
You call me up.
You are so happy.

3052
02:49:12.631 --> 02:49:15.450
What would it fuck it feel like to you that when nobody's giving you a chance

3053
02:49:15.451 --> 02:49:18.660
and you're an underdog and you believed in me,
you put me on your podcast.

3054
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:20.970
I did the rest of the fucking work.
And here we are.

3055
02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:24.090
You know we want to go on that squad,
but that's not my dream.

3056
02:49:24.390 --> 02:49:28.080
I want all of us to start headline.
They,
we were all in a different fucking club.

3057
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:32.960
We're going to shut down the system.
What you did for us,
me,
Ari,
Duncan,

3058
02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:37.230
Brian,
uh,
Freddy Loc card,
you know Jason Tebow,
Tam,
Tripoli,

3059
02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:38.550
the original debt squad.

3060
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:41.970
What'd you have done for us is give us the same light Rodney gave us and look

3061
02:49:41.971 --> 02:49:45.240
what happened and as far as I'm alive,
I'm never going to let you down.

3062
02:49:45.270 --> 02:49:45.630
I'm going to,

3063
02:49:45.630 --> 02:49:49.350
we're going to the next year motherfuckers what we got coming at you.

3064
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:52.560
You might as well stop listening to everybody else right now I'm telling you

3065
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:54.180
because there's only going to get better.

3066
02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:58.200
I give you my word that speaks that Ben Rothwell made was one of the most,

3067
02:49:58.570 --> 02:50:01.290
I felt fucking cause that's how I feel.

3068
02:50:01.291 --> 02:50:05.640
I had nothing until I got these people on Twitter and Facebook and all I dream

3069
02:50:05.641 --> 02:50:08.460
about is to give them funny shit.
Now when I get up at six in the morning,

3070
02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:13.220
that's all I want to do.
I don't tweet.
Nonetheless,
it's fucking gold.
Hey,

3071
02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:17.610
I'm doing that and I do it for you guys and I think Joe feels the same and red

3072
02:50:17.611 --> 02:50:21.360
van,
but this number,
one hour I didn't you Joe.
How long have you known me?

3073
02:50:21.361 --> 02:50:23.700
I'm not in.
I don't give a fuck about what people think.

3074
02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:28.200
This is overwhelmed me to be a better person.
Not even to be a better comic.

3075
02:50:28.201 --> 02:50:31.110
This is teaching me to be a better person because you gave me a chance in life.

3076
02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:36.300
When somebody gives you a chance in life,
dog,
it's the best feeling in the world.

3077
02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:38.310
I can't dish.
I don't care about the money.

3078
02:50:38.311 --> 02:50:40.050
I don't care about CD being number one.

3079
02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:42.720
It's just a thing that these people put me there.
Well,

3080
02:50:42.721 --> 02:50:46.440
you didn't put myself there,
Joe.
You know I didn't put,
they put me that dog.
Yeah,

3081
02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:50.220
yeah.
Well,
you know what you're doing is the right thing.
Well,

3082
02:50:50.221 --> 02:50:52.190
you're doing is you're,
you're a comic.
You're a real,

3083
02:50:52.290 --> 02:50:55.260
like you're out there busting your ass constantly doing shows,

3084
02:50:55.261 --> 02:50:57.610
constantly writing,
constantly having fun.
You know,

3085
02:50:57.700 --> 02:51:00.030
you're the life of the party man.
Never went to Montreal.

3086
02:51:00.031 --> 02:51:04.470
No comedy central special,
no love at Bailey.
Got to manage them and got an agent.

3087
02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:09.060
I just show up and so it's all because of you guys because I don't give a fuck.

3088
02:51:09.061 --> 02:51:11.040
I've never given a fuck.
And this one.

3089
02:51:11.041 --> 02:51:15.150
That's what I love it now you motherfuckers,
now you've got problems.

3090
02:51:15.151 --> 02:51:18.780
If you're on my Facebook and put a page and then you come to one of my shows,

3091
02:51:18.781 --> 02:51:22.680
I sweat on my mother's grave.
You mother fuckers have created a Frankenstein.

3092
02:51:22.681 --> 02:51:25.470
Don't come crying to me when I fucking die on a stage one night.

3093
02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:28.410
Dropping knowledge because you must put this,
brought it out of me.

3094
02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:31.980
I appreciate Joe Rogan with all my heart.
I mean what you did bro,

3095
02:51:31.981 --> 02:51:36.180
for all these Comedians,
not just me,
is what Rodney did.
And with that special,

3096
02:51:36.210 --> 02:51:40.050
he changed comedy forever.
Well,
it was for me,
it was just a matter of we,

3097
02:51:40.051 --> 02:51:40.591
like I said,

3098
02:51:40.591 --> 02:51:44.700
we all enhance each other and it makes me better to be around all you guys.

3099
02:51:44.700 --> 02:51:46.170
It's makes me better to be around.

3100
02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:49.710
When I listened to you guys go on stage and crush and I know I'm going up later,

3101
02:51:49.711 --> 02:51:53.310
it's like,
it makes me feel good.
I'm having fun.
I'm being a part of a fun thing.

3102
02:51:53.340 --> 02:51:57.810
And does the experience is a hundred times more fun than just doing it on your

3103
02:51:57.811 --> 02:52:01.320
own and you don't want to be the man.
Fuck that.
There's no,
there's no the man.

3104
02:52:01.410 --> 02:52:04.740
The man is nonsense.
You want to be a part of a group of brothers,

3105
02:52:04.890 --> 02:52:06.470
you know you want to be a part of a brotherhood.

3106
02:52:06.471 --> 02:52:10.690
And that Brotherhood extends from the stage into the crowd and that's where it

3107
02:52:10.691 --> 02:52:11.524
gets crazy.

3108
02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:15.820
You can't tell me that there wasn't some crazy deep connection with the crowd in

3109
02:52:15.821 --> 02:52:17.020
Atlanta because of this show.

3110
02:52:17.021 --> 02:52:21.730
What they know us about fucking Wisconsin everywhere.
Double Waukee.

3111
02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:24.060
Lubo went to Chicago.
How old,
what they used to,

3112
02:52:24.080 --> 02:52:27.040
we didn't get out of that Fort Lauderdale.
Where have we got that?

3113
02:52:27.041 --> 02:52:28.480
We've gotten somewhere after the show.

3114
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:33.630
We up in Chicago when we looked and there was a line around three fucking

3115
02:52:33.930 --> 02:52:37.590
stairways and I wish I was lying county.
There was,
this wasn't one,

3116
02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:41.440
it was the same three and it went and I remember looking back there,

3117
02:52:41.441 --> 02:52:42.760
I've haven't the only light,
you know what I'm saying?

3118
02:52:42.810 --> 02:52:45.520
What's really insane is when you go on stage to that many people and you're
like,

3119
02:52:45.521 --> 02:52:49.510
whoa,
this is nuts.
This is a crazy number of fucking human beings.

3120
02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:51.140
Joe Rogan I went to,
I went on,

3121
02:52:51.170 --> 02:52:54.400
I did these bad flavor worlds and I went on to Twitter to Facebook and I said,

3122
02:52:54.401 --> 02:52:58.690
listen,
I want to,
I got $1,400 that I saved up.
Can you guys help me out?

3123
02:52:58.691 --> 02:53:03.640
And I got $3,100 sent to me on Twitter and Facebook.
My wife was like,

3124
02:53:03.641 --> 02:53:05.920
where were these bitches 10 years ago?
We needed the money.

3125
02:53:05.921 --> 02:53:09.540
Now they send you a dirty one.
And I took that 4,500 pounds and I went,

3126
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:10.660
I've got two plane tickets.

3127
02:53:10.661 --> 02:53:14.320
I took my friend in New York and we taped this documentary about just where I

3128
02:53:14.321 --> 02:53:17.500
grew up,
the people I was around,
I've never done that for nobody.

3129
02:53:18.100 --> 02:53:20.290
And now it's been ready since January.

3130
02:53:20.620 --> 02:53:24.250
But I want it to be so perfect for these people that we've been making cuts and

3131
02:53:24.251 --> 02:53:27.820
adjustments and just just to show them on what,
to see where I came from,

3132
02:53:27.821 --> 02:53:28.870
whether they like it or not.

3133
02:53:29.140 --> 02:53:32.280
And I'm going to put it up and sell for five bucks like everything else or

3134
02:53:32.281 --> 02:53:36.190
everybody who donate is a fucking producer on this thing and they all help this.

3135
02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:39.100
Do you think this is all going?
Where are we going,
Joey?

3136
02:53:39.490 --> 02:53:43.150
We're going to get an out of network on Youtube because when they come to offer

3137
02:53:43.151 --> 02:53:46.510
is something from the network.
What are we going to do on a network?
Take orders.

3138
02:53:46.511 --> 02:53:48.820
At this point I'm not taking the real body to do,

3139
02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:52.000
would be to start a podcast network,

3140
02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:56.260
a real podcast network online and all of us be connected.

3141
02:53:56.261 --> 02:54:00.040
All of us be independent but all connected.
That's just the beginning.

3142
02:54:00.041 --> 02:54:02.360
I want to connect.
Camera's all over.
