00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.750
Once upon a time, a pregnant woman wished
for strawberries, when she did not receive

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.160
them, her daughter born a few months later,
a strawberry shaped mark on her forehead.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.950
Or so the story goes in much of ancient history.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.570
Hey Guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.250
Birthmarks can often be a source of embarrassment
for some.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.779
A mistake of DNA can lead to an deposit of
melanin or a tangle of veins.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.070
But surprisingly, not a lot is known about
them.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.190
Scientists split birthmarks into two main
categories, vascular and pigmented.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.410
Caused by increase in melanin in one spot,
pigmented birthmarks are mostly harmless.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.840
Moles, Café au lait spot, and mongolian spots
are the big three kinds.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.559
Pigmented Nevi, or more commonly known as
moles, are dark skin cells that grow in clusters.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.910
Cafe au lait, are a little more spread out
and a lighter brown or tan.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.760
Mongolian spots, are bluish purplish spots
and appear when melanocytes get trapped in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.860
a deeper layer of skin.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.019
And are typically found in people of East
Asian descent.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.710
They go away as kids get older and are almost
always gone by puberty.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.260
More is known about vascular birthmarks however,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.510
The most common are stork bites, pink or tan
patches that appear on babies’ neck.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.960
It’s estimated that as many as half of all
newborns get one.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.740
Similar to spider veins, the stretching of
some capillaries causes the patches to appear,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.720
and they too usually go away after 18 months
or so.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.130
Another type of common birthmark are little
strawberry like marks called infantile hemangiomas.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.590
These are basically benign tumors in the cells
that line blood vessels.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.530
One study published in Journal of Clinical
Investigation found that these marks originate

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.260
in one type of cell which express a protein,
CD133.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.170
From these cells blood vessels form, but then
they disappear leaving behind fat cells which

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.420
make the marks stick out.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.290
Another study published in Pediatric Dermatology
found a connection between oxygen depletion

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.680
in the placenta and the development of these
type of birthmarks.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.530
Yet some research from The Medical College
of Wisconsin and Children's Research Institute

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.630
suggests that low birth weight is the single
greatest factor in developing an infantile

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.780
hemangioma.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.679
Most of them disappear after a few months,
but up to 10% of them can cause some problems,

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.640
like getting so big it impacts vision or breathing.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.360
Some birthmarks indicate a serious underlying
issue.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.100
Port-wine birthmarks are pretty common, about
one million people in the United State have

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.940
the reddish elevated spots.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.260
Like stork bits and hemangiomas, they form
when capillaries don’t grow correctly, yet

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.100
these can grow and thicken over time.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.990
They can sometimes be a hallmark of Sturge-Weber
syndrome, in which patients have abnormal

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.020
blood vessels in the skin, brain and eyes,
which cause the symptoms of the disorder.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.870
One study published in the New England Journal
of Medicine found a single genetic mutation

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.310
on the gene GNAQ is associated with the disorder.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.190
From this run down, it’s clear more research
is need, get on it science!

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.560
Alright guys, do you have a weird birthmark?
