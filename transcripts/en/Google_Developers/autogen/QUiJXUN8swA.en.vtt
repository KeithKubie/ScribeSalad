if I butchered your name asks what

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
if I butchered your name asks what
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.799
if I butchered your name asks what
should be the factors determining the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
should be the factors determining the
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.289
should be the factors determining the
initial price of an app and if a

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:39.299
initial price of an app and if a
 

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:41.329
initial price of an app and if a
correction is needed what should be the

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339
correction is needed what should be the
 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.850
correction is needed what should be the
transition strategy to a lower or a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
transition strategy to a lower or a
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860
transition strategy to a lower or a
higher price point without upsetting

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
higher price point without upsetting
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.210
higher price point without upsetting
current or future potential customers

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220

good question there's actually two

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
good question there's actually two
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.530
good question there's actually two
questions there so the first one is how

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540
questions there so the first one is how
 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.640
questions there so the first one is how
do you determine the initial price point

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650
do you determine the initial price point
 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.009
do you determine the initial price point
look at the competition and if you're

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019
look at the competition and if you're
 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.859
look at the competition and if you're
competing against a an entrenched

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869
competing against a an entrenched
 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.010
competing against a an entrenched
competitor then you want to price under

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
competitor then you want to price under
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.070
competitor then you want to price under
them so say 10 to 20 percent under the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
them so say 10 to 20 percent under the
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.580
them so say 10 to 20 percent under the
entrenched competitor if there aren't

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
entrenched competitor if there aren't
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.040
entrenched competitor if there aren't
entrenched competitors then there are

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050
entrenched competitors then there are
 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.080
entrenched competitors then there are
alternatives like there might not be a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
alternatives like there might not be a
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270
alternatives like there might not be a
product or a service that is exactly

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280
product or a service that is exactly
 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.610
product or a service that is exactly
like yours but there's always an

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620
like yours but there's always an
 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.200
like yours but there's always an
alternative if there's a need there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
alternative if there's a need there
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.990
alternative if there's a need there
they've figured out some way to solve

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
they've figured out some way to solve
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.260
they've figured out some way to solve
the problem maybe it's not as elegant as

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
the problem maybe it's not as elegant as
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.930
the problem maybe it's not as elegant as
your solution or as efficient as your

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940
your solution or as efficient as your
 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.970
your solution or as efficient as your
solution but there are ways to do it so

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980
solution but there are ways to do it so
 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.090
solution but there are ways to do it so
you have to look at how our users

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
you have to look at how our users
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.810
you have to look at how our users
solving the problem today and how much

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
solving the problem today and how much
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.630
solving the problem today and how much
are they paying to do that and if they

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
are they paying to do that and if they
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.750
are they paying to do that and if they
switch to your product or service how

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760
switch to your product or service how
 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.649
switch to your product or service how
much additional productivity or gains

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
much additional productivity or gains
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.440
much additional productivity or gains
are they getting so that they'll pay

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450
are they getting so that they'll pay
 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.530
are they getting so that they'll pay
perhaps pay more than the existing

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
perhaps pay more than the existing
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.080
perhaps pay more than the existing
solution so that's two ways to look at

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
solution so that's two ways to look at
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.630
solution so that's two ways to look at
how to price your product either against

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
how to price your product either against
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.670
how to price your product either against
the competition and come in a little

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
the competition and come in a little
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.210
the competition and come in a little
lower or against the alternatives that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
lower or against the alternatives that
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.580
lower or against the alternatives that
may be inferior and price a little

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
may be inferior and price a little
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.330
may be inferior and price a little
higher

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
higher
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
higher
okay so then you get your initial price

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
okay so then you get your initial price
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.690
okay so then you get your initial price
and and pretty soon you'll discover that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700
and and pretty soon you'll discover that
 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000
and and pretty soon you'll discover that
you weren't spot on you will need to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010
you weren't spot on you will need to
 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.190
you weren't spot on you will need to
change it what are the strategies for

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
change it what are the strategies for
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.179
change it what are the strategies for
four uses for going up or going down

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189
four uses for going up or going down
 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.179
four uses for going up or going down
good question my experience is it's

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189
good question my experience is it's
 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.940
good question my experience is it's
easier to go up in price than it is to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
easier to go up in price than it is to
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.890
easier to go up in price than it is to
go down and really I thought it would be

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
go down and really I thought it would be
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.330
go down and really I thought it would be
the opposite everybody likes something

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
the opposite everybody likes something
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.390
the opposite everybody likes something
cheaper except the customers who already

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400
cheaper except the customers who already
 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.860
cheaper except the customers who already
paid for Oh

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
paid for Oh
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.030
paid for Oh
so if if you take your product out at a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040
so if if you take your product out at a
 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.830
so if if you take your product out at a
price say $100 and customers pay $100

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
price say $100 and customers pay $100
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.599
price say $100 and customers pay $100
and you start getting customers but

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609
and you start getting customers but
 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.699
and you start getting customers but
you're not getting enough and then you

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709
you're not getting enough and then you
 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.390
you're not getting enough and then you
lower it to $75 well now you've

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400
lower it to $75 well now you've
 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.940
lower it to $75 well now you've
alienated all of those customers who

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
alienated all of those customers who
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.720
alienated all of those customers who
paid $100 they're going to be angry

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
paid $100 they're going to be angry
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.330
paid $100 they're going to be angry
you've disrupted the sort of value

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340
you've disrupted the sort of value
 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.089
you've disrupted the sort of value
proposition that you had going in so now

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099
proposition that you had going in so now
 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.550
proposition that you had going in so now
where are you versus the competition and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560
where are you versus the competition and
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.170
where are you versus the competition and
so you need to think very carefully

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180
so you need to think very carefully
 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.409
so you need to think very carefully
before lowering the price it's easier to

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419
before lowering the price it's easier to
 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.899
before lowering the price it's easier to
come into the market at a low price and

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909
come into the market at a low price and
 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.809
come into the market at a low price and
then raise the price higher and higher

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819
then raise the price higher and higher
 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.990
then raise the price higher and higher
the reason for that is that typically

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
the reason for that is that typically
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.240
the reason for that is that typically
when you raise the price you're giving

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
when you raise the price you're giving
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.240
when you raise the price you're giving
additional features so you're making the

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
additional features so you're making the
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.210
additional features so you're making the
product better you're making it scale

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220
product better you're making it scale
 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.369
product better you're making it scale
better you're making it faster you're

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379
better you're making it faster you're
 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.250
better you're making it faster you're
having additional features there's more

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260
having additional features there's more
 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.860
having additional features there's more
value there so customers are willing to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
value there so customers are willing to
 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.890
value there so customers are willing to
pay more money so in my experience it's

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900
pay more money so in my experience it's
 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.839
pay more money so in my experience it's
always easier to go up in price than it

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849
always easier to go up in price than it
 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.979
always easier to go up in price than it
is to go down hmm interesting about that

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989
is to go down hmm interesting about that
 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.809
is to go down hmm interesting about that
freemium there's a lot of talk about

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819
freemium there's a lot of talk about
 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.110
freemium there's a lot of talk about
freemium is is that the way to go to

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120
freemium is is that the way to go to
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.149
freemium is is that the way to go to
have a free tier and the premium tier

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159
have a free tier and the premium tier
 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.819
have a free tier and the premium tier
yeah that's a great a great way to go

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829
yeah that's a great a great way to go
 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.960
yeah that's a great a great way to go
because the the idea behind freemium is

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970
because the the idea behind freemium is
 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.969
because the the idea behind freemium is
that if it's free you'll get a big user

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979
that if it's free you'll get a big user
 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.900
that if it's free you'll get a big user
base and lots of network effects and

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910
base and lots of network effects and
 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.060
base and lots of network effects and
feedback from users that are free and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
feedback from users that are free and
 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.460
feedback from users that are free and
that's okay and then you have a premium

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470
that's okay and then you have a premium
