00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.590
 I think most people will think 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.210
 Payday loans are not the best choice for loans 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.490
 It is likely to be for people who are in desperate need of money 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.350
 High fees 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 What I want to do in this section is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.820
 Explain what is going on and do some math calculations 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.700
 Let you really understand the interest they charge 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.010
 How unreasonable 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.700
 Hypothesis using this method 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.550
 I need to buy a beautiful birthday present for my wife tomorrow. 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.470
 I need to borrow $500. 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.060
 So I have to borrow $500. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.690
 I infer 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.360
 For a certain gift, most people will not borrow money. 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.520
 They may be paying rent or paying utility bills. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.260
 Or borrow money from food or something else 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 But whatever your reason is 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.360
 You need to borrow $500 to infer 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850
 There is not much money in your bank account. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.780
 Otherwise you won't go to the payday borrower. 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.390
 They said ok, Sal, we are willing to lend you $500. 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.860
 About your credit status and related content 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.950
 We will not do a thorough investigation 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.010
 But we want to know a few things 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.050
 First we want to know your pay slip and payday 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.240
 They want to see your pay slip 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.160
 They want to know when you are paying 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.460
 We call it your payday 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.040
 They may need the most recent bank statement 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.240
 The reason they want these things is 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.570
 They want to know what you know 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.580
 Even if your credit is very poor 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.070
 Then you will get your salary 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.860
 Or payday in two weeks 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.300
 You will get paid from the boss 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.320
 Then you can repay the $500 arrears 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.030
 To ensure this 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.000
 So they want to make sure you have a job 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.240
 Get $1,000 every two weeks on your payslip 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.510
 Or $2,000 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.070
 So that you have the ability to pay 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.630
 Maybe you earn $1,500 every two weeks. 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.020
 They like to see these 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.190
 Maybe from the day you borrowed 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.590
 Your payday is two weeks 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.060
 So two weeks from today 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.740
 And your bank statement shows 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.500
 $1,500 more in your account 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.500
 You pay for rent to buy food 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.680
 Then the account balance is close to zero 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.870
 Then it rose to 1500 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.910
 But they want to see 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.000
 This $1,500 is paid regularly. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.810
 They said that you know 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.030
 We will lend you 500 today. 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.040
 You need to write a check 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.860
 Not writing a check for $500 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.070
 But write a debit for every $100 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.380
 You need to pay an extra $25 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.060
 Extra 25 dollars 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.350
 At first you will say that is good. 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.020
 25% interest rate 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.030
 Higher interest rates than credit cards 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.000
 But this is not a 25% annual interest rate. This is a 25% interest rate for two weeks. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.950
 At the end of the video 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.820
 I will compare 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.770
 What is the adult interest rate? 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.750
 What is the effective annual interest rate? 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.830
 These numbers are not outrageous 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.540
 These are actually typical for payday loans. 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.330
 So if I borrow $500 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.400
 I have to return $500 in two weeks. 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.420
 Plus $25 for every $100 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.960
 So I borrowed $500. 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.300
 I will have to pay an extra $125 for 25 times 5 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.970
 I will write a check for 500 plus $125. 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.730
 That would be $625 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.480
 Obviously not so much money in my account right now. 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.020
 Otherwise I won't go to a payday loan 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.260
 I want to do my hands on the date. 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.030
 I will postpone the date of this check. 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.260
 I will write the date 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.880
 Suppose this is the beginning of the month 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.760
 Or the assumption is January 1st 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.590
 I will write on January 16th, which year is the year. 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.070
 I have postponed it for two weeks from today. 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.140
 In the next two weeks 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:28.740
 Then I signed the check 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.500
 I write a payday loan 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.020
 I wrote $625 and so on. 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.900
 Then here is some information 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.950
 I gave this check to them. 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.680
 They will say that we will not honor it 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.810
 We just keep this small and cute check 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.050
 You can make a choice when your payday is up. 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:57.770
 You can come to us and pay us $625 in cash. 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.670
 Then we will return this unpaid cheque to you. 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.610
 Or if you don't show up 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.160
 We will honor this loan 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.000
 So there is always one of these two things that will happen. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.380
 But in fact 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.880
 If you don't lie to them 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.170
 They will basically charge you $625. 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.360
 You think this is risky for the lender. 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.550
 Because the borrower has the potential to repay very low 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.580
 Obviously the borrower has nowhere to go. 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.640
 So they are not good at managing their property 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.540
 But they will do their best to ensure 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.190
 Once payday is coming 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.830
 Once you get a salary from your boss 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.600
 Before you pay rent, utilities and food 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.070
 They can get the money first 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.000
 That is the basic concept of payday loans 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.500
 Now let's start talking about this may not be a good way. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.690
 You should have an understanding of this 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.800
 Because we pay a 25% interest rate every two weeks. 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.390
 Not every year 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.050
 We think about what it means based on the annual interest rate. 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.730
 Suppose I pay $25 for every $100. 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.720
 Is the real 25% interest rate 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.810
 When you say a percentage, this root means 100 pairs. 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.020
 100 years in a century 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.430
 So literally means every 100 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.470
 25 percent literally means 25% interest rate 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.660
 Or we write it down in a customary way 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:18.920
 This is a 25% interest rate every two weeks. 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.680
 If we only calculate a simple APR 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.650
 a simple annual interest rate 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.590
 For this question you may want to watch the next video. 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.080
 In order to understand it with a 25% interest rate 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.620
 Then multiply by the number of cycles in a year 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.010
 There are 52 weeks a year but this is the rate every two weeks. 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.350
 So instead of multiplying it by 52 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.040
 We will multiply it by half of 52 and multiply by 26 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:03.380
 So multiply by 26 times every year for 26 two weeks 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.030
 This is 25% every two weeks 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.630
 When you get out 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.310
 This is equivalent to letting us calculate with a calculator 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.160
 I will multiply these numbers 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:27.030
 I wrote a decimal point of 25 times and 26 equals 650. 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.900
 The annual interest rate we pay is 650% 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.740
 If you think of a credit card company 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.630
 Charge you a ten or twenty percent interest rate 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.760
 Already a fairly high interest rate 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.020
 And this is 650% 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.110
 One order of magnitude higher than credit card interest 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.880
 Or higher than an order of magnitude 

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.500
 So this is really a crazy annual interest rate. 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.360
 This is just the result of our multiplication by 26. 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.240
 Simple annual interest rate 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.470
 This is not a valid annual interest rate 

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.660
 Or the one that is really mathematically correct 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.230
 In order to get the loan we actually need to spend 

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.010
 You may want to see this 

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.130
 If you let this be calculated according to compound interest 

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.660
 Can you imagine if you are a lender? 

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.180
 And you keep lending money 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.090
 You actually have to follow the compound interest 

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.390
 If you lend the interest you got from the last person 

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.010
 And lending the same interest rate 

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.620
 To calculate a valid annual interest rate 

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:23.180
 You do compound interest calculation 1.25 26th power 

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.500
 26 cycles per year 

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.010
 How much will it be? 

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.530
 Calculate the 26th power of 1.25 

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.850
 Then we got this crazy number 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.890
 We have to subtract 1 from it 

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.480
 That won't have much impact on our mathematical results. 

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:50.040
 Lose 1 we got me to make it clearer 

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.540
 Essentially this is 329 times our borrowing 

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.510
 So if there is a 1 here, it is 100% 

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.350
 I made it clear 

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:05.110
 This number is quite high 

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.920
 hard to imagine 

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.720
 If you use this interest rate to let the money go to compound interest 

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.840
 Generally at least let you roll out the principal 

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.720
 This may be correct or maybe incorrect but the actual lender 

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.860
 If they can lend at such an interest rate, they can roll out the principal. 

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.400
 Will get 329 times the principal 

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.060
 If you want to write a percentage, it will 

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:33.970
 Is 32987 32987% 

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.150
 Or one year later 

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.590
 Essentially you will have to return the borrower 

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.640
 330 times the amount of borrowing 

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:43.550
 Obviously they won't make you like that 

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.230
 But let you know 

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.670
 How absurd this interest rate is 

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.200
 I mean you may have heard the word loan shark. 

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.780
 In the past, usury refers to any kind of interest rate. 

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.380
 But now in our cultural environment 

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.100
 We only refer to unreasonable interest rates. 

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.500
 This threshold may be different for different people. 

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.230
 Some people will say that 20% interest rate per year is unreasonable. 

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.810
 Or 30% or 40% 

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.350
 But I think everyone will agree 

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.610
 No matter how you look at 650% or 33000% 

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.030
 These are usury loans that are unreasonable interest rates. 

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.660
 So unless it’s about life 

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.020
 Otherwise, avoid borrowing such a payday loan.
