00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.230
- [Instructor] What we're gonna talk about

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.010
in this video is how various
political ideologies can affect

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.280
folks' views on economics,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.490
and when we're talking about
economics and government policy

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.920
around economics, there's
two fundamental types.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.370
There's fiscal policy,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.900
which we will focus
mainly on in this video,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.850
which is the idea of how
much does the government tax,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.510
and how much does the government spend,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.500
and this is fundamentally in
control of the U.S. Congress.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.480
Then you also have monetary policy,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.290
and these are ideas around interest rates

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.290
and the money supply in service

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.210
of keeping the economy strong

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.090
without having inflation run amok,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.120
and this is controlled
in the United States

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.410
by the US Federal Reserve System.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.760
Now if you were to put the
various ideologies on a spectrum,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.690
it might look something like this,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.680
and I put liberal ideology on the left

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.110
because it's often associated
with a left leaning ideology,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.320
and I put conservatives and on the right

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.430
because it's often described
as a right leaning ideology.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.270
Libertarians are interesting
because, if we're talking

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.560
about economics, they
have a lot more in common

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.630
with conservatives than
they do with liberals,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.460
but if we were talking
about social issues,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.090
it would be the other way around.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.180
Libertarians would have
a lot more in common

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.950
with liberals than
conservatives on social issues.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.580
In general, Libertarians want
less government intervention

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.780
on either dimension, on
economics or social issues,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.510
but now let's focus on
the entire spectrum.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.050
So if we were to think about liberals,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.060
what's your sense of how a
liberal might think about,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.993
say, fiscal policy, taxation,
and government spending?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.750
General speaking, liberals
favor a larger government,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.763
and this larger government
happens through higher taxes,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.180
higher taxes,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.180
and higher government spending
and more government programs.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.860
Higher spending,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.050
and the reason why they tend
to favor a larger government is

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.250
they will invoke ideas
of a safety net that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.930
in a wealthy society everyone
should be provided for

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.090
on some level.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.800
They might invoke ideas of fairness.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.120
They also believe that a
larger government is out there

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.370
to protect the citizenry from
being taken advantage of,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.780
and so they'll also favor more regulation.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.800
Now conservatives would
take the opposite stance.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.810
They tend to favor smaller government,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.530
smaller government,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.520
and it would be in the
form of lower taxes,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.160
lower taxes,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.950
lower spending,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.680
lower spending,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.820
and less government regulation,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.330
less regulation,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.820
and they'll make the
argument that the less

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.120
that the government
gets in the way the more

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.280
that the economy can actually thrive.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.110
The more that business can do well,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.550
the more competitive our country will be,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.940
in which case everyone will be better off,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.730
and so they're often associated
as being pro-business,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.200
but many conservatives would argue

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.410
that by being pro-business

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.440
it's actually helping more individuals.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.550
Now an idea that often gets associated

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.460
with liberals is one
of Keynesian economics.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.690
Now John Maynard Keynes was an
early 20th-century economist

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.130
who argued that a government
could use fiscal policy

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.980
in order to stimulate the economy.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.000
So Keynes argued that

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.260
during recessions the government
could even run deficits

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.620
in order to stimulate the economy,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.830
that even deficits were
not bad, by lowering taxes,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.430
because lower taxes would put
more money in individuals'

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.470
and business' pockets,
and increasing spending.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.010
So higher government spending.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.523
Higher government spending.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.853
Now although Keynes is most associated

00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:58.340
with a liberal ideology,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.700
especially because it was practiced

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.490
during the depression
by FDR, some would argue

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.250
that it might have come
out of the depression,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.670
it turns out that most mainstream liberals

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.680
and conservatives do practice some form

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.790
of Keynesian economics.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.270
Liberals tend to stress the
higher government spending.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.540
If we're in a recession, the
government should spend more

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.890
to stimulate the economy to put
more money in folks' pockets

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.850
so that there's more consumer spending,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.770
which could drive the economy.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.520
Conservatives try to
favor the lower taxes.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.617
You will see conservative
government officials say,

00:04:33.617 --> 00:04:37.370
"Hey, we want to lower taxes
to stimulate the economy."

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.860
Fundamentally, that is a
Keynesian point of view.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.880
They're focusing on the
lower taxes angle of it.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.980
In either case,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.730
if you're spending is
higher than your taxes,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.720
both sides would run a deficit

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.720
in order to stimulate the economy.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.770
Sometimes the conservatives are associated

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.030
with the idea of supply-side economics,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.210
and this is the idea,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.760
this goes back to being
pro-business and even lower taxes,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.330
that, hey, if more people have
more money in their pockets,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.110
especially those who invest or those

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.960
who are starting businesses
or businesses themselves,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.110
that they can then expand their capacity.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.300
They could go and hire more people

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.060
and that this would be good for everyone.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.770
Now what about libertarians?

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.940
Well, on economic policy,
you could view them

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.170
as even more conservative
than conservatives.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.150
They would favor the
smallest possible government.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.150
Smallest smallest possible
possible government.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.050
Many libertarians would argue

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.290
that the government should only be there

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.030
to protect property rights,
to have a common self-defense,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.310
to have some basic public
safety, and outside of that,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.390
the government should get out of the way,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.530
and people would be best off,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.750
and many libertarians would even argue

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.140
that the whole idea of
a Federal Reserve System

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.470
that's actively controlling
monetary policy is a bad idea.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.920
So I'll leave you there.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.300
This gives you a big picture

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.970
of how political ideology connects

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.143
to folks' views on economics.
