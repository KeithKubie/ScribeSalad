00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; The Library of Congress
in Washington DC.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.300
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Welcome
to Library of Congress.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.110
I am Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of the
African and Middle Eastern Division

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.980
and I wish you all a happy Nowruz.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.870
We are celebrating today Nowruz
with a special cultural program

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:52.100 position:56%
on Azerbaijani culture and food, and
I just want to say that every year,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.650
the African and Middle Eastern
division, which is responsible

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.800
for the collections and for
serving those collections

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:15.770
from 78 different countries
is here and collects materials

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.100
from Azerbaijan that
it serves, as well.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.080
Now why we celebrate Nowruz,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.520 position:56%
it is because it is a secular
facility sacred to the Zoroastrians,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.460
but in fact, celebrated not
only in Iran, the Persian world,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.430
the Persian speaking world, but
also throughout central Asia

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.830
from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Uzbekistan,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.560
and certainly in Azerbaijan.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.750
It is also celebrated in India,
and in some of the people in Iraq

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.280
and Turkey, in Turkmenistan,
and many other places.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.780
And every year, we
do something special.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.480
So this is a very special
event today 2016, for example,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.000 position:56%
we celebrated it at the White House.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.040
We were invited by Mrs.
Obama, and we had a display

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.260
and a special Nowruz lunch
at the White House in 2015.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.330
We had a special presentation
by Dr. Saeed Hussein Nasser,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.180
and many of you know him
at George Washington.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:39.050
In 2014, we opened a big exhibit
on 1000 years of the Persian book.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.990
A year earlier, we had a
film on the Shah Hanami.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:53.930
So year after year, we have unique
programs that celebrate new year,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.350
celebrate the beginning of spring.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.600
I know it's a not very
auspicious the snow outside,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.570
but we do what we can to
bring spring to everyone

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.990
and to bring spring through
Nowruz, through the programs,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.430
through the food, through
the culture, which is so rich

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.780
and so wonderful, and you
hear much more about it today.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.070
We are delighted to be cosponsoring
this event today with the embassy

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.890
of Azerbaijan, and the embassy
has been absolutely wonderful,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.070
has a fantastic team.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.940
We have a young lady, Fadoon
[assumed spelling] here,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.170
who has been a dynamo
putting this together

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.420
in a very short period of time.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.390
So I want to thank the
embassy of Azerbaijan

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:58.390
for also making possible this
wonderful menu and event today.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.580
We have with us, and
we are honored to have

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.670
with us today the ambassador
from Azerbaijan.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.020 position:56%
His Excellency, Elin Suleymanov, was
appointed ambassador of the Republic

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.500
of Azerbaijan to the United
States in October 2011.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.250
Prior to that, for over five years,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.500 position:56%
Mr. Suleymanov had been the nation's
first consul general to Los Angeles

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.110 position:56%
and the Western states leading team,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.190
which established Azerbaijani
diplomatic presence

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.390
on the western coast.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.050
He's a graduate of the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.380
in Medford, Massachusetts,
and holds a graduate degree

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.330
from the political
geography department

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.210 position:56%
of Moscow State University in Russia

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.780
and from the University
of Toledo, Ohio.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.550
Mr. Suleymanov, His Excellency,
Ambassador Suleymanov,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.940
has authored numerous articles

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.670
and is a frequent presenter
at academic events.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.870
He is fluent in several languages,
and now we'll ask them to be fluent

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.510
in English and welcome
you all, of thank you.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.130
[ Applause ]

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.740
&gt;&gt; Elin Suleymanov:
Thank you, Ms. Deeb.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.190
This a great honor to be here.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.550
My English is heavily accented.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.730
So I'm not sure how
fluent I'm going to be,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.260
but I will ask you to bear with me.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.510
The happy thing, it's
going be very short.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.730
So, Ms. Deeb, thank you so
much for partnering with us.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.580
It's a great honor to be
speaking in this marvelous hall.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.030
We all know about Library of
Congress from her childhood,

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.180
from different things, but now,
we're finally presenting here

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.530
in a partnership with
Library of Congress.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.830
Thank you so much, Ms. Deeb.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.130
Thank you to the division.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.430
Thank you to the team.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.730
Thank you, Ms. Weeks,
for being with us.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.030
Thank you.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.000
I actually have a book itself
to present you, but we'll do,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.240
but I will also ask
Feride later to sign it.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.000
So you'll have it actually --
we could have pre-signed it,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.640
we thought it would be better if
she signed it in your presence.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.940
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Absolutely.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.240
&gt;&gt; Elin Suleymanov: So Ms.
Deeb, thank you very much.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.910
This is the book itself.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.210
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.510
Thank you so much.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.810
Thank you.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.110
&gt;&gt; Elin Suleymanov: So thank
you for your partnership.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.410
If Feride could sign it.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: That's wonderful.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.010
Thank you.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.310
&gt;&gt; Elin Suleymanov: And
while the ladies do that,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.610
let me say a couple of words.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.910
First of all, we are
very proud to partner

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.830
with Feride Buyuran on this book.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.880
It was a joint project, in
which we didn't do anything.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.730
She did all the work.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.030
But we are very grateful.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.530
This is the first book of its kind.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.040
She will tell you more about this.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.300
It's not surprising that this book
actually was written in California.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.500 position:56%
Because when you look outside the
nature and the weather of Azerbaijan

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.630
and the fruit in the meat
at all this is probably more

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.970
like California than
elsewhere anywhere else.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.320
So, Ms. Buyuran, I'm not surprised
that you were inspired to do

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.700
that in the [inaudible]
of Los Angeles.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.000
&gt;&gt; Feride Buyuran: That's true.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.300
&gt;&gt; Elin Suleymanov:
Rather than elsewhere,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.600
but we could have called this
conversation a taste of Nowruz.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.750
As Ms. Deeb pointed out, is very
important to realize that today,

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.270
we are in the second day
of the last week of Nowruz.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.080
I know it sounds strange for
people who don't follow this,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.590 position:56%
but we're very religious about this.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.890
Very, very, very committed.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.680
So happens is every Tuesday
before the actual Nowruz,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.690
which a solar equinox, which is
the real beginning of spring,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.580
we dedicate ourselves to eating
a lot of fattening food, sugar,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.510
carbohydrates, and jumping over
various burning [inaudible].

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.940
Mostly fire.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.880
It's good for you, because
it clears your soul.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.370
Yesterday, we did that as well,
because that's a celebration

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.680
of the beginning of spring.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.850 position:56%
Don't be fooled by the cold weather.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.700
Actually, the sun will be soon,
I think it's on Monday, right?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.190
The night from Sunday and
Monday, it will be solar equinox.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.030
The spring begins, and
no more cold weather.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.330
I promise you.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.830
That's been true for centuries.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.010
That's been true for thousands
of years, but the celebration

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.450
of Nowruz is not possible
without the food,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.600
because that's very much the
heart of the Nowruz celebration.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.410
You jump, you eat,
you cleanse your soul,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.410
and you get minimal
carbohydrates back.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.020
So Ms. Buyuran will
be talking about this.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.740
But what Ms. Deeb also
said is very important.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.860
I think, in addition to the Nowruz,
at the beginning of the celebration

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:30.070
of the actual equinox, Nowruz
is a celebration of unity.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.530
It's the unity of Iranian
culture, Azerbaijani culture,

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.510
culture of people of
Central Asia, the Caucuses.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.490 position:56%
So much, and throughout, and in
fact in places like the Middle East,

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.830
Iraq, and Russia, Turkestan,
and Uzbekistan.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.720
Everybody has their own
specificity of these things.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.710
I believe that we really
have the best [inaudible].

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.460
People believe they have
the best [inaudible].

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.260
People boil the best eggs
and keep the eggs together.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.970
Everybody has a different thing,
but what it does, it unites people

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.200
in many ways, and it's
a fascinating field.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.880 position:56%
When you go to different places
quite far from each other, actually,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.230
in terms of distance, and
people celebrate together.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.570
They celebrate in a way which
is so familiar for each of us.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.430
So I think that's, in a way, a
great opportunity for us to think

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.150
about this as a unifying force.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.130
Especially during this
week a celebration.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.290
Now there's something
that is also special

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.810
about this book, and
you've noticed it.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.460
Not only the celebration bringing
us all together, the food.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.600
If you look at the specificity of
food, it's actually very common

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.000
to so many of our neighbors,
so many of our friends,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.500
some many of our partners.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.020
In a way, when we say Azerbaijani
food has also been developed

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.320
under different influences.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.250
It has influenced others.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.530
So in a way, the unification of
food is also a very good thing.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.190
And in addition to the
talk by Ms. Buyuran,

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.900
I also hope that we can have some
of that here, because they told me

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.490
that they will serve some food.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.780
So I look forward to listening,
and also eating, as well.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.690
So thank you very much and good
luck with your presentation.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.490
Thank you.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:12.510

&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: [Non-English Spoken].

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.510
So --

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.740
[ Applause ]

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.810
For the others, that is welcome,
and on behalf of my colleagues,

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.180
and in particular Dr. Mary-Jane
Deeb, Chief of the African

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.610
and Middle Eastern Division,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.020
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.640
I'm Joan Weeks, head of the Near
East section, who's the sponsor

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.180
of today's program, along with the
embassy, and we're very pleased

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.650
to present this program
on Pomegranates

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.060
and Saffron a Culinary
Journey to Azerbaijan,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.460
but before we start our
program, and very quickly,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.740
before we introduce our
speaker, I'm just going

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.270
to give you a little brief
overview of where you are.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.940
This is a custodial division, and
we have three sections that build

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.900
and serve collections
from all around the world.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.770
We cover 78 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.800
The Africa section covers all
of the sub-Saharan Africa.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.060
Hebraic section covers
Hebraic and Hebraic worldwide,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.610
and our Near-East section
covers all of the Arab countries

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.970
in North Africa, Turkic
Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.590
and the Muslims of Western China.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.440
So you see it's quite extensive,

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.990
and we hope that at some
point you'll come back

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.180
into our reading room and use the
collections for your research.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.590
I'd also like to invite
you to try out our blog,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.830
where our specialists right

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.690

us on Facebook, and that way,

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.910
you'll find out about
future events, and now,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.770
I also just like to just let you
know that if you ask a question

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.730
at the end, you are implicitly
agreeing to be used on the video

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.410
that will be uploaded
on our website.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.920
So now I'd like to introduce
our speaker, Feride Buyuran,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.290
who dreamed about creating her own
cook book and finally published it

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.710
after seven years of hard work
and obsession/determination.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.500
She was born and raised
in Baku, Azerbaijan,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.200
and moved to the United
States at the age of 24.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.480
Feride holds a BA and MA degree
in English and literature

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.360
from the University of
Languages in Baku and an MBA

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.400
from California State
University at Long Beach.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.360
She is the writer behind
the blog AZ-Cookbook.com

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.320
where she shares recipes and
stories from her native Azerbaijan

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.520
and her book, Pomegranates and
Saffron, a Culinary Journey

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.550
to Azerbaijan, has won
five prestigious awards.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.510
So without further ado, let's
welcome Feride to the podium.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:05.080
[ Applause ]

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.380
&gt;&gt; Feride Buyuran:
Thank you, Mrs. Weeks.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.310
Thank you, Mrs. Deeb.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.090
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.470
You've been very supportive of
my work since the early days

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.320
when I started writing the book.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.530
Thank you for this opportunity to
be here in the Library of Congress.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.980
Coming from LA, this is a
really big thing for me.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:28.030
So I am very honored to speak
about the topic that I love a lot.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.110
It's Azerbaijani cuisine.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.470
So thank you very much.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.450
And before I begin my
presentation, I'd like to mention,

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.330
we have stickers under four chairs.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.800 position:56%
So four of you will win my cookbook,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.300
and I will happy to
sign them for you.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.280
So do we do it at the very end?

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.580
Because everybody is
reaching for the stickers.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.340
So four people, lucky
people, and I'll sign it

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.470
for you after my presentation.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:06.930
Okay, well, they're
looking for that thing.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:15.080
Okay, in 2007, when I had just
started researching Azerbaijani

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.330
cuisine for my book, I stumbled
upon this beautiful quote

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.890
by Anya von Bremzen.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.720
She's a prominent food writer.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.690
And I saw this quote in
her famous book Russia,

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.640
Please to The Table the quote read,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.740
"Azerbaijani cuisine is perhaps the
most distinct, yet the least known

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.040
of all three Caucasian republics."

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.740
So this idea really stuck with me,

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.400
and I carried it the seven
years of my work on the book.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.540 position:56%
I thought I really wanted to deliver
the beauty Azerbaijani cuisine,

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.860
the diversity of it, how it
steeply seeped in the culture

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.700
of people populating this
territory and the history

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.190
of people, living on that land.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.510
So I hope I achieved my
goal, and after seven years

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.440
of working, the book was published.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.440
So what is Azerbaijani cuisine
and why is it so distinct?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.510
What makes it different
from other cuisines

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.660
or what makes it common
with other cuisines?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.900
My lecture will give you a very
brief overview of the country.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.830
Most of you are probably
very familiar with it.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.650
I'll be very brief, and then
I'll talk about the cuisine,

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.630
the techniques of cooking
general ingredients

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.000
that we use in the cooking.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.380
Then I'll talk about the evolution

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.830
of Azerbaijani cuisine
throughout the centuries.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.040
And then we'll talk about
special days and food traditions.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.730
This is Azerbaijan on a big map.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.530
So you can see it's
a very small country

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.480
on the crossroads of
Asia and Europe.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.910
It's bounded by the Caspian
Sea where the capital

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.460
of Buka is located, our
neighbors are Iran, Turkey,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.770
Armenia, Georgia, and Turkey.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.850
This is the map of Azerbaijan.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.480
I don't want to talk too
much about the country,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.790
because you probably already know.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.960
I'll switch to the country
overview, to the cuisine overview.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.560
So what are some of the main
factors Azerbaijani cooking,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.270
one of them is seasonality factor?

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.680
We use fresh ingredients.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.910
Summer greetings in the summer.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.840
Winter ingredients, feeding for
the winter, in the wintertime.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.400
Hearty meals in the winter, light
vegetarian meals in the summer.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.620
So this is a very important
aspect of Azerbaijani cooking.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.740
And also, it's very used
to use fresh ingredients.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.650 position:56%
We go to farmer's market very often.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.460
You know, farmer's market
operate every day over there.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.760
It's not like here.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.380
I don't know how it is here,
but in LA, it's once a week.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:37.150
So Azerbaijan, it's every day, and
everybody shops very frequently

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.770
for the ingredients to use the
cooking, because cooking is made

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.880
from scratch on a daily basis.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.090
Then there is a concept of sweet
and sour and some of the dishes,

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.360
and this is something that
came to our cuisine from Persia

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.000
from the times Azerbaijan was
part of the Persian Empire.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.080
We blend, we mix sweet with sour.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.500
For example, some rice pilafs the
toppings for some rice pilafs,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.840
they have apricots, but at the
same time the top you may have

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.140
sour plums.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.440
So it's beautiful combination.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.650
It's delicious, but it's
also for the purpose of --

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.080
to balance the richness
of the dishes,

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.800
especially if it's a meat dish.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.720
And also, sour ingredients help
with the digestion of the food.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.840
So there is a medicinal
property, as well.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.810
There is also minimum waste.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.110
The idea of minimum waste.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.650
For example, when we
slaughter sheep,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.180
we try to use as much
of it is possible.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.480
We make kebabs.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.360
Then with the innards, we make
something that's called jiz-biz.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.000
It's really good, unless
you're a vegetarian.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.650
Then you won't like it, but it's
really delicious, and then the feet

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.600 position:56%
and head is simmered for a long time

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.280
until we obtain something
that's called khash.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.380
It's very good for
hangovers, but not always.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.680
I love it.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.130
I don't have hangovers,
but I love it.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.760
So and also, wastes
are also sometimes used

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.940
for their medicinal
properties, as well.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.240
What else?

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.640
And traditional food
preservation is very important.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.490
We do have a lot of jarring
during the summer months,

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.710
but we also have a very old
tradition of preserving food

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.470
when there were no
refrigeration possible.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.790
For example, we make
govurma, which is lamb fried

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.970
in its own fat and
stored for winter.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.870
Then it's used, scooped out with
its fat, and added to the dishes.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.540
Then we have something that's
called ghage or gujarat.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.550
It's basically large pieces
of meat salted and dried.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.500
Then you can use the dishes, as
well, especially pasta dishes.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.380
In the coastal regions,
they dry fish and use it

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.040
in the wintertime, as well.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.260
Cooking on a saj is
a very important.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.480
Saj is a very interesting utensil.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.780
It's a pan.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.650
I think we have a picture
of it in the later slides.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.070
Basically, it's a dome-shaped
vessel where you bake

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.370
and cook at the same time.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.670
On one side, you bake breads.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.310
On the other side, you
cook savory dishes.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.440
And I'll show you the
pictures after that.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.630
Okay, so these are the pictures.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.640
This is a pomegranate car, a truck.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.610
They sell pomegranates
in the trunk of the car.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.460
I snapped this picture last year in
Baku during the pomegranate season.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.680
And there are lots of fresh
herbs and the bazaars.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.740
And this is a dairy seller that
came to our neighborhood in Baku,

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.220
and I was typing with my family.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.070
I just took a picture of her.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.260
She was very happy to
be in the presentation.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.290
So this is something is
very common there, as well.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.970
People, you know, neighborhood
vendors,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.860
they go to the neighborhoods
and sell something.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.620
This is our vendor over there.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.480
I talked about this,
and I forgot this slide.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.780
So this is kufta.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.320
On the right, you can see kufta.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.480
It's a huge jumbo meatball with
sour plum inserted in the middle.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.650
This gives it a nice, tart flavor.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.770
Also takes away the richness of the
meat and helps with the digestion.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.240
And the khash that I
talked a little earlier,

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:58.030
the feet and the tripe is on top.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.410
And on the bottom, you see cheese
that stored in the sheepskin.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.710
It's called matal pendir.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.010
It's called cheese that
stored in the sheepskin.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.310
It's called matal pendri.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.610
It has a very distinct flavor.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.120
So we don't waste any
part of the animal.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.420
And I talked about this.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.770
This is dried meat in the middle.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.660
That's how it looks,
and dried yogurt.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.210
There's also a tradition of drying
the yogurt for the winter months.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.050
When the yogurt is drained
and there is no liquid,

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.090
they shape it into cones
or circles or rounds,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.870
and they dry it under the sun.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.970
And they use it in pasta dishes.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.920
Cooking on a saj, in the middle,

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.160
you can see flatbread stuffed
with meat, fresh herbs.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.930
On the right is saj-cooked
lamb with vegetables.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.660
I took this picture in the
region of Gabala in Azerbaijan.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.470
It's a beautiful region,
and on the left,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.870 position:56%
you see this is an Azerbaijan crepe.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.480
It symbolizes the sun.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.320
When you pour the batter in
the middle, it spreads around

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:57.570
and you can see that it
looks likes the sun rays.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.690
Breadmaking is very
important, as well.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:04.840
Bread is a very important
aspect of Azerbaijani cuisine.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.140
It's revered.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.440
It's sacred.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.740
It's been prepared and
Azerbaijan for centuries,

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.880
according to archaeological
discoveries.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.380
And archaic methods
that were used back

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.460
in the time were really archaic.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.760
Pieces of dough were
basically baked in the ground.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.820
A hole was made in the ground.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.330
Fire would start there,
then when members were hot,

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.440
a piece of dough would be
just put on top of embers

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.940
and the dough would be covered with
leaves, and the bread would bake.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.440
But this is a very archaic method.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.270
Later on, of course, with
time, other methods came.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:47.040
You can see here a brick oven,
which is called kure, a big one.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.540
In the middle, it's a tandoor oven.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:55.580
It's very common in Azerbaijan, and
you basically, you slap the dough

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.260 position:56%
against the wall of a heated
tandoor, and the dough doesn't fall.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.500
It just stays there until
it's nice and golden.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.020
And on the right, it's lavash.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.770
Flat bread baked on the side.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.770
When I was researching
for my cookbook,

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.440
I realized how diverse
Azerbaijani cuisine is.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.380
My family is from different parts
of the country, from Ordubad,

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.680
from Balakan, from Zaqatala.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.510
There really, I called a triangle.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.940
One part is here, another
here, and I'm from Baku.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.760
So the cuisines of all of these
regions are very different,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.890
and as I researched for the book,
I realized how diverse it is.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.690
Not only within the regions,
but also there are many cuisines

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.620
of ethnic minorities, the
population of Azerbaijan.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.600
For example, I found out
that Molokan Russians,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.680
that came to Azerbaijan in the 19th
century when they were expelled

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.530
from Russia because of their
belief in spiritual Christianity,

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.830
they settled in Azerbaijan.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.440
And there is a village Ivanovka
is populated by Molokan Russians,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.640
and they preserve their
ways of cooking.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.770
They make laksha, these
noodles, the old-fashioned way.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.890
They make pierogi of
many kinds on Easter.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.970
There's also the cuisine of
the mountain Jews that came

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.490
to Azerbaijan in the
5th century from Persia.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.480
They have a very distinct
cuisine, as well, that is a mixture

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.440
of Persian cuisine,
Azerbaijani cuisine.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.090
They have elements
of different cuisine.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:21.580
So these are some examples
of the diversities.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.270
We have many kinds of baklava.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.250
The one in the picture
is guba-style baklava.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.270
It's different from Baku style
because here the dough is made

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.660
with rice flour versus Baku style.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.960
It's made with wheat flour.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.650
And that's stuffed --

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.040
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.340
Oh, you can't hear?

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.640
Can you hear well?

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.990
Can you hear?

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.880
Hello. True.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.970
Hello? Can you hear?

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.570
&gt;&gt; Feride Buyuran:
Okay, much better?

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.870
Okay, sorry.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:56.270
I'd like to talk about the
history of Azerbaijani cuisine.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:01.930
One of the most important factors
that really started the development

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.970
of Azerbaijani cuisine is
the Silk Road that started

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:08.910
in China's Xinjiang
Province in 183 BC,

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.140
and it lasted to the 15th century.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.510
So all these caravans
started bringing spices, rice,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.330
and all kinds of commodities,
passed through Azerbaijan,

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.520
and there are lots
of caravan routes.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.230
You can see in the picture they're
basically inns that were built

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:29.020
to accommodate the traders
that passed through Azerbaijan.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.180
This one is in Sheki,
and on the first floor,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.480
the trade was happening.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.780
The camels were resting.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.480
On the second floor,
they were sleeping.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.030 position:56%
It's like a hotel room, and so with
the Silk Road, new ingredients came.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:47.060 position:56%
For example, spices came from India
we use a lot of cardamom and baking,

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.690
for Nowruz baking especially.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.750
Cardamom, turmeric,
those fennel seeds,

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.990
anise seeds, they came from India.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.210
And saffron came from Persia.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.590
So the silk Road really played
a big role in bringing a lot

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.500
of ingredients to Azerbaijan,
and saffron was very important.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.760
Still is. It came -- the
earliest mention of saffron

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.070
and Azerbaijan was
in the 9th century.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.370
It was really expensive.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.640
It was exchanged for
gold coins only.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.770
And not all the ingredients came,

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.180
but also dishes came
with the Silk Road.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.140
For example, we have this dish
which is like a rice pudding.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.440
It's called firni.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.140
The same thing is made in Iran.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.450
A very similar dishes made in
Pakistan in northern India.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.850
So it's believed that it
came with the Silk Road,

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.030
and very good firni
is made in Sheki.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.460
My assumption is that it came
to Sheki first via the Silk Road

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.180
and then it distributed to
the rest of the country.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.200
But I haven't proven it yet.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.400
It just my assumption.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.530
Tea becomes a staple, as well.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.880
Azerbaijan is a very
big tea drinking --

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.830
we have a very big
tea-drinking culture.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.260
There's a kettle on the stove
all day long, and whoever walks

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.510
in the door, we have to
treat them to a glass of tea.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.130
But how did tea come to us?

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.950
It came from China via
the Silk Road, again.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.940
The leaves originated in China,

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.730
but until the 18th century,
it was mostly an import.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.920
So we really didn't
grow tea ourselves.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.960
It was mostly coming from
other places from China,

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.400
but in the 19th century
-- in the 18th century,

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.380
the first factory was established
in the church of Azerbaijan,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.530
and that's how the tea industry
developed in the country.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.420
And this is a glass of tea.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.840
You can see this is samovar,
something that came from Russia,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.620
More of our Russian influence,
although a very archaic,

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.220
samovar was found on the
church of Azerbaijan in Sheki.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:50.010
So there are theories about
where samovar was first born,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.060
but the shape resembles
the Russian style,

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.290
and the glass is a
pear-shaped, just like in Turkey.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.070
We call it [non-English
word spoken],

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.060
which comes from [non-English
word spoken] is pear.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.360
So it's pear-shaped.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.710
And what else?

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:10.630
So in the 7th century, Arab
expansion happened in Azerbaijan.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.580
With that changes happen, as well.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.610
For example, sharbat a
more commonly used drink,

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.370 position:56%
versus wine that was were popular
before that, because the consumption

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.820
of alcohol was prohibited in Islam.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.200 position:56%
And you can see beautiful vessels
here in the middle and on the right.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.620
This is where sharbats were served.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.370
In the middle, this is called
[non-English word spoken],

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:37.400
and on the right, later on, after
the 15th century, it was replaced

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:43.260
with special bowls,
intricately ornated and designed.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.590
And Turkic migration
was also brought a lot

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.640
of changes to the cuisine.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.790
Turks it started to populate
the territory of Azerbaijan

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.300
from the 6th to the 11th century.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.580
More Turks came in the 11th
century, and with them,

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.840
they brought their own cooking
techniques, their own ingredients.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.600
They brought this art of making
kebabs, very down to earth dish,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.720
but it was very popular
in Azerbaijan.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.450
They also brought dumplings, which
are believed to have traveled

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:19.370
through Central Asia from China,
and we have a lot of dumplings.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.950
You can see the picture
in the middle.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.450
These dumplings are called guza

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.170
and they resemble Chinese
[non-English word spoken]

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.470
or Japanese[non-English
word spoken].

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.770
And Azerbaijan gurza.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.320
I think the name is
very similar, although,

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.010
guza also is the name of a snake.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.680
So also, you see arishta, which
is believed to have traveled

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.060
from Persia, although it's believed

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.790
that the Turks really embraced
it and made it their own.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.330
We use noodles.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.720
Those are noodles, basically.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.810
And there is also, we were also
introduced to the use of yogurt,

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.090
which is a staple in
Azerbaijani cuisine.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.670
We scoop yogurt on
top of many dishes,

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.600
vegetarian dishes, pasta dishes.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.590
You can see in the picture
soup that's called dovgha.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.250
It's a yogurt soup filled
with lots of fresh herbs.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:10.450
It's very refreshing and
delicious at the same time.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.540
The most dramatic impact of --

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.110
on Azerbaijani cuisine happen
during the Soviet Union.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.960
What happened during the
Soviet Union, you know,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.030
the Soviets had this
idea of the same for all.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:27.190 position:56%
So that means that all the republics
that were in the Soviet Union,

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.090
part of the Soviet Union,
15 republics altogether,

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.240
they had to have the same
eating habits, the same menus,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.620
so they introduced the
same for all style.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.280
Cafeterias opened across
the country,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.190
and all of these cafeterias
served the Soviet-style foods,

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:44.580
which include some
of the things you see

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.640
in the picture [non-English
word spoken], for example.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.690
These sausages, Soviet-style
sausages.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:50.100
There was mashed potatoes;

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.190
[non-English word spoken],
which is meat patties.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:58.270
Buckwheat and other
similar Russian foods.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.040
So everything was controlled
from Moscow.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.930
That's where all the rules were
made, all the decrees were adopted.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.570
And the cuisine was primarily based
on elements of Russian cuisine,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:14.840 position:56%
although for festive occasions, they
adopted elements of other cuisines.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.140
For example [non-English
word spoken],

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.440
which comes from the word
[non-English word spoken].

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.740
It's a kebab.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.220
They adopted it from the Caucuses
and also from Central Asia,

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:26.100
but mostly it was built on the
elements of Russian cuisine.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:34.440
Some not very good things
happened during the Soviet time.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.840
Rice production declined.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.500 position:56%
When I was researching for my book,
I realized that before the Russians,

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.820
before the Soviet Union was
established in Azerbaijan,

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.590
there was a big rice-growing
industry in the country.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.800
When the Russians came,
when the Soviets came,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.610
they realized that this is a very
labor's process to grow rice,

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.450
and it wasn't really fitting
the Soviet style of eating.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:00.060
So a lot of plantations, rice
plantations, were abolished,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.420
and instead of them, cabbage
plantations were started,

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.200
potato plantations started.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.870
So rice dishes that
were very popular before

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:16.310
and were really a part of the
cuisine before, now they became,

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.030
they started to be served
at the end of the dinner

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.770 position:56%
for something, or something festive.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.630
Spice bazaars also were demolished,

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.630
because Soviet cuisine did not
require the use of a lot of spices.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.450
So spice bazaars disappeared,
as well.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:36.170
And new drinks came into existence,
such as European-style drinks.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:41.330
Sharbats disappeared, and the
German winemaking tradition

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.550
that existed before the Soviets
came also suffered, as well.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:51.100
We had a German population
Azerbaijan that came.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.440 position:56%
Those were German colonies that were
established in the 19th century,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.780
and they brought with them
their winemaking skills,

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.730
and they started winemaking
industry in Azerbaijan.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.000
Unfortunately, they had to be
exiled to Siberia and Kazakhstan

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.180
because of the war of
the USSR and Germany.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.150
In 1941, they had to
leave Azerbaijan,

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:14.020
and these are some pictures
of the German winemaking time,

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.350
and new breads were introduced.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.620
Instead of traditional breads, such
as lavash, tandoor, and others,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.390 position:56%
Soviet style loaves, long and round,
were established across the country,

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.180
and my grandfather actually
owned one Soviet bakery.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.480
That's his picture.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.880
This is a picture of him.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.070
He ran away from the
Stalinist exile.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:36.880
He hid in another region, and later
on, he realized there was a need

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.660
for a Soviet-style
bakery, and he started one.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.320
So that's him down there.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.490
And after the collapse
of the Soviet Union,

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.800
goods things started to happen.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.890
We started to receive a lot of
new foods from other countries.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.020
The first foods that came to us
in Azerbaijan were Turkish foods,

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.510
because of the proximity
of the regions,

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.500
and also because of the
tastes were very similar.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.740
So the first foods that came
to Azerbaijan, I remember,

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.060
in the early 1990s, when the
Soviet Union had just collapsed,

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.940
was the doughnut kebab,
the spiraling meat

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.050
that was really fancy back then,
but it's really widely spread now.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:15.090
So Azerbaijanis started to
reclaim their traditions

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.390
of preparing traditional meals
more often now in restaurants,

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.470
they serve a lot of things
that were not served before,

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.950
for example, piti.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.250
This is piti.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.840
It's a lamb stew with chestnuts
cooked in a special pot.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.620 position:56%
And special days in food traditions,

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.440
you've heard about
Nowruz a little bit.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:41.430
So I just want to say that a lot
of traditions, a lot of holidays,

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.860
they have food traditions
involved in them.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:49.280
So in weddings, a lot of foods,
even when two families meet,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.300 position:56%
the families of the bride and groom,
the first ceremony, when they agreed

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.840
to the marriage, is a tea ceremony.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:58.350
They sweeten the tea, which
means that the union is going

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:02.360
to take place, and so the
commemorations, for example,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.500
when death happens in the
family, halwa is made.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.690
It's believed to soothe
the pain of the grief,

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:11.700
and this is my daughter holding a
plate [non-English word spoken].

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.160
It's sprouted wheat.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.510
They symbolize abundance
and fertility,

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.630
and this is Baku-style baklava,
one of many styles of baklava

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.510
that is made in Azerbaijan.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.040
You can see the different styles,

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.590
you can read about the different
types of baklava in my cookbook.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:30.130
This is a Baku style or Ganga style
baklava, and this is shakerbura.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.730
It's intricately designed
with something

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.220
that is called [non-English
word spoken],

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.280
and baklava actually
symbolizes stars.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.550
Shakerbura symbolizes
half-moon, and this is shorgoghal.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.850
It symbolizes the sun.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.860
It's a flaky, spice-filled
flatbread.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.210
They're really good.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.950
And the most important thing is
the tradition of hospitality.

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:55.180
We have a saying that says,
"A house without a guest is

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.480
like a mill without water."

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.780
And it's very true.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.140
For Westerners, our hospitality
may seem overwhelming,

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.980
because we push everybody
to eat and drink.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.300
Even if you are not
hungry, you have to eat.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.930
So you cannot refuse the food,
because you have to be polite,

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.960
because there is so much labor put
into preparing something for you.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.240
Always express gratitude
to the host.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.730
At the very end, I wanted to
review this quote that I found

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.030
in Alexander Dumas's book
Adventures in Caucasia.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.330
I really love this.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:28.030
It really gives the gist
Azerbaijani culture.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.730
So this is what he said.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.290
"The officer commanding the
nearby village of Sourakhani came

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.020
to invite us to take tea with him.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.940
Tea is hardly the right word,

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.400
for we found he had prepared
an excellent supper for us,

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.480
a Tatar meal of shashlyk,
pears, grapes, and watermelons.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.690
He also offered us rooms if
we cared to stay the night."

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.020
Tatar, by the way, is how we were
called during the Russian Empire,

00:35:52.020 --> 00:36:00.150
and I hope you get to try the
signs of hospitality firsthand

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.420
if you visit Azerbaijan, and I hope
you try the food of Azerbaijan.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.710
If you don't go there,
we have food served here,

for a few questions.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.060
I think we have time

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.360

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.660
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: I think we
have time for a few questions

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:36.720
if anybody has a question
for our speaker.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.520
Yes?

[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.400
It's more nationwide.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.090
For example, in Baku, there
are restaurants that serve food

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.920
from other regions of Azerbaijan,
something that, for example,

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.990 position:56%
hasn't been served during the Soviet
times, but now it's being served.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:21.920
So it's more on a general,
in general, yes.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.880
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Any
other questions for us?

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.210
Yes, Angela?

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:31.850
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] like there
is here in the US for meats

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:37.570 position:56%
that are organic versus non-organic?

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:42.320
Are the animals that you have
there fed [inaudible] or --

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Feride Buyuran: I think there is.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.620
I haven't lived there for 15 years,

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.720
but I believe if you buy
something that's, for example,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.010
my mom never buys chicken
that's sold in supermarkets.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:57.290
She buys chicken from somebody
who raises the chickens herself.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.820
Like it's village-grown chicken.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.150
So naturally, it doesn't have
any hormones or everything,

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.070
but as far as I know, some
of the chickens that sell

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:10.200
in the supermarkets have some
bad stuff, just like here.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.370
You know? So there is a
classification just like here.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.950
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: One last question.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.260
Anybody? Well, I think
we're all very anxious

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.910
to taste some of this cuisine.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:31.060
If you search under your chair,
four people will find a red bow,

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.250
and if you have a red
bow, if you bring it up,

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.550
Feride will sign your book,

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:40.510

start through the line.
