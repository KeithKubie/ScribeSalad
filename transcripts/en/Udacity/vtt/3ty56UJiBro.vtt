00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now with that in mind, I've given you the template of most of the the fill&lt;u&gt;in function,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I want you to just put in two missing pieces.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What does the fill&lt;u&gt;in function do?&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
First, it finds all the letters in the formula, and I want you to fill in that piece.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then it iterates a collection called the digits, a permutation of the digits

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
taken from all the digits n at a time, and you have to fill in the right value of n.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then it builds a table from taking the letters.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That means you want to make sure that the letters up here are represented

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
as a string and not as some other type of collection.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It makes a translation table from the letters

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and a string of all the digits that we got out of the permutations.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The function itertools.permutations returns a tuple of results,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and so we want to join together that tuple into one big string,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
make up the translation table, and then call formula with the translate method

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
with that table to translate all the letters into the appropriate digits and yield that result.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
In other words, fill&lt;u&gt;in is a generator function not a function that returns a list of results.&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Why did I do it that way? Well, because you might get lucky.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It might be that the very first formula you try or one of the few

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
first formulas you try is the correct one.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If I do for f in fill&lt;u&gt;in a formula, I ask for the first formula, and if it is valid,&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
then I want to return it right away.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I don't want to waste time calculating all the other possible fill&lt;u&gt;ins.&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's why a generator makes more sense here.

00:01:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
See if you can fill in these two missing pieces.
