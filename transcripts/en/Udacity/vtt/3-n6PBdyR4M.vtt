00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.870
The answer to this question is 25, unique chromosomes

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.410
in the total cellular genome. What I wanted you to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.940
do was look at our nuclear mitochondrial chromosomes, take the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.110
first pair, we don't want the extra copy, right, there

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.430
are two copies in this pair. We just going to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.470
count that one as a unique chromosome. It's unique. It's

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.090
different from all the other chromosomes. And the same thing

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.320
for the second pair. We're not going to count the copy,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.750
this is two. Third, three. Four, all the way till we get to 20, 21, 22.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.960
And our last pair, the 23rd pair, though.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.810
We're going to count each chromosome by itself, because

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.490
they're not the same. The X and Y

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.200
are different. So, chromosome, there's a 23rd unique one

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.140
and a 24th unique one. And then, if

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.200
we include the mitochondrial chromosome, that's 25 unique chromosomes.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.610
Remember, you have one extra copy of every

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.180
other autosome in your genome at any given

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880
time in the cell and there are many

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.450
mitochonria and thus many mitochondrial chromosomes in a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.629
cell at any given moment. But when we

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.870
talk about the total cellular genome, how many

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.980
unique chromosomes there are There are a total

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.520
of 25 when we leave out the extra copies.
