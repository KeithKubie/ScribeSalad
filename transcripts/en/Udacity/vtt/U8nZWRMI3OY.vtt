00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
Bit Torrent's solution to free-riding is called

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.870
choking, which is a type of game theoretic

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.950
strategy, called tit for tat. Choking is

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.460
a temporary refusal to upload chunks to another

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.740
peer that is requesting them. Downloading, of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.300
course, occurs as normal. But if a node

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.010
is unable to download from any particular

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.460
peer, it simply doesn't upload to that peer.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.560
This ensures that nodes cooperate. And

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.160
eliminates the free rider problem. If you're

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.240
interested in the game theory behind

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.020
why this strategy ensures cooperation, I encourage

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.510
you to go read about the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.550
repeated prisoner's dilemma problem. Where, a tit-for-tat

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.870
strategy, such as that which is shown

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.790
here, ensures cooperation among mutually distrustful parties.
