00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's say that you're
curious about studying

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.000
the dimensions of
the cars that happen

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.370
to sit in the parking lot.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.740
And so you measure
their lengths.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.740
Let's just make the
computation simple.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.590
Let's say that there are
five cars in the parking lot.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.580
The entire size of the
population that we care about

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.140
is 5.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.730
And you go and measure
their lengths--

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.740
one car is 4 meters long,
another car is 4.2 meters long,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.700
another car is 5 meters
long, the fourth car

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.910
is 4.3 meters long,
and then, let's say

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.540
the fifth car is
5.5 meters long.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.137
So let's come up with some
parameters for this population.

00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:48.220
So the first one that you
might want to figure out

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.080
is a measure of
central tendency.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.930
And probably the most popular
one is the arithmetic mean.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.380
So let's calculate that first.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.730
So we're going to do
that for the population.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.220
So we're going to use mu.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.330
So what is the
arithmetic mean here?

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.970
Well, we just have to add
all of these data points up

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.882
and divide by 5.

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:13.590
And I'll just get the
calculator out just

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.798
so it's a little bit quicker.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:28.200
This is going to be for 4 plus
4.2 plus 5 plus 4.3 plus 5.5.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.830
And then, I'm going to take
that sum and then divide by 5.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.170
And I get an arithmetic mean
for my population of 4.6.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.090
So that's fine.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.990
And if we want to put some
units there, it's 4.6 meters.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.170
Now, that's the central tendency
or measure of central tendency.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.730
We also might be curious about
how dispersed is the data,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.680
especially from that
central tendency.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.730
So what would we use?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.890
Well, we already have a
tool at our disposal--

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.160
the population variance.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.630
And the population
variance is one

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.930
of many ways of
measuring dispersion.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.880
It has some very neat
properties the way

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.430
we've defined it as the mean
of the squared distances

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.690
from the mean.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.380
It tends to be a
useful way of doing it.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.270
So let's just a bit.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.880
Let's actually calculate
the population variance

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.000
for this population
right over here.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.540
Well, all we need to
do is find the distance

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.750
from each of these points
to our mean right over here.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.750
And then, square them.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.920
And then, take the mean of
those two squared distances.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.390
So let's do that.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.110
So it's going to be
4 minus 4.6 squared

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:01.100
plus 4.2 minus 4.6 squared
plus 5 minus 4.6 squared

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.770
plus 4.3 minus 4.6 squared.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.930
And then, finally--
I'm running out

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.520
of space-- plus 5.5
minus 4.6 squared.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.980
And then, we're going to
divide all of that by 5

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.070
to get our population variance.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.570
And so what's that
going to give us?

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.150
Let's get our calculator out.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.320
4 minus 4.6 squared.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.382
That's negative 0.6 squared.

00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:32.840
Negative 0.6 squared
is going to be

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.400
the exact same thing
as 0.6 squared.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.660
So let me write
that as 0.6 squared

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.830
plus 4.2 minus 4.6
is negative 0.4.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.670
But when we square it, the
negative's going to disappear.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.120
So it's going to be plus 0.4.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.650
I'll just write 0.4 squared.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.860
And then, we have 5 minus 4.6.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.920
That's 0.4 so plus 0.4 squared.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.560
4.3 minus 4.6.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.520
It's negative 0.3.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.270
The negative goes away
when you square it.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.845
It's going to be
plus 0.3 squared.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.130
And then, finally, 5.5 minus
4.6 is going to be 0.9.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.455
So plus 0.9 squared.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.490
Then, we will divide by the
number of data points we have.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.630
And we get 0.316.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.170
Or if we want to write it,
this is going to be 0.316.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.940
Now, let me ask you what is a
mildly interesting question--

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.900
what would be the units for
this population variance?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.020
Since we happen to care
about units in this video.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.640
Well, up here, this is 4
meters minus 4.6 meters.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.640
4.2 meters minus 4.6 meters.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.010
So these are all meters.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.770
These are measurements
in meters.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.360
We saw it up here.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.150
So these are all
measurements in meters.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.100
When you subtract them,
you'll get meters.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.080
But then when you
square them, you

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.560
get meters squared plus meters
squared plus meters squared

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.490
plus meters squared
plus meters squared.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.820
And then, you're just dividing
that by a unitless count

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.660
of the number of
data points you have.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.980
So the units here are
going to be square meters.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.740
And so you might say, hey.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.760
That's kind of a
weird unit if we're

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.820
trying to visualize
or think about how

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.560
dispersed we are from the mean.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.260
When I visualize it,
I visualize dispersion

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.260
or how varied they are in terms
of meters, not meters squared.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.010
So what could we do?

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.640
And a big hint-- this
comes out of just even the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.550
notation for variance.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.870
And it's this sigma
symbol squared.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:59.230
So why don't we just take the
square root of our variance?

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.545
Which we will denote
with just a sigma.

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:03.390
It makes a lot of sense.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.740
And in this case,
what's it going to be?

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.490
It's going to be the
square root of 0.316.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.220
And then, what are
the units going to be?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.410
It's going to be just meters.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:24.250
And we end up with-- so let me
take the square root of 0.316.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.350
And I get 0.56-- I'll
just round to the nearest

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.200
thousandth-- 0.562.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.450
So this is approximately
0.562 meters.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.370
So you might be
saying, Sal, what do we

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.210
call this thing
that we just did?

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.980
The square root of the variance.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.240
And here we're dealing
with the population.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.060
We haven't thought
about sampling yet.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.560
The square root of the
population variance,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.450
what do we call this
thing right over here?

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.390
And this is a very
familiar term.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.910
Oftentimes, when
you take an exam,

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.820
this is calculated for
the scores on the exam.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.800
This is our population-- let
me do this in a new color.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.190
I'm using that yellow
a little bit too much.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:17.050
This is the population
standard deviation.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:25.300
It is a measure of how much the
data is varying from the mean.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.040
In general, the
larger this value,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.651
that means that the data is
more varied from the population

00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:30.150
mean.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.400
The smaller, it's less varied.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.740
And these are all somewhat
arbitrary definitions

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.080
of how we've defined variance.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.770
We could have taken things
to the fourth power.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.740
We could have done other things.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.570
We could have not
taken them to a power

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.547
but taking the
absolute value here.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.130
The reason why we
do it this way is it

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.460
has neat statistical properties
as we try to build on it.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.360
But that's the population
standard deviation,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.290
which gives us nice
units-- meters.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.440
In the next video, we'll think
about the sample standard

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.867
deviation.
