00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.868
- All right,
everyone take a seat.

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.737
- Wait, why does Justin
have a church in his house?

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.472
- And why does the cross
have a little foot on it?

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.141
- Oh, that's a "T" for Theroux,

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.076
because Justin believes
in himself so much.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.645
- Ugh, ew. Can we just go
back down to the living room?

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.981
- No, there's a lot
of bad stuff in this binder,

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.549
and I don't want Chase to hear.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.217
Now, I want
to start with Cary.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.420
- Great, yes, I've done
a lot of bad things.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.922
Um, when I was 11 years old,

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.591
I would get boners in church
because one of the altar boys

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:28.027
was super hot, so I would
just tuck my dick

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.962
up into my belt
during communion.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.931
- Cary.
- I know which altar boy.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.733
- And when was in
the eighth grade,

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.635
we took a class trip
to Water World,

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.470
and I purposefully rode
the log flume

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.073
with my friend Kevin's dad
so I could buy

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.308
the picture afterwards
and masturbate to it.

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.943
- Oh, honey,
did you hear he died?

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.445
- I did.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.281
And when I was 23,
I worked at a hotel

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.882
and Christopher Meloni
stayed there,

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.151
and one day he went
out to the pool,

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:55.121
so I snuck into his room
and smelled his underwear.

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:58.591
But then he returned
to a different room,

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.693
so I don't know
whose underwear I smelled.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.562
- Oh, my God.
Cary, let me cut to the chase.

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.530
- Ooh, we should
trademark that, my God.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.566
- I meant things
I could find online.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.236
You just described three
private, sad moments.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.205
How would I find those things?

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.574
- Oh.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.509
Then...

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.211
I'm just kidding.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.712
- You know what, I didn't find
anything bad on you.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.013
- Good.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:22.348
- You can go do
your little play,

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.816
but, Cary, please have sex.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.085
- I'm trying.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:27.820
- I know something bad
that I did online.

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:28.955
- Good luck, babe.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.623
- Beth Kellogg from church

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:32.525
is always posting photos
of these ducks in her yard.

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:35.361
So one night, I did have
a little glass of wine,

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.364
I commented,
"Enough with the ducks,"

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:39.999
and then I unfriended her.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.767
I already had
to change churches,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.438
and now I'm so worried
it's gonna ruin Chase's career.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:49.308
- Awww, that is absolutely
not in this binder.

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:50.443
- Ah.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.311
- Every single thing in here

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.846
is about Brooke.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.448
- Oh.
- Excuse me?

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.650
No, my whole thing
is smart, young progressive.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:00.153
So I don't know what
you think you found,

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.355
but...was it my Gchats?

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.090
- Nope.
- Oh, then I'm golden.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.625
Come at me.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.226
- You used the word
"retarded" on Twitter

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.829
no less than 56 times.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.764
- I mean, are we sure
that was me?

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.267
- Your first tweet was,
"Twitter is retarded.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.568
Come at me."

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.836
- Ooh.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.337
Well, that was
a long time ago.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.906
Now I'm a social
justice warrior.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.474
People on Twitter
always tell me

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.309
I'm a classic white feminist.

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.710
- That's not good.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.779
And we deleted that account.
- What?

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:29.782
- I also deleted
photos of you from Halloween

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.184
as Terri Schiavo.
- What?

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.487
- Okay, I went as
Terri Schiavo before,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.989
and then I happened
to pass out at the party.

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.958
- Okay, shall I continue?

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.626
- Well, if you
have anything else.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.461
- Let's talk about
your LiveJournal.

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:43.629
- Oh, no.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:44.764
- What do you mean?

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.399
He's our brother.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.334
- Keep your voice down.
He's been through enough.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.937
- He has a right to know.
- No, we have to protect him.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.906
[cell phone buzzes]
That's what family does.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.475
So it's settled.

00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:58.611
We decide tomorrow.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:01.480
- Agreed. Brian?

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:04.150
- No.
- No?

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.219
- You think I want to say no?

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.820
Like some kind of sick freak?

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:10.389
- Of course not, but--
- But nothing!

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:13.960
We decide the day
after tomorrow.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:18.097
- And finally,
your Venmo account.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.100
- Okay, what could I have
possibly done wrong on Venmo?

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:24.070
- Every time you pay Cary
for anything,

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:27.740
you write that it's for
"slamming that puss."

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:28.908
- Brooke.
- Well, okay.

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:30.209
That is just sibling humor.

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:31.611
- We deleted
that account too.

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.379
- [sighs]
- And that's it.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.448
- Really?
I'm okay?

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.284
- Well, karmically, you need
to do some soul searching.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.886
- Yeah.
- Optically, we're fine.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.054
- Okay.
- All right.

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:43.689
Let's call Yendani, people.

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:46.726
- This is gonna be so romantic.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.194
[beep]

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.695
<i> - Hi, Yendani.</i>

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.264
- Hey, Chase.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.898
- Okay, kids, so tonight

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.767
we'll start off
with Instagram live,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.270
and then tomorrow I have you
on the red carpet

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.639
for the Hot 97 Summer Jam.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.874
- Oh, my God,
I love Summer Jam.

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:06.045
Okay, one year I got so drunk,
and I went home with this guy,

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:07.680
but I was dating somebody else,

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:10.549
and so I waited until
he was asleep to kiss him.

00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:12.451
That way it wasn't cheating.

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:15.355
[laughs]
- That's sexual assault.

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.960
- Oh, oh.
No, no, you're confused.

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:23.796
I'm a girl,
and he just wasn't awake.

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.765
And I kissed him, so...

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:29.201
<i> - Yeah, no,
 that's sexual assault.</i>

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:31.470
- You know, you make
a great point, Yendani,

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:35.641
and we're gonna take a break
and just think about that.

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.277
<i> So...</i>

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.547
Okay, we're on mute now.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.784
So everybody keep smiling
and don't move your lips,

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.218
'cause this is very bad.

00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:48.154
- Am I doing it?
Are my lips moving?

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:49.755
- Oh, I gotta get
those pictures.

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:51.624
Who do I gotta suck?
Who do I gotta [bleep]?

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.426
- There are no pictures.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.094
- Did he wake up
and file a report?

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:57.630
- No, he doesn't know.
Like, nobody knows.

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.332
- Oh, nobody knows?

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.599
Okay, ooh.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:02.068
- Oh, okay.
- Who gives a shit?

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.070
- Okay, we're fine.
We're fine.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.072
- No, we're not fine.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:10.042
Yendani said it.
I committed sexual assault.

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:13.145
- But no one knows.
- But I know.

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:15.047
And strong, powerful women

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.550
like me and Yendani,

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.952
we don't do stuff like this.

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:22.154
I have to go tell him.

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:24.957
Someone DVR "Real Housewives
of Atlanta" for me.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.527
- I don't think Justin has DVR.

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.998
- Damn it.
