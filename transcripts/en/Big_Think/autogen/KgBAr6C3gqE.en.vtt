evidence thinking about histories of
justice it allows us to have those

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
justice it allows us to have those
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190

that doesn't really get us forward
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.820
that doesn't really get us forward
certainly it is the case we should not

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
certainly it is the case we should not
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160

to air ideas and giving everybody time
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.000
to air ideas and giving everybody time
to do that so that we can have

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
to do that so that we can have
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.310
to do that so that we can have
