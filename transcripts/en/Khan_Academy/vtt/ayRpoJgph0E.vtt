00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.900
The following table contains
the first five terms

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.410
of the given Pattern
A. Generate Pattern

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.190
B according to this rule.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.390
For every term of Pattern
A-- so they give us

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.290
the terms of Pattern A
here-- multiply the term by 3

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.090
and add 1 to get the
corresponding term of Pattern

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.120
B. Then graph the pairs
of corresponding terms.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.660
So for every term in Pattern A,
we want to multiply by 3 and 1.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.170
So if we multiply
0 by 3, we get 0.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.325
And you add 1, you get 1.

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:34.710
If you multiply 1
by 3, you get 3.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.530
And then you add 1, you get 4.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.462
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:47.510
3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.930
Remember, we're just
multiplying by 3 and adding 1.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.040
4 times 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.380
So those are the corresponding
terms for Pattern B.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.920
And then they ask
us to graph them.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.510
So let's try to
graph these points.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.400
So when Pattern A is
0, Pattern B is 1.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.110
When Pattern A is 0-- so
this is Pattern A equaling 0.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.800
That's our horizontal axis, the
value of Pattern A-- Pattern B

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.050
is the value of
our vertical axis.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.630
Pattern B is 1.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.700
When Pattern A is
1, Pattern B is 4.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020
So when Pattern A is
1, Pattern B is 4.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.420
Pattern B is on
the vertical axis.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.845
When Pattern A is
2, Pattern B is 7.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.264
When Pattern A is 3,
Pattern B is 10, so 3

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:46.430
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.990
That's our Pattern A value.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.550
And our Pattern B value is 10.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.325
And then, finally, when Pattern
A is 4, Pattern B is 13.

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:00.420
Now, let's just look
at these patterns.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.750
We see Pattern A is
increasing by 1 each time,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.479
while Pattern B is
increasing by it's-- well,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.400
Pattern A starts at
0 and increases by 1,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
while Pattern B starts
at 1 and increases by 3,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.550
which makes complete sense.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.925
It makes sense that it starts
at 1, because all of these,

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:21.760
you multiply by 3 and add 1.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.162
So you start at 1.

00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:25.120
And then, the fact that
we're multiplying by 3,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.430
that's what's leading to the
distance between these points

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.410
being 3.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.830
So let's check our answer to
make sure we got this right,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.640
and we did.
