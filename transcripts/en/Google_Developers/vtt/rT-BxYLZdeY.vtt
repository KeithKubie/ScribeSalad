Alex Willen: Box is a cloud content
management company.

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:10.250
We provide online storage and
collaboration features for businesses.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.000
So, it's like a file system in the cloud,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.542
but with a software layer on top of it

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:16.208
that allows you to easily
share content with others.

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:19.375
And while we provide sort of
the online version of a hard drive

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.250
that allows you to store
your content online,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.542
Chrome takes it one step further

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.833
by taking the entire operating
system online.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:28.875
Jeremy Glassenberg: Our first integration
with Chrome was a single sign-on solution,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.667
so that any Google user
who was utilizing Chrome--

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.375
either the Chrome OS or the browser--

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.292
has an easy way of accessing Box
through the App Store.

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:41.167
So, we enjoy the fact that any files
you traditionally work with

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.292
through the Chrome OS 

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.000
can easily go right into Box
and from there,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.542
interact with your customers,

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:48.917
with your co-workers,

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:51.625
and with the other Google services
that you're used to.

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:54.250
We especially like the latest update
that Chrome's providing,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.625
where if you have content on your desktop,
on your Chrome device,

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.292
you're getting it into your Chrome device.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:04.375
It's very easy to get it
from Chrome onto the cloud.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:06.250
And with the Box APIs, 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.417
as was acknowledged
by the Google Chrome team,

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:12.542
it was very easy to connect
our APIs to Chrome's APIs

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:14.083
so that just in a matter of days, 

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:17.792
we were able to get files
uploading from Chrome into Box.

00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:20.542
Alex Willen: So yeah, we're very excited
to be integrated into Chrome OS.

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:22.625
It's pretty simple,
which is the way we like things.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.250
If you have, for example, a USB drive,
and you plug it into your Chrome OS notebook,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.167
you'll see that content in Chrome OS
in their file browser.

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:32.625
You easily just select a file,
click "Upload to Box,

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.292
pick what directory you want it
to go into and it uploads right away.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:39.125
It's a very simple, two-click process.
