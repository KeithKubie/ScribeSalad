00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
Imagine two people.
Two extremely wealthy people.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.620
One of them inherited their money, acquiring it
through the luck that comes with being born to owners
of immense amounts of property and wealth.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.900
And the other person worked for what they
have.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.910
They started at the bottom, and through
years of hard work and clever dealing, they built
a business empire.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.100
Now: which one would you say deserves their
wealth?

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.900
Sociologically, the interesting thing here
isn't your answer, not really.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.140
It's the fact that different societies in
different times and places have different
answers to this question.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.040
Because the question of what it means to
deserve wealth, or success, or power, is a matter
of social stratification.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:48.220

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.640
Social stratification is what we’re talking
about, when we talk about inequality.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.920
It's a system by which society categorizes
people, and ranks them in a hierarchy.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.640
Everything from social status and prestige, to the
kind of job you can hold, to your chances of living
in poverty, are affected by social stratification.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.920
That’s because, one of the first principles
of social stratification is that it’s universal,
but variable.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.720
It shows up in every society on the planet,
but what exactly it looks like –

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.080
how it divides and categorizes people, and the
advantages or disadvantages that come with that
division – vary from society to society.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.740
Realizing that social stratification exists
in every society brings us to another principle:

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.240
that stratification is a characteristic of
society, and not a matter of individual differences.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.900
People are obviously all different from each other,
so we might assume that stratification is just a kind
of natural outcome of those differences, but it's not.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.220
We know this because we can see the effects
of social stratification on people, independent
of their personal choices or traits:

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:49.080
For example, children of wealthy families are more likely to live longer and be healthier, to attend college, and to excel in school than children born into poverty.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.260
And they’re also more likely to be wealthy
themselves when they grow up.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.140
And this highlights another key principle
of social stratification:

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260
It persists across generations.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.440
So, stratification serves to categorize and
rank members of society, resulting in different
life chances.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.720
But generally, society allows some degree
of social mobility, or changes in position
within the social hierarchy.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.540
People sometimes move upward or downward
in social class, and this is what we usually think of
when we talk about social mobility.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.880
But more common in the United States is horizontal
mobility, changing positions without changing
your standing in the social hierarchy.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.580
This generally happens when a person moves
between jobs that pay about the same and have
about the same occupational prestige.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.480
Like stratification itself, social mobility
isn't just a matter of individual achievement;
there are structural factors at play, too.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.200
In fact, we can talk specifically about
structural social mobility:

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.860
when a large number of people move around
the hierarchy because of larger societal changes.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.520
When a recession hits, and thousands of people
lose their jobs and are suddenly downwardly
mobile, that's structural mobility.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.160
But stratification isn't just a matter of
economic forces and job changes.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.920
Which brings us to another aspect of social
stratification:

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.750
It isn't just about economic and social inequalities;
it’s also about beliefs.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.160
A society’s cultural beliefs tell us how to categorize people, and they also define the inequalities of a stratification system as being normal, even fair.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.320
Put simply: if people didn't believe that
the system was right, it wouldn’t last.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.260
Beliefs are what make systems of
social stratification work.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.520
And it’s these beliefs about social
stratification that inform what it means to
deserve wealth, or success, or power.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:26.080
These four principles give us a better understanding
of what social stratification is, but they still haven't told
us much about what it looks like in the real world.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.560
So, sociologists classify stratification systems
as being either closed or open.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.060
Closed systems tend to be extremely rigid
and allow for little social mobility.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.620
In these systems, social position is based
on ascribed status, or the social position
you inherit at birth.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.140
On the other hand, open systems of
stratification allow for much more social mobility,
both upward and downward.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.640
Social position tends to be achieved, not
ascribed.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.360
Now, these terms are pretty theoretical, so let’s look
at some examples of more closed or open systems,
as well as societies that fall in the middle.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.920
The archetypal closed system is a caste system.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.230
Of these, India's caste system is probably
one of the best known.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.400
And while it’s a social system of decreasing
importance, it still holds sway in parts of rural India,
and it has a strong legacy across the country.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.760
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble:

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.300
The traditional caste system contains four
large divisions, called varnas: Brahman, Kshatriya,
Vaishya, and Sudra.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.540
Together these varnas encompass hundreds of
smaller groups called jatis at the local level.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.180
The caste system in its traditional form is
a clear example of an extremely rigid, closed,
and unequal system.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.789
Caste position not only determined what jobs
were acceptable, but it also strongly controlled its
members’ everyday lives and life outcomes.

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.780
The system required endogamy, or marriage
within your own caste category.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.120
And in everyday life, the caste system
determined who you could interact with and how,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.360
with systems of social control restricting
contact between lower and higher castes.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.280
And this whole system was based on a set
of strong cultural and religious beliefs,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.120
establishing caste as a right of birth and
living within the strictures of your caste as a
moral and spiritual duty.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.280
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.040
We see a variation of the caste system in
feudal Europe with the division of society
into three orders or estates:

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.520
the nobility, the clergy, and the commoners.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.600
Again, a person's birth determined his social
standing;

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.379
commoners, for instance, paid the most taxes
and owed labor to their local lord.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.610
So they had little expectation that they’d
rise above their station.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.220
The whole social order was justified on the
belief that it was ordained by god, with the
nobility ruling by so-called divine right.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.340
Both caste systems use ancestry and lineage
as a main principle of social stratification,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.520
but race has also been used as the main
distinction in closed social systems.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.420
The South African system of apartheid, for instance,
maintained a legally enforced separation between
black people and white people for decades.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.080
Apartheid denied black people citizenship,
the ability to own land, and any say whatsoever
in the national government.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.500
The Jim Crow laws of the American South were
another example, as was slavery before that.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.480
In contrast with caste systems, class systems
are the archetypal open systems.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.320
They aren't based solely on ascribed status
at birth.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.900
Instead they combine ascribed status and
personal achievement in a way that allows for
some social mobility.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.980
Class is the system of stratification we have
in American society.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.060
The main difference between caste and class
systems is that class systems are open,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.300
and social mobility is not legally restricted
to certain people.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.580
There aren't formally defined categories in
the same way there are in the Traditional
Indian Caste system.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.080
Being in the “under-class” in the U.S.
is not equivalent to being an “untouchable”
from India.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.960
In class systems, the boundaries between
class categories are often blurred,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.420
and there’s greater opportunity for social
mobility into and out of class positions.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.100
The American system of stratification is founded
on this very idea, in fact:

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.240
that it’s possible, through hard work and
perseverance, to move up the social hierarchy,
to achieve a higher class standing.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.220
And this points to another difference in
systems of stratification:

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.280
Instead of ancestry, lineage, or race being
the key to social division,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:50.740
the American system has elements of a
meritocracy, a system in which social mobility is
based on personal merit and individual talents.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.580
The American dream is that anyone, no matter how
poor, can "pull themselves up by their bootstraps"

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.320
and become upwardly class mobile,
through nothing but hard work and gumption.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.620
The American system is certainly more meritocratic
than feudal Europe or traditional India;

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.420
but the idea of meritocracy is as much a justification
for inequality as it is an actual principle of stratification.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:16.620
In an open, class-based system of
stratification, it’s easy to believe that anyone who’s
not upwardly mobile deserves their poverty.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:23.140
Because a meritocratic class system is supposed
to be open, it’s easy to ignore the structural
factors that influence class standing.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.920
But just as the Indian caste system and feudal
estate system placed their limits on certain groups,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.210
the American class system limits just
how far hard work can take some people.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.740
The US class system tends to reproduce
existing class inequalities,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.380
because the advantages that you start with
have an incredibly powerful impact on where
you can end up.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.559
This is part of the reason that the US is
still stratified along race and gender lines.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.000
That said, these inequalities are no longer
explicitly enshrined in the law, which is an example
of the greater openness of class systems.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.780
Because of this openness, class systems also have
a greater likelihood of opportunity for individuals to
experience status inconsistency:

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.240
a situation where a person’s social position
has both positive and negative influences on their
social status

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.300
Stratification isn’t just a matter of one
thing after all.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.999
When we talk about socioeconomic status, for
instance, we’re including three things:

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:12.719
income, education, and occupational prestige.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.540
An example of status inconsistency is an
adjunct professor who’s very well educated,
but earns a low income.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.900
There’s an inconsistency among these different
aspects of their social status;

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.099
low income tends to decrease social status
while at the same time, a high level of education

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.900
and the societal respect for the occupation
of college professor improves social status.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.580
All these comparisons between closed and
open systems might make it sound like they’re
totally different:

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.120
a system is either one
or the other.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.320
But really they’re two poles on a spectrum.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.230
Not every society is strictly a caste system
or a class system.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.400
Modern Britain, for instance, is a good illustration
of a mixed system of stratification.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.160
It still maintains a limited caste system
of nobility as a legacy of the feudal system
of estates,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.640
which survives alongside, and helps
reinforce, a class system similar to what
we have in the U.S.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.080
And some systems of stratification even
claim that its citizens are entirely equal, as
the Soviet Union did.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:12.220
Following the Russian Revolution of 1917,
the USSR was established as a theoretically
classless society.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.280
But inequality is more than just economic.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.060
And Soviet society was stratified into four
groups, each of which held various amounts
of political power and prestige:

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.500
apparatchiks or government officials, intelligentsia,
industrial workers, and the rural peasantry.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.540
So, like I mentioned before, stratification
is universal, but variable.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:36.940
If you want to study a society, one of the things
that you need to look at is that way that it’s stratified,
and whether, and how, social mobility occurs.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.300
Today we learned about social stratification.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.720
We talked about four basic principles of a
sociological understanding of stratification.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.600
We discussed open and closed
systems of stratification,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:52.940
and finally we talked about examples of
different kinds of stratification systems, including
caste systems and class systems.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:59.980
Next time we'll talk more about the why and
how of stratification by looking at different
sociological theories of stratification.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.460
