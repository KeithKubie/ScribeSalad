00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.610
So we think of ourselves as
dynamic, autonomous creatures

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.700
that have agency and
free will, right?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.000
We move about the world, and
things don't influence us

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.250
because we have free will.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.925
We have the capacity to decide
at every moment who we are

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.200
and where we're going, right?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
That is what we do.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.160
Except when you look
deeper, you actually

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.620
find that mind,
that consciousness,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.200
is in fact not necessarily
autonomous from the world

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.160
in which it dwells.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.290
In other words, consciousness
is a co-production.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.650
Consciousness is a collaboration
between subject and object.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.500
Professor David Lenson writes
about this in his book.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.880
So consider what that means.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.880
It basically means there's not
just one type of consciousness,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.380
right?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.390
There is this notion that
it's person multiplied

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.715
by place multiplied by time
that reveals a garden of forking

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:10.700
paths of possible
consciousnesses,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.120
of possible entities, and
that your consciousness is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.450
mediated-- again, if you
think about what I'm saying--

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.440
by the spaces that we dwell.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.820
In other words, the designs
that we create design us

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.120
in return, right?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.560
Ontological design.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.860
So what does that mean?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.630
It means that the
people you hang out with

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.090
determine who you are.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.280
It means that the
language you speak

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.470
sculpts your perception
of the world.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.620
It means that the
culture in which you live

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.402
shapes your worldview.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:43.060
It means that the people that
you meet meet you in return,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.600
and thus affect you.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.770
We are mediated beings.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950
The clothing that
we wear, uniforms,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.040
can structure our
beliefs about the world.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.100
I mean, even typography
can change how you think

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.480
and how you perceive it.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.250
This notion that the
wallpaper of the mind

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.230
can influence reality so much,
can influence consciousness,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.220
can influence perception, to the
degree that who and what we are

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.813
is determined by where we
are and where we dwell.

00:02:10.813 --> 00:02:12.390
The wallpaper matters, right?

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.740
What is within is without.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.160
What is without is within.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.180
We're like the dragon
eating its own tail.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.930
We're the ouroboros, OK?

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.500
We're Escher's hands.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.310
The hand is drawing
the hand that's

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.300
drawing the original hand.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.285
Whoosh.

00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:28.690
That's us.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.620
And again, what is the
takeaway of this idea?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.070
That we can create
our own reality--

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.620
that our creative and
linguistics choices govern

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.910
our faith.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.030
I design, therefore I become.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.290
The vertigo of freedom-- pfew.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.540
