00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:02.253
Bill: Well, first went the record stores

00:00:02.253 --> 00:00:04.254
then crowds thinned down at the library

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.670
and now you have to wonder
if physical classrooms

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.004
could become another
casualty of the Internet age.

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.919
Well if Khan Academy is
any indication, the old

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.886
schoolhouse will survive
but the way kids spend

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:17.587
their time inside it could change forever.

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:21.254
So why are millions logging on
to get lessons from one man?

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.671
Could your kids benefit?

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.547
My co-anchor, Terry
Moran went to find out.

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:26.843
(school bell rings)

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:28.231
Terry: No matter how old you are,

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.142
you can probably still
remember what the bell

00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:33.495
sounded like at your school.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.305
You can still remember
pushing your way through the

00:00:35.305 --> 00:00:38.587
hallways to your next
class or the minute hand on

00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:41.047
the clock in your math
class that you swore ran

00:00:41.047 --> 00:00:45.223
slower than every other clock in
the building, but that was then.

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.287
This is now.

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:50.387
Khan: 8 meters and the
same thing along the side.

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:53.123
Terry: Welcome to the Khan
Academy, online learning

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:56.788
on steroids, a one world
schoolhouse that is

00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:00.491
skyrocketing in popularity,
sparking controversy and

00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:02.567
fundamentally challenging the very notion

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.586
of education in the 21st century.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.973
Khan: What we're talking right
now is the learning side.

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:09.808
How can we democratize
the information, the

00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:11.755
knowledge, so that anyone
can get to whatever level

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.086
they want to.

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:15.481
Terry: Sal Khan founded
the Khan Academy kind of

00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:18.169
by accident, more on that in a minute.

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:20.650
First, the sheer scale of this thing.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.054
Seven million students
around the world are

00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:26.087
attending the Khan
Academy online every month

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:30.528
and that number is
growing by 400% per year.

00:01:30.528 --> 00:01:33.464
The thousands of lessons,
everything from Algebra

00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:36.504
to Medieval History to the
Fiscal Cliff, they've been

00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:41.587
viewed more than 200 million
times and all for free.

00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:45.048
Terry: Are you out to dismantle
our educational system?

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:47.213
Khan: I'm not an education radical.

00:01:47.213 --> 00:01:49.798
A lot of what I'm doing
and we're doing is really

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.132
bringing back very, very
old ideas that have been

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.596
proven, but somehow got lost in the fray?

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:57.928
Terry: Sal Khan is an
unlikely education reformer.

00:01:57.928 --> 00:02:01.262
He's a former hedge fund
analyst, MIT undergrad,

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:03.959
Harvard MBA, who just really stumbled

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.819
upon his revolution when
he tried to help a young

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.462
cousin with her algebra
homework back in 2004.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:12.325
Khan: I started tutoring her
remotely. I was in Boston,

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:15.940
she was in New Orleans
and after that I started

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.394
tutoring other family
members and eventually

00:02:17.394 --> 00:02:18.599
put the stuff on YouTube.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.128
Terry: In a few weeks, Khan
noticed that the "stuff"

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:23.802
that he was making for his
relatives was going viral.

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:27.904
The requests from strangers
for more, more, more.

00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:30.848
Khan: Antibiotics.

00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:32.977
Terry: Visually, they aren't
the kind of videos you'd

00:02:32.977 --> 00:02:36.683
expect to go viral. They're
more of a virtual blackboard,

00:02:36.683 --> 00:02:39.767
but they work and education
reformers all over the

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:43.122
world have noticed,
including some heavy hitters.

00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:45.517
Bill: There's a new website
that I've just been using,

00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:48.895
with my kids recently called
Khan Academy, K-H-A-N,

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:53.293
just one guy doing some
unbelievable 15-minute tutorials.

00:02:53.293 --> 00:02:55.234
Terry: Bill Gates did
more than look at the Khan

00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:59.335
Academy videos. He helped
to bankroll the project.

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:02.375
So in 2009, Khan finally
quit his day job and

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.378
partnered with the Gates
Foundation and Google to

00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:07.751
form the Khan Academy.

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.216
Here's how it works.

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:11.551
Students watch the
videos and then work on a

00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:15.000
problem set based on the
lesson on the website.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.169
If you pass, you move
onto the next lesson.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.668
If it looks like you don't
understand a concept,

00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:23.130
the site takes you back
through what you are missing.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.751
The goal is not to replace
the traditional classroom.

00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:28.818
The goal is to liberate.

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:30.720
Khan: The idea of
students being grouped in

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.414
age base co-horts and
then going at a set pace,

00:03:33.414 --> 00:03:35.582
this is the school that
we all kind of grew up in,

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:38.498
this is actually not the
way students were educated

00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:40.131
for most of history.

00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:43.130
Terry: Instead, Khan and
his allies see classrooms

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.497
thrumming with creative activity,
spurred by the fact that

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.569
kids will have already
engaged the subject matter

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.101
through the online lessons.

00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:53.804
What does your ideal classroom look like?

00:03:53.804 --> 00:03:57.192
Khan: It won't be a bunch
of chairs all positioned

00:03:57.192 --> 00:03:59.691
looking at someone in the
front of the classroom.

00:03:59.691 --> 00:04:01.526
It'll be a much more collaborative space.

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:04.916
It's not one pace fits all
anymore and the teacher

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:06.666
will be doing focus
interventions with them.

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:08.583
They'll be mentoring them.
They'll be inspiring them.

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.121
They won't be lecturing at them.

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.582
Terry: About 25-30
schools, most of them based

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:15.526
around Silicon Valley
have started implementing

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:18.862
the Khan Academy as a pilot
program, exploring how

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:22.399
it might change teaching and learning.

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:25.704
There are plenty of critics,
but one big group of supporters.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.500
Khan: The single biggest
thing that happened and

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.376
it wasn't obvious to us at
first, the teachers and the

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.778
principal told us, is that
the students started to take

00:04:33.778 --> 00:04:34.960
ownership of their learning.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.246
They started to not
say, "Hey, I'm passive."

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:38.348
"Tell me what to do next."

00:04:38.348 --> 00:04:41.518
They started to say, "These are my goals."

00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:42.875
"I'm going to seek out the information."

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:45.888
"Teacher, you're my coach.
You're my mentor. Help me do it."

00:04:45.888 --> 00:04:49.126
Terry: They're already
online, maybe at least in some

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:53.864
ways that's where their
classrooms can be, too.

00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:56.864
Bill: And Khan's book,
The One World Schoolhouse,

00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:59.266
is in stores now. Thanks to Terry.
