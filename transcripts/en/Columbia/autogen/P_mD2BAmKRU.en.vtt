in my suit that's a good question

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:45.970
in my suit that's a good question
 

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.570
in my suit that's a good question
especially as that global University

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:48.580
especially as that global University

very very good question ah well assume
that I mean there's so many ways to

00:35:59.070 --> 00:35:59.080
that I mean there's so many ways to
 

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.820
that I mean there's so many ways to
break it down i mean i think first we

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:02.830
break it down i mean i think first we
 

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.420
break it down i mean i think first we
really have to grapple with what it

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:06.430
really have to grapple with what it
 

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.490
really have to grapple with what it
means for something to be global and the

various different ways that that term is
 

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.900
various different ways that that term is
utilized I think you're you're actually

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:12.910
utilized I think you're you're actually
 

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.760
utilized I think you're you're actually
touching I I have a sense that you

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:14.770
touching I I have a sense that you
 

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.140
touching I I have a sense that you
you're sort of touching on some of them

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:16.150
you're sort of touching on some of them
 

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:20.310
you're sort of touching on some of them
even in your question which is that you

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320
even in your question which is that you
 

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.930
even in your question which is that you
know one of my global can be understood

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:21.940
know one of my global can be understood
 

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.560

harnessing many kinds of difference in
making it home right there's a sense of

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:42.310
making it home right there's a sense of
 

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.990
making it home right there's a sense of
the global that's that's about the world

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000
the global that's that's about the world
 

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.340
the global that's that's about the world
right and in that sense of global being

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:50.350
right and in that sense of global being
 

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:51.750
right and in that sense of global being
about the world again is something that

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760
about the world again is something that
 

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.310
about the world again is something that
we want to we want to break down and

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:53.320
we want to we want to break down and
 

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.650
we want to we want to break down and
think through more carefully because if

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:55.660
think through more carefully because if
 

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.349
think through more carefully because if
you think about entry into the world

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359
you think about entry into the world
 

00:36:58.359 --> 00:37:01.890
you think about entry into the world
into the world stage it's never about

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:01.900
into the world stage it's never about
 

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.550

equality right different countries enter
 

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.609
equality right different countries enter
onto the world stage become a part of

00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619
onto the world stage become a part of
 

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:12.260
onto the world stage become a part of
the global on deeply on equal footing

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:12.270
the global on deeply on equal footing
 

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:17.820
the global on deeply on equal footing
right so so I wonder if to some extent

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:17.830
right so so I wonder if to some extent
 

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.690
right so so I wonder if to some extent
we want to find a way to

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:21.700
we want to find a way to
 

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.400
we want to find a way to
retain a sense of connection and

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:25.410
retain a sense of connection and
 

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.730
retain a sense of connection and
diversity while also attending to the

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:29.740
diversity while also attending to the
 

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.790
diversity while also attending to the
fact that there is difference right

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800
fact that there is difference right
 

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.780
fact that there is difference right
difference in power difference in

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:35.790
difference in power difference in
 

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.450
difference in power difference in
relationships and you know I think that

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:39.460
relationships and you know I think that
 

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.120
relationships and you know I think that
in many ways that the jury is out on on

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.130
in many ways that the jury is out on on
 

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.640
in many ways that the jury is out on on
whether global can the term global can

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:44.650
whether global can the term global can
 

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:50.880
whether global can the term global can
do all of that at once right ah I think

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:50.890
do all of that at once right ah I think
 

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:55.290
do all of that at once right ah I think
that one of the one of the challenges

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:55.300
that one of the one of the challenges
 

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.930
that one of the one of the challenges
and and pleasures of this project is

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:57.940
and and pleasures of this project is
 

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.620
and and pleasures of this project is
about developing a kind of sensibility

sense to to kind of gloss over

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:42.750
sense to to kind of gloss over
 

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:46.050

inequality it has i mean i think in in

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:46.060
inequality it has i mean i think in in
 

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.150
inequality it has i mean i think in in
certain sorts of discourses and then

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160
certain sorts of discourses and then
 

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.620
certain sorts of discourses and then
again you know this is it's both kind of

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:49.630
again you know this is it's both kind of
 

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.960
again you know this is it's both kind of
it is it does get it does get sort of

it is it does get it does get sort of
 

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.240
it is it does get it does get sort of
quite abstracted moments but but i think

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:54.250
quite abstracted moments but but i think
 

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.090
quite abstracted moments but but i think
in some of the political effects of the
