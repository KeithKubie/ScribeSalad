00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.690
I'm here with Jarrod Parkes who's
a course developer at Udacity.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.220
And Jarrod thanks so much for
talking to us today.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.420
&gt;&gt; We're going to talk a little bit
about student motivation in classes and

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.770
how technology can help.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.280
So Jarrod I'll start by asking,
what kind of shaped do

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.590
you as far as motivation is concerned,
back when you were a learner in school?

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.010
So what were your experiences with
the role of motivation in education?

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.320
&gt;&gt; Right,
I had kind of a lucky situation.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.620
I'm a twin, so for me a lot of my
motivation I think was always driven out

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.560
of that natural sense of competition
that I had with my twin brother, James.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.460
But from more of what
the school was providing for

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.320
me, I think I was always
motivated by doing well.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.710
It was always stressed that you want to
do well, so I tried to get to the top.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.420
And for me that seemed to be enough,
at least to get me through grade school.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.920
And then as learning got deeper and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.290
the topics got more difficult,
I had to kind of dig.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.760
I think more inside of
myself to find the time and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.330
give the commitment to the topics
that you had to be successful.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.680
&gt;&gt; I think you're echoing something
really important, also is that,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.410
and there's actually
research that backs this up.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.926
Is that early in education,

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:10.788
students might adopt a real focus on
some of those external motivators.

00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:13.299
And it sounds like you're
commenting on that,

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.630
early on it was about
doing well overall.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.750
What was your definition of doing
well back then, you remember?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.910
&gt;&gt; It was very much get As in class.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.680
My parents made it known to my brother
and I at a very early age that we had to

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.120
do well in order to be
able to get to college.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.594
So that for me was a goal from fifth
grade and on, something like that.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.180
And so I think there's research that
confirms that early on many students

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.420
adopt this kind of external
mindset about learning.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.920
Which isn't inherently a bad thing
because there are powerful external

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920
motivators out in the world.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.035
And there are very important
reasons to learn well and do well.

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:52.150
But what about the tension between,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.810
I think you mentioned this as
far as later in your career.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.230
The tension between being motivated
by something out in the world and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.560
being motivated by something
more internal to yourself?

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.660
&gt;&gt; I think that started to arise when
I got to points where I started to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.610
question were the grades that I was
getting in class and receiving.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.250
Truly reflective of how
I felt I was learning or

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.240
how I felt, just self worth and value.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.680
I feel like I'm trying hard, but I dont
know if I want to commit the amount of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.598
time it takes to get what is considered
an A, a high mark in this class.

00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:29.760
Whereas, I feel I'm still
learning effectively and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.500
this is just added pressure.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.190
And so, I think intrinsically,
in and of myself,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.130
I started to think about
why am I learning?

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.350
Why do I want to learn?

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.150
I'm actually having fun doing this.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.189
And then I started to go after and learn
and look at topics that excited me.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.730
Not just because somebody told me this
is what I should be interested, but

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.480
because I chose them for myself.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting because
you're commenting on that.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.050
I think a lot of students experience
that same thing where they find

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.650
something that they're very passionate
about and they end up pursuing it.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.100
But it seems like it would be really
great if we could actually bring that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.870
into the classroom.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.600
At least in my opinion, there's nothing
inherent about the classroom that means

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.682
students can't be internally motivated
by something a teacher gives them.

00:03:08.682 --> 00:03:12.120
It's that I got it from
a teacher doesn't make it, so

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.690
that I'm never going to be
personally interested in it.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.780
It's just something happens in school
that often prevents that from arising.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.190
So do you have any thoughts on,
either from your personal experience or

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.240
what we as educational
technology analysts can do.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.690
To try and
create that more personal motivation,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.630
even when we're designing
well-formed interventions.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.072
&gt;&gt; I think you have to keep adaptivity
at one of the highest priorities.

00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:38.200
I think the classroom in a lot
of ways is for a lot of people,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.560
can be very rigid.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.090
Because of that, when they find
something interesting, maybe they feel

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.860
silenced or they don't feel like
they can go and explore this topic.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.504
And it's going to help them getting
hired or finishing school and

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:50.968
getting hired whatever.

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:54.345
And so being able to identify
when students have something that

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:58.140
they are very interested in and
then allowing them to pursue that.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.090
And still somehow maybe tie it back to
whatever the universal message of this

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.637
class or the learning points.

00:04:03.637 --> 00:04:06.710
That's something that I think
would be very beneficial.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.700
&gt;&gt; So you're saying it would be good to
have a class where students can kind of

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.220
be given a bunch of topics to explore.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.505
And choose which topics they'd
like to explore and when and how.

00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:15.350
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
Yeah.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.040
As long as they're,
I think, dense enough and

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.480
they're ones that actually would
merit a good amount of work.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.660
And you can make those
calls as an educator.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.830
Then yeah,
that would be a great type of class.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.710
Those were the kind
of classes I enjoyed.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.470
&gt;&gt; So, Jerry would enjoy this class, so.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.450
You don't know this, but

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.240
that's exactly the motivating principle
behind the design of this class.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.580
We've given the students a library of
information, such as this interview.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.680
To explore and kind of find what's the
most interesting and pertinent to them.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.240
&gt;&gt; Oh, great, yeah.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.450
&gt;&gt; So, but what about the role
of technology in all this?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.120
It seems like,
everything we've talked about so

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.550
far is kind of general to education,
the classroom as a whole.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.519
What can technology do
specifically to help us with this?

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.860
Facilitating students' personal
motivation in these topics.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.660
&gt;&gt; One thing I think about is how
technology nowadays has access to so

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.330
much information.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.230
And because they have
access to that information,

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.950
when students are being, we're
collecting responses from students and

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.360
we're analyzing their feedback,
their answers or whatever.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.000
We can look at those things and
make choices about or

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.790
give them recommendations about
things they may become interested in.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.150
So the technology is what would allow us
to adapt where it may be more difficult

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.830
in a traditional classroom for

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.280
professor to give that individual
attention to each student.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.850
I think that's something that
technology could definitely do.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.580
&gt;&gt; I agree, I think that
technology also has the benefit of

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.420
making a lot of these resources
always very easily available.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.250
That in the past, it was a case of
if I wanted to start your class

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.560
where students can
choose their own topic.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.480
I could say, today in class,
you're going to go to the library,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.630
find an encyclopedia, find a book and
research it yourself.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.280
But that means that students have
15 minutes to one day to do all

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.800
the research and
find their own direction,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.220
which is isn't really enough time.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.910
But now we can say you have all
semester, you have the internet.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.650
You have as much time as
you're willing to invest.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.590
You can go in any direction you want
without ever leaving your office.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.840
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So I think that's really powerful in

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.940
making that available.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.690
Do you have any thoughts on the role
of artificial intelligence in this?

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.860
I don't know if you have any
experience with how AI can kind of help

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.860
personalize this and if you don't,
I'll comment on it, but.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.210
&gt;&gt; I don't have any deep experience, but

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.760
I think AI systems can be
the ones responsible for

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.450
finding those things that and making
those recommendations for students.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.060
So I think that might
be a good application.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a friend of mine is
actually working on a project

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.510
kind of like that that's a digital
assistant for research like this.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.970
That if you're working for something,
it can actually connect you out to

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.470
ongoing research in the field or
similar ideas.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.290
Or just help you kind of build
a broader knowledge of what

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.502
you're researching without having
to find everything on your own.

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:40.212
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; So and

00:06:40.212 --> 00:06:43.660
do you have any final thoughts for
our students who might be worried about

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.940
facilitating motivation in the
technological devices that they build?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.660
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.840
My recommendation is for
any roadblocks that you ever

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.740
run into from a motivation
standpoint is to have friends.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.160
Have people around you that support you.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.840
I think every time that I reached
one of those blocks in my life,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.460
that's what helped pull me through,
more than anything else.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.290
&gt;&gt; That actually speaks,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.510
I think to something we've commented
elsewhere in this class on as well.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.670
Is that when we're building technology,

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.600
we need to be able to facilitate
interaction among students.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.730
It's very tempting to treat my system as
the student and whatever I'm building.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.790
But in reality, it should be the
student, their friends, their teachers,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.680
their mentors, things like that.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.900
And my device which is facilitating
interaction amongst all of them.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.880
&gt;&gt; It's almost the intrinsic
motivation that grows out of us,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.310
as well as the extrinsic motivators.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.390
I think it's driven by people,
it's a people-based thing.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.430
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.750
Okay, well thank you so
much for talking to us today.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.390
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.170
&gt;&gt; And thanks all for watching.
