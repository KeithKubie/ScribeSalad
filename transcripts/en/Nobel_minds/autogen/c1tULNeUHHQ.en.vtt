hello my avatars name is archivist

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519
hello my avatars name is archivist
 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.390
hello my avatars name is archivist
Llewellyn and I'm asking a question from

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400
Llewellyn and I'm asking a question from
 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.540
Llewellyn and I'm asking a question from
Second Life carbon nanostructures can be

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550
Second Life carbon nanostructures can be
 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.490
Second Life carbon nanostructures can be
grown in high yield inside the pores of

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500
grown in high yield inside the pores of
 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.220
grown in high yield inside the pores of
zeolite crystals which are

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230
zeolite crystals which are
 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.899
zeolite crystals which are
aluminosilicate semiconductors my

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:19.909
aluminosilicate semiconductors my
 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.970
aluminosilicate semiconductors my
question is does the quality of the

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980
question is does the quality of the
 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.009
question is does the quality of the
crystals make a difference if so with

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019
crystals make a difference if so with
 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.779
crystals make a difference if so with
crystals grown in space show to have

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789
crystals grown in space show to have
 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.540
crystals grown in space show to have
higher quality be a viable option thank

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550
higher quality be a viable option thank
 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.699
higher quality be a viable option thank
you
