00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.400
So now, with your spool DNA and picture of yourself

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.620
that you've put online, you can show the world what

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.630
a great scientist you are. Of course, if you go

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.690
to any dinner parties, and find yourself in the kitchen,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.150
it also works as a great party trick. If you're

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.810
feeling ambitious, you can also try other fruits, like bananas,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.460
which are triploid and kiwi fruits which are hexaploid. And

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.620
the amount of DNA you get out, is predicated entirely on

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.750
the amount of DNA you put in. So I hope you've enjoyed this lesson.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.267
Good luck if you try it on your own. Thanks for watching and good science.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.952
