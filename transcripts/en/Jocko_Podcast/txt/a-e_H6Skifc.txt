Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 22 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. And I would say that it is a good evening. Sure because we are free, we are free and I talk about that all the time and you hear me say discipline equals freedom. You hear me say free your mind and here in America and in places around the world that have the ability to be listening to this podcast, a lot of times we take freedom for granted and we all want freedom. We want the ability, the capability to move around and go where we want to go. But more importantly we want freedom of the mind and freedom of the heart. And those things sound abstract. They seem like things that cannot be taken away. We don't even know what that means to have them taken away because of the way we live and how we were raised to think what you want to think and believe what you want to believe to be who you want to be, to have and to exercise the freedom to question and the question, everything. That's freedom. And there are parts of the world where none of those freedoms exist.

Speaker 2:          00:02:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       In worse, there's parts of the world where any chance of free thought is exterminated. From childhood, we'll broken dreams, extinguished, faults controlled. So let's go to a place where that

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       is the reality, and again, I'm going to point this out. This is not a dystopian movie or some post apocalyptic novel. This is real, real life with real people.

Speaker 4:          00:03:19       Cool.

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       Red is reserved for the lettering of the propaganda signs. The Korean language uses a unique alphabet made up of circles and lines. The red letters leap out of the gray landscape with urgency. They march across the fields, preside over the granite cliffs of the mountains, punctuate the main roads like mileage, markers and dance on top of railroad stations and other public buildings. They say things like this, we have nothing to envy in the world. If the party decides we do long live, Kim, Il Sung, let's live our own way. We will do as the party tells us, we will do as the party tells us. And like I said, this isn't a book. This is real. This is North Korea. This is a story of horror, end of slavery and of brain washing. And it's also a story of choices, story of freedom. And it's also a story of the strength of the human will. This is a book that is called nothing to envy, ordinary lives in North Korea. It's by Barbara Dimmick or DEMEC.

Speaker 4:          00:05:39       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:05:44       it Teresa's a bunch of people that defected, who Barbara Dematic was able to interview, who wants, they left North Korea, but it traces their lives and what their lives were like. And one of the characters, and again, I want to call it a character, one of the people that's in the book is named me, ran and going to the book here, me, his father was a pow, and it talks about that me, his father never talked about being a pow, but there's a nother fellow pow who wrote a memoir, and in his memoir, and I'm going to the book here, he said that men were housed in squalid camps where they were not permitted to bathe or brush their teeth. Their hair became infested with lice. Untreated wounds swarmed with maggots. They were fed one meal of rice and salt water a day under the name construction unit of the Interior Department knew pow camps had been built near the mines. Coal Mining in North Korea was not only dirty but exceedingly dangerous since the mines frequently collapsed or caught fire and that same former pow wrote, the life of a pow was worth less than a fly. Every day we walked into the mines, I shuttered with fear like a cow walking to the slaughter house. I never knew if I were to emerge alive.

Speaker 3:          00:07:29       So if you don't know anything about anything, the leader in North Korea at this time post war is Kim Il Sung and you still hear his. His grandson now is in charge of North Korea,

Speaker 3:          00:07:52       but at this time, I'm going to the book. After the war, Kim Il Sung made it his first order of business to weed out fo from friend. He started at the top with potential rivals for leadership. He disposed of many of his comrades in arms who had led the struggle from Manchuria to unseat the Japanese Japanese occupiers. He ordered the arrest of the founding members of the Communist Party in South Korea. They had been invaluable during the war. Now that they'd served their purpose. They could be discarded throughout the 1950s many more were purged in what was increasingly coming to resemble an ancient Chinese empire. With Kim Il Sung the unchallenged master of the realm. Kim Il Sung then turns his attention to ordinary people. In 1958 he ordered up an elaborate project to classify all North Koreans by their political reliability, ambitiously seeking to reorganize an entire human population. The North Koreans were methodical to a fault. Each person was put through eight background checks. Your Song Bun, as the rating was called, took into account the backgrounds of your parents, grandparents, and even second cousins. The loyalty surveys were carried out in various phases with inspiring names. Intensive guidance by the central party was the first announced phase. The classifications became more refined in subsequent phases such as the understanding people project between 1972 and 1974 so those things to me, they all sound like just bad movie

Speaker 3:          00:09:47       plots, right? The in in intensive guidance by the central party.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:09:56       that's something you don't want to mess with and here's how they would be. Here's what life was like. A little bit of life. People would be closely watched by their neighbors. North Koreans are organized into what are called in men bond, literally people's groups, cooperatives of 20 or so families whose job it is to keep tabs on one another and run the neighborhood. The Inman bond have an elected leader, usually a middle aged woman who reports anything suspicious to higher ranking authorities. It was almost impossible for North Korean of low rank to improve his status.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:10:44       now we talked about this character or sorry, the person Miron that's being talked about and she talks about her father and here's what she says about her. Father. Me Round often found her father's passivity maddening. Only later did she understand this was a survival mechanism. It was as though he had hammered down his own personality to avoid drawing undue attention to himself among the thousands of former South Korean soldiers who tried to assimilate into North Korean society. Many slipped up me, Ron's mother. Later later told her that four of her father's buddies in the mines, fellow South Koreans had been executed for minor infractions. Their bodies dumped in mass graves. Being a member of the hostel class meant you would never get the benefit of a doubt. I'll sarcastic inflection when referring to Kim Il Sung or nostalgic remark about South Korea could get you in serious trouble. It was especially taboo to talk about the Korean War and who started it in the official histories and there was nothing but official history in North Korea. It was the South Korean army that invaded acting on orders from the Americans, not the North Korean army storming across the 38th parallel. Anybody who remembered what really happened on June 25th, 1950 new, it was wise to keep one's mouth shut.

Speaker 3:          00:12:25       So even history, even facts that you learned that the country learned or just lies me ran, didn't have any particular artistic or athletic talent, but like her older sisters did. But she was a good student and she was beautiful. When she was 15 years old, her school was visited by a team of serious looking men and women in somber suits. These were aqua members of the fifth division of the Central Workers' Party recruiter recruiters who scoured the country looking for young women to serve on the personal staff of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. If selected, the girls would be sent off to military style training camp before being assigned to one of the leadership's. Many residences around the country. North Korean girls her age didn't know what a concubine was. Only that whatever you might do to serve the leadership would be a tremendous honor. Only the smartest and prettiest girls would be selected. I think we can all imagine what that looks like. Twisted men in seats of power, preying on the entire nations for young girls.

Speaker 3:          00:14:02       Disturbing. Now another character in the book, and I'm getting, I keep using that term character. You hear that even me, I'm sitting here trying to tell everyone, hey, remember these are people but I'm calling them characters. These are characters in a book. These are people and this person was named Mrs Song and Mrs Song. What's interesting about Mrs Song is she's a true believer. She's a true believer, and you're going to hear some of this, but these folks that are raised in North Korea, they just believe that, that they believe the propaganda. They believe that North Korea is the best place on earth and it everywhere else is suffering and that because of their great leader, their lives are better than anyone else in the world and she truly believes that. And here's kind of what her attitude, here's what her life was like. And her attitude was like, Mrs Song usually went to work with one baby strapped to her back in one or two daughters dragging along behind her.

Speaker 3:          00:15:05       Her children basically grew up at the daycare center. She was supposed to work eight hours with a lunch break and a nap in the middle of her shift after work. She had to spend several more hours in ideological training in the factories auditorium. One day the lecture might be about the struggle against us imperialism. On other time. It might be about Kim Il songs exploits actual or exaggerating fighting the Japanese. During World War II. She had to write essays on the latest pronouncements of the Worker's Party. By the time she got home, it would be 10:30 PM she would do her housework and cooking. Then get up before dawn to prepare herself and her family for the day ahead before leaving home around 7:00 AM she seldom slept more than five hours. Some days were harder than others. On Wednesday mornings, she had to report to work early for mandatory meetings of the Socialist Women's Federation. Friday night she stayed especially late for self criticism.

Speaker 3:          00:16:05       In these sessions, members of her work unit, the department to which she was assigned would stand up and reveal to the group anything they had done wrong. Mrs Song would usually say in all sincerity, sincerity that she feared she wasn't working hard enough. Mrs Song believed what she said. All those years of sleep deprivation, all those lectures and self criticisms, the very same tools used in brainwashing or interrogations had wiped out any possibility of resistance. She had been molded into cumulus songs, improved human beings. Kim Il Sung, his goal wasn't merely to build a new country. He wanted to build better people to reshape human nature. Once in power, Kim Il Sung retooled. The ideas developed during his time as an anti Japanese guerilla fighter as instruments into instruments of social control. He instructed North Koreans that their power as human beings came from subsuming. Their individual will to that of the collective. The collective couldn't go off Willy Nilly doing whatever the people chose to some democratic process. The people had to follow an absolute supreme leader without question. That leader of course was Kim. Il Sung himself. So they're being told through multiple channels, through every instrument available, newspapers, radio, television, all controlled by the state. And through all these they're being told that they have to submit their individual will

Speaker 3:          00:18:13       and perform at the will of the collective. And you know, you, you will hear me refer to, for me the most important piece of humanity is the individual individual freedom

Speaker 4:          00:18:37       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:18:39       and obviously this attitude is the opposite of individual freedom. And also you got to remember from a leadership perspective, the way you maximize a team's effort isn't through a supreme authority trying to control everything. It doesn't work. That's why we have a little something called decentralized command. I want my front line leaders to think I want my front line troops to understand what they're trying to make happen and use their free will to make it happen. Use their own brain to make it happen. So if you're in a leadership position and you realize that you're trying to control everything yourself, you're not getting the most effective performance from your team.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:19:27       And we're going to see this on a grand scale. And you know, we do see it on a grand scale when governments try to control humans. It doesn't work. Now, it might seem crazy that you would buy into this propaganda. And here's a, here's a paragraph in a statement about that. Back to the book. We laugh at the excesses of propaganda and the gullibility of the people, but consider that their indoctrination began in their infancy during 14 hour day spent in factory daycare centers that for the subsequent 50 years, every song film, newspaper, Article and billboard was helped, was designed to deify Kim Il Sung, that the country was hermetically seal to keep out anything that Mike might cast doubt on Kim Il Sung his divinity who could possibly resist or you're not just being told that this guy is the leader you being told he's God.

Speaker 4:          00:20:39       Mm hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:20:43       In 1972 on the occasion of his 60th birthday, a milestone in Korean culture, the Workers' Party began distributing lapel pins of Kim Il Sung before long. The entire population was required to wear them on the left breast over the heart and Mrs Songs home as in every other, a framed portrait of Kim Il Sung hung on an otherwise bare wall. People were not permitted to put anything else on that wall, not even pictures of their blood relatives. The children were never to forget that they owed everything to the national leadership. North Korean children. They didn't celebrate their own birthdays, but those of Kim Il Sung on April 15th and Kim Jong Il on February 16th when the time came, the children lined up in front of the portraits to express their gratitude in unison. They would bend from the waist, bowing deeply with feeling. Thank you, dear Father Kim. Il Sung, the children repeated has their mother looked on with satisfaction, televisions and radios and North Korea are preset so they can receive only official government channels. Still the programming was relatively entertaining besides the usual speeches of Kim Il Sung on a typical weeknight, you might have sports concerts, television dramas and movies produced by Kim Il, Kim Jong Ils film studio. On weekends you might get a Russian movie as a special treat. The newspapers would occasionally run feature stories about heroic children who ratted out their parents to be denounced by a neighbor. For bowed mapping the regime was nothing extra ordinary.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       Starting to get a little feeling for what we've got going on here. Now, what happens when the government tries to control everything and you take the the freedom of the people away? Communism, obviously, and things are not as productive as they could be. That's what happens when there's no individual drive to succeed. Because if you're a farmer, once you plant your food, it's just going to get taken away by the government and redistributed. So what's your, what's your drive to grow the right amount of food or more food? There is none because it's all just going to be taken away anyways. They avoid punishment. So they do the minimum. Yes. Rather than the opposite. When they strive for the maximum, that means they're focused on what can be, you know? Yes. Avoiding what can be. Yes. And so now this is again, I'm breezing through chunks of this book to get to some of the highlights. So now we're into the 80s and we're starting to run out of food. Kim Jong Il, who by the 1980s was increasingly, it's assuming his father's duties offered on the spot guidance to, to address the country's woes. Father and son were experts in absolutely everything. Be at geology or farming. Kim Jong Il onsite instructions and is warm. Benevolence are bringing out the, bringing about a great advancing goat breeding and output of dairy products. The Korean Central News Agency opined after Kim Jong Il visited a goat farm near Chung Gyn. So that's the kind of, that's the kind of headlines in the news.

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:24:47       One day he would decree that the country's had switched from rice to potatoes for staple food. The next you would decide that raising ostriches was the cure for North Korea is food certed shortage, the country lurched from one harebrained scheme to another. So w the fact of the matter is that even if this guy was a brilliant or is a brilliant farmer, he's not taking into account the various terrain and the different climates that are in the area and who can get what done. Whereas if you let the free market decide what can be grown and let individuals decide and let freedom and guide people things, work things, find a way, the control does not work.

Speaker 2:          00:25:38       Okay?

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       And you'll see that here. Back to the book soon the country was sucked into a vicious death spiral without cheap fuel, oil and raw material. It couldn't keep the factories running, which meant it had nothing to export with no exports. There was no hard currency and without hard currency, fuel imports fell even further and the electricity stopped. The coal mines couldn't operate without electricity because they required electric pumps to safe and water. The shortage of coal worsened the electricity shortage, the electricity shortage further lowered agricultural output. Even the collective farms couldn't operate properly without electricity. It had never been easy to eek out enough harvest from North Korea's hardscrabble terrain for a population of 23 million and the agricultural techniques developed to boost the outport, relied on electrically powered artificial irrigation and on chemical fertilizers and pesticides produced it. Factories that were now closed for lack of fuel and raw materials.

Speaker 3:          00:26:53       North Korea started running out of food and as people went hungry, they didn't have the energy to work and so output plunged further. The economy was in a free fall. North Korea was the last place on place on earth where virtually all staples are grown on collective farms. The state confiscates the entire harvest and then gives a portion back to the farmer. But as harvest withered in the early 1990s the farmers themselves were going hungry and began stashing some of the harvest away. There were stories from the countryside of roofs that collapsed under the weight of grain hidden away in the eaves. The farmers also neglected the collective fields for their private kitchen gardens next to their houses or small steep plots. The carved out of the side of uncultivated mountain slopes driving through the countryside. You could see clearly the contrast between private gardens bursting with vegetables being pulled, soaring skyward, vines drooping with Pumpkin's next to the collective fields with they're stunted stunted haphazard rows of corn that had been planted by so called volunteers doing their patriotic duty.

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       Case in point. Koreans like to think to themselves as tough. And so they are. The propaganda machine launched a new campaign playing up Korean pride by recalling a fable from 1938 to 1939 in which Kim Il Sung commanded a small band of Anti-japanese gorillas fighting against thousands of enemies in 20 degrees below zero breathing through a heavy snowfall and starvation. The red flag fluttering in front of the rank, the arduous march, as they called it, would later become a metaphor for the famine. And here's a, one of the statements that they would make no force on Earth can borrow the Korean people from making an onward march for victory and the revolutionary spirit of the arduous march and the d p d p r a k will always remain a powerful nation. Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Speaker 3:          00:29:25       So people are starving and the government is saying, yeah, we're going to drive on. It's a tough road, but we're going to make it enduring. Hungary became part, one's patriotic duty. Billboards went up in Pyongyang, touting the new slogan, let's eat two meals a day. North Korean television ran a documentary about a man who stomach burst. It was claimed from eating too much rice. In any case, the food shortage was temporary. Agriculture. Agricultural officials quoted in the newspapers reported that bumper crops of rice were expected in the next harvest. When the foreign press reported on food shortages in north in the north in 1992 the North Korean news service was indignant and here's what the new North Korean new service had to say. The state supplies the people with food at a cheap price so that the people do not know how much rice costs. This is the reality of the northern half of Korea. All people live a happy life without any worries about food. In our land,

Speaker 3:          00:30:44       people are starving in the government is lying. If North Koreans pause to contemplate the obvious inconsistencies and lies in what they were told, they would find themselves in a dangerous place. They didn't have a choice. They couldn't flee their country, depose of their leadership, speak out or protest. In order to fit in. The average citizen had to discipline himself not to think too much. Then there was the natural human survival instinct to be optimistic like German Jews in the early 1930s who told themselves that couldn't get any worse. The North Koreans deceive themselves. They thought it was temporary. Things would get better. A hungry stomach shouldn't believe a lie, but somehow it did. Along with the new propaganda campaign, the regime stepped up its extensive network of domestic surveillance. The more there was to complain about, the more important it was to ensure that nobody did.

Speaker 4:          00:31:56       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:32:02       Now at this point, further in the book, Miran has gone off to college to become a teacher and she shows up there and this is what she deals with. The food in the cafeteria was even worse. North Korea was starting. It's let's eat two meals a day campaign, but the school took it a step further and offered only one meal. A fin soup made of salt water and dried turnip leaves. The cafeteria would, would sometimes add a spoon of rice and that had been cooked for hours to plump up the grains. The girls in college began getting sick. One of me, Rand's roommates was so malnourished that the skin was flaking off of her face. She dropped out of school and others followed. Now, during the, during the middle of this,

Speaker 3:          00:33:16       Kim Il Sung dies and you know, it's, um, it's crazy to hear how the people reacted. And so I'm going to start off with this announcement that was made and I, this is long, a little bit of a long announcement, but just to get the tone of it is worth it. Here we go. The central committee of the Worker's Party of Korea, the Central Military Commission of the Party, the National Defense Commission, the Central People's Committee and the Administration Council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea report to the entire people of the country with deepest grief that the great leader, Comrade Kim Il Sung general secretary of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea and president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, passed away from a sudden attack of illness at 2:00 AM are respected fatherly leader who has devoted his whole life to the popular masses because of independence and engaged himself in tireless an energetic activities for the prosperity of the motherland and the happiness of the people for the reunification of the country and independence of the world till the last moments of his life departed from us to our greatest sorrow. Very disturbing. And what's crazy is you hear all these bureaucratic names. That's what's crazy about it. All of these government organizations picking away at the people.

Speaker 3:          00:35:12       And here's some of the reactions. The morning that went through and and people like Mrs Song, who is a true believer, this is how they felt the old women wailed. How could you leave us? So suddenly the men's screamed. Those waiting in line would jump up and down pound their heads collapsed into theatrical swoons, rip their clothes and pound their fists at the air. In few tile rage, the men wept copiously as the women. The histrionics of grief took on a competitive quality who could weep the loudest, who was most distraught? The mourners were Egged on by the TV news, which broadcast hours and hours of people wailing grown men with tears rolling down their cheeks, banging their heads on trees, sailors banging their heads against the massive, there's ships, pilots weeping in the cockpit and so on. These scenes were interspersed with footage of lightning and pouring rain. It looked like Armageddon. Our country is envelops in the deepest sorrow in the 5,000 year history of the Korean nation. Intoned in an announcer on television and they had these little miss that they throw out there like this one. Here's a, here's an official release. When the Great Marshall died, thousands of cranes descended from heaven [inaudible] fetch him. The birds couldn't take him because they saw that North Koreans cried and screamed and pummeled their chests, pulled their hair and pounded the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:37:04       They couldn't let him go, but nonetheless, despite the heroic efforts of the Grand Marshal,

Speaker 4:          00:37:22       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       the famine continued and here we go to another person in the book

Speaker 3:          00:37:31       whose name is Dr. Kim, a woman doctor in North Korea in the pediatric ward. Dr. Kim noticed that her patients were exhibiting peculiar symptoms. The children she treated born in the late 1980s and early 1990s were surprisingly smaller, even smaller than she'd been as the tiniest kid in her elementary school class. Now their upper arms were so skinny, she couldn't circle them with her thumb and forefingers. Their muscle tone was a week. It was a syndrome known as wasting where the starved body eats away at its own muscle tissue. Children came in for constipation that was so acute. They were doubled over in pain, screaming. The problem was with the food housewives. It started to pick weeds and wild grasses to add to their soups to create an illusion of vegetables. Corn was increasingly the staple again instead of, but people were adding leaves, husks stems and carbs to make it go further. That was okay for adults, but it couldn't be digested by the tenders. Stomachs of children, the babies were in the worst shapes. Their mothers themselves under nourished didn't produce enough breast milk for them. Baby formula was nonexistent and milk was rare in the past. Mothers who couldn't produce enough breast milk would feed their babies a watered down Kong he made have made from cooked rice, but now most of them couldn't afford rice either.

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       And here's Dr. Kim talking about the toddlers. They would look at me with accusing eyes. Even four year olds knew they were dying and that I wasn't doing anything to help them. Dr. Kim told me years later, all I was capable of doing was to cry with their mothers and their bodies afterwards. Dr. Kim hadn't been a Dr. Long enough to have a record, the protective wall that would insulate her from the suffering around her. The children's pain was her pain years later when I asked her if she remembered any of the children who had died on her watch, she answered sharply. I remember all of them

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       now, me ran, has graduated from college and she's an actual school teacher. Dan Actually requirement of school teachers was that they knew would need to know how to play the accordion, which is like a transportable instruments. So therefore was considered to be a good thing because you could carry it on a march. So all school teachers had to play the accordion. Today's, they sang songs like this and they would sing it with the class. Our Father, we have nothing to envy in the world. Our houses within the embrace of the Worker's Party, we are all brothers and sisters. Even if a sea of fire comes towards us, sweet children do not need to be afraid. Our Father is here. We have nothing to envy in this world. Another one of the songs that they'd sing. Where have we gone? We've gone to the forest. Where are we going? We're going over the hills. What are we going to do? We are going to kill Japanese soldiers.

Speaker 3:          00:41:31       And another classic that was taught in the music classes called shoot the Yankee bastards. Our enemies are the American bastards who are trying to take over our beautiful fatherland with guns that I make with my own hands. I will shoot them, Bang, Bang, Bang. That idea of nothing to envy in the world and, and again, you know, as you read through this book, you hear the people saying that they believed whole heartedly, that they had nothing to envy in the world, that this dismal life of starvation or near starvation was as good as it gets.

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       Then here's what the hunger would look like in school. According to me ran, each child was supposed to bring from home a bundle of firewood for the furnace in the school basement, but many had trouble carrying it there. Big heads load on top of scrawny necks. They're delicate rib cages, protruded over their waste so small that she could encircle them with our hands. Some of them were starting to swell in the stomach. It was all becoming clear to her. Miran remember seeing a photograph of a famine victim in Somalia with a protruding stomach, although she didn't know the medical terminology. She remembered from our teachers, teachers college course on nutrition that it was caused by severe protein deficiency. Me Ran also noticed that the children's black hair was getting lighter, more copper toned. It was always the same progression. First, the family wouldn't be able to send the quote of firewood. Then the lunch bag would disappear. Then the child would stop participating in class and would sleep through recess. Then without explanation, the child would stop coming to school over three years. Enrollment in the kindergarten drop from 50 students to 15 what happened to all those children?

Speaker 4:          00:43:37       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:37       Miran didn't pry too deeply for fear. The answer she didn't want to hear a decade later when we ran was a mother herself trying to lose or pros pregnancy weight through aerobics. This period of her life waited like a stone on her conscience. She often felt sick over what she did and didn't do to help the young students. How could she have eaten so well herself when they were starving is axiomatic that one death is a tragedy. 1,000 a statistic. So it was from me ran. What she didn't realize is that in her is that her in difference was an acquired survival skill in order to get through the 1990s alive one to suppress any impulse to share food.

Speaker 4:          00:44:35       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       to avoid going insane one, how to learn to stop caring in time. Miran would learn how to walk around a dead body on the street without paying much attention. She could pass a five year old on the verge of death without feeling a feeling obliged to help. If she wasn't going to share food with her favorite pupil, she certainly wasn't going to help a perfect stranger. And here's some,

Speaker 3:          00:45:06       I guess I would say thoughts on a famine or realities of famine in a famine. People don't necessarily starved to death. Often. Some other ailment gets them first. Chronic malnutrition impairs the body's ability to battle infection and the Hungary become increasingly susceptible to tuberculosis, tuberculosis, and typhoid. The starved body is too weak to metabolize antibiotics even if they're available and normal. Normally curable. Does illnesses suddenly become fatal? Wild fluctuations of body chemistry can trigger strokes and heart attacks. People die from eating substitute foods that their bodies can't digest. Starvation can be a sneaky killer that disguises itself under blend statistics of increased child mortality or decreased life expectancy. It leaves behind only circumstantial evidence of excess morality. There's excess mortality statistics that show a higher than normal desk during a certain period.

Speaker 4:          00:46:19       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       Yet another gratuitous cruelty. The killer famine targets the most innocent. The people who would never steal food, lie, cheat, break the law or betray a friend. It was a phenomenon that the Italian writer, Primo Levi, identified after emerging from Auschwitz when he wrote that he and his fellow survivors never wanted to see another one again, one another again after the war because they had all done something of which they were ashamed as Mrs Song would observe a decade later when she thought back on all the people she knew who died during those years, it was the simple and kindhearted people who did what they were told they were the first to die.

Speaker 4:          00:47:14       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:19       By 1998 an estimated 600,000 to 2 million North Koreans had died as a result of the famine. As much as 10% of the population. By the end of 1998 the worst of the famine was over, not necessarily because anything had improved, but as mrs song later surmised, because there were fewer mouths to feed, everybody who was going to die was already dead.

Speaker 2:          00:47:50       Now.

Speaker 3:          00:47:52       That's how the famine wrapped up. But to go a little bit in depth of what it was like once the famine was raging, people became homeless, which was strange because in North Korea they never had a problem with homelessness because if you wanted food, you needed to live in your home because if the government would allegedly bring you food, well once they won't bring in food anymore, there was no reason to stay at home. So now you had people going out trying to survive. Right. And this talks a little bit about that, especially for the children.

Speaker 3:          00:48:25       It was a dangerous life. The children couldn't sleep without worrying that somebody, perhaps another gang member would steal what little they had. There were strange stories going around about adults who preyed on children, not just for sex but for food. High ACC was told about people who had drug children kill them and butcher them from meat. Behind the station near the railroad tracks were vendors who cooked up soup and noodles over small burners and it was said that the great chunks of meat floating in the broth or human flesh. The stories got more and more horrific. Supposedly one father went so insane with hunger that he ate his own baby. A market woman were said to have been arrested for selling soup made from human bones. From my interviews with the defectors, it does appear that there were cases in which people were arrested and executed for cannibalism. What did our wonderful, uh, leaders do during this? Here's how they handled the people as the people who started black markets and started growing these gardens and selling what they could to get, you know, people started to try and survive through exercising their personal freedoms.

Speaker 3:          00:50:02       And here's one of the ways that are, here's their comments about this. This is coming from Kim Jong, Il as well as any of the world's strong men. He understood perfectly the cliche that an absolute just regime needs absolute power. Everything good in life was to be bequeathed by the government. He couldn't tolerate people going off to gather their own food or buying rice with their own money. Telling people to solve the food problem on their own only increases the number of farmers, markets and peddlers. In addition, this creates egoism among the people and the base of the party's class may come to collapse. So He's trying to stop people.

Speaker 4:          00:50:54       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:50:55       from solving the problems themselves, which they have the capability to do, and I don't talk about it too deeply near, but they'd go into the, the massive black market that was started and there was people that were surviving, were people that were doing that, that we're figuring out a way to make money. And Kim Jong Il retaliated against that free market excessively to try and stop it. It was better that people die of starvation than they have the freedom

Speaker 3:          00:51:27       to try and let their get their family to survive. And here's an example of what they did with one man that was trying to get money so his family could survive. Back to the book, the man was accused of climbing electric poles and cutting copper wire to sell the theft caused extensive damage to the nation's property and was done with the intention to damage our social system. It was an act of treason that aided the enemies of the socialist state. The prosecutor read his voice bellowing through the scratchy speakers than a man acting as a sort of lawyer for the accused spoke. Although he offered no defense. I have determined that what the prosecutor says is true. The accused is the hereby sentence to death and the sentence will be carried out immediately. Decreed a third man, the condemned man was bound to a wooden stake at the eyes, the chest and the legs. The firing squad would aim to sever the ropes in order three bullets in each location. Nine in total, top to bottom. First, the lifeless head would slump over so that the body would crumble in an orderly heap at the foot of the steak. Neat and efficient. It would look like the condemned man was bowing in death, as if to apologize.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       A murmur went through the crowd who thought the execution was excessive punishment for a minor theft, the electric lines or weren't working anyways, the few meters of copper wiring the man had stolen, probably had gotten him no more than a few bags of rice. A pity he has a younger sister. Somebody said, two sisters set another. The man's parents must be dead. Clearly he knew nobody with influence to intervene on his behalf. You probably had a poor class background as well. Maybe he was the son of a miner. The shots rang out

Speaker 4:          00:53:50       head, chest, legs, the head

Speaker 3:          00:53:56       burst open like a water balloon, blood spurted out over the dirt, almost spilling onto the feet of the crowd.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       Now

Speaker 3:          00:54:21       what do people do to stop this? You know, and you have rebellion in the world. You have people turn against the government in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       But in North Korea that did not happen. And here's why. The level of repression in North Korea was so great that no organized resistance could take root. Any anti regime activity would have, would have terrible consequences for the protester, his immediate family and all other known relatives under a system that sought to stamp out tainted blood for three generations. The punishment would extend to parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews and cousins. A lot of people felt if you had to give one life, you would give it to get rid of this terrible regime. But here you are not the only one getting punished. Your whole family would go through hell. So with the fact that they're going to give you protest, they're going to kill everybody. So there was no protest. So now the only thing you can possibly think of doing

Speaker 4:          00:55:53       okay is escaping.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       And it goes through the various people in the book and how they escaped. But I thought what was interesting, in fact the most interesting sort of mental transition to make was for Mrs Song. And again she was referred to as the true believer and her daughter had escaped and made it actually to South Korea and her daughter arranged to have Mrs Song Visit China, but she visited China sort of against the rules thinking that she was going to go back to North Korea.

Speaker 4:          00:56:41       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       because she truly believed that North Korea was the better place. She believed that South Korea was the enemy. Indie was evil. And so she spends, but she does go to China and she spent some time in China and when she's in China, she staying in the House that you know, her daughter set up for her to stay in and they have TV and they have microwave oven and they have dishwasher and they have a rice cooker, which, which like is miraculous to her. I mean she's talking about it, she's saying at a certain time the light would come on and it would make a chirp and that means the rice was now being cooked. And by the way, at this time, they didn't have rice in North Korea. So there's this thing that just automatically cooks up your rice in the morning. And it was that combination of things that broker, because when she first saw that stuff, she said, oh, this is imperialistic. You know, this is capitalism. It's evil. They're trying to buy us and enslave us with their capitalism. That's what she'd been convinced her whole life.

Speaker 4:          00:57:47       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:57:50       And then she has the realization bad at Madden would close with this because after this it goes through the stories of how they escaped and whatnot. But this realization, this moment in time when our mind becomes free and here's, here's how it goes, how much they all, how much had they all missed herself? Her daughter's locked away in North Korea working themselves to death for what we will do, what the party tells us, we will die for the general, we have nothing to envy. She had believed it all than wasted her life or maybe not.

Speaker 4:          00:58:53       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:53       Was it really over? She was 57 years old, still in good health. This was her wake up call. She was ready to go. So I ask,

Speaker 4:          00:59:14       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:59:18       what is your wake call?

Speaker 4:          00:59:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       What is in sleeving you? What is controlling your thoughts?

Speaker 4:          00:59:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:36       Is it the television set feeding your mind images of what life should be? Is it the Internet drawing you in and controlling your time? Is it drugs or alcohol numbing your brain and diminishing your desires? Or is it weakness, a lack of discipline that prevents you from accomplishing what you want to accomplish? And I'm not saying that you have to rebel. I'm not saying that there aren't things in life that we just have to do. There are. But what I am saying is ask questions. Don't believe everything that you're told and don't follow the path just because it's there. Don't get in line just because other people are. Get up and wake up and be conscious of what is creeping into your mind. What's getting in there? What are you letting in there? What is forcing itself in there and what does it want you to do?

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       You have only one life. So don't waste it being controlled by someone else. That's one of the things that's um, it's everywhere. Like you can easily be controlled by stuff. Like I'm a big one is, I hate it. I hate to harp on parents, but like your parents, so nobody's perfect, right? So all your imperfections or a lot of your imperfections will be passed onto your kids just because you don't know any better. Like that Mrs Song Lady like she just believed it. She didn't know any better. And so you can end up passing these things down like certain traditions or um, you know, just methodologies of raising kids that you might hear otherwise. But that's your thing. You know that you believed it it in your mind because your parents, their parents, you know, and you don't like how you say ask questions and you don't ask questions, you're just like, hey, that's how I was raised.

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       You pass it on. Meanwhile you're doing the wrong thing the whole time. That's what happens when you don't ask questions. That's what happens when you don't ask questions. You know, that's what happens when you believe authority all the time. Yeah. And Hey, this might come across as some people are sitting there saying, wait a second, Jocko worn shoe in the military for 20 years. You're damn right. I was, yeah. And there was a definitely, I was a rebellious kid and when I was in the military I was always questioned everything that we did and why we did it. So, and I think that's one of the things that helped me get to a leadership position and become a, a decent leader was the fact that I didn't just take everyone's word for it and say, Oh yeah, that's what we're going to do. Okay. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:03:14       No, you know what? We're actually going to change the strategy. We're going to change the tactics. What why was taught isn't working right now. We're going to do it differently. Yeah. They did that all the time. Yeah. But this is a broader scale. This is a broader scale. This is life, not just in the book, but life in general. Life in general. Like what are you doing? Where are you getting your direction from? Yeah. Who is, who's got a hold of your steering wheel. Yeah. Yeah. And make sure it's you that's got a hold of your steering wheel. Yeah. And that's one of the things where it's tough because you've got to balance it as well. You know, so if you're just rolling around saying, hey, nothing's true until I figure it out, it's Kinda like, you know, you've got to consider the opportunity cost where some people you got it, you know, you got to consider their credibility and then you got to kind of just go with it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       And again, this is just kind of demonstrating like there's a balance there, but just like are you're saying if something, if it's not working and someone presents you with some alternative, don't just be like, Hey, I've done it this way, so, you know, leave me alone type of thing. You know, ask those questions and listen to them. You know, chances are you might find a little improved method and doing some stuff. Yeah. Or you might find out that you've been sucked into a trap, you know, do you don't want to be in, no, you got to free your mind. You got to free your mind. You got to get out of that box, out of that cage. Yeah. Think of that. You know, I meet people now and it's so bizarre because, because I've traveled a lot and I've, and I've walked with a lot of different kinds of people, you know, oh, from all different walks of life.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       And I meet people sometimes and I think to myself, man, this guy is pretty awesome. He's got all this, you know, I wonder what this person's goal is. And sometimes I'll ask like, you know, what do you want to do? Or like, what are you, hey, how meet some kid or what you want to do. And some people say, you know, well, I want to do, you know, I, I think they're, I think they're going to come out with this giant dream and they come out with like a little mediocre idea. And I, and I won it and I, I haven't done this yet. I've talked to five people in the last six months that I thought were going to tell me about their dream and that I was going to be like in shock and I was going to be impressed and say, yeah, that's what I'm talking about, brother. Go get it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       And instead I had to bite my tongue because they were telling me their dream, but it wasn't big enough. It wasn't big enough. It wasn't. It was too realistic. You know, you now, you meet some people sometimes and they tell me their dream and I go, man, you ain't got a chance at that. You need to, you need to tone that down. You need to get a grip. Right. These people that are like, you can achieve anything you want. No, actually you can't achieve anything you want. If you could achieve anything you want, you know, everyone would be sitting on a yacht or doing whatever big badass thing that they want to do. Kind of depends on what you mean by can't though. But yeah. Yeah, it's true. I mean can't, that's what I mean. These guys, these people that are like, you can do whatever you want. No, actually there's limitations to that. All people are not created equal. Some people are smarter than other people. Some people are better athletes than other people. Hey, reality.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       Now what can you hear the question? Isn't that the question is what can you do with your, with what you've got, what can you do? And I'd much rather, I love to hear people overshooting, but don't trap yourself in a box where you're like, well, I'll be happy if I can do this. Right. And there's whole, the other part of this is, it's sorta like North Korea. There's people that are trapped in a paradigm in their head of the world. They think that the world is, this is this thing that they live in. They think that the world is this small, this small place that the people that they know, right? And the, the atmosphere that they live inside. And it's really, really small.

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       And I think to myself, man, you gots to get out. And I'll tell you, part of this came when I got out of the military because my whole life, you know, the only guys I knew were seals. So I mean that's just who I knew. And so when I got out and I started meeting other people and especially started working with big businesses, started meeting really not just successful in terms of financial people but people that had really done something [inaudible] and I started realizing that there was a whole nother level that, not a, not a higher level but there's just another world. Yeah, like in the seal teams. Oh well you know a, I did, I did my seal platoon to silk Tim commander, you know you do these certain, I did task unit commander, you do these things and that's what you do and it's awesome and that's a whole world.

Speaker 1:          01:08:51       But there's other worlds. And I remember telling him, one of my seal buddies, we were out surfing and this is after I'd been out for like two years. I had this exact conversation with them. I said, hey man, like we were taught, we were out there surfing for an hour and for 58 minutes we're talking about the seal teams, the seal teams, the seal teams, the seal teams in the seal teams. And then I w I said, hey man, the seal teams is awesome. But just so you know, there's other things in the world and it's stuff that I'm saying my mind was in North Korea, my mind was just seal team, you know, and I, and I'll tell you what I'm glad it was because it made my life very simple and I still, you know, obviously I love the seal teams more than anything, but there are other worlds out there and you can do other things in the world. And so now when I meet people in different environments and different jobs and each little, each little environment that I poke my head into, cause we work in different industries all over different, you know, manufacturing and gas, oil and, and financial and they're all their own little worlds. And sometimes people are trapped in those worlds. And I just want to say, man, free your mind, free your mind and see what else is out there.

Speaker 5:          01:10:15       Yeah. Kinda like what you and Tim, Tim Kennedy were talking about how you guys, you guys are an example of people who have seen the really, really bad parts of the world and the really, really good parts of the world. Cause you guys travel all over and you live in San Diego, which is, you know, arguably one of the, one of the best places to live. So you have that expanded view. Meanwhile, some people, they only go on vacation when they travel, so they have, although a real positive and really nice view, but it's really narrow or other people who only lived in bad places, just like people who grew up in a real negative household. When they go out into the world, just their beginning view of the world is negative. Like money's just so hard to come by because be when they grew up, their parents are complaining about the rent and bills are piling up and all this stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:11:03       So that's their attitude when they go out and then, then that's how they kind of take on the world. Man, I know this and this kind of a different thing. Same, same content, same subject, but, um, I had a friend in, in high school in this people, I grew up in quite a small island in Hawaii, so some people straight up have their whole life having been off of choir in no less than mainland. The mainland is this fantasy world place with where Disneyland is and Hollywood and all this stuff. So I had a friend, one of my good friends, he moved to the mainland, but it was just this small, teeny tiny town, just as small as coy. So I remember one time what state was the down in Colorado? Colorado is he moved to Pueblo, it's called. So I remember we were just having a conversation later and I was like, Hey, yeah, let's, let's go to Las Vegas.

Speaker 5:          01:11:49       A lot of white people go to Las Vegas. And I was like, let's go to Las Vegas or whatever. I was like, when do you do, what do you do you rent a car? He was like, I would never drive in Las Vegas. I would never drive in Las Vegas because it's too crazy. You know, there's freeways, there's no freeway on quiet on who there, there's a highway, but, and he, a grown adult, so to speak, um, can't even dry, you know? So that's like an example of that's how narrow his, his whole view was world, his whole world. And I'm that extended to his driving skill. You know, this was just so hectic on a freeway highway Las Vegas even, I don't even know how crazy that is. I mean, that's not a crazy place to drive really. You know, compared to like, I don't know, whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       So to La man hit the 405 north on a Thursday afternoon. Yeah. There's no doubt. There's so much out there and if you stay comfortable in your world, you can get used to, you can get comfortable starving in North Korea. That's what the scary thing is. That's the point that I think I'm trying to make is don't be comfortable because what you think is awesome right now, there could be so much more. You know, if you can envision and pay attention to what's going on in the rest of the world and break out of that paradigm that you're in and see that you can fly, you can fly around the world, you can do it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:26       Yeah. Just don't get trapped and for your mind. Yeah. All right, let's get to some questions from the interwebs in webs. Speaking to Inter webs. If you like supplements, good supplements, which I think we both recommend, right? As far as supplements go get on it. Supplements and the, and we are uh, sponsored as it so happens by on it. But I would say get on its supplements anyway cause I was taking them even before we were sponsored by on it on it.com/jocko and get 10% off. Get your Krill oil supplements. Get Your Alpha brainy. Yeah. Krill oil and Krill oil is anything for your joints is critical. Cause like when you, even even when I was young, when you lift hard, when you get after it working out. Um, so okay, so if you gain strength, right, which of course we all kind of want to do or whatever, um, you don't have to put a whatever on the end of the day.

Speaker 5:          01:14:29       We just all want to just period generally best not to speak for everyone, but I think it's safe to assume that yes, we're getting straight straight. But when you have a higher capacity for strength, a lot of times your muscles will just want to fire real heart. So what that can end up with is this weird stiffness, you know, so you're going to end like, it's like you got to, it's almost like you've got a warm up in life. It's almost like that feeling, you know, so it's like, yeah, you're strong, you're about to carry like the whole bloat of groceries in and you can do that. It may be, you know, you grown a grocery you to come up with song saying everyday stuff and you can, you can get after doing that. But you kind of got a warm up, you know, it's kind of like eh could have anyway, groceries, you have a lot man.

Speaker 5:          01:15:13       Hey Man, get after in the store, out of the store. So anyway, so the point being like when you have stuff like for your joints or you don't take care of your joints, see I would have told this totally differently. I like if you want to Jack big steel, you want to do Jujitsu, you want to jump off things, you want to throw stuff around, get some krill oil so you stay healthy. Yeah. Talking about groceries. No, but I'm saying though it's, it's, it is, it seems counter productive. Cause I've experienced, experienced this where I'm like, yeah, but then I kinda gotta like do twists. You know, Dan, I'm strong, you know, it's kind of cold out. And then I'd go to live, I'm like, Dang, I can lift a lot of weights. But why on this first set I can't even lift anything. You just need to Krill oil.

Speaker 5:          01:15:58       I'm just saying your joints gotta be like, good to go. That was a long explanation, right? It's absolutely true. I'm telling you, if, if you take it, you take that to heart. Well you already take Krill oil, so you're the man anyway. Yeah on it.com/jocko get 10% off. You'll be happy you did.

And I found out through one of the, the true pursuer in the know, sometimes you have ad blockers on your browser and they're activated, which is a good thing by the way. It's, it's good to, you know, cause sometimes they can air can get it back anyway. Yeah. Because it's, it's an actual code and it works in, in, in the same ways. Don't tell those small stuff to me. Yeah. Anyway, so deactivate it. If, um, you know, you want to get past it, there it is. Or if you want to buy some shirts, which uncle was hit and or name on it, go Jocko, store.com

Speaker 1:          01:17:11       that's it's cool way to represent anyway. Yep, there it is. Alright, let's get it first question. Any questions? Okay. First question, how do you continue to train Jujitsu when hurt or injured being? Same thing with whatever kind of interact. Got In whatever I'm going to do, I'm going to do what I can. You know? Now one thing you do have to do what? You have to let yourself rest enough that you can heal because sometimes they get the sprained ankle and instead of lasting one month, it lasts 18 months. No kidding. If you push, if you just won't let it heal, that thing is not going to heal. So you have to let things heels now, but you can go through all kinds of positions. You can work different transitions, but sometimes you get an injury and if you're a Jujitsu person, you know what I'm talking about?

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       Like you get a weird injury that you can't do certain movements. Yeah, like guy, I'll have a hurt back, can't get on top. I can't be on top, I can't. So you just practice your guard or you have a hurt, you know, groin, muscle. So you can't hold any guard. You have to work like side control only. Okay, cool. Let's keep side control or be inside control. So you can definitely do those things. You just figure out what movements you can do. You figure out what training partners aren't going to go psychopathic on you and dis hurt you even worse. So that's important. You know, just being in class and you're learning some new technique. You know, I find if, if I cannot roll when I'm in class, I'll like pay a little bit more attention to what the instruction is being given because I know I can't roll.

Speaker 1:          01:18:46       So I know all I'm going to get out of this is what I'm going to learn right here from Jeff, he Glover or dean list. And so I will be like paying extra special attention. Yeah, yeah. That's good. And uh, then I'll tell you, this is something like, I wear knee pads when our role and I think that they prevent some injuries from happening. And I just made a transition in my life where I used to wear extra large pads, knee pads, the neoprene, neoprene, kneepads like neoprene. There was raised braces though. Nothing bracing in there, just like a piece of neoprene. Yeah. But I recently like uh, two weeks ago I went, I used to wear extra large, then I went to large cause they felt a little bit snugger and I just got medium and I got some pretty big legs. And then I got medium in there, like really compressing my knees and keeping it all together and they feel really good.

Speaker 1:          01:19:38       So maybe just order that exercise down to little compression. And the same thing, like when I've heard elbow, I'll put an elbow pad on. Uh, so wrap up whatever you can and just keep training and warm up a little bit. Yeah. You know, I didn't use to, I do now I'll do a like a five minute round where I'm not trying to kill the person. I'm hoping that the person's not going to try and kill me. Although you and I had a little incident the other day, we get a little excited in that first round.

Speaker 5:          01:20:09       Yes. Just to clarify, when you say knee pads, elbow pads, they're not, not like the kind soccer, you know, they're neoprene through [inaudible] got wet suit, like a neoprene seat. Aesics yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. Clif Keane wrestling kneepads that's what they are. That's what they're calling. And they're generally made a neoprene. Gotcha. Yeah. So a lot of this, the trading partner thing, that's a big deal if you choose to train when you're injured. Because man, I can't sit here and say train when you're injured. And I might even say, don't train, just learn. Like, how are you saying if you want to show up because you actually got placed it, man. Yeah. You know, you can't just not show up on the mats and you know the maths, even if you're not rolling, it's like it's, that's a good place to be. Let's face it for most of us.

Speaker 5:          01:20:53       Um, and you sit in on a class or, or just do the instruction part of it and you know, and do the movements cause you're not going full speed, you're not rolling. Do the movements that you can and you can pick up a lot man. In fact, when you especially know how you say you were learning from Dean Jeff and most of the instructors here, they're really good. Even if you learn one little detail and even if you know, I know this guard pass, you know, he edited that one little detailed Dang, I've been training for all these years and I just learned that one dude, you can always add something. Um, the aim, I think that that's, that's a, that's a big deal. Show up and be there and you will learn. It's like I was talking to Greg one time, long time ago, he, he was like, we were talking about Hazel.

Speaker 5:          01:21:33       If someone asks you, how long have you been training? But let's say you treat, you started training 10 years ago, but then you train for a year. You took off a year and then you went back. But you were only training a little bit, you know, so how long have you been training? Really? How do you count it and all that. Anyway, so he was like, he did, we didn't go too deep into it, but he was like, not man, if you started 10 years ago, you've been training for 10 years because if you start training for a year, even if you take a year off, when you see something, you hear something, you, someone's talking about something, you're picking all that up because it's, you have the context, you know, you know, so your, your, your brain is already assimilated into your system in your mind, even if you're not training.

Speaker 5:          01:22:07       Yep, exactly. Right. So if you're injured, just keep that going. That's a weird thing to do though. There's a little ego situation if you're like, well, I've been trading for 13 years, meaning I started 13 years ago, but I took a lot of time off. Right. So you might catch me, right? Yes. Browse basically what they're saying. So just tell people like, I've been training for 13 years. Yeah. You cut that kind of got a whore. You know what? Let's see how good I am. Yeah. You know, if in fact you, yeah, cause I think it's calming. Get it so automatic for the person. Like, like if you're at, if you ask me how long have you been training, it's so automatic for me to try to justify my skill with my number. Oh, of how long, you know, even though the guy asking typically is just asking for conversation.

Speaker 5:          01:22:53       He's not trying to evaluate how good you are to ask you while I'm size and their shit. But you're different. How long you've been training for what school. Right. Everybody, you're different. You compete. Well I was talking to Keenan about that. Like how do you do it? And they're kind of psycho though. They'll be like, it's man hours. That's how you say it. You train for 10,000 hours. You do. That's how long you've been training. I don't know if he was serious or not, but that's the one we're looking at it. But yeah, moral injury thing. Man, I don't feel the same way as you though. I think I definitely training and I'll tell you what, like if I've said this before, if my back is tight. Yeah. Nothing better for your back. That Jujitsu. Yeah. Your next little sore. Jujitsu. Yeah. Shoulders in that little stretch or it, no, I'm not saying go out there and you'd be able to kill it. You're gonna be able to go like the superhard crazy rounds. Not going to work. Yeah. Yeah. Just be careful. I would say be careful. Yeah. Yeah. I am not a doctor in probably if people listened to me as if I was a doctor, their health would be deteriorated quickly. It'd being questioned for sure. From time to time. Don't sleep, eat meat, train, injured, go.

Speaker 5:          01:24:09       That's my attitude. All right. Next question. How crucial is knowing the personality type, introvert extrovert of your colleagues in combat business or choosing an mos, which is occupation. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:24:27       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:24:29       How crucial is it to know the personalities of people? It's really crucial. Knowing in understanding people is critical in every aspect of life.

Speaker 2:          01:24:43       And

Speaker 1:          01:24:46       that being said, the most important part of knowing people is knowing that you really can't know people, not 100% and I hear people talk about like personality types and there's these tests and these, these categories and stuff like that. And honestly, I've never been familiar with that. Um, but you know, you can put people in different categories, but for me, when you put person in a category by themselves, right? That's only 50% of the situation. The other 50% is the other people that they're working with [inaudible]. So I want to know not just what type of personality they have, because that's a, that's a, like I said, that's half of the equation. The other half is how do they interact with other people and other people's personalities? How do they handle slackers? How do they handle over achievers? How do they handle loud mouse? How do they handle submissive people?

Speaker 1:          01:25:48       How do they handle aggressive people? Those are all different personality traits. I want to know. I want to see how people are going to handle other personalities. And then I want to also know how they're going to handle certain situations. Pressure, conflict, a responsibility. I mean, I want to know not just what their personalities, but how they're gonna react because you can get people that are a really easy example is people that are super aggressive but they fold under pressure and you can get people that are super passive, that fold under pressure and vice versa. You can get someone that's super quiet and humble and under pressure. They're just strong. So that's what I want to know. I don't care what kind of personality you have. I mean, I do to an extent, but I want to know how it interoperates with the, with the world, with the people and with the situations that you're going to face and how do you do that?

Speaker 1:          01:26:42       You do that by observing them while they're dealing with other people and while they're dealing with pressure situations and that's just a reality. Yeah. And you can't, you can have an idea, you know? I won't say that. You won't be able to predict it, but you get surprised. Sometimes you get surprised about a person that you think is all tough and they fold or PR person that you think is weak and they're strong. So you will get fooled sometimes. A lot of times you're, you know, you're probably right 60% of the time, 70% of the time. Yeah. Yeah. Big One is also how, how they react when stuff goes bad. Like when stuff doesn't go their way, you know, and that's a spectrum too, but, and some you can meet someone and or things are going good, you're hiring new people with growth or whatever, whatever your situation.

Speaker 1:          01:27:28       And it's like, Dang this guys, I'm so glad I hired this guy, but when something goes wrong they self destruct or something like that, then yeah. That's I think a critical component. And so I get the, you know, the simple answers that there's, there's so many different variables, so many different nuances that what you want to do is you want to know your people. Yeah. You want to build relationships with your people so you know them so you understand them. That's what you want to do. Yup. The r word relationships. Yeah. That's what you need. That's how you get to know your people and that's how you lead them correctly.

Speaker 1:          01:28:10       Next question. In regards to subordinate leadership, how do you begin to change the culture slash school of thought of an industry or a company? You know, I'm not sure if they mean in regards to how do you change your subordinate leaderships or if you are subordinate. I'm not sure what, which one of those it is, but regardless, it doesn't matter because guess what I'm going to do? I'm going to lead. You do. Yeah. That's what I'm going to do. Whether I'm on, whether I'm the subordinate guy or the Superior Guy [inaudible] I'm going to lead [inaudible]. Oh, we're going to, I want to change things and make them a certain way. Cool. I'm going to do those things. I'm going to make those things happen. That's how you do it and if you're doing the right things for the right reasons, your message is going to spread. Yeah. You know how many bad seal platoons I was in? How many? Zero. You know why? Because me and my buddies, we always had a good attitude. We always had the right attitude and that spread to the other people that were with us.

Speaker 4:          01:29:14       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:29:17       Now there is a red flag that you can get for yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:29:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:24       And this is frustration when you start seeing yourself, which I'm not saying this necessarily, but this kind of question is coming from somebody that wants change to happen, but it's not happening. So they're getting frustrated and they're thinking they are not on board. They don't care if they aren't professional. They're not motivated like me. They don't have a good attitude too. There's a lot of blame going on right there. Yeah. So this isn't about them though. It's about you.

Speaker 1:          01:29:57       And it's about leading from any level in the chain of command. If you're leading, if you're doing the right things for the right reasons, that's going to spread. So when I, the classic example I talk about at all time is if you're exercising extreme ownership, if you're saying, you know what, I got this, it was a mistake made, it was my fault. That spreads. Yeah. If you're humble, that spreads. If you have an open mind that spreads, if you're being aggressive, not, again, not aggressive towards other people, but if you're being aggressive in pursuit of your goal, that spreads, you know what doesn't spread is when you're aggressive at people [inaudible] Oh, I'll actually, it does spread, but it's negative. Yeah. You don't want that. You know, it doesn't spread. It doesn't spread when you're trying to get people to do things because it's gonna make you look good. Yeah. That doesn't spread. You can't get people to behave better because you want to look good. It doesn't work. Yeah. People see right through that, oh, he wants to look good. You know what? I'm gonna do sabotage.

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       Now the other thing I've been saying lately, because people are surprised or whatever, or not surprised, but they're concerned, they don't see how it's gonna work so fast. And I say, you know what? It's not gonna work fast. It's gotta be, and here's the word, it's got to be a cam pain. It's gotta be a campaign. It's not like World War II was not one battle, right. World War One was not one battle. It's a campaign to win in Europe. It's a campaign to win in the Pacific. He takes battle after battle after battle. And guess what? You don't win them all. Yeah. You lose some of them. And so you're going to, on this campaign, you're going to win and you're going to lose. But you got to have the persistence and the patience and the to continue

Speaker 4:          01:32:02       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:32:05       in another piece of this is cute. You are best off if you go indirect and not be like, Hey, you need to act like me. No, people don't like that.

Speaker 4:          01:32:22       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:32:24       You need to just act how you're acting. And if you're doing it though, like I said, the right things for the right reasons, people are going to see you and they're going to follow.

Speaker 4:          01:32:32       Mm.

Speaker 5:          01:32:37       So that's how you begin to change the school of thought. Yeah. That genuineness like tends to show itself or that like if you're not genuine, it tends to show itself, you know, just because of the dynamics of Vinny, nevermind tends to it just straight shows itself. So when you're doing it for the right reasons, like you can't help but expose that, you know, that will be exposed. So yeah, people will sign up the sign right on and then you end up gaining like how you say it's a campaign. It's like you'll gain a little bit of ground. You might win this guy over like hey wait, that's, you know, that's a cool way of doing it. Or you know, whatever the group is and you make these small little steps and you kind of hold that ground and yet before you know it, it's kind of like Dang, the whole culture of this, I don't know, office or whatever. It's kinda changing. You know? It just happens. It's true. I've seen it happen. Next question.

Speaker 4:          01:33:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33:29       Jocko Echo. How do you work with people who overthink things? The classic overthinker, what does that mean? The over the means. They won't pick up this pen right here because they look in and say, hmm, I wonder what the weight of that pen is and if I should pick it up right now. Because I'm also thinking about saying something and what if I dropped the pen while I'm trying to say something that makes a noise on the desk that disrupts from the flow of my sentence. And then the whole flow of my sentences disrupted, which means my train of thought will be disrupted. Now I can't refinish when I was going to say that's an overthinker. So that's personal training. Now you can just imagine applying that fought pattern to an actual project that you're working on, right? Right. Not a good scenario. Or you're trying to apply it to a combat situation that you're in or you're trying to apply it to a relationship that you're in.

Speaker 1:          01:34:22       You start overthinking, well, if I see this, then she might think bad, right? What they mean by that, right there, that little by that. Yes. Yes. Dang. Yeah, that's true. Okay. That's an overthinker. So quit thinking so much. You're overthinking it. So here's what I do. When someone's overthinking, I got someone that's like a, like a chronic overthinker, I'm going to, I'm going to funnel them into the right mindset with questions and I'll give you some real easy questions to ask that'll make this happen. Things like, Hey, what do we mean by that? Or like, can you explain that again? And you're getting them to explain it in a simpler way. Mm. Or you say, you know, hey, so hold on. So what's the actual goal? What are we trying to get done here? Because again, they're putting layers upon layers of complexity on top of things that don't deserve it.

Speaker 1:          01:35:14       So what exactly are we trying to do? And again, you're just kind of playing dumb a little bit and asking questions. And then if you can't get to them, if you can't quite get them to simplify it, then you say, oh, okay. So we're trying to do this very simple statement. So, so that way they start subconsciously being coached and being taught to simplify things as much as they can in their head. And you know, another thing I've been saying lately when I'm out working with people is I used to not really understand why people are drawn to this complexity, but I actually think I understand now and I think it has something to do with the fact that if I come up with a plan and it's super complex and super crazy and you don't understand it, then I must be smarter than you.

Speaker 1:          01:36:10       Right? Yeah. Right. I came up with something that's so genius and so complicated that you don't even understand it. I understand it. I understand that. Yeah, they get you don't get it. Right. And by the way, you know, the only way you're going to understand it if I have is if I break it down for you because you don't get it. You know? So it's an ego trip and it's completely wrong. Because the fact of the matter is, if I'm trying to get you to do something and you don't understand it, I'm a loser. I'm failing as a leader. So you, you, you got to try and get people to understand that simplicity beats complexity every single time and overthinking things is a failure in ability to simplify. So another thing, and this is more kind of about planning, and this is something I used to talk about in the seal teams and I called it 6% advantage over the enemy.

Speaker 1:          01:37:09       And what this was was let's say you have a target building that you're going off of or going after. You're going to go take down a target building in the middle of wherever, the middle of the desert, and you basically come up with a plan that you're going to use, your standard operating procedures, you're all going to get online, or you're going to at least set up a base in a maneuver elements. Very simple. Two elements. One element is going to hold cover and the other one's going to move through the target cover move. It's, I mean it's as simple as it gets. That's great. So you come up with a plan, that's your plan. And then as you're looking at the imagery or you're looking at the map, you notice that there is an outhouse [inaudible] 150 meters away from the house. So now what you do is you go, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:37:51       Because there's that outhouse there you don't want to do is I'm going to take us another team of our guys. We're going to break them off from the main assault force, going to put them over there, and that's what they're going to be in case the guys in the outhouse, blah, blah, blah. So what you've done is you've separated your units, you've increased your communication problems, you've sacrificed your fields of fire, you dis-aggregated your fire power, you've diminished your unity of command. You've broke from your standard operating procedures. You've given up your real tactical advantage that you have for the chance. The chance that this guy at two o'clock in the morning when you hit the target is in the outhouse and not in his home. Is it worth that? No. So don't overthink it. We're hitting this target. You know what? Cool. We'll keep eyes on that thing. No big deal. But don't give up your tactical advantage because you overthought the situation. Hmm. Go with what you know.

Speaker 4:          01:38:51       And

Speaker 1:          01:38:54       another piece of that is a lot of times when people get super detailed like that and planning, they're actually planning things, planning on things that that can't be known. So why would we make a plan for something that can't be known? I got a better idea. Instead of making a plan for something that can't be known, make a plan that's adaptable. [inaudible] you want your plan to be adaptable and you know how you have the best adaptability, for instance, on the battlefield that you have the most control over your guys so that you can move them, maneuver them quickly. And how do you do that? By having good unity of command. And how do you do that? By keeping your guys for the most part together, the minute you start spreading them out all over the place and something changes, something unknown, that unexpected happens. Now you've got a real everyone back in and try and get them to change the formation of their assault. It becomes very, very complex. So if you set up your plan so that it's adaptable to changing situations, then you're going to be good to go. Same thing in business. Do you know what the market's going to do? No. We have predictors. Yes. Do. Do we know them? No. Do you know what your competitor is going to do? No. Do you know what your consumers are going to do? No. Do we have intelligence? Of course we do. Do we have metrics? Of course we do, but we don't know things. So keep your plans adaptable so you can make adjustments when you need to

Speaker 1:          01:40:36       as opposed to overthinking things and creating specific branch plans for a possibility of something that might occur in the future or might not. Don't overthink it. People, you know, sometimes people who under think things [inaudible]. Sometimes they tend to say, hey, why you overthink things when you're, when you're just normally thinking about something like you're thinking about the whole stem. Yeah. So there's obviously you have to think about things, right? Yeah. And yes, you should be cautioned of someone, cautious of someone that's just constantly saying, Mary, you're overthinking this. Three minutes planning.

Speaker 5:          01:41:22       Yeah. Yeah. Watch out for that guy. Yeah. That's why. Yeah. One, the word open, one overthinking comes up. Kinda understand what that means. But I feel like your example is sound juggle. What do you think of Greg Jackson that [inaudible] famous MMA coach criticizing Jon Jones on his recent power lifting and muscle gain?

Speaker 1:          01:41:52       Yeah, so if you didn't see this, if you're into MMA at all, they caught Greg Jackson on the mic after John Jones recent fight, say, and you know, basically, hey, I told you so. He's too big. He's all that power lifting. And I've talked about Greg Jackson before and nothing but respect for Greg Jackson. Uh, not only is he an outstanding coach and a great tactician, he's also just super humble guy who has built a really cool gym and built a lot of champions. So his record speaks for itself. So I'm not going to second guess. You know what he's saying about a fighter that he's worked with since day one. And I think really it boils down to this sort of definition of perfection. If you've ever heard this definition of the definition of perfection is when you have nothing more to add and nothing more to take away.

Speaker 1:          01:42:51       You've got it where it needs to be. And they use this with design, you know, design of whatever, furniture of iPhones have anything, buildings. When you've, when you've got everything that needs to be there and you can't take anything away, that's the, that's perfection. They say this about writing too, and you look at someone that writes really well, every sentence you look at that sentence, you can't take away a word and you can't add a word. And that's perfection. And I think that is what Greg Jackson is trying to do with Jonny bones. Jones, get him in that physical status where you don't want to add anything and you don't want to take anything away. So what they may have done, according to Greg Jackson, is they may have added a little too much muscle because of course you got to have some muscle because it gives you strength and explosiveness.

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       But at the same time, muscle requires oxygen. And so you can actually get too big to where it's affecting your cardio. So I think that's all Greg Jackson was talking about. And I think that's the balance that I, that's the balance I'm always looking for. You know, I want to be big and strong enough, but I want to have endurance. That's what I'm trying to do. Yeah. You know, and I try and find that balance by doing bolts, strength work and endurance work. That's, and when I say endurance, I mean muscular endurance. I don't mean marathon running cause I don't run marathons. METCON metcons baby. So that's what I think he's talking about. And you know, like I said, respect for Greg Jackson and I'm sure that he had a, he's got a good handle on why he's saying that.

Speaker 5:          01:44:39       Yeah. Fully. And when you, I do know a little bit of a little bit about this where, um, so if you gain some, a bunch of muscle fast, like over short period, period of time, you can have a way harder time dealing with, you know, the drawbacks of that muscle. And that is endurance. That's the main thing. Um, and at the same time, this doesn't have much to do with this particular situation, but if you gain muscle real fast, you can lose it. You have the potential to lose it real fast. But at the same time, you vice versa, if you cultivate this, you know, muscular body build, whatever, um, over time, like let's say you started lifting at 15 years old and you're, you know, 35 years old now and you've always been muscular, your body will have an easier time holding onto that must for if you stop like lifting for even a year or if you stop leaking for a long time and then you get back to lifting, it'll, it'll, it'll jump right back up as far as your muscle muscular muscularity.

Speaker 5:          01:45:39       So in regards to endurance, no matter what, bigger muscles require more oxygen, more, more fuel. So it's harder to get that PR, um, endurance up when you have big muscles just in general, but you're going to have the potential to gain that endurance way more if you've had muscle for a long time. So you do these big jumps in muscle gain. Man that endurance is going to suffer. It's going to be really hard to build up that endurance really hard. I'm not saying impossible, but it's just really, we're going to take time. Yeah. So yeah, that is a dangerous thing. Not Dangerous, but it's, it's a risky thing to do when, you know, I'm going to jump back into the fighting situation and I'm huge now. You know, it's like God, that insurance might stuff around that one, you know, obviously, or apparently it, uh, it did there. I think we, uh, maybe do one more here. Okay. Jocko, do you ever feel like Sisyphus pushing a rock up a hill only to watch it roll back down again and have to do it again? How do you overcome that? Do ever feel

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       like Sisyphus?

Speaker 4:          01:46:56       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:46:59       of course I have. Yeah. I mean, I do and I'll tell you, I've, I've thought about this and I've been waiting for people to start saying like, oh, you put another picture of the sweat and have a squat rack. Really?

Speaker 4:          01:47:17       But

Speaker 1:          01:47:19       I don't know if they understand. I've been getting on that squat racking, grinding it out for 25 years and I'm not bored with it yet. Hey, it might seem like that's an unwinnable battle, but really to me it's not about winning. It's the battle itself. It's the struggle. It's the daily test. That's what life's about. Not just physically, but mentally getting that rock to the top of the mountain.

Speaker 1:          01:48:11       That's not what my goal is. My goal actually is pushing the rock because pushing the rock that pushes me, that makes me tougher. That makes me harder mentally and physically. He, he, it gives me much more than I give it. I want a struggle how wanna grind in Claude scratching. I want to dig in and I want to push and I don't want it to end. If I ever got the rock to the top of the mountain, had it stayed there, I push it back down myself. I don't want to rest and I don't want to coast and I don't want to reach a point in my life where I say, [inaudible], that's it. I've done enough. I'm not gonna give any more. I'm not going to push anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:49:27       No,

Speaker 1:          01:49:30       no. That relentless cycle of day to day challenges, they are maddening to me. They don't frustrate me. They inspire me, inspire me to drive and push more and to push harder. That's what that rock does to me.

Speaker 5:          01:49:58       So why is c d g n

Speaker 1:          01:50:04       and get to push it

Speaker 5:          01:50:12       can I think that's all I've got for tonight. So,
