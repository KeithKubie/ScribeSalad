00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.929
We’re kinda destroying our lovely Earth,
so can’t we just go to the Moon?

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:04.929
TERRAFORM!

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:08.910
Yeah, that’s probably not the best option…

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.180
Hey guys!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.519
Moon-loving Amy with you on DNews today!

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.000
We got a great question on Twitter from @atul05kumar.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.840
He asked why our Moon doesn't have an atmosphere
and what would happen if we created one?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.679
When we think of a body having an atmosphere,
we typically think of one like Earth’s:

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.410
a nice, cozy envelope of life-giving gases
at pressure that keeps us alive and well.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.520
To keep an atmosphere like that, or any atmosphere,
a planet needs a few things.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.800
It needs to be big enough to have enough gravity
to hold on to that atmosphere, and some kind

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.030
of protection from the solar wind so it doesn’t
get completely eroded away.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.660
Mars is a great example.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.790
The planet lost its past thicker atmosphere
because it’s gravity is too weak to hold

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.790
on to the gasses and it doesn’t have a magnetic
field.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.420
Solar particles have ripped the gases away,
leaving the planet with the tenuous layer

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.660
of carbon dioxide it has today.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
Our Moon is smaller than Mars and has even
lower gravity, and it’s geologically inactive

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.380
so has nothing to produce a magnetic field
— basically a recipe for having no atmosphere…right?

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.119
Well, the Moon actually does have an atmosphere!

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.759
It’s just super rarified, so much so that
the engineers who designed the Apollo lunar

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.619
module were able to completely ignore it (not
to mention they didn’t know it was a thing

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.890
at the time but it all worked out).

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.320
It’s barely considered an atmosphere; properly
speaking, it’s called an exosphere.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.009
It’s some 100 trillion times less dense
than Earth’s atmosphere at sea level.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.210
That’s about the equivalent density as the
area in space where International Space Station

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.210
orbits.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.219
But still, it’s there!

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.229
And interestingly, the solar wind that destroys
atmosphere is also one of the factors contributing

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.240
to the Moon’s.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.310
The Moon is constantly blasted with a stream
of particles from the Sun that act as an abrasive,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.609
knocking sodium and potassium atoms off the
surface to populate the exosphere.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.399
There is also gas constantly being released
from the Moon’s interior; the radioactive

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.720
decay of potassium atoms leads to exospheric
argon and helium.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.799
More material is also released after impacts
of comets and meteoroids.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.331
There are still a lot of unknowns about the
Moon’s atmosphere, but with the discovery

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:15.500
of water molecules trapped in the regolith
(aka moon dust), scientists suspect the exosphere

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.080
might play a role in a potentially dynamic
lunar water cycle, moving molecules between

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.670
the polar regions and the lower latitudes.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.540
As for creating an atmosphere on the Moon…
well that one’s a little trickier.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.440
The same conditions that have contributed
to the Moon having no atmosphere mean it’s

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.210
unlikely to retain one we create for very
long.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.940
But could we even create one?

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.810
It would be really hard.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.150
Terraforming the Moon — not just building
a colony or a bubble to live in but changing

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.640
the Moon so it can support human life — would
mean adding volatiles like hydrogen, nitrogen,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.580
and carbon, and the only place to get those
elements in large enough quantities is in

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.640
the distant regions of the solar system in
the form of comets.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.960
We’d have to capture these comets and smash
them into the Moon, allowing the frozen material

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.450
to sublimate and populate the atmosphere.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.150
This would potentially liberate water in the
lunar regolith at the same time, yielding

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.370
natural bodies of water.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.900
Ideally, the momentum from these impacts would
also get the Moon spinning faster so humans

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.590
living there could have a more natural day-night
cycle.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.170
But this is massively complicated and way
out of our current technological capabilities!

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.960
So it’s unlikely to be something we’ll
see anytime soon, and by anytime soon I mean

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.540
any century soon.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.930
But that doesn’t mean there aren’t reasons
for us to keep researching the Moon.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.780
Because the lessons learned from Apollo — including
the first ever indication of what makes up

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.190
the Moon’s atmosphere — really taught
us that there’s a lot more to learn.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.830
If you want to learn more about NASA’s Moon
landing on the go, check out the show When

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.830
We Left Earth.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.930
You can get it now on the Discovery Go app.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.210
Check your app store or the link below in
the description to find out more!

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.860
And speaking of going to the Moon, the Moon’s
non-atmosphere helps explain why there’s

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.240
no flame when the Apollo lunar modules left
the surface.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.460
I explain the whole story over on my channel,
Vintage Space.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.330
And also, why do we only have one moon?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.940
Well, we made a video about that, here.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.090
So what other Moon mysteries - or just mysteries!
- keep you guys up at night?
