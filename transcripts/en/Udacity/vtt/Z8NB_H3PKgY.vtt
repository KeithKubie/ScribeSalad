00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.590
Let's talk about how we got that tricky 
last answer.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.390
For composite functions, the domain of f 
composed with g is all the x values in

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.930
the domain of g that lead to g of x 
values that are in the domain of f.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.575
Well, what on earth does that mean? 
That's definitely a mouthful.

00:00:17.575 --> 00:00:21.235
But basically it means that in order for 
a number to be in the domain of this

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:24.955
composite function, it must be in the 
domain of the inner function g in this

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:30.340
case, and in the domain of the composite 
function itself.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.470
If we have f of x equals one over x 
squared and g of x equals the square root

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.840
of x, then what is f composed with g. 
And what is the domain of that composite function.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.509
Please write this in inequality notation.
