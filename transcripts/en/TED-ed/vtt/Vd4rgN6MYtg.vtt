00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.406
We've all seen the movies where a monster,

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:10.939
created by a scientist in a laboratory,

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.639
escapes to wreak havoc on the outside world.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.088
But what if the monster was not some giant rampaging beast,

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:18.769
destroying a city, but just a tiny amount of seaweed

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.907
with the potential to disrupt entire coastal ecosystems?

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:24.915
This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia,

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:26.902
originally a naturally occurring seaweed

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.442
native to tropical waters.

00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:32.135
In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:35.287
This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:37.545
and ability to grow quickly without maintenance

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.281
made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean

00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:42.945
by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water.

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:45.140
Further selective breeding made it even heartier,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.844
and soon it was used in aquariums around the world.

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:49.528
But it was not long before a sample of this

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:51.338
aquarium-developed super algae

00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:52.923
turned up in the Mediterranean Sea

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:55.855
near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.664
The marine biologist who found it believed that

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.039
the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.415
along with aquarium waters,

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:02.679
while museum directors claimed

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.692
it had be carried into the area by ocean currents.

00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:07.333
Regardless of how it ended up there,

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.208
the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly,

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:10.805
having no natural predators

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.429
due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away.

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.392
And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.534
could grow into a whole new colony.

00:01:18.534 --> 00:01:21.426
Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines,

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:24.681
it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:26.386
covering coral reefs.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.683
So what was the result of this invasion?

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:30.318
Well, it depends on who you ask.

00:01:30.318 --> 00:01:32.640
Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.917
reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:37.099
that are eaten by fish,

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.554
with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it

00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:41.222
Killer Algae.

00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:42.539
Other studies instead claim

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.939
that the algae actually had a beneficial effect

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.513
by consuming chemical pollutants --

00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:48.755
one reason the aquariums strain was developed.

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.245
But the disruption of a natural ecosystem

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.847
by an introduced foreign species

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:55.426
can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.178
that may not be immediately visible.

00:01:57.178 --> 00:01:59.408
So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered

00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:01.621
at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon,

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.314
near San Diego in the year 2000,

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.197
having most likely come from the dumping

00:02:05.197 --> 00:02:07.694
of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain,

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.270
it was decided to stop it before it spread.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.632
Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.598
and chlorine injected inside.

00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:15.772
Although this method killed

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:18.137
all other marine life trapped under the tarps,

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.178
it did succeed in eradicating the algae

00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:23.379
and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.639
By responding quickly, authorities in California

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.036
were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating.

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:29.737
But another occurrence of the strain,

00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:32.093
in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia,

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:34.076
was left unchecked and allowed to spread.

00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:36.918
And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea

00:02:36.918 --> 00:02:38.836
or the Australian coast.

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:41.123
Invasive species are not a new problem,

00:02:41.123 --> 00:02:42.878
and can indeed occur naturally.

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:44.703
But when such species are the results of

00:02:44.703 --> 00:02:47.865
human directed selective breeding or genetic modification

00:02:47.865 --> 00:02:49.892
and then released into the natural environment,

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:51.246
their effect on ecosystems

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:53.894
can be far more radical and irreversible.

00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:55.954
With the proliferation of new technologies

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:57.838
and multiple threats to the environment,

00:02:57.838 --> 00:02:59.920
it is more important than ever for scientists

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.746
to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers,

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:04.058
and for the rest of us to remember

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.529
that what starts in our backyard

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.054
can effect ecosystems half a world away.
