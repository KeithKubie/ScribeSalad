1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,860
The Joe Rogan experience. Don't
want to hear the truth about it. Um,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,780
we did one about a trophy hunting,
uh, animals about how cause people,

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:12,330
young people get so mad. I'll look
at this guy shot a lion, right?

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,100
And the truth is that, uh, in some
countries, not 100% of the time,

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,850
but in some countries they are effectively
using trophy hunting as a way to,

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,760
to protect the animals because you know,

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,790
that's how they are able to sort of like
monetize, you know, in that place and uh,

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,270
you know, get money coming in, in order
to protect the animals. And they're,

9
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:37,110
they're very specific and strategic
about it and it can be part of a good,

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,840
you know, sort of animal
management, you know,

11
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:43,490
strategy and it's being used to some
success, you know? Um, and yeah,

12
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,780
people don't want to hear that.
Right. It's still really hard

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,650
to me and I hunt. Yeah. Yeah.
That, that, that, that whole,

14
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,560
the whole lion and elephant thing,

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,280
right? Ooh, that's a weird one though.
What they can do is they can say, okay,

16
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,420
well we've got these elephants,

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,930
one of these elephants is an old male
that's like killing the other elephants.

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,650
Right.

19
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,790
And if we organize these hunts where you
got to pay half a million dollars for

20
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,880
the right to even go in there,
right.

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,480
Well with the old male elephants, I know
that was the issue with that giraffe.

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,290
The woman that got actually don't
know that specific case. Yeah,

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:17,741
there was a,

24
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:21,010
there was a woman who got in trouble
because she shot this really beautiful

25
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:21,670
giraffe.

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,210
It was really dark and unusually colored
and it was dark because it was very old.

27
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,420
And the older the Giraffe,
apparently the males get really dark.

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,490
It was really cool again.
Um,

29
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,660
but she shot it and everybody went
crazy on the internet because, you know,

30
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,680
she was posing and
smiling with this drought.

31
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,500
But apparently that giraffe had to be
killed because it had killed at least two,

32
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,750
maybe three young males,

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,480
and it was no longer have a
apple breeding age. So they,

34
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,590
they were in this situation where they
didn't have the money to take it and

35
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:52,890
bring it to a zoo somewhere and the,

36
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,110
they would have gotten money from
having this woman come in and shoot it.

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,860
That's what they did. Yeah. That's Sorta,
that's sort of the idea, you know. Um,

38
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,730
I mean, one of the issues is if
you've got an area where, you know,

39
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,540
one of the problems is you need to have
a reason for the people who live in the

40
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,950
place to care about the animals. You
know what I mean? If it's just like, hey,

41
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,300
the ovens are going to roam free while
you've got people there who are like,

42
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,860
all right, fine. So I'm
living near some elephants.

43
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,990
Occasionally they eat my crops
and shit and that annoys me.

44
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:20,120
I don't really give the
occasionally. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

45
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:20,990
I don't give a shit about that.

46
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,170
And what that allows to happen is allows
poachers to come in and kill them.

47
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,080
Wantonly Right. But if instead,
okay, we're protecting them,

48
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,860
we have a revenue stream, right.
We get money when, you know,

49
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:33,920
hunters come in and pay a lot
of money to go kill one animal.

50
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,250
Right now we've got a way to hire guards.
We've got away.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,740
This is now a resource that
we're protecting. Right?

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,180
And that sounds a little cynical,

53
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:45,530
but it is working in some places and it's
both cynical and effect and effective.

54
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,590
And we have a, we, we had
a woman on from, um, uh,

55
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:52,340
the IECN International Union
for conservation of nature,
big conservation group,

56
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,470
talking about how this is
effective now in some places,

57
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,720
if you've got a corrupt government where
there's going to pocket the bunny, yeah,

58
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,650
that's bad.
Right?

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,320
But the point is just because the mere
idea of someone going overseas and

60
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,620
killing an animal is not necessarily
the worst thing in the world.

61
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,120
We have to look at the
details of the situation.

62
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,940
And it's hard for animal lovers to hear.
Animal lovers don't like to hear that.

63
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,390
Uh,
yeah,

64
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,910
they don't. They don't. And I, like I
said, I don't like to hear it. I wish,

65
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,530
I wish I could be hear it either.
I wish people would just,

66
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
it just what freaks me out more than
anything is that there's no other options.

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,400
It's not like a bunch of people are
donating a bunch of money to keep these

68
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:31,340
areas clean and free of poachers.
And yes,

69
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,160
the amount would be massive,
right? We can, we can donate
money, but yeah. Yeah. That,

70
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,160
that's the w when you've got a problem
that big and intractable as how do you

71
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,870
save these animals, you know, and against
habitat encroachment, right? Again,

72
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:48,140
you know, people want to farm on
that land. People, you know, people,

73
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,450
people have lives, right?
They're not sitting around going,

74
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,700
the people in those countries
are not sitting around going, oh,

75
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,250
I love the cute elephant.
Like we have the luxury to do.

76
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:58,190
They like fucking live there.
Right? And so how do you get,

77
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,000
how do you get those people
in that society to, to
really protect those animals?

78
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,290
That's a hard question to answer.

79
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,980
And some places are having success with
that strategy and that's something that

80
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,430
we can understand. We don't have to
approve of it. And every single case.

81
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,130
And we can say that's really tough
for us as animal lovers. And in fact,

82
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:14,870
the character I'm talking
to you on the show says,

83
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,710
I still just hate the idea of an animal
being killed. Right? And I said, yeah,

84
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:22,280
so do I. Right. We try to
dramatize that emotional, you know,

85
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,760
resistance on the show, like that
emotional reaction that we have. Yeah.

86
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,180
I also don't like the idea of, of an
animal being killed brutally. You know,

87
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,370
I think I'm uncomfortable with the idea,
right?

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,640
But if my main goal is to preserve the
population of these animals overall and

89
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,360
stop them from going extinct,

90
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,350
maybe I need to accept that this
tough truth that once in a tie,

91
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,510
once in a while one's gotta be
shot through the head of the rifle.

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,300
Maybe I need to accept
that. It's, it's weird.

93
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,810
That's what I chose about really weird
when it comes to things that people don't

94
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:55,580
eat, like lions stuff. I don't
understand the psychology.

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,220
Michael Douglas and the,
what was that movie with the Val Kilmer,

96
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,380
the ghost and the darkness that the,

97
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,470
the lions that decided to kill those dudes
are, would never heard of this movie,

98
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,980
man. It's a great movie. The
ghost in the darkness. Yeah.

99
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,590
I feel like it's from the 90s yeah,

100
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,690
but it's a really good movie about a
true story about this guy that they

101
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:15,181
brought,

102
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,590
they brought this Michael
Douglas character was brought
in to hunt these lions

103
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:23,700
that were systematically targeting and
killing these workers that worked on this

104
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:28,050
railroad. This team of lions work
together and started eating people. Wow.

105
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,290
That's great. My way. And they would go,
it sounds all right. And they have to,

106
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,410
they have to go for the alliance. Yeah.
They have to go kill these lines. Yeah.

107
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:37,530
There it is. Ghost in the darkness.
Oh, holy hell biting tension.

108
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,070
That is a great hunters. Kilmer's
looking good there. Yeah.

109
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:45,390
That was pre fatso but val Kilmer free
when he went off to do it was too good

110
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:49,410
looking guy handle anymore looking
guy too handsome. That's the problem.

111
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,000
You had to just go off the deep end.
