00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.580
In the responsive images support course,

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.000
they tell you how to
use unicode characters.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.520
I believe it's like fontawesome.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.776
So you can take these icons and
link them, so

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:15.000
you get a Facebook icon or
a Twitter icon that you can use.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.040
So if you want to add something special,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.700
you can check out that course and
try to give that a shot if you want.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.840
&gt;&gt; So,
this is the CSS Zen Garden web site.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.670
As you can see here,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.110
there's all kinds of little things
you can choose from the side.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.621
But if we go to view all designs here,

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:35.488
we can see that there's just tons of
just these amazing looking pages.

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:38.430
Let's go to this apothecary one.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.238
I mean like,
just really well thought out designs,

00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:47.530
really good use of font and spacing and
page breaks and things like that.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.250
And this is all the same CSS as,
say, this page.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.480
Or sorry, all the same content, [LAUGH]
not CSS obviously, all the same content.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.610
Two completely different pages,
two completely different styles, but

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.640
all of the same content and
just sort of this beautiful use of CSS.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.703
So if you're looking for inspiration
on what you want to do with your CSS or

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:16.280
your style, this is a great
page to look for some ideas.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960
Some of it is very advanced,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.650
so by no means do you have to
create something like this.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.468
The people making these
tend to be like really

00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:30.960
well-established graphic designers.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.220
But I mean, you can just get some ideas
of some of the awesome things you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.070
can do with CSS.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.126
&gt;&gt; Can you recommend a good source
of copyright for your images?

00:01:41.126 --> 00:01:44.680
That I do.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.480
Look for
the word creative commons license.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.350
A lot of people,
a lot of independent photographers,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.410
they post free photos every day,
everywhere.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.030
Just search for the word
creative commons license, photos.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.270
Flickr has a whole set of great
photos that you can look on,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.370
and there's a filter on Flickr for
creative commons license.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.160
And if you don't want to use Flickr,
just use your favorite search engine.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.150
And type creative commons license
images, and it will have a filter to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.840
search by images and it will give
you all the creative commons images.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.680
And those are all free to use, provided
that you give the author attribution.
