00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
You know what I've been thinking a lot about lately?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.260
That you don't love communism but you don't hate it?

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.840
No.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.060
Oh!  That you're really excited that they finally found the cure for AIDS?

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.200
Not that you have AIDS or anything.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.460
Guys!  I've been thinking--

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.260
I'm gonna stop you right there because I am not a guy

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.320
so why don't you go ahead and rephrase that before you continue.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.460
Jane.  Atticus.  It was actually a rhetorical question

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.280
as a segway into what I was actually thinking.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.280
I apologize deeply.  Go ahead.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.760
That's okay.  No problem.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.700
I've been thinking: why are colored pencils more difficult to erase than regular pencils?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.420
I mean they're both just pencils.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.300
Well I mean obviously colored pencils are

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.280
better than regular pencils because they're

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.680
harder to erase

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.220
Can we be a little bit more sensitive please?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.000
I don't know how I feel about us calling them "colored" pencils.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.820
Yeah, and I'm actually really shocked Jane that you would be labeling something as better

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.040
than something else.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.520
I kind of just feel like charcoal is a classic look.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.760
I prefer it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
For film maybe but not for art.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.080
Film is art.  And I think you mean black and white film, not charcoal film.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.400
Actually, I do mean charcoal.  I'm sorry.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.960
I guess you haven't seen films from the 1700s.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.800
Yeah.  Nobody has because they don't exist.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.960
Do you two even know what it means to exist?
