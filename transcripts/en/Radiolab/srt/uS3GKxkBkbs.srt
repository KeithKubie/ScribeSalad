1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,920
You are listening to radio lab radio

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,020
from [inaudible] W N Y s e

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,620
n n p. R. Alright.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,390
For the money for all the glory
for the Gold Robert Jad take four.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,690
Hey, I'm Jen. I have them Rod. I
remember killing that actually.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,180
I'm a jab boom rod. I remembered
Krulwich this is radio lab, the podcast,

7
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:31,500
the podcast. So we've been talking about
animals for the last few podcasts. Um,

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,510
particularly how difficult it is to
find something like a shared space.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,970
We're building to the podcast that
follows this one where we've got this

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,710
enormous and wonderful
story. But this one, uh,

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,240
the podcast you're about to hear is um,

12
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,330
an elegant and kind of momentary
communion between us and them.

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,740
Hi, this is Michigan radio. I have
your guest. Hi, this is Barb. Hi,

14
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:01,160
this is Robert [inaudible] and
how do you say your last name?

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,130
Smart Smiths and that splits. But Smith's,

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,330
Barbara Smith is a professor
at the University of Michigan
where I teach courses

17
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:10,820
on animal behavior. And back in the 70s,

18
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,910
she moved to Kenya in
Africa to a remote area.

19
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:18,890
We out on the plains fairly open grassland
and she tried to get friendly and

20
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:23,840
then get access to a
troop of baboons. No. How,

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,380
what was the deal like you
would wake up, drive some Leer,

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,700
get out of your van or whatever, walk him.

23
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:34,701
I get the break of day before the break
of day and then follow them around all

24
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,190
day for how many days? A week?

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,580
Seven for for weeks at a time or
a month at a time or two years.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,030
Two years. Yeah.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,793
Um,

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,120
this trip hadn't been studied before,
so they were afraid of people,

29
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,170
but because the

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,310
area was very open, it was possible
to approach them from a distance.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,710
She positioned herself, you know, like
about a hundred feet away. And then,

32
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:01,850
yeah,

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,540
and day by day I would
kind of inch closer,

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,300
80 feet away, 50 feet.

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,550
And then as soon as they started
running, I would stop moving

36
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,843
towards them.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,920
She says sometimes they would
flash their teeth at her long,

38
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:24,210
sharp canine teeth and then
she'd edge off pretty scary.

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,380
And then slowly she'd try again.
I can get a little bit closer.

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,060
Mm.

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,523
30 feet,

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,933
20 feet

43
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,540
until finally after a couple of months
I got close enough so that I could see

44
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:43,250
their faces.

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,960
I could record and begin to recognize
them as individuals and they could

46
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:51,560
recognize me. That's when
things started to shift.

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,040
It was like they realized that I was a
social animal like them and that we could

48
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:03,490
negotiate the distance between
us. How does that work?

49
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,380
I started by just talking to them,

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,110
telling them that I wasn't a threat
in English or in gratefulness.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,130
Yet all mammals recognize that a, um,

52
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,710
fairly high pitched voice is someone
who's not threatening as opposed to a very

53
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:23,020
deep voice, which scares them.

54
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,910
So I would talk to them in a light
tone of voice to reassure them.

55
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:28,961
Finally,

56
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,961
I got to the point where I could be just
a few feet from them and nobody would

57
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:40,030
even glance at me. And what if one comes
up to you and goes or whatever they do.

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,480
Then I would think it was a warthog at

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,450
Boone grunt sound like,
Huh, Huh, Huh, Huh,

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,390
okay. They smack their lips in between
grunts the fee if they do that to you.

61
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,460
And they're getting
closer. What do you do?

62
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,850
You would respond in kind
or what do you do? Yes.

63
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,680
Sometimes I would respond in
kind with it. With the grant.

64
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,990
It's not polite.

65
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,580
If someone says something to you to
just act like a rock leaves that,

66
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,870
would that be an insult? Yes.
Say hello when I say hello,

67
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,980
it's excellence, but isn't this one
of these rules of field biology?

68
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:24,440
Aren't you supposed to act like you're
not there and they'll act like you're

69
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,640
not? Yeah, but it doesn't
really work that way.

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,580
They're social animals and
they know that you are,

71
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,320
so your solution was to become,

72
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:36,830
as I figured it's you're like you be
try to become even very shy. Baboo yeah,

73
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,260
shy and pretty boring. And did that work?

74
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:46,261
Did you pick 10 I found
myself very naturally sitting
the way that many baboons

75
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,131
do,

76
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:53,080
which is they stick their legs out in
front of them and they hold their toes.

77
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,080
The longer I was with them, the more,

78
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,010
well completely automatic it
became for me to be shy by Boone.

79
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,830
I didn't have to think
about it. I just was,

80
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,140
as this progressed as are you beginning
to feel like you're a shy bubble? Yeah,

81
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,220
I felt increasingly, uh,
aware of my animal self.

82
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,780
I mean the scientist is doing the
things the scientists needs to do,

83
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,810
but I think I was kind of
in this a sub universe.

84
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Me and the baboons I was going where they
went and resting when they rested and

85
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,260
walking when they want.

86
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,560
And one day she says she saw a beautiful
baby gazelle prancing by and the

87
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:39,130
baboons pouched on the animal
rifted apart to eat it.

88
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,410
And watching Barbara admits
that she salivated. Yeah,

89
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,630
I did. I couldn't help it.

90
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,900
And I am a vegetarian,

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,600
but she says the real transforming moment
was she was out on the plains one day

92
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,610
and [inaudible]

93
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,100
I got caught in this pouring
rain and lost the baboons.

94
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,050
So I headed downhill to toward the
lake because that was the way home.

95
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,000
And when I got to the
beach it was still boring.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,750
So I [inaudible] did to this hut.

97
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,720
There were these little, um,

98
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,270
fishermen's huts on the
beach that were empty,

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,070
completely dark inside.

100
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,860
And after I was in there
for a minute or two,

101
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,110
my eyes started adjusting to the dark
and first thing I noticed were these sort

102
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,550
of lumpy shapes.

103
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,610
And then I realized that there
were bad balloons in there.

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,240
And as my vision got better,

105
00:06:56,241 --> 00:07:01,241
I I could see about 15 or 20 members
of my troop who had gone into the hut

106
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:08,330
probably just before me. I
had the same idea that I had.

107
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,280
And um, I,

108
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,010
I was quite touched that they were silent
when I moved in there and that nobody,

109
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,950
you know, nobody said, are you
doing in here? This is our hot,

110
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,530
they were just silent.

111
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,930
I think someone even shifted over
slightly to make room for me.

112
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,060
And we just sat there
for about 15 minutes,

113
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,640
started to kind of steam up, you know,

114
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,720
from their breath and they smell it
kinda like grass and leaves cause that's

115
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:44,460
what they've been eating.
It's a nice smell.

116
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,040
Did you ever think for
even that at all a while,

117
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,790
maybe in that hut was the moment.

118
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,230
Do you ever think that you
had done something close to
some kind of trespass or,

119
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,330
ah, did you steal something
here? I, no, no, no, no.

120
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:04,590
That was just in a weird, we are so
loose used to this dividing line.

121
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,360
There's humans on one side and then
there's all the other animals on the other

122
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:12,510
side and we don't meet up.

123
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,490
But if you go back in
evolutionary time, I mean,

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,500
that line wasn't there. So rather than
feeling like I was stealing something,

125
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:27,501
I felt like I was retrieving
something that was my heritage.

126
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,270
Hmm.

127
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,270
It felt so completely
natural to just be with them,

128
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:37,570
to not be doing anything, to just be

129
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,743
[inaudible].

130
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,220
Barbara Smiths now spends her
days in Ann Arbor, Michigan,

131
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,740
cheesy teachers here
at the beak university,

132
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,250
and her African days are well
there now a couple of decades old.

133
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,540
But what a tale. Yeah. Speaking of tails,

134
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,810
we are at the tail end
of this little podcast.

135
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,720
If you want any more information on this
piece or anything you've ever heard on

136
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:26,890
this program. radiolab.org is
the place. I'm Chan Abu Miranda.

137
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,570
I'm Robert Krulwich.
