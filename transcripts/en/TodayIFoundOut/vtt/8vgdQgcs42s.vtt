00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:21.360
Although 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.061
tequila dates back only a few hundred years,
people have long used the heart of the agave

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:28.700
plant to make delicious, alcoholic beverages.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.700
Maguey (Agave)

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.980
Cultivated from at least as early as 200 A.D.
by the Zapotecs of the Oaxaca Valley of southern

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.360
Mexico, the maguey has been essential to life
for well over a thousand years.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.510
Providing the raw material for building homes
and able to be converted into clothing and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.480
even rope, the numerous species of maguey
(also called agave and the “century plant”)

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.790
were an invaluable source of fiber for those
living in the arid, rocky highlands.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.100
In addition, since agave stores juice in its
heart, for well over one thousand years, people

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.110
have used it as a food and liquid source,
as well as transformed it into an alcoholic

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.330
beverage.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.190
(Yes, Native Americans had many alcoholic
drinks long before the Europeans arrived,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.190
contrary to popular belief.)

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.190
Notably, by the time of the Aztecs (14th-16th
centuries), it had been discovered that maguey

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.190
offered an effective cure for both gonorrhea
and syphilis, as well as other infections.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.190
Pulque

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.190
Since ancient times, the liquid from the maguey’s
heart, sometimes called aguamiel (honey water),

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.749
was traditionally collected from the head
and fermented without heating, but simply

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:19.219
through the introduction of natural yeasts.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.420
This basic process resulted in a drink with
an alcohol content of between 4-8%.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.970
Still made today, depending on the mixture,
it can be sweet and fruity or a bit sour.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.970
Many believe it is a rich, and enjoyable,
source of niacin, thiamine, riboflavin and

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.970
pantothenic acid.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.479
Reputed to have been discovered by the goddess,
Mayahuel, pulque is also associated with another

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.189
400 rabbit deities, collectively called the
Centzon Totchtin.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.640
This large number of gods is thought to represent
the “infinite number of forms intoxication

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
takes.”

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.640
Mezcal

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.490
When the Aztecs were conquered in the 16th
century, the Spaniards also brought (and shared)

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.909
the process of distillation, by which the
fermented pulque was heated, and the vapors

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.259
captured, cooled, reconstituted and collected,
resulting in a stronger and purer alcoholic

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.119
beverage – mezcal.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.179
The name is said to derive from a Nahuatl
term, metl or mexcametl, and unlike tequila,

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.300
which can only be made from the blue agave
plant, mezcal can use any of 11 types of the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.829
different maguey found in Oxaca, including
Mexican, blanco, azul, largo, pasmo, tepestate

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.829
and quishe.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.900
At first mezcal was called a variety of names
including agave wine and mezcal brandy, before

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.129
simply mezcal was settled upon.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.129
Tequila

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.340
Protected due to Mexico’s participation
in the World Trade Organization, the Paris

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.319
Convention for the Protection of Industrial
Properties, the North American Free Trade

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.250
Agreement and other international treaties,
the word “tequila” may only be applied

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.030
to a particular type of mezcal made in a particular
place.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.010
Under the control of the Tequila Regulatory
Council (CRT), only the spirit made in the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.790
Jalisco state in west-central Mexico, and
only that distilled from the juice of the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.950
Agave Tequiliana Weber plant (blue agave),
may officially be labeled “tequila.”

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.180
The origin of the word is lost in time, but
many believe it cam from a Nahuatl term or

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.060
phrase that alternately meant “the place
where they cut,” “the place of work,”

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.569
“the place of wild herbs,” and “the
place of tricks.”

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.260
Tequila is also the name of a town in the
state of Jalisco that was officially established

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.079
in 1666.

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.530
Although there is some dispute, most sources
point to Don Pedro Sánchez de Tagle, the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.609
Marquis of Altamira, as the first person to
mass produce tequila, beginning about 1600.

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.849
However, it was not until 1795 that Don José
Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo was the first to

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.700
receive a license to make it from King Ferdinand
IV of Spain.[1]

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.530
Don Cenobio Sauza was the first to export
to tequila to the United States in 1873 when

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.019
he shipped 3 barrels of it to El Paso, Texas.[2]
This was soon followed by a shipment from

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.439
Don Cuervo, as well.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.219
Tequila became much more popular in the US
during World War II, when importing whiskey

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.879
from Europe became very difficult.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:46.499
In fact, the 6,000 gallons of tequila imported
in 1940 had grown to 1.2 million gallons by

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.499
1945.[3]

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:52.599
Today, many credit Jimmy Buffet and his song
“Margaritaville” with ensuring tequila’s

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.870
place in the pantheon of America’s most
beloved spirits.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.260
The Worm

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.129
Officially, only mezcal is supposed to have
the worm, which itself is a caterpillar of

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.129
the mariposa (butterfly).

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.500
Known as gusanito and gusano de maguey, it
feeds on many varieties of the maguey plant.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.519
Its origin in mezcal is not clear and some
say that the tradition dates back to Aztec

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.350
times when the priests would add the worm
to batches of pulque.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:47.419
Others believe the practice started later,
simply as a means to test the strength 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:05:00.810
of 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.169
the distilled mezcal.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.270
Consumers who prize the worm believe its color
to be an indicator of quality.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.830
The red worm, which lives in the heart and
root of the agave plant, is said to denote

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.740
a higher quality mezcal when compared with
the white or gold worm, who is stuck living

00:05:15.740 --> 00:06:24.349
out 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:08:13.310
on 

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:20.830
the maguey’s leaves.
