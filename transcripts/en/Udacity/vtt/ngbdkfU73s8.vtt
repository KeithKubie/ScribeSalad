00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's look at the results first. The blue curve is the one that we know, almost optimal braking.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And you see that this type of pumping doesn't really cut it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It takes more than 5 seconds to bring the car to a complete stop.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
As the driver slams on the brake, the wheels locked every second,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which means that the wheel slip is almost never close to the optimum.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The implementation uses this on/off factor to where switch the brake on and off.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
To compute when to switch off the brake, it'll get the fractional part of the time--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the time minus its integer part.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In the solution, we won't be overly picky about this precise instance of time

00:00:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to take the finite step size into account, which require some more thinking.
