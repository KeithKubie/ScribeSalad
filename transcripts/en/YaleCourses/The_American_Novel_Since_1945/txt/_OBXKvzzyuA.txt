Speaker 1:          00:01          All right. So today I'm going to give my second and final lecture on the human stain, my first lecture focused on identity. And my final argument about the novel in relation to the question of identity is that the first half of the novel comes down on the definition of identity through secrecy. That what makes you who you are anyway, what makes Coleman the person he is is his secrecy, who he really was, was his secrets. So I did that little reading of that phrase. Today I want to talk about what happens in the second half of the novel to the question of secrecy and how that relates then into the question of desire and narratives. So that's where I'm going today. Um, if you'll recall on page 47 I don't think we need to turn to this. Um, desire is said to be generated by the, the human discrepancies, the difference between Fanya with her, uh, illiterates vocabulary and Coleman with the vocabularies have to ancient languages and his language of English.

Speaker 1:          01:22          So discrepancy difference is understood as the engine of desire. So this shouldn't be surprising when you think about what desire is. Uh, many psychological theories of desire, uh, agree on one thing and that is that desire is reaching towards a lack of desire is generated by lack. So you can think of difference as one version of what it means to lack what you are not. You then desire what you have not you then desire so you don't desire that thing which you already have. So it's just a simple structure of desire that I want you to keep in mind. Now I want to note in the second half of the novel something that you probably noticed at the beginning of chapter four, we are plunged back into Nathan's first person voice. So that I have Nathan comes back very strongly at the very beginning of that chapter.

Speaker 1:          02:22          We haven't seen it for a while. We've been embedded in Fanya and less and Delphine and Coleman inside all their minds using that technique of free and direct discourse where the narrative voice just sort of seamlessly allows you to look at the world through that character's eyes and in that character's mind. So that technique is highlighted as a technique in chapter four when we are reminded. So suddenly that this is all being written by Nathan, that the illusion of these characters is just that it's an illusion. The second half of the novel then sets up the source of the story. How does Nathan know all that he knows to give us that story, sets up the problem of that source. And then it finally answers it in the person of Ernestine's. Silk.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Ernestine Coleman sister answers some of those basic questions about Coleman's background. First of all, revealing his racial secret simply by her presence at the funeral and her resemblance to his daughter, Lisa. So her body is a kind of revelation to Nathan and then she fills in some details that we can see recapitulate material that has come in an imaginative form, different imagine a two form earlier in the novel. So I would note, and I will come back to this, uh, this point, Ernestine is kind of a stock character. There are some characters in this novel, uh, Delfin to some extent less and Ernestine who are stereotypes of one kind or another.

Speaker 2:          04:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:12          There are various ways of thinking about this problem in Roths fiction. Uh, the critical way of thinking about it is that his fiction is uneven, that he cannot somehow truly inhabit the complexity of some kinds of characters. And he has said about his own work that he writes novels about the lives of men very clearly masculine fiction. So that should come as a prize, as a surprise to none of you. Um, so that's one way of understanding the, uh, sort of cliched quality of characters like Ernestine. I'm going to offer a slightly different way of understanding that, uh, by the end of the lecture, so be looking for that. But for now I just want to focus on the structure of the second half of the novel, setting up the problem of knowledge and then producing it a part of an answer to it. But even though you have that partial answer, there's still a residue of functionality within the logic of the novel. Of course it's all fiction, but within the logic of the novel, we know that there's a lot that Nathan is making up. So Ernestine story doesn't get you Stena dancing at the end of, so, uh, Coleman's bed, for instance, a very important scene in Nathan's construction of Coleman.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Um, so there are scenes like that that are purely the product of Nathan's imagination. You have the final spasm of this kind of imagining when Nathan's stands at Coleman's grave and asks him to speak to him one last time and tell him the story of telling Fanya his racial. So you have that last scene where we enter fully into the minds and voices of those characters.

Speaker 2:          06:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:06          One question that you want to ask here is how we should understand this move. Is there something perhaps duplicitous about the way Nathan root suggests he's related to this enterprise of imagining? We're told on page three 37 right before that grave side scene that it was Ernestine's speaking to him that caused him to be seized by his story. This is in the middle of the page. Um, I was completely seized by his story by its end and by its beginning. And then in there I began this book. So we get an account of it start. So he seized by the story. It puts him in a position much like he is at the very beginning of the told story that you've just arrived at the end of when Nathan, when, um, Coleman shows up at his door demanding that he write the story of the unjust dismissal from Athena College. So there are two moments when Nathan claims to be seized by Coleman and his story, it puts Nathan in a very passive position. It suggests that he's not the active party here, that somehow he has been drawn into this enterprise, into this narrative, maybe against his will. I think you can see this as duplicitous.

Speaker 1:          07:44          So I want to look a little bit at how this is duplicitous and this is where desire comes back into the braid of my argument. Is that a sentence on page one 60 a four, I want to direct your attention to,

Speaker 2:          08:01          okay.

Speaker 1:          08:03          Desire that urge to and habit or fill the lack of whatever it is. How's a structural relation to language in Roths work? So desire has a structural relation to language and I think there's no better example of it and there's perhaps no better example of Roths, um, uh, ecstatic sentence structure. Then this sentence on one 64 and I will read the whole of it. Um, it starts the kid, you see it about a quarter of the way down, halfway through a line. The kid, this is about [inaudible] the kid whose existence became a hallucination at seven and a catastrophe at 14 and a disaster after that, whose vocation is to be neither a waitress nor a hooker, nor a farmer nor a janitor, but forever the stepdaughter to a lascivious, his stepfather and the undefended ops offspring of a self obsessed mother. The kid who mistrust everyone sees the con in everyone and yet is protected against nothing.

Speaker 1:          09:15          Whose capacity to hold on on intimidated is enormous. And yet who's purchased on life is minute misfortunes, favorite embattled child, the kid to whom everything loathsome that can happen has happened and who's luck shows no sign of changing and yet who excites and arouses him like nobody since Stina not the most, but morally speaking, the least repellent person. He knows the one to whom he feels drawn because of having been aimed for so long in the opposite direction because of all he has missed by going in the opposite direction and because the underlying feeling of rightness that controlled him formerly is exactly what is propelling him now the unlikely intimate with whom he shares, no less spiritual than a physical union who is anything bought a play thing upon whom he flings his body twice a week in order to sustain his animal nature, who is more to him like a comrade in arms than anyone else on earth.

Speaker 1:          10:16          Wow. That's quite a grammar. What you see in that sentence is language trying to embody desire by its very excess. It's acting out formally, just how far Coleman has to reach from where he was to arrive at steam, at a Fanya as his object of love and desire. And you see that missing lack is thematized in the middle of this sentence because of all he has missed by going in the opposite direction. She embodies everything he isn't. And the grammar of that sentence relentlessly tries to fill in to reach towards who she is. And that's why I think it's this. It's a repeated noun phrase. That's the grammar of the sentence and repeated noun phrase. So you just have piles of descriptions of Fanya and now let me see if there's any, if there is a no, there is no verb, there is no verb. This is a sentence fragment people, this is a sentence fragment. You can't find a verb for the subject. So it's quite a remarkable feat of grammar and it embodies the formal quality of language as desire. But it's more than

Speaker 2:          11:54          just at the level of grammar or at the structural level of language. That desire and language, um, coincide. It's also there in the way sex is imagined. As auntie metaphorical. If you look on page two or threes is one. Fanya is dancing, uh, for Coleman.

Speaker 1:          12:18          And she insists when Coleman wants it to mean something, I guess she's just about to dance for him. When, when he wants their sex to mean something. Uh, she says, no, it's just what it is. He said to her, this is more than sex and flatly, she replied, no, it's not. You just forgot what sex is. This is sex all by itself. Don't fuck it up by pretending it's something else. What Coleman's urges is to use language to make sex into something other than it is to make meaning out of it. That's a fundamentally linguistic enterprise by insisting that it can't be made into something else. It puts sex not, uh, so much, uh, outside of language as it elevates sex to the equal of language. So just as the grammar of the sentence reaches out to fill that lack sex does that too, but it doesn't require the resources of language to be successful. So you don't need language. Really. All you need is sex to produce that human connection, that desire, uh, seeks. So it elevates sex.

Speaker 2:          13:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:50          Um, sex is the analog to writing and other ways to, uh, on page 37, um, he talks about Nathan talks about sex as the mania to repeat the act. And he also talks about the language tasks that go along with it. This is on the top of 37 when he's talking about why he withdrew from life. Uh, I couldn't meet the cost of its clamoring anymore, could no longer marshaled the wit, the strength, the patients, the illusion, the irony, the art or the egotism, the resilience or the toughness or the shrewdness or the falseness, the dissembling, the dual being, the erotic professionalism to deal with its array of misleading and contradictory meanings. So sex always comes along with those meanings. And Nathan could not separate out the two in the way that Coleman succeeds in doing with Fanya in finding an illiterate woman. I think it's, it's her illiteracy in a sense that enables the separation of sex from language.

Speaker 1:          15:01          Uh, but that may need to repeat. The act looks a lot actually like, like Roth's writing. Roth is an extremely repetitious writer across his novels. His novels often engage the same kinds of characters, sometimes the same character, lots of Nathan Zuckerman novels, uh, even the ones that are not Nathan Zuckerman novels. Uh, look like Nathan Zuckerman novels. You usually have someone who looks like Nathan. Um, the women are often, uh, often look the same. They often rant in similar ways. So there is something about Ross writing that is close to that mania to repeat the act. So there you get that parallelism again.

Speaker 2:          15:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:45          So the distance between one person and another is crossed by language and by sex in two equal tracks. But it's also crossed in this novel by the imagination. And this is where the entering into a Coleman story comes into play. Now you will have noticed at a few jarring points that suddenly you'll be in free and direct discourse in the third person. And suddenly the eye of that character appears. And there's an example on one 65. This is Fanya at the bottom of the page. She's thinking about the crow.

Speaker 2:          16:32          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          16:32          that cruise voice, she remembers it at all hours, day or night awake, sleeping or insomniac had a strange voice, not like the Voice of other crows, probably because it hadn't been raised with other crows. Right after the fire I used to go and visit. You see that I coming very suddenly there. So why does it appear? Well, this is a moment when Nathan as the writer takes an unusual liberty, makes an unusual claim on us as readers by entering directly into the first person of this character, violating what has been the formal habit of the novel up until that moment where the formal habit of that scene and happens on a few occasions. So he becomes the, I have fanya now you might say that this is just to emphasize the imaginative work that's required for Nathan to tell this story, but I want to suggest that there's a structural relationship between Nathan and fauna that we have to attend to and to to excavate this. I want to go back to that first dance scene on page 27 with Coleman and Nathan.

Speaker 1:          17:55          This is when they start to talk about sex. And this is Nathan's reflection. The moment a man starts to tell you about sex, he's telling you something about the two of you. I'm going to, man starts to tell you about sex. He's telling you something about the two of you. It's quite a remarkable statement. It's homoeroticism should not be lost on you. He's telling Nathan about sex with Fanya. But how Nathan here is it is that it's about him and Coleman. Now, I don't mean to say that it literally becomes about the fantasy of sex between literal sex between Coleman and Nathan. But I will point out a couple of things. One is that Nathan, if you recall, has been rendered impotent by his surgery. So his only relation in that physical way to, uh, to Coleman is not really as a man has such, I think he's imagined to be unmanned in this scene.

Speaker 2:          19:16          So

Speaker 1:          19:17          then you get on page 43 and even fuller description of this.

Speaker 2:          19:26          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          19:28          he's talking, Coleman is talking again about Fournier.

Speaker 1:          19:36          And Nathan is very much responding in the conversation. We were enjoying ourselves now. And I realized that in my effort to distract him from his rampaging peak by arguing for the primacy of his pleasure, I had given a boost to his feeling for me. And I exposed mine for him. I was gushing and I knew it. I surprised myself with my eagerness to please felt myself seeing too much explaining too much over involved and overexcited and the way you are when you're a kid and you think you've found a soul mate in the new boy down the street, and you feel yourself drawn by the force of the courtship. And so act as you don't normally do and a lot more openly than you may even want to. But ever since he had banged on my door, the day after IRS is death and propose that I write spooks for him.

Speaker 1:          20:24          I had, without figuring or planning on it, fallen into a serious friendship with Coleman silk, the language of courtship and of gushing of that overeagerness suggest to crush it, reinforces the homo erotic charge of their dance. And the way Nathan observes his [inaudible] body as they danced together. And it gives it that, um, that emotional dimension. So we're told of Coleman in another spot in this, uh, basic scene that he's contaminated by desire alone. Nathan, if he is seized by Coleman story as we're told at the end of the book, is contaminated to by that story and by desire for Coleman. So just as that stepping over into the first person from free indirect third person discourse, stepping over into the eye of his character represents crossing a certain kind of boundary. So does the erotic charge that is given to his relationship with Coleman. Now there are a couple of ways of thinking about that homoerotic structure. One is through the work of a critic named Eve Sedgwick. Um, and if you've taken any women's and gender studies courses are studied, um, a feminist interpretations or queer interpretations of literature, she should be a familiar name. She wrote a famous book called between men. And her argument is that in a lot of, I think her subject was Victorian fiction in a lot of Victorian fiction, the homo erotic or the homo social bond between men is channeled through a woman.

Speaker 1:          22:24          And the perfect example of that in this novel is when Coleman and Nathan go to the dairy farm to watch Fanya. So it's as if by both watching funny together through her, their desire for one another is channeled. So they're able to experience desire together and it safely, not for each other. Because funny is right there as a mediating a f, uh, point of the triangle. But I think we can say some other things about this structure to, um, and not just that it's there. Essentially Sedgwick's um, theory allows us to see how it works to see that it's there. But then we want to ask why, and this is related to what another feature of the texts that you might have noticed. And that is the repeated reference to Thomas Mons death in Venice. Did you notice that it comes back? Todd Zeo and Aution Bach are the two characters from Mons death in Venice.

Speaker 1:          23:23          This is a mid 20th century German novelists. This is a small novel will develop. Um, it's about an older man named Ashton Bach who goes to Venice for a vacation and he's a scholar and a writer. And he goes to Venice and he suddenly finds himself transfixed by a beautiful young boy that he sees at the hotel. And he spends the novel chasing Todd Ceo, the boy all around the city and trying to get close to him. And the mother realizes the mother of Tazio realizes there's this sort of lecherous man coming after her boy and warns him the, uh, Todd CEO to stay away from Austin Bach. Uh, in the end, I, Bach is, uh, is taken with a, I think it's, um, a tuberculosis or some disease. I can't remember what the diseases, and he dies in Venice. This passion for the boy is described. And this is the, the, the part that Roth quotes in this novel as a late adventure of the feelings. So in those quotations, Roth is directing us to think about the lateness of that desire as its characteristic quality. It's an older man suddenly waylaid by an unexpected surge of passion.

Speaker 1:          24:53          Now, what I find interesting about that is that rock could have chosen any number of romantic stories to characterize. This Hummer would be one, uh, late adventure of the feeling. An older man, younger woman, why does he take a homo erotic structure? Why does he choose this story? A story of same sex desire rather than a heterosexual desire? Why is this the model that he chooses? So I would suggest it's important that the novel is called death in Venice that [inaudible] dies. There is something about homo erotic desire and this is, you know, a characteristic of fiction that features it, uh, over the centuries that it seems deadly. Somehow it's deadly. It's imagined as being deadly. Of course, this is a product of its unconventionality in older times. Um, the fear that a heterosexual person or a person who conceives themselves as heterosexual might experience if they are taken by a homoerotic urge. So there's somehow that death gets wound into stories of homo erotic desire and the human scene is no different. Um, just want to point out, uh, a couple of examples. Um, you can see it in the difference between the way Nathan describes his decision to dance with Coleman and the way funnier describes hers. Um, this is funny. A on two 26.

Speaker 2:          27:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:09          Uh, this is just right in the middle of the page. She's playing with her hair. Um, and thinking that her hair is like seaweed, a great trickling sweep of seaweed, saturated with Brian and what's it cost her anyway? What's the big deal? Plunge in, pour forth. If this is what he wants, abduct the man. Ensnare him won't be the first one that's Fanya sort of thinking why not? Why not dance as he's asking me? Why not? What's the big deal? What does it cost her? Contrast that with on 25 and 26 the way Nathan thinks, what the hell? I thought we'll both be dead soon enough. And so I got up and there on the Porch Coleman's silk and I began to dance the Fox trot together. And if you look on 26th, do you get another description where death comes back up as a reason?

Speaker 1:          28:07          Um, maybe why it didn't even cross my mind to laugh and let him, if you wanted to dance around the porch by himself, just laugh and enjoy myself watching him. Maybe why I gave him my hand and let him places arm around my back and pushed me dreamily around that old blue stone floor was because I had been there that day when her corpse was still warm, that's irises corpse and seen what he looked like. The corpse pops up in the middle of this reflection on why he's dancing. So two times in the space of a page, death accompanies his decision to dance with Coleman. So why then

Speaker 2:          28:54          is

Speaker 1:          28:56          homo erotic desire such a threat, a threat in this way? Well, one structural reason could be that homo erotic desire threatens to collapse the engine of desire, which is difference. The novel has set up difference being the engine of desire. So if its desire for the same understood as gender, the important sameness being gender,

Speaker 2:          29:21          then

Speaker 1:          29:23          it looks like a self canceling desire, a desire that can sustain itself somehow or that lacks that fundamental structure of difference that the whole novel seeks to set up. If desire is the engine of the sentence, as well as the engine of the narrative, as well as the engine of human connection in the novel, it's collapse is a great threat, not just to human connection to human life, but to write him. So this was one way to understand the problem and it goes back to speak to my point about inhabiting or being a parasite. Upon Coleman story, Nathan inhabits the eye and finally begins to conflate himself with Coleman or with Coleman's lovers. And we get various versions of this. So while, um, while Fanya and Coleman Dance,

Speaker 1:          30:33          he replaces, uh, let's see, he replaces less. So while they're dancing in the cottage, do you remember the scene? I can't find my page number on my notes right now. Um, while he is, while he, while they are dancing in Coleman's house privately, this is after Coleman, uh, stopped seeing Nathan. He's outside in his car lurking on the road. The only other person who does that is less Farley. So he comes to be in the position of Fournier's other lover. Okay. So that's one way he enters into his characters as he starts to occupy structurally the same spot as they do, but it actually gets much more, um, complicated. This is on three 26 in Ernestine's conversation in her scene. She is very helpful to say, well then, because Coleman Nathan has said, I've been, uh, trying to figure out Coleman, well then she says, you are now an honorary member of the silk family. So there he is, taken right into the silk family. So he starts to replace Coleman after Coleman's death at the very end, as he's getting into the car to drive down to New Jersey for dinner with the silks, he says, um,

Speaker 2:          32:10          let's see.

Speaker 1:          32:13          Uh, let's see. Like Stina Polson before me, uh, he was going to sit with his east orange family as the white guest at Sunday dinner. He become Stena in that passage. He becomes funnier when he dances with Coleman. He leeches into all the aspects of coalmines life. So it's not just inhabiting imaginatively, but there are these structural ways. He comes to double Coleman and also to double his lovers. It's by virtue of a blankness that Nathan sees in Coleman and in Fanya that he can pull this off. And this is very noticeable in my favorite scene of the novel that the Tanglewood scene, which I think is quite beautiful. This is on two nine to 10.

Speaker 1:          33:19          He's running about, um, music here and the feeling that all the people in the audience, we're going to be swept away by deaf. That's sort of an overwhelming sense of mortality in the beginning of the, at the beginning, in the middle of the page there, and he says, um, and yet what a lovely date is today. A gift of a day, a perfect day, lacking nothing in a Massachusetts vacation spot that is itself as harmless and pretty as anything, as any on earth. I would suggest that it's precisely that lacking nothing that makes it definitely, because if you lack nothing, there is no desire. So it's very status of the day and the solidity of that music that brings him into this mood. And then Bronfman appears the pianist and you get this wonderful description of what he does, how he attacks the piano and banishes death with his contention with the piano. And it should remind you of all that sad about life being an argument. I remember I mentioned last time Coleman saying that all Western literature begins with a fight, with an argument between Achilles and Agamemnon. Coleman's fight with the College Coleman's fight against the racial contract drawn up for him at birth. Nathan's contention in the world of, of desire, which he then withdraws from,

Speaker 1:          34:52          he implants in his own narrative of his thoughts. What Nathan, what Coleman will later say. This is on two 11. Uh, he's Coleman says, I was telling funny that he took 10 years, at least out of that piano. Nathan had said, uh, on the previous page that they would have to throw that thing out after Bronfmans finished with it. He plants in the narrative. The shared thought asserting that somehow Kohlmans mind is Nathan's mind. That collapse is written right into the realest assumption of the novel. We sort of read along in those passages thinking, oh, you know, let's take this at face value. Oh yes, they're thinking the same thing. But of course it's Nathan who plants that. It's Nathan who's making it up. We don't know how honest Nathan is. So he claims to have the same thoughts. It's the blankness. He describes Nathan, I mean a Fanya and Coleman as a pair of, of blanks. Um, and it's precisely that blankness that allows Nathan to inhabit Coleman. This is in fact a quality that he finally attributes to the, as he says, negroes in the photograph of Coleman's family. And this is on three 37.

Speaker 2:          36:30          Okay,

Speaker 1:          36:40          very bottom of three 36. They were Pale, but they were Negros. How could you tell they were negros by little more than that, they had nothing to hide. This is quite an astonishing sentence. If identity is in its ideal form secrecy, if you have nothing to hide, then you don't have an identity. There are two things, two implications that flow from that. One is, uh, that racial secrecy is really the only kind of secrecy that matters because being Negro is the only thing that one would hide.

Speaker 2:          37:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:33          It also means that these people are just as blank as fornia and Coleman.

Speaker 1:          37:43          So there is a somewhat pernicious racial simplification going on here. It's somewhat related to the simplification of thinking that homeowner erotics is the desire for the same. What both of these logics leave out is that point that is insistent upon actually earlier in the novel, which is that the other fellow always has a life. You can't know that it's simply the otherness of any individual person that keeps you from knowing more than you can see on the surface. It's the otherness, not the racial otherness necessarily, but just the otherness. So in these last pages, otherness gets collapsed back into racial otherness. And I think this is why Ernestine emerges as a stereotyped character. He is a folding and analysis of identity back into racial stereotype and analysis of identity as as blank. They have no interiority.

Speaker 1:          38:57          One question that you could ask is whether this constitutes a critique of Nathan. Is Nathan being brought to task for stealing the story of Coleman Silk? Is this making passing racial passing into the ultimate form of identity? That to be interesting as a character, you've got to be passing a, is it indicting Nathan? Is it suggesting that Nathan really does Desire Coleman? These are all kinds of questions that you can think about. One thing I think it does do though is highlight the constructiveness of the narrative across the board. Coleman says about his spooks narrative that he could not do the creative remove that the pros do calls the creative remove. He says it's still the Ra thing. It's a bad book because it's still the raw thing. He has no self distancing, so what the critique of Nathan does, the implicit critique of Nathan does is distant sauce from him to some degree. It allows us to see him as an unreliable narrator. It also, I think models, Roths own relation to Nathan Zuckerman.

Speaker 1:          40:41          Nathan's Zuckerman is the creative remove is the medium of the creative remove that Roth requires in order to write about his own life. Most of the Nathan Zuckerman novels draw very heavily on Roths life. And in fact, at one point, Roth writes an autobiographical, uh, um, nonfiction book called the facts and it's all mostly about, um, complaining about the, uh, response to Portnoy's complaint and also [inaudible] against his ex wife. Very happy habit that a Roth has. Um, at the end of the facts there is a letter to Roth from Nathan Zuckerman where he says, idiot, why are you doing autobiography? This is not your style facts. It's just not your thing. Forget it. It's terrible. Don't publish this. Go back to what you do best, which is making stuff up. Roth has played with this dynamic between autobiography and fiction throughout his career. And I think the threat, the deathly threat of the collapse that's figured in the homo erotic element of this novel is the threat of it. It's sort of, um, doubles the threat of Roth collapsing into Nathan Zuckerman.

Speaker 2:          42:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:15          And in another sense, it doubles the threat of writing really only about men. That what's weak about the novel is the way that it inhabits the subjectivities of women, especially Delphine room is just a character really. Um, and in many small ways Fanya is a character too. Um, I've talked about Ernestine less can be seen as a caricature.

Speaker 2:          42:50          Uh,

Speaker 1:          42:53          so it's not something exclusive to his female characters, but it does suggest, as I mentioned a little while back in the lecture, certain kind of limit to Roths project. So I will finish by saying Roth is an extremely important writer in this period because of the very complexity with which he makes the texture of his novels. Speak to the question of fictions, relationship to life writings, relation to life and the relationship between the writer and what he or she writes the writer in the work. These are questions that vacs writers in this period. We've seen many writers in this syllabus who worry about these things. Barth, Morrison, um, so many of them, Maxine Hong Kingston Roth does it in a way that nobody else particularly does. He's also widely admired when the New York Times had this feature a few years ago. I think it was 2004 on the best novels of the last 25 years. And they pulled about 125 public intellectuals, writers, professors of literatures, um, reviewers and asked who, what is the one best novel they asked? They made it hard. He said, what's the one best novel of the last 25 years? Well, number one was beloved. Number two was blood meridian. But if you added up all the rough novels together

Speaker 1:          44:32          that people chose Roth was the winner.

Speaker 2:          44:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:35          So he's highly regarded, although there is split opinion as you can see there about which of his novels is really, uh, the best one.

Speaker 1:          44:45          So I will say to you that we're tracking in what we're reading writers who are making an enormous impact on what American fiction looks like in the latter part of the 20th century. Um, it's very interesting to me to see the very ambivalences that are at the heart of this fiction. Now I'll stop there for, uh, for Roth. Let me just say as we go into Edward P. Jones, um, the novel that I don't have on the syllabus is beloved. It's always a novel that, um, I hope that you've read. I used to teach it routinely, but it's fun to shake it up and put some different things on knowing that a lot of you will have read it when you read Edward P. Jones. If you have read, beloved, I'd like you to think hard about the relationship between those two writers and, and the two novels. If you haven't read beloved, I urge you, just go to Wikipedia and just get a plot summary or open it up even better. I won't ask you to read it on the side extra. Uh, although I would love to, um, find out a little bit about it just so that you, you have it in your, in your head, uh, as you begin to read. Okay. Thank you.
