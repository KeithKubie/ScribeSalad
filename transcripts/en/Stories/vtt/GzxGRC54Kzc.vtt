00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.460
NARRATOR: Whales are big.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.650
I know that seems like
an obvious statement,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.910
especially while
looking at this picture.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.700
But I know something you don't.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.140
That giant whale, the marine
mammal dwarfing that diver,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.560
it's a juvenile humpback.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.740
Just wait until you see
how big the adults are.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.980
KARIM ILIYA: Hi.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.405
My name is Karim Iliya.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:29.170
I'm a professional
photographer and filmmaker,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.024
specializing in underwater
and aerial photography.

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.440
NARRATOR: Karim isn't actually
the one who took the photo.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.300
He's the one getting up
close next to the whale.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.230
KARIM ILIYA: This photo
was taken in August

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.380
off the island of Vava'u
in the kingdom of Tonga.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.600
This is an image moments
after this juvenile humpback

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.370
whale took a sharp turn
to avoid smashing into me.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.990
NARRATOR: That sounds
terrifying, but not to Karim.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.970
KARIM ILIYA: It was a
playful interaction.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.930
And there was no fear inside me.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.680
The babies are these curious,
clumsy little creatures,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.980
that can fill you
with so much joy

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.140
that your heart feels like it
will explode from your chest.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.814
NARRATOR: Not every interaction
is so calm and peaceful.

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:17.480
When you swim with
whales, sometimes you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.290
get a playful juvenile.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320
But other times, you
can find yourself

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.030
in the middle of
an all-out frenzy.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.900
This is what happened to Karim
after jumping into the water,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.360
not knowing that four
battle-scarred adult male

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.310
humpbacks were
fighting over the right

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.880
to mate with the lone female.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.630
KARIM ILIYA: Out of
the depth in the blue,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.880
four large male
humpback whales emerged.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.800
Two of them broke
off and started

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.440
smashing into each other,
blowing bubbles, tail

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.590
whipping around.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.350
They came closer and closer,
all the while fighting.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.430
A five meter long tail
whipped near my face.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.110
And the thought
occurred to me that I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.397
would be pulverized
between these two school

00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:03.450
bus-sized animals.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.390
NARRATOR: But that
possibly to close encounter

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.466
didn't spoil Karim's love for
swimming with and photographing

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.460
whales.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.350
In fact, it may have
even enhanced it.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.990
KARIM ILIYA: Looking back on
the images that I had taken,

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.380
I see that the
whales were looking

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.250
at me, even as they fought.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.090
It is a true testament to the
gentleness of these giants

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.410
that they would take
the time and effort

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.980
to avoid crushing this tiny
little creature before them.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.730
The thing that I love the most
about photographing humpback

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.440
whales is the level
of interaction

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500
that you have with them.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.710
They are highly
intelligent creatures

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.730
with distinct
personalities and will

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.160
convey a range of
emotions and attitude,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.330
like curiosity and
playfulness, or even annoyance.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.150
Swimming with
humpback whales was

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.124
the most magical, humbling,
powerful experience of my life.

00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:57.540
NARRATOR: If you
liked this video,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.540
be sure to check out this one
on TestTube Daily about Japan's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.695
controversial fight to
continue whale hunting.

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:04.070
REPORTER: The
Japanese government

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.890
has noted that whaling has long
been a part of their culture

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.890
and acknowledge that they
would likely continue,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.460
despite the controversy.
