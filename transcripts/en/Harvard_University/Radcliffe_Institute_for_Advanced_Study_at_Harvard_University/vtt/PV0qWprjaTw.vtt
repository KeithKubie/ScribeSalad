00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.740
[TRUMPET FANFARE]

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.510
- Good afternoon.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.250
Glad to be back with you,
friends and colleagues,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.830
to Radcliffe Day 2018.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.170
For those of you who
may just have arrived,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.850
I'm Liz Cohen, dean
of the Radcliffe

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.980
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.520
On this special day,
we are fortunate to be

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.580
joined by Radcliffe
and Harvard leaders

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.250
of the present and the future.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.480
I would like to extend a special
welcome to Harvard President

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.870
Drew Gilpin Faust, who
is also founding dean--

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:54.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.234
--founding dean, as
many of you know.

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:56.734
OK.

00:00:56.734 --> 00:01:02.478
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:04.769
I'll try one more time--
founding dean of the Radcliffe

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.950
Institute--

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.680
to Provost Alan
Garber, to Bill Lee,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.110
who was the senior fellow
of the Harvard Corporation

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.420
along with other members
of the corporation

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.150
and the board of
overseers, as well

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930
as to many other current
university leaders who are here

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.450
with us this afternoon.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.080
On a day like today, we
are inspired to also look

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.590
towards the future.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.889
So it is an honor to
also welcome Larry Bacow,

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:36.930
Harvard president-elect--

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:49.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.330
--and Tomiko Brown-Nagin, the
incoming dean of the Radcliffe

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.800
Institute, who will take over--

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.100
--who will take over when
I step down on June 30.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.580
And we have a record number of
past Radcliffe medalists here

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.570
today.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
That includes Drew Faust,
as well as former Secretary

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.080
of State Madeleine Albright,
former Chief Justice

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.900
of the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court Margaret

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:26.090
Marshall, and Linda Greenhouse,
long-time distinguished Supreme

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.340
Court Analyst for
The New York Times.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.550
Today is also a celebration
of the achievements

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.720
of The Radcliffe
Campaign, Invest in Ideas.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.680
I'll say more about
that in a moment.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.610
But let me thank all the
current and former members

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.190
of the Radcliffe
Dean's Advisory Council

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.890
and the Schlesinger
Library Council, members

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.401
of the Radcliffe
Associate's Program

00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.990
and the Ann Radcliffe
society, and past members

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.350
of the Radcliffe College
Board of Trustees and Alumni

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.200
Association for helping
to make our campaign

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.450
such a great success.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.120
And I would like to recognize
all of the Radcliffe

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.960
and Harvard alums who are
marking milestones, including

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:29.250
the reunion classes of '43, '48,
'53, '58, '63, '68, '73, '78,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:40.690
'83, '88, '92, '98, 2003,
2008, 2013, and our newest

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.480
graduates in the class of 2018.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.684
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:53.600
And everyone, please join
me in congratulating members

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.870
of the earliest classes
represented here today--

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.212
the classes of
1940, '41, and 42.

00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:01.420
And they're right over there.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.330
We are also thrilled to be
joined by former US Ambassador

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.510
to the United Nations and
current Radcliffe Fellow

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.610
Samantha Power.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.830
And to all of the
other elected officials

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.530
and dedicated public servants
who are here with us today,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.290
we are grateful for your work.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.410
And we are honored
to have you here.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.200
Finally, with all of us
gathered here together,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.830
we do, of course, think of
the friends and classmates

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.990
who are no longer with us.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.960
This year, we lost
Amey Amory DeFriez,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.240
a member of the
class of '49, who

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.410
served as chair of the Radcliffe
College Board of Trustees.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.410
Please join me in a
moment of silence for Amey

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.200
and for others we are
missing this afternoon.

00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:10.330
The Radcliffe Institute
supports and broadly shares

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.600
bold ideas,
transformative research,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.000
and daring creative work that
is both timely and timeless.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.120
It has been a profound
honor and privilege

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.990
to lead and grow this Institute
for the past seven years.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.630
As I prepare to step
down, I am especially

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.150
pleased to be able to
share with you some

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.780
of the highlights of the
outstanding academic year that

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.480
concludes with today's event.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.910
Since January, we
have been celebrating

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.420
the 75th anniversary of
our Schlesinger Library

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.250
on the history of
women in America.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:55.830
The commemorative exhibition
"75 Stories, 75 Years"

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.260
documenting the lives
of American women

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.980
at the Schlesigner Library will
be open to all of you at 2:30

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.060
PM today and is on
view until November 1.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.130
Other programs
celebrating the library

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.860
will continue
throughout next fall.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.250
Across the yard in the
Johnson-Kulukundis Gallery

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.090
and Byerly Hall is a
student-centered exhibition

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.070
suitable for commencement week.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.140
It's entitled "Art in the Yard--

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.230
Students Make Art
Public at Radcliffe."

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.710
This exhibition celebrates
the imaginative student

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.830
designs that we have installed
in the Wallach Garden

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.260
since 2013.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.050
Art in the Yard will also
be open this afternoon

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.530
and remain on view
through June 30.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.700
This year's annual science
symposium, titled "Contagion,"

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.320
explored new ways to understand,
track, respond to, and even

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.060
predict modern epidemics
from infectious diseases

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.190
to the opioid crisis.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.550
An accompanying year-long
lecture series on the science

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.320
of epidemics engaged with
topics including fibromyalgia,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.440
obesity, and
Alzheimer's disease.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.680
Throughout the year, workshops
and public events at Radcliffe

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.940
explored the complexity of
citizenship broadly defined.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.520
Our flagship annual
gender conference

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.670
interrogated the
question, who belongs,

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.430
bringing a gendered lens to
the topic of citizenship,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.095
which is increasingly fraught
both at home and abroad.

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:30.660
Our programmatic
focus on citizenship

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.940
is timed in part to anticipate
and to contextualize the 2020

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.420
centennial of the passage of
the women's suffrage amendment,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.020
and it will continue through
the next academic year.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.170
In September, we will
also welcome more than 50

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.650
outstanding new fellows
from 11 countries who

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.700
will write novels and
poetry, chart massive stars,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.230
create new art, explore the
politics of gender quotas,

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.620
delve into the geometry of
political redistricting,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.600
and much else.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.690
All of this and more
is made possible

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.420
by our generous supporters.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.230
Last year at
Radcliffe Day 2017, I

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.270
announced that the
Radcliffe Campaign

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.130
had surpassed its $70 million
monetary goal more than a year

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.670
ahead of schedule.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.260
Today, I am delighted
to report that we

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.470
follow that up with our
most successful year of fund

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.180
raising to date.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.070
Since the start of
the campaign, we

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.690
have received over 23,000
individual gifts representing

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.710
all 13 Harvard schools
and every graduating class

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.440
from 1933 to the present.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.510
All together, we have raised
a phenomenal $87 million,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.330
well over 120% of our goal.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:57.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:02.260
Nearly 80% of the people in our
2/10 have donated to Radcliffe,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.990
and we are deeply
grateful for your support.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.110
And to the other 20%, I
would say, don't worry.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.960
You still have time
to make it right.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.800
The campaign doesn't
end until June 30.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.170
But of course, The
Radcliffe Campaign

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.290
is about much more than dollars.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.980
Those 23,000 gifts
are a humbling display

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.250
of confidence in the
Institute, of commitment

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.450
to our important work, and of
our common ambition for an even

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.700
stronger Radcliffe
into the future.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.030
Thanks to the campaign,
we have expanded

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.360
our public programming,
diversified our library

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.500
collections, endowed
new fellowships, created

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.880
new opportunities for creative
work, renewed our campus,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.490
and changed the face
of the Harvard faculty

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.775
through Radcliffe
professorships.

00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:55.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.640
Yes, that's worth some applause.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.330
That is a lot to be proud of.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.450
So please join me in round
of applause for all of you,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.740
for the entire Radcliffe
community, and for everything

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.200
that we have been able
to accomplish together

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.990
as a result of your generous
support of the Institute.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:20.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.110
On a more personal
level, the campaign,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.980
including a two-year
planning phase and then

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.980
a five-year public
phase, has perfectly

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.560
aligned with my deanship.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.320
Although that was
challenging, I am

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.500
grateful for how it
pushed me to get out

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.040
and to partner with our key
supporters, many of whom

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.780
I now consider dear friends.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.670
And it pushed us as an
institute to more clearly

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.080
and compellingly articulate
a vision of who we are

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.630
and what we strive to do.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.590
Two extraordinary people have
worked very closely with me

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.370
on this campaign, our
cochairs Sid Knafel all

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.990
and Susan Wallach.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.430
I would like to take a moment--

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:14.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.120
There will be
another opportunity.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.560
I'd like to take a moment now to
extend a special thanks to both

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.340
of them.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.140
Sid could not be here today.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.150
But his generosity
and his leadership,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.310
as well as the example he set
as a well-respected Harvard

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.400
hand invested in
Radcliffe's future,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.890
were critical to our success.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.270
Susan Wallach is a passionate
and tireless advocate

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.940
for all things
Radcliffe and has served

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.260
as a trusted advisor to me
and to all of my predecessors

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.370
while also inspiring the
incredible record-breaking

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.600
support we received from her
Radcliffe College 50th reunion

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.820
class of 1968.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.930
Susan, I cannot--

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.780
I cannot emphasize
enough to you, Susan,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.710
how grateful I am for your
partnership these past seven

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.340
years.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.130
So would you please stand
and let us all give you

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.550
and Sid a big round of applause.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:30.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.540
And now, on behalf of
the Radcliffe Institute,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.410
I am honored to recognize
Hillary Rodham Clinton

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.880
as our 2018 Radcliffe medalist.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.420
Every year, we strive
to illuminate aspects

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.620
of our medalists' life and
work that are not widely known

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.620
but help us understand
her achievements.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.130
You can imagine that this
was very difficult to do when

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.610
it comes to Secretary Clinton.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.490
That so much about her
life is well-known is

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.240
a consequence of her
decades in public life

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.140
as well as the unusual level
of attention and scrutiny

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.770
she has faced and overcome
throughout her distinguished

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.100
career.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.350
But there is still an
important story to tell.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.550
Those who have observed Hillary
Rodham Clinton over the years

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.930
can testify to her
brilliance, her determination,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.940
and her capacity for growth.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.330
Not surprisingly,
those qualities

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.320
were in evidence from her youth.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.830
Born to Hugh and Dorothy
Howell Rodham in Chicago

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:46.000
and raised in the suburban
Republican stronghold of Park

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.420
Ridge, Hillary was
quite naturally imbued

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.640
with the conservative
political views

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.580
of her small-businessman father.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.990
But there were early signs that
she would chart her own, quite

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.270
different political path.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.030
To start with,
her mother Dorothy

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.300
provided a
counterforce of sorts,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.540
as she was, in Clinton's own
words, basically a Democrat,

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.200
although she kept it
quiet in Park Ridge.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.510
By eighth grade,
Hillary was already

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.440
displaying independence
of mind, allowing herself

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.520
to be inspired by a Democratic
President John F. Kennedy's

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.060
ambition to put an
American on the moon.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.270
In her excitement, Hillary
wrote a letter to NASA

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.200
volunteering her services,
only to be informed

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.280
that the astronaut training
program did not and probably

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.960
never would accept girls.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.890
Clinton reflected years later
that this, and I quote her,

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.690
"was the first time I had hit
an obstacle I couldn't overcome

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.000
with hard work
and determination.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.540
And I was outraged."

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.820
Not only did this
experience begin

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.220
to raise the feminist
consciousness of young Hillary,

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.960
but it also demonstrated
how passion for a goal

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.770
could motivate this junior
Nixon canvasser to reach

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.770
across the partisan divide.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.620
Clinton's political brilliance
showed up early as well.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.500
Her senior year in
high school, she

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.640
took the part of Barry Goldwater
in a mock presidential debate

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.240
for the 1964
presidential election.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.350
Hillary's success outshone
candidate Goldwater's.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.900
Her opponent in that
debate, the young man

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.290
acting as Lyndon Baines
Johnson, accepted defeat

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.670
and said of Clinton what future
rivals would also discover.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.300
She was the brightest
person I ever knew.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.700
When it was time to
apply to college,

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.280
Clinton was drawn
to a women's school.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.310
Her parents offered
her some advice.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.980
As Clinton recalled
years later, "my mother

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.800
thought I should go
wherever I wanted.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.170
My father said I
was free to do that,

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.910
but he wouldn't pay if I
went west of the Mississippi

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:14.680
or to Radcliffe, which he had
heard was full of beatniks.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.740
Smith and Wellesley, which
he had never heard of,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.660
were acceptable."

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.810
Hillary, some of those
beatniks your father

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.400
warned you about are here today
celebrating their 50th reunion.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:33.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.160
College would prove to be a
time of political transformation

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.570
for Hillary Rodham as it was
for many of her generation.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.010
She had a few rocky weeks of
typical freshman self-doubt,

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.450
which her mother met
with, I'm quoting,

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.510
"I don't like hearing
that you would walk away

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.120
from something because you're
not as ready as you think

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.050
you should be.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.210
Get ready."

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.540
But after that, Hillary
flourished at Wellesley.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.099
Politics became her passion both
in her political science major

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:07.490
and in her extracurricular life
where she experienced something

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.950
of a political realignment.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.010
Elected president of
Wellesley's Young Republicans

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.400
in her first year, by
Clinton's junior year,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.359
she was supporting the anti-war
campaign of Minnesota senator

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.490
Eugene McCarthy.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:28.310
That academic year, 1967-'68,
coincided with watershed

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.940
moments, including the
escalation of the Vietnam War

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.730
and the assassinations
of Martin Luther King Jr.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.220
And Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.220
Those upheavals led
to massive protests

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.220
at the Democratic National
Convention in Chicago

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.900
the following summer.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.680
Clinton, back home from an
internship in Washington DC,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.330
found her way there.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.790
She and a close
friend, Betsy Johnson,

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.120
drove downtown in the
Johnson's station wagon

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.330
to bear witness to
the unfolding events.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.290
Knowing that their parents would
never have allowed them to go,

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.650
Betsy had told her mother
that she and Hillary

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.490
were headed to the movies.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.460
For Clinton, this experience
proved not disillusioning

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.780
but rather a confirmation that
electoral politics was, and I

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.660
quote her, "the only
route in a democracy

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.930
for peaceful and
lasting change."

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.180
Clinton's political
education at Wellesley

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.430
culminated in her
well-known role

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.080
as speaker at her class's
commencement in May 1969.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.010
Her peers elected her to be
the first ever student speaker

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.770
at a Wellesley
graduation ceremony.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:44.150
Hillary's remarks foretold the
course of her later career,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.480
recasting Otto van
Bismarck's famous quote

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.650
that politics is the art of the
possible as, and I quote her,

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.890
"the challenge now is
to practice politics

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.320
as the art of
making what appears

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.966
to be impossible possible."

00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:06.284
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:06.284 --> 00:19:08.450
Clinton's Wellesley
commencement speech

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.310
caught the attention
of the press,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.840
shining the national spotlight
on her for the very first time.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.160
But buried beneath the
headlines was a side of Clinton

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.180
that would also inform
her career going forward.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.580
Dismayed at reports
that suggested

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.770
that she had personally attacked
a fellow speaker, Massachusetts

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.470
Republican Senator
Edward Brooke,

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:38.030
she warned Life magazine not
to repeat the same mistake

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.070
in their profile.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.040
Even as a youthful
activist, Clinton

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.880
valued civility and
respect for her opponents,

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.100
not something that
was always prevalent

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.650
in those troubled times.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.360
The Radcliffe
historians among us--

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.590
and certainly the members
of the 50th reunion class--

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.080
will remember with some pride
that Radcliffe students had

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.920
succeeded in demanding a student
commencement speaker the year

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.190
before Wellesley in 1968.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.860
Rachel Lieberman
gave that address.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.350
And in Lieberman's
own telling, Clinton

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.740
acknowledged to her later
that she and her classmates

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.420
might never have had the courage
to demand their own student

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.390
speaker if Radcliffe
hadn't pulled it off first.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.980
Even if Hugh Rodham kept us from
claiming Clinton as an alumna,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.085
we can at least take a little
credit for her early success.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.350
The next stage after
Wellesley in Hillary

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.010
Clinton's political
evolution was her discovery

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:46.150
that the law was a powerful
tool for social justice.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:50.290
In the fall of 1969, Clinton
entered Yale Law School,

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.090
where she was one of 27
women in a class of 235.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.720
Clinton focused her studies
and her first scholarly article

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.600
on how the law affects children.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.640
It was also during
her law school years

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.750
that Clinton first connected
with fellow Yale alumna Marian

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.750
Wright Edelman, founder of
the Children's Defense Fund--

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.700
and I can't resist
saying, received

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.030
the Radcliffe Medal in 1989.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.630
As a law student, Clinton worked
with Edelman in Washington.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.940
And then she joined the
Children's Defense Fund

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.200
full-time after
earning her JD in 1973.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.310
In 1974 Clinton would
further hone her legal skills

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.400
on the impeachment staff of
the House Judiciary Committee

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.150
investigating President Richard
Nixon, one of only three women

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.960
attorneys out of 44.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.310
Among Clinton's
peers at Yale Law

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.420
had been a young man
from Arkansas named Bill.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.500
They dated.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.960
People actually did that then.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.980
And when Nixon resigned
in August of 1974,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.260
Hillary joined Bill
in Fayetteville

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.660
where she became a faculty
member at the University

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.700
of Arkansas Law School.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.370
And they married
soon thereafter.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.670
Hillary Clinton's Arkansas
years as law professor,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.390
as legal services activist,
as a dedicated advocate

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.840
for the state's
families and children,

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.330
and as a rare woman
partner in a major law firm

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.690
confirmed her confidence
in the law as an instrument

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.970
for achieving a better world.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.400
Early on, she ran
a legal aid clinic

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.210
when the very idea of legal
aid was controversial.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.670
A prominent Arkansas
judge told her,

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.720
"I don't have any use for
either lady law professors

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.730
or legal aid clinics."

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.560
She was soon appointed to the
Arkansas Committee of the Legal

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.410
Services Corporation.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.500
And in 1977,
President Jimmy Carter

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.440
named her to the board of
the National Legal Services

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.880
Corporation.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.670
Meanwhile, Clinton
continued her work

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.540
advocating on behalf of
women, children, and families.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.470
In 1977, she cofounded one
of the first child advocacy

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.480
organizations in Arkansas.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.940
She joined the board of
the Children's Defense Fund

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.310
in 1978, and she became
its chair in 1986.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.420
And in 1987, Clinton headed
the newly established American

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.440
Bar Association Commission
on Women in the Profession.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.110
She was also twice
recognized as one

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:24.220
of the 100 most influential
lawyers in the country.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.980
While Bill Clinton was
climbing the political ladder

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.800
in Arkansas from Attorney
General to Governor,

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.860
Hillary was establishing
herself as a leader

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.680
on the state and
national levels in using

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.510
the law to redress wrongs
that had long troubled her.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:45.070
Back in 1979 when Clinton
became First Lady of Arkansas,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:50.680
she launched a new and more
public era in her career.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.040
And this would culminate in her
service as Secretary of State

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.170
and her two runs for
president in 2008 and 2016.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.710
She shifted her focus
to making policy

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.200
that improved people's lives.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.380
About a month into her role
as First Lady of Arkansas,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.590
Clinton gave a TV interview
on the public affairs program

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.940
In Focus.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.850
The interviewer expressed
what many in the state

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.110
were surely thinking.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.140
And I quote, "you really
don't fit the image

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.740
that we've created for the
governor's wife in Arkansas.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.390
You're not a native.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.720
You've been educated in
liberal eastern universities.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.560
You're less than 40.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.170
You don't have any children.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.120
You don't use your
husband's name.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.100
And you practice law."

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.640
Clinton responded, "I think
that each person should

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.930
be assessed and judged on
that person's own merits."

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.380
And she then proceeded
as First Lady of Arkansas

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.750
and as First Lady of the
United States beginning

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.860
in 1993 to use her
public platform

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.940
to advance an agenda for
social and political change.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.910
Even in roles not
historically associated

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:04.750
with policy leadership,
Hillary found opportunities

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.670
to make a difference.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.700
When Clinton became First
Lady of the United States,

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.940
she broke with tradition
by establishing her office

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.360
in the West Wing, clearly
signaling her intention

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.820
to play a substantive role.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.390
Her staff became known within
the White House as Hillaryland.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.840
Soon she took on leadership
of the Task Force

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.320
on National Health Care
Reform, a role one analyst

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.280
called "the most powerful
official post ever assigned

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.220
to a First Lady."

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.920
This was not uncontroversial.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.070
But as she had done
before, Clinton forged

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:46.200
ahead, determined to make health
care a right for all Americans.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.200
The Clinton health care
reform effort was ultimately

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.890
defeated for many reasons,
but in part because

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.650
of the resistance Clinton
acknowledge she faced,

00:25:55.650 --> 00:26:00.630
and I quote her, "as a First
Lady with a policy mission."

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.880
While her vision for
a health care overhaul

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.890
would take almost
two decades to be

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.890
realized in the form of
the Affordable Care Act,

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.150
Clinton regrouped.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.940
And by 1997, she
played a key role

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.730
in securing passage of the
Children's Health Insurance

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.860
Program, known as CHIP.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.410
CHIP provided low-cost
health coverage

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.560
to millions of
American children,

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.090
an objective Clinton
cared about deeply.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:28.890
And it served as a crucial step
toward more comprehensive care.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.960
And Clinton also
used her standing

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.000
as First Lady of
the United States

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.850
to advocate for the
rights of women worldwide,

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:39.270
most famously declaring at the
United Nations Fourth World

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.240
Conference on women
in Beijing in 1995--

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.210
and I know Nick quoted, but
it's worth saying again--

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.670
"if there is one message
that echoes forth

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.120
from this conference, let
it be that human rights are

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.800
women's rights
and women's rights

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.600
are human rights
once and for all."

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:02.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:09.450
Having made about as much of her
First Ladyhood as anyone could

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.800
and as determined as ever to
solve the nation's problems,

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.120
in 2000, Clinton sought
a new role for herself

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.210
in elected office as the
senator from New York.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.700
Back in Washington,
Clinton established herself

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.760
as a master of
complex policy details

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.340
and as a pragmatic deal maker.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.800
Among her legislative
accomplishments,

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.680
Clinton helped secure billions
of dollars in federal aid

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.890
to rebuild New York after the
terrorist attacks of September

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.690
11, 2001.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.090
She also fought to
provide health coverage

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.610
for 9/11 first
responders and was

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:48.960
critical to a bipartisan effort
to provide full military health

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.450
benefits to reservists
and National Guard

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:56.190
members, both important steps
towards her long-sought goal

00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.240
of expanding Americans'
access to quality health care.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.030
Clinton was re-elected in 2006.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.620
And then in 2008, a year
I suspect everyone here

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.310
remembers well, Clinton ran
in the Democratic presidential

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.660
primary.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.570
After her opponent, then
Senator Barack Obama,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.410
secured enough delegates
to lock in the nomination,

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.130
Clinton worked hard to
unify the Democratic Party

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.380
and to help Obama win.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.650
It was not in her
nature to do otherwise.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.460
As she told her supporters,
"life is too short,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.080
time is too precious, and
the stakes are too high."

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.170
When Obama was elected,
Clinton accepted his nomination

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.110
to serve as Secretary
of State, traditionally

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.450
the most prestigious
and important role

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.490
in the president's cabinet.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.080
Our panel discussion
this morning

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.080
took as its starting point
Secretary Clinton's vision

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.450
for a new global architecture.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.960
Clinton combined that vision
with the same awe-inspiring

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.960
endurance that she had
demonstrated so many times

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.890
before.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.040
She became one of the most
effective and highly regarded

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.620
secretaries of state
in recent memory,

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.080
rebuilding fractured
relationships

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.900
and opening up
productive communication

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.570
with countries long ignored.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.150
She also created
infrastructure to advance

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.480
human rights, women's
rights, and LGBTQ rights

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.260
around the world, bringing
democratic and pluralistic

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.590
values into the heart
of US foreign policy.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.860
And Clinton became the most
traveled secretary of state

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.310
in history, visiting
112 countries

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.150
and engaging in the same kind
of shoe-leather diplomacy

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.050
on a global scale as she had
done when building alliances

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.220
at home.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.660
When Hillary stepped down as
secretary of state in 2013,

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.240
she had the highest
favorability rating

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.910
of any secretary
of state save one

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:58.080
since those opinion polls
were introduced in 1948.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.490
And then in 2016,
as we all know,

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.100
Clinton ran for
president a second time

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.680
and succeeded in
becoming the first woman

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.285
ever nominated by a major party.

00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:17.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.540
So much has been said
about that election.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.150
And you all witnessed
it for yourselves,

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.610
so I need not add much.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:29.000
I will just make the
point that elections

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.860
are about more than winning.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.560
They promote ideas.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.240
They shape values.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.390
They inspire new
national ideals.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.240
Hillary's campaign
for president may not

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.480
have shattered that
highest glass ceiling.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.070
But in that brutal race,
as in so many other battles

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.620
she has fought over
her career, she

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.110
applied her vast intellect
and determination

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.730
in breaking down barriers
on behalf of others.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.680
Although a majority
of American voters

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.970
cast their ballots for her,
she did not get the job.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:09.080
Nonetheless, over a
lifetime of public service,

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.980
Hillary Clinton has fully
demonstrated her commitment

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.900
to the presidential
oath she would

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:19.040
have taken to preserve,
protect, and defend

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.560
the Constitution of
the United States

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.010
for the benefit
of all Americans.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.230
In "Song of Myself,"
Walt Whitman

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:32.160
wrote, "have you ever heard that
it was good to gain the day?

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.900
I also say it is
good to fall, battles

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.580
are lost in the same spirit
in which they are won."

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.160
I suspect Hillary
Clinton would agree.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.020
We honor her today for all
of her battles won and lost.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.490
And most of all, we celebrate
her for returning time

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:55.490
and again to the
battlefield of public life

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.160
to fight for human
rights, for equality,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.150
for economic opportunity, and
for a pragmatic but principled

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:08.382
approach to governing this great
if sometimes vexing nation.

00:32:08.382 --> 00:32:16.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.100
This afternoon, we will
have the opportunity

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.230
to hear more from
Secretary Clinton herself

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.230
when she converses with
Massachusetts Attorney General

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.250
Maura Healey.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.820
As I mentioned earlier,
Healey is a 1992 graduate

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.840
of Harvard Radcliffe.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.010
Like Clinton, Healey
dares to compete.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.620
Here at Harvard, she
concentrated in government

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.040
and was a cocaptain of the
women's basketball team.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.800
After graduating, Healey
was the starting point guard

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.980
for a professional basketball
team in Austria for two years

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.870
before she returned
to Massachusetts

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:53.440
to attend law school at
Northeastern University.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.090
Healey took office as attorney
general in January 2015,

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.570
pledging to be the people's
lawyer and, in her words,

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.440
"be guided by the values of
responsiveness, inclusion,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.820
and integrity."

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.460
A distinguished attorney,
a powerful advocate,

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.130
and a rising star
among her generation

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.580
of office holders, Maura
Healey is an ideal conversation

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.600
partner for Hillary Clinton.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.300
But before that, we will hear
from another trailblazer,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.940
Madeleine Albright,
who was the first woman

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:30.460
to serve as secretary of
state from 1997 to 2001, which

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.940
made her the highest-ranking
woman in the history of the US

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.450
government.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:40.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.590
She started a
trend that led some

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.810
to ask-- when John
Kerry was nominated

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.180
to be Secretary of State--
whether a man could

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.700
serve effectively in that role.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.920
And she has long
been a trusted friend

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.990
and colleague to our medalist.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:58.170
Secretary Albright is also
a graduate of Wellesley,

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.350
and she went on to earn
master's and doctoral degrees

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.210
from Columbia University.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.400
Before taking over
the State Department,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.980
Albright had served as US
permanent representative

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.650
to the United Nations and
a member of the president's

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:14.489
cabinet from 1993 to 1997.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.310
Today, she is the Michael
and Virginia Mortara Endowed

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.020
Distinguished Professor
in the Practice

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.659
of Diplomacy at the
Georgetown University

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.580
School of Foreign Service.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.820
In 2012, Secretary
Albright deservedly

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.820
received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.600
I am thrilled that Madeleine
Albright is here with us today

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.080
to offer her personal tribute
to Hillary Rodham Clinton,

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.050
so please join me now in warmly
welcoming Secretary Madeleine

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:41.550
Albright.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:35:10.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.540
- Dean Cohen, thank you so
much for the introduction.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.950
And congratulations to you for
your incredibly great tenure--

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.150
really fantastic.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.490
And Secretary
Clinton and members

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.610
of the Radcliffe Association,
distinguished guests,

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.000
thank you all for your warm
welcome, and happy Memorial

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.260
Day.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.270
I'm delighted to
be here and will

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.820
presume to speak for
our guest of honor

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.910
in saying that nothing gives
Wellesley graduates more

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.921
satisfaction then receiving
an award from Radcliffe.

00:35:38.921 --> 00:35:46.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.130
And I have to say--
just to continue

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.750
the Wellesley-Radcliffe
connection--

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.850
I'd like to point
out that Dr. Paula

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.081
Johnson, the president of
Wellesley, is here with us

00:35:54.081 --> 00:35:54.580
today.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:36:04.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.460
I have to say, nothing
will give me more pleasure

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.730
than to share with you a few
thoughts about Hillary Rodham

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:11.790
Clinton.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.940
Of course, it will
not be a surprise

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.100
that I have a very
soft spot in my heart

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.840
for this wonderful woman.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.890
Back in 1996, when the
period of great mentioning

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.400
was going on about who was
going to be secretary of state.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.250
I didn't ever think I
would be secretary of state

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.190
because people said, how could
a woman possibly be secretary

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.360
of state?

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.420
And I now know that I would not
have been secretary of state

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.190
if it hadn't been for Hillary.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.380
And the reason I know
that is President Clinton

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.890
said so publicly.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:47.306
And what happened was that we
were actually traveling abroad,

00:36:47.306 --> 00:36:48.680
and we were at a
foreign embassy.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.138
And we used to have this thing
where I'd introduce Hillary,

00:36:51.138 --> 00:36:52.550
and she would introduce him.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.970
And he said that during this
period of great mentioning,

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:56.930
Hillary came to him.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.200
And she would say, why
wouldn't you name Madeleine?

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.480
She is most in tune
with your views,

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.060
expresses them better than
anybody else, and besides,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.810
it would make your mother happy.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:11.270
So that is how I got to
be secretary of state.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.390
And as I think many of
you here can attest,

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.880
there's nothing like a
good job recommendation

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.900
when you need it.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.400
I had first met Hillary in
the 1980s when she was serving

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.950
on the board of the
Children's Defense Fund, which

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.360
has been mentioned was founded
by a really fantastic woman

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.990
and another recipient of the
Radcliffe Medal, Marian Wright

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.650
Edelman.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.640
And this goes to show that
even at that early stage

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:41.390
in her career, Hillary was
fighting for social justice

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.370
and to help the disadvantaged.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:46.850
In 1993, when I began serving
as America's ambassador

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.670
to the United Nations,
Hillary was First Lady.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.010
Now, a lot of people
kidded about the fact

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.520
that she used to channel
Eleanor Roosevelt. And Eleanor

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.670
Roosevelt spent a lot of
time at the United Nations,

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.620
so Hillary would come
up and visit me a lot.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.720
And we had a great time and got
to know each other very well.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.150
It was wonderful
to introduce her

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.480
to the foreign delegates,
whom she impressed really

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.450
with her knowledge and her
passion for the issues.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.350
Hillary and I also traveled
together internationally a lot.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.310
And she did prove to be one
of the country's most valuable

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.010
representatives, because
everywhere she went,

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.470
she made friends for America.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.830
Now, people have talked about
the Beijing Women's Conference.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.290
And we know the quote,
but I have to tell you

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.030
what it was really like.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.660
When I got there,
it was really crazy.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.110
There were cab drivers who
were given white sheets

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.850
to throw over the lesbians.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.360
There were those who
kept talking about people

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.290
that were lesbians.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.915
And people would come
up and say, where

00:38:49.915 --> 00:38:51.307
is this country of Lesbia?

00:38:51.307 --> 00:38:52.640
We couldn't figure out anything.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.920
There were a lot of
disabled people there,

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.860
and people didn't know
how to treat them.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.010
It was really crazy.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.410
So those of you
have given speeches

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.852
know how hard it can
be to grab and maintain

00:39:06.852 --> 00:39:08.060
the attention of an audience.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.360
So just imagine what it's
like when your listeners come

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.540
from 150 countries and are
sitting in front of you

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.880
with earphones
clamped to their heads

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.760
hearing the voices of
translators who speak slowly

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.390
and without emotion.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.690
And we had been there
for a couple of days.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.940
And then Hillary came
and spoke, and she

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.680
electrified the whole place.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.100
She didn't openly offend
her Chinese hosts,

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.850
but neither did she weaken
her message even a slight bit.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.300
She spoke with dignity
and courage of activists

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.070
across the globe
who were struggling

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.610
to be heard in places where
the only right most women were

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:46.460
granted was the right
to remain silent.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.920
She spoke of women who
had been held back,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.830
pushed aside, shoved
down, beaten up

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:56.420
for reasons that were ascribed
to tradition and culture.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.260
And she insisted that there
was no reason of culture that

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.580
could excuse the
theft of human dignity

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.650
and no tradition that provided
a license for bigotry.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.990
And in words that echoed
instantly across the globe--

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.560
and I will repeat it--
she declared simply

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.360
that human rights
are women's rights

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.670
and women's rights
are human rights.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.880
Never before and never
since has a First Lady

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.200
inspired so many with an impact
that continues to this day.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.300
And that statement
echoes everywhere

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.850
as I have traveled
everywhere, and it is still

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.000
the one that is
motivating so many people.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.910
The following year, we
were on the road again.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.880
And this time, we went to
Prague, Czechoslovakia,

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.500
the city of my birth.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.150
And I'll never
forget the pride I

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.690
took in showing Hillary the
sights of the beautiful city.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.840
But we also had an awful lot
of serious diplomatic business

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.110
to take care of and
at one point needed

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:55.490
to talk where foreign officials
and reporters couldn't hear us.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.860
The result was another
landmark moment

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:59.930
in US diplomatic history--

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.750
the first official
foreign policy discussion

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.598
in the ladies' room.

00:41:04.598 --> 00:41:11.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.930
We also had an
opportunity to march down

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.880
Wenceslas Square
with President Havel,

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.130
and Hillary and President Havel
had wonderful discussions.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.370
And you can just
imagine how proud

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.990
I was to have that opportunity.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.830
I also actually happen
to like Czech food,

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.800
so I took Hillary
to a restaurant.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.570
And the thing I like
most of all is cabbage.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.330
And so I went to the kitchen.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.010
They're nice to me there
in the Czech Republic.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.390
And I said, please keep
bringing out the cabbage.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.370
And finally, Hillary
said, Madeleine,

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.470
I don't really
like this cabbage.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:51.250
So that is one thing
we do disagree on.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.020
It was in this
period that the world

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.360
came to realize what
friends already knew.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.760
Hillary Clinton
was not just smart.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.880
She was dedicated to helping
people across the globe.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.620
And she was not just dedicated.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.970
She was tough.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:08.320
Her career has been guided
by John Wesley's admonition.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.750
And I quote, "do
all the good you can

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.310
in all the ways you can.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:16.360
And by Harriet Tubman's creed,
if you're tired, keep going.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.310
If you're hungry, keep going.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:21.700
And if you want a taste
of freedom, keep going."

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.240
Hillary Clinton is a unique
figure in American history.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.750
No one else has been First
Lady, an award-winning author,

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:32.500
a mother now a grandmother, US
senator, secretary of state,

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.620
and the first woman nominee
of a major party for president

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.940
and who won all
the popular votes.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:46.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.730
But her true
measure can be found

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.840
not in what she's been but in
the principles for which she

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.890
has stood.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.710
She takes seriously the
words that symbolize what

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.420
this country is all about--

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.180
that all men and women
are created equal

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.770
and that our shared
purpose should

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:05.460
be to pursue liberty and
justice for everyone, regardless

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.920
of race, creed, gender,
sexual orientation,

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.800
or whether someone
arrived in this land

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.780
as an immigrant or
a refugee, which

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.150
is why I'm wearing the
Statue of Liberty today.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:23.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.080
Hillary's dedication
is reflected

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.230
in the efforts she made on
behalf of universal health care

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.480
here at home and
the initiatives she

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.050
led abroad to foster peace,
reduce poverty, promote

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:38.320
human rights, and ensure that
the vital voices of women

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.300
are taken into account.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.690
When Hillary Clinton represented
America as secretary of state,

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:46.810
we were confident that she
would strengthen our bonds

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:49.690
with allies, spur
progress in addressing

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.260
global threats such as
terrorism and climate change,

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.780
and speak eloquently
and effectively

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.090
on behalf of democratic values.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.640
That is the kind of
leader Hillary is.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.270
That is the kind of leadership
America will always need.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:08.290
And it's why, in 2016,
I was proud to support

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.660
her candidacy for president.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.200
I'm still excited by the
many thousands of volunteers

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.780
who worked so hard
for her campaign

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.140
because they believed that
America is strongest when we're

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.750
together and that we're
best when we look out

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.330
for one another and treat
each other with civility

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:26.740
and kindness.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.780
Since the election,
we have all struggled

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.840
to understand the
forces that were

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.650
at work during the campaign.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:35.350
And some of us have put
our thoughts in writing.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.630
Hillary wrote a book
called What Happened.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.960
And I-- well, Hillary is
more of a diplomat than I am.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.520
The book I wrote is called
Fascism-- a Warning.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:52.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.590
The good news is that
in recent months,

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.800
we've been witnessing the most
widespread and far-reaching

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.070
groundswell of political
activism and organization

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.420
in my lifetime.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.190
Thousands of women
have stepped forward

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.440
to run for office
for the first time

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.660
and many of them
energized by Hillary

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.110
and supported by her new
organization, Onward Together.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.780
None of them are
dwelling on the past.

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:18.560
Like Secretary Clinton, we
are focused on the future.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.540
More than two decades
ago in Beijing,

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.530
Hillary urged us never to forget
that all people, and I quote,

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:28.430
"have the right to speak freely
and the right to be heard."

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:32.070
And thanks to Hillary's
example, voices are being heard

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:35.630
and will continue to be heard
on behalf of imperatives that

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.280
are anchored in the heart--

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.240
the love of justice, the
desire for freedom, the refusal

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.910
to remain silent in
the face of bigotry,

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.560
and the pursuit of veritas--

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.640
truth.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.590
And now I ask you
to join with me

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.750
in thanking Hillary
Clinton for everything she

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.150
has done and will
do for our country,

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.940
for women, for men, and
for the future of us all.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.950
So Hillary, if
you and Maura will

00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:59.790
come up and take your places.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.570
Thank you all very, very much.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.070
Thank you.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:56.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.760
- Well, we have renewed
energy after that lunch.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.810
This is a rowdy crowd.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.280
This is wonderful.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.534
Listen, I want to say very much
thank you to Dean Cohen and all

00:47:08.534 --> 00:47:10.200
of the folks here at
Radcliffe Institute

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.450
and this entire
university who worked so

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.220
hard to make this day possible.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.960
It's a real honor for
me to be here today

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.550
and a particular honor to be
here with Secretary Clinton

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.730
as she receives this so
richly-deserved Radcliffe

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.071
Medal.

00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:26.820
We're going to get
right into it, I think,

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.910
because everybody's been
waiting for you to speak.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.820
Maybe you could
start by telling us

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.540
how you felt when you got
the call that you were going

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.820
to be able to come to Radcliffe
today and receive this medal.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.570
- Well, I really was
absolutely thrilled

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.890
because I have followed
over the years what

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:50.300
the Institute has done.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.570
And as you've heard
earlier, a number

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.730
of women who I both
know and admire

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:59.780
have been on this stage
receiving the medal.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.170
But I couldn't help but
think about my late father.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.010
Because as you heard
from Liz, I don't

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:10.190
know where he got
this idea, but he

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:14.749
was convinced that
Radcliffe was filled

00:48:14.749 --> 00:48:16.040
with what he called "beatniks."

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:20.830
So he did tell me I couldn't
go west of the Mississippi--

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.770
assuming I wanted him
to help pay for it--

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:25.540
or to Radcliffe.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.610
So I ended up
applying to Wellesley.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.440
I'd never been to
Wellesley before.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:36.070
And so my parents drove me, and
we went through Harvard Square.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.890
And just at the most
normal-looking person,

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.750
my father would say,
see, I told you.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:43.900
It's filled with beatniks.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.535
So, dad, here I am getting
the Radcliffe Medal.

00:48:48.535 --> 00:48:57.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:02.330
- Well, maybe a good place
to start following Secretary

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:06.410
Albright's wonderful testimonial
and this amazing panel that we

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.362
were all experiencing
this morning--

00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:09.320
that was just terrific.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.070
I figured you might
have some thoughts--

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.970
perhaps some things to
amplify, even challenge.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.010
But what's your
reaction to some of what

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.540
was talked about during
this morning's discussion?

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:30.310
- Well, first, I
couldn't imagine a more

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:34.510
distinguished and lively panel.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.060
Nick, thank you for
putting it together

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.690
and for moderating it-- and
to each of the panelists.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:49.540
I think what you heard is a
very fair discussion about where

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.910
we are in the world today
and an implicit challenge--

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:59.590
regardless of party, regardless
of region of our country--

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:02.530
about who we want
to be as a nation

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.580
and how we want to be
represented in the world

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.180
and how we choose
or not to lead.

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:16.300
So up on that panel were two
people that I've had a real

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.200
pleasure in working
with closely,

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:25.750
Anne-Marie and Michelle, another
whom I really admired her

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:27.830
commitment to her work--

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.460
Megan-- during the
Bush administration

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:34.720
was really legendary,
and a journalist

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:40.780
who doesn't just sit and think
about what he wants to opine on

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.960
but actually travels
to places like Raqqa

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.770
and has been doing that
for years and led by Nick,

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:51.400
one of our country's most
distinguished diplomats.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.270
So as I listened
to them, I really

00:50:55.270 --> 00:51:00.070
found no space to disagree with.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.660
The hard part always
is, how do you

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:07.720
translate that into not
just policy but action?

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:13.750
And I'm hoping that perhaps
with this pause that

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:18.730
was described concerning
the North Korea

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:22.750
potential summit
and negotiations,

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:26.440
perhaps some of
those lessons will be

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.460
applied by this administration.

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:36.080
There's that famous old saying,
fail to plan, plan to fail.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.310
And many of us who have
had the opportunity

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:44.290
to be involved with negotiations
or followed them closely--

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:48.920
we're quite skeptical
that pushing as quickly

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:55.670
as the administration did to get
a summit without the groundwork

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.580
being laid, without
really the expertise that

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.060
should be consulted being
part of that process

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.710
would be successful.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.820
So now with this
pause, look, I want

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.180
to see our country succeed
as much as anybody.

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:15.620
And I'm hoping that there will
be a chance to regroup and see

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.510
if any of this is possible.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.030
But as Nick knows,
as Madeleine knows,

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:23.450
we've been down this
road numerous times

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.280
with the North Koreans.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.430
So we have to go in
with our eyes wide open

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.830
with a certain
amount of skepticism.

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.010
But that doesn't
undermine the need

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:35.660
to push as hard
as possible to see

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.990
if there is at this
point in their history

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:43.430
a real chance for a
different relationship

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:47.820
and to rein in and contain
their nuclear program.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.840
So all in all, I was
just captivated by it.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.860
I thought it was a
terrific discussion.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.090
My press secretary who's
been with me since 2008

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:00.470
was shaking his head.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:03.470
And I walked out, and I said,
Nick, what's the matter?

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.540
He goes, I've just never
heard so many people

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.530
say so many nice things
about you in a row.

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:15.670
- Well, enjoy it.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.410
- You know that goes, Maura.

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:20.759
- It doesn't last long.

00:53:20.759 --> 00:53:23.050
One of the things, though,
that I think the panelists--

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:25.720
we had a brief
breakfast this morning.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.430
But the issue about
the pipeline--

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.190
how do we encourage people
to pursue foreign service?

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.380
How do we encourage
people in this time

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.320
to go into government when
good men and women are

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.460
so desperately needed?

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:40.780
How do we encourage those to
pursue public service where

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.450
there may be a question for some
about where power really lies?

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:45.730
Is it in the political sphere?

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:46.870
Is it in government?

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:48.320
Is it in business or elsewhere?

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.050
But any thoughts about that?

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:58.120
- Well, sure, because we hope to
be able to encourage successive

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.750
waves of people,
particularly young people,

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:07.520
to decide that they want to work
in government-- local, state,

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.960
or national, or even
with international bodies

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.040
but focusing particularly
on our federal government.

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.450
And the way that that is
done is by inspiring people

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:22.430
by modeling what
that looks like.

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:23.980
And there's been--

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.350
I think it's fair to say--
a lot of discouragement.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:29.200
Madeleine was telling me that at
the School of Foreign Service,

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.200
where she is a
distinguished professor,

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.600
students are in the
School of Foreign Service,

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.870
but they don't want to go
into the Foreign Service.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:45.970
There is a real concern that
borders on discouragement

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:49.644
from entering into
the civil service

00:54:49.644 --> 00:54:51.310
or, in the case of
the State Department,

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.960
the foreign service.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.520
So that has to be rebuilt.
Now, I'm hoping that the new

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.370
secretary of state-- who has
told me and others that he

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:05.810
intends to really try to
rebuild the State Department,

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:09.250
try to bring in and maybe
even bring back some

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:11.970
of the expertise and
experience that has been lost--

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:14.050
will follow through on
that and be permitted

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:15.790
to follow through on that.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:20.770
It's not a question
of valuing expertise

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:24.340
over common sense or
personal experience.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.530
It's all hands on deck.

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:29.830
If you're running an
agency of the government,

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:33.250
or indeed, if you're in the
White House in the situation

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:38.180
room, those decisions are
so knotty they wouldn't

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.130
get to the secretary of
state or the president

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:45.040
or the national security
advisor unless they

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.550
were difficult decisions.

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:52.180
And in that case, you want
to have as much information--

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.550
dare I say facts and evidence--

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:59.770
that you possibly could in
order to advise and then make

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:00.680
the best decisions.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.680
There's no guarantee that
the decision you make

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.380
will be the right one.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.660
You know, Maura, that I've
thought a lot about this.

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:09.550
But one of the most
amazing decision

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:12.820
processes I was
part of was being

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.800
in the very small group
advising President

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:21.370
Obama about whether to go
after a target in Pakistan

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:27.250
based on intelligence that it
could very well be where Osama

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:31.650
bin Laden was living or hiding.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:37.390
It was by no means a
100 to nothing decision,

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:39.130
and it certainly
wasn't a decision

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:41.830
that could be made by
the gut of the president.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:45.820
At the end of the day, after
everything was presented

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:49.350
and the intelligence
was red teamed

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:53.020
by two different intel
groups that were not

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.990
in the hunt for bin Laden
but had other expertise,

00:56:55.990 --> 00:57:01.600
and it came back that
maybe it was 40% to 60%

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.860
accurate reliable, you
had to lay all that out.

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.850
You had to have robust
discussion, even disagreements,

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:13.780
which we did among that very
small group around the table.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.730
And then you turn
to the president.

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.940
And you each give
your opinion based

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.770
on your understanding
of the facts

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:24.050
and the evidence, your
assessment of the risks.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:25.480
And then, of course,
the president

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.860
has to make the decision.

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.030
There is no way
that I can imagine

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:36.180
important life-or-death
decisions being

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.020
made without that kind
of thoughtfulness.

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:45.030
And the State Department
has a deep reservoir

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:47.920
of people with experience
who will say, well,

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:51.390
if you say that,
that sounds like what

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:52.920
was said to his father.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.770
And he's going to immediately
have a negative reaction.

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:58.170
Now, who would know
that other than people

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:03.330
who have been immersed in
the language and the culture

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:04.420
of another country?

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.940
So I'm hoping that
people who are currently

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.120
in the government who are
not political appointees

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:16.350
will stay as long as they
can fighting for facts

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.880
and evidence and our values.

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.940
And I hope that people--

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:24.300
if they are so motivated-- will
still go into our government.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:30.350
Because this too shall pass, and
we're going to need a vigorous,

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:34.080
well-prepared, well
positioned federal government

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.380
to try to pick up the pieces.

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.240
- Well, thank you.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:43.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:47.250
Let's shift now to more
on the domestic front.

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:50.940
And in particular, I
want to focus some time

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.710
on a couple of
groups of people--

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:54.870
first, the students.

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:56.700
And then I want to
talk about women

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.400
out there who are running in
record numbers for office.

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.010
But just weeks ago
on this very campus,

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:03.780
Parkland students came to town.

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:07.980
And I think we see this
incredible surge in energy

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.210
by young people all
across this country.

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.420
We've got high schoolers
and junior high schoolers

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:15.860
organizing walkouts here in
Massachusetts, for example.

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:18.480
What do you make of it,
and what would your advice

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:22.200
be to young people today?

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:26.130
- Well, I'm thrilled by
the activism we're seeing.

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:32.730
And the fact that one of
the most difficult issues we

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:38.640
confront is over our
tragically high rate of gun

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:45.740
deaths in this country
and the constant pattern

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:50.700
of mass shootings and what
we've seen in our schools

00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:54.930
has ignited a level
of civic involvement

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:59.130
on the part of high school
students is thrilling.

00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:03.450
And what the Parkland
students are trying to do--

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:08.520
and I'm very much
admiring of this.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.420
They want to turn
common sense gun safety

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.140
laws into a voting issue.

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.360
Now, people will say,
well, it's always

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.440
a voting issue, isn't it?

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.050
Well, it is for the other side.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:26.580
For the other side whipped
up by the exaggeration

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:30.360
and the hyperbole--
the hypocrisy even--

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:39.720
of the NRA and public figures,
even though it's a really small

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.300
minority of Americans--
and, frankly,

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.120
a minority of gun owners,
because both a majority

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.780
of Americans and a majority of
gun owners support common sense

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.220
gun safety laws--

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:57.210
but because the anti group
is so well-organized and so

01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:01.320
intimidating and because there's
some history as to the price

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.180
politicians pay for
going up against them,

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.850
it remains a voting
issue only on one side

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:11.440
of the political ledger.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.954
So what the Parkland students
are doing is to say, look.

01:01:14.954 --> 01:01:17.370
Whatever else you care about--
you care about the economy,

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:19.680
you care about health care,
you care about education

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.580
and climate--

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.720
great.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.530
But please move up your
priority list whether or not

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:31.980
we keep children and young
people and everyone alive.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:37.970
Let's not overlook the fact
that Las Vegas happened.

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:43.910
People attending a country
music concert picked off--

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:46.760
more than 50 killed,
500 injured--

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.280
the Pulse night club in Orlando.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:55.370
So the children and student
killings, from Sandy Hook

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:59.180
to now Santa Fe,
Texas, grip your heart

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:02.330
in such a horrible way.

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:05.370
And people get motivated,
but let's remember

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:08.810
that a lot of other totally
innocent people going

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:12.260
about their daily lives
are being murdered.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:18.830
So taking this on is one of
the great public services

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:22.040
that the Parkland students
and others joining them

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.870
are performing.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:26.120
But it won't matter
if people don't

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:31.310
vote against NRA-funded
candidates come November.

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:35.490
So they're trying to translate
this into a voting issue.

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.280
And I want to thank
your attorney general.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.990
She was one of the
first people out

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:42.630
of the gate talking about
the need for common sense gun

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:43.296
safety measures.

01:02:43.296 --> 01:02:50.746
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:50.746 --> 01:02:52.620
- So we look at these
students-- high school,

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.564
college millennials.

01:02:54.564 --> 01:02:56.480
They're out there in the
environment marching,

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.129
the Women's March here, on
the gun issue and the like.

01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:01.670
Is there something
different, though,

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.711
that you think is happening
with these students--

01:03:03.711 --> 01:03:06.140
their use of social media
or other things happening

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:12.200
that makes youth activism,
student activism maybe

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.210
translate into something more
meaningful and transformational

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:18.400
than we've seen with student
movements in the past?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.770
Not to take away from student
movements in the past,

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:23.230
but do you have any
thoughts on that

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:28.110
and real consideration of that?

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.530
- Well, I think it's always
difficult to compare.

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:34.560
And, of course, my
frame of comparison

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.920
would be the 1960s where there
was a lot of student activism.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.550
There were many students
involved in the civil rights

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:45.540
movement.

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.510
There were many, many
students involved

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.490
in the anti-war movement.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.070
Increasingly, there were
students speaking out

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.780
about the women's movement.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.530
So there was a
level of involvement

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:02.940
that we saw in the streets, in
the classroom, and teach-ins

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:08.220
and sit-ins and all kinds
of tactics that were used.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.560
And we look back, and
we think, well, hey, we

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.470
passed civil rights
laws eventually--

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:14.280
not soon enough.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.870
But eventually, the
Vietnam War ended.

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.910
And yeah, ultimately,
we got laws passed

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:27.300
and legal decisions, court
opinions rendered to knock down

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.860
barriers for women.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.550
So I certainly think
there was a connection

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:36.420
between young people's
activism back then

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.980
and a lot of the changes
that have been taking place.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:46.740
What I see today is different
in part because it combines

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.080
old tactics like marches--

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.690
the Women's March,
the March for Life,

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:55.410
so many other demonstrations
that people have been

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.120
waging and participating in--

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.550
and it uses social
media for organizing.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:06.070
And as you say, that is
a different approach.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:11.640
Now, I will hasten to point
out that in the absence

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:18.150
of buttressing social media
with real on-the-ground personal

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:22.950
connections, relationship
building, and organizing,

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:24.610
it will not be effective.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.300
And I saw that firsthand.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.040
When the panel was
talking earlier--

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.632
and I think David Ignatius was
talking about the Arab Spring.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.220
I went to Cairo after
Mubarak stepped down.

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:47.910
I met with a large group
of the students who

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:53.250
had led the Tahrir
Square demonstrations,

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.750
and I asked them.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.809
I said, so what is next for you?

01:05:57.809 --> 01:06:00.100
And they looked at me like,
what a ridiculous question.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.340
We've done what we came to do.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.940
We got rid of Mubarak.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.630
And I said, so what do
you think happens next?

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.010
And they said, well, we're
going to have a democracy,

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:15.686
and we're going to move
quickly into a better future.

01:06:15.686 --> 01:06:16.310
And I said, OK.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:17.570
Let me stop you there.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:20.090
Are any of you planning
to run for office

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:21.290
in this new democracy?

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:22.400
No.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:27.230
Are any of you planning to start
political parties to compete?

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:28.280
No.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.250
So you've built up all
this social capital driven

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:38.460
by social media, but you're not
ready to take the next step.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.827
And of course,
that's what I saw.

01:06:41.827 --> 01:06:42.660
And I said to them--

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.910
I said, there are only
two organized groups

01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:48.630
other than the Mubarak regime.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.430
There are only two
organized groups

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:55.350
in Egypt, the Muslim
Brotherhood and the army.

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:59.790
So if you don't help to fill
the void that has now developed

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:05.370
because the 30-plus
year ruler is gone,

01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:07.980
it's going to be a contest
between the Muslim Brotherhood

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.120
and the army.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.150
And indeed, that's
what happened.

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:15.900
So when I look at social media
as a tool for bringing people

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.990
to demonstrations,
for signing petitions,

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:23.880
for attacking somebody online
for what they did or didn't do,

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.480
that's a part of it.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.230
But in the end, it
really does come down

01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:32.310
to how well you're organized,
whether you show up and vote,

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:37.320
and whether there are people
willing to get into the arena

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.980
as Dean Cohen referred to
with the reference to Teddy

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.690
Roosevelt earlier.

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:48.690
So I guess I am inspired,
and I'm optimistic.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:53.580
But I want to be sure that
all this activity actually

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.290
leads to real change.

01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:59.670
And that's what I
find really hopeful--

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:02.580
is the number of people,
particularly the number

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.990
of women, running for office.

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:07.290
And I started this
group Onward Together

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:10.650
to support groups that
are recruiting candidates

01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:12.780
and funding fund
raising for them

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:17.609
and also taking on cause
issues because I want

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:21.720
to have as personal
relationship as I can

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.310
with the young people who are
trying to go to the next level.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.760
And many of them are
both motivated by

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.960
and shocked by the outcome
of the 2016 election.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.359
Some have a sense
of mission that

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:39.870
is just extraordinary to
take our country back.

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.580
But this doesn't
happen overnight.

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.939
And it's imperative
that young people--

01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:49.439
and really all of us who
are on the side of change

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:53.010
in the so-called
resistance and opposition--

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:57.630
who want to change the course
of the Congress first in 2018,

01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:00.899
state legislatures,
governors and the like

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:05.790
really get involved and
support everybody who's already

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:07.950
out there in the arena
to the best we can

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:10.020
and make sure they
actually participate

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.680
in the political process and
show up and vote in November.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:20.710
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:24.819
- Your story and so much of
what we've heard recounted today

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:27.189
shows and demonstrates
your lifelong commitment

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:29.859
to girls, to women, to
empowering girls and women.

01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:32.830
And I know to this day you
continue to receive letters

01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:34.330
from girls all over the world.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.023
I asked my niece.

01:09:38.023 --> 01:09:39.939
I went right to the
source-- a nine-year-old--

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:40.939
and you inspired her.

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:41.859
And I said, what
would you like me

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:43.210
to ask Secretary Clinton today?

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:47.050
And she told me that she'd
like to know who inspired you

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.920
when you were a little girl.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.420
- Wow.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.330
That's a great question.

01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:55.840
I love talking to
these little girls

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.870
between the age of four and 12.

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.930
On my book tour, they would
come with little pantsuits

01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:05.980
and little fake poppet pearls.

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:11.320
And some of them would wear
their Wonder Women costumes.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:19.570
Look-- I feel very much
indebted to my mother who

01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:24.130
didn't have the opportunities
by any stretch that I've had

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:30.250
but who really both inspired
me and guided me and picked me

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.080
back up when I was knocked down.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.940
I tell this story
in Living History.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.200
There was a searing experience.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.420
We moved from Chicago
to the suburbs.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.490
And we were living in the
kind of classic 1950s suburbs

01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:48.139
where the men were--

01:10:48.139 --> 01:10:49.930
they all left in the
morning to go to work.

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:51.790
They were all World War II vets.

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:53.590
They had lived through
the Depression.

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:58.180
They had a pretty
common world view.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.160
Our mothers all were at home.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.610
None of them worked.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:07.420
They were active in the
PTA and in the neighborhood

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.270
in the church doing things
on a volunteer basis.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.500
So when I was four
years old and we

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.134
were in this new neighborhood,
it was filled with kids.

01:11:16.134 --> 01:11:17.050
I mean, it really was.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:21.910
The baby boom was on every
corner of every street.

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:24.460
So my mother would
get me dressed

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.940
and usually put a bow in
my hair and send me out.

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:31.210
And every day, I would
get knocked down.

01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:33.190
I would get pushed around.

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:36.040
And I would go running and
crying back into the house.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.170
This went on for weeks.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:42.380
And they just decided that I
was the easiest victim around,

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.600
so why not?

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:51.430
And it was kind of a training
program for future bullies.

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:56.300
And so one day, I go as usual
running back into the house.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.690
And my mother meets me.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:04.630
And she says to me, there is no
room for cowards in this house.

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:07.070
Get back out there.

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:10.280
I thought I'd been
sent to my death.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.740
I later learned she was like
hiding behind the dining room

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:13.520
curtains.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.120
Because when I came
back out, those kids

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.700
were more surprised than I was.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.020
So here's what they decided.

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.410
They decided that there
should be a fight--

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:27.441
a real, physical fight-- between
me and the four-year-old girl

01:12:27.441 --> 01:12:28.940
who lived across
the street who came

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.490
from this big, raucous family.

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:34.550
So they make a circle,
and they push us both in.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.640
I'm looking at her.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.430
She's looking at me.

01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:39.500
And so her brothers
are yelling at her,

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.270
knock her down, knock her down.

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:43.880
And so she starts pushing me.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.670
So, I mean, this was
not just another fight.

01:12:46.670 --> 01:12:49.310
This was whether I would
have a home and a family

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:51.050
for the rest of my life.

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:56.160
So I pushed back really
hard, knocked her down.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.119
That, thankfully, was the end.

01:12:58.119 --> 01:12:59.910
There was no weapons
or anything like that,

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:02.970
it was just kids pushing
each other around,

01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:06.240
and she became my best
friend growing up.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.670
So my mother was a role
model and an example,

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.700
even though her life was
so different from mine.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.260
She was abandoned
by her parents,

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.730
thrown out by her
grandparents, was

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:21.540
working as a domestic in another
family's home when she was 13.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:27.810
But in the funny way life
is, working in that home

01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:30.150
really influenced
her life because it

01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:32.310
was the first time she'd
ever been in a home

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:34.860
where the mother and the father
loved each other, where they

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.840
took good care of
their children,

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.550
and where the woman
she was working for

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:40.020
knew my mother wanted
to go to high school.

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.060
So they worked it out that
my mother could get up early,

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.860
get her chores done,
run to high school,

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.080
and run back and finish her
chores when she got back

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:46.995
from high school.

01:13:46.995 --> 01:13:51.540
It sounds kind of harsh, but for
my mother it was a great gift.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:54.060
So she was by far the
biggest inspiration.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:59.580
But then as I learned
more about our history

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.970
and got exposed to
different people,

01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.790
I remember being really
impressed with Margaret Chase

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.580
Smith, the senator from Maine.

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:13.470
And I didn't really
know a lot about her.

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:16.260
But I've got most of my
information about the world

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:19.480
from Life magazine,
which came every Friday.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.990
So you'd come home from school,
and you'd lie on the floor.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.750
And you'd look at the pictures
and maybe read the article.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:28.680
And that's how I encountered
Margaret Chase Smith.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.820
I learned more about
Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:38.640
It was a very rich
time to be exposed.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.510
And I had fabulous teachers
in my public schools,

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:47.854
just great teachers, all of whom
gave me a tremendous education.

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:54.680
- We're going to move through
an incredibly quick lightning

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.040
round here, OK?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.170
One question I did
want to ask you

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:06.610
is, if you could be a CEO
of any company right now,

01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:09.020
what would you choose and why?

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.600
- Facebook.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.550
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:21.370
I just want to add, it's
the biggest news platform

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:22.960
in the world.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.940
We can listen to really
brilliant experienced writers

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:31.690
like David Ignatius and try
to keep up with the news.

01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:36.220
But most people in our
country get their news--

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.410
true or not-- from Facebook.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:42.640
Now, Facebook is
trying to take on some

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:48.160
of the unexpected consequences
of their business model.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:51.640
And I, for one, hope
that they get it right,

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:55.990
because it really is
critical to our democracy

01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:58.540
that people get accurate
information on which

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.370
to make decisions.

01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:02.030
And so that's the one I'd pick.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:08.170
- When was the last time
someone didn't recognize you?

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:14.860
- Well, I sometimes go--

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.890
- You actually remember?

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:16.940
- I do.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:22.000
I sometimes try to go in
sort of a mini disguise--

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.734
put on a baseball cap.

01:16:23.734 --> 01:16:26.150
It is a little hard when you
have Secret Service following

01:16:26.150 --> 01:16:27.800
you around.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.815
One time where I
lived in Washing

01:16:29.815 --> 01:16:31.190
while I was
Secretary of State, I

01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:34.670
came home to go for a walk one
night at like 9:30 or 10:00.

01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:37.730
I was trying to power
walk down Mass Avenue.

01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:40.477
And a woman passed me on
her bike, and she stopped.

01:16:40.477 --> 01:16:42.560
And I caught up with her,
and she whispered to me.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.340
She said, I have to tell you.

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.700
There's a man following you.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.740
I said, oh, really?

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.540
Oh, OK.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.720
So I was just in
Australia and New Zealand,

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.200
and we were in New
Zealand and seeing

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.230
some of the sights in Auckland.

01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:07.165
And they have a new
fabulous 39-year-old woman

01:17:07.165 --> 01:17:07.790
prime minister.

01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.880
Not only that,
she's going to have

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.900
a baby in a couple of weeks.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.620
So it's really quite exciting.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:23.180
And so people did not
recognize me, which was great.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.750
It's a nice respite.

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.020
- OK.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.140
Speaking of travels-- best
ceremonial swag you ever

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.040
received on the job?

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.860
- Wow.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.910
Well, the good stuff
you can't keep.

01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:42.200
You get a lot when you're
a First Lady, a senator,

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.990
or a secretary of state.

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:46.940
Most other cultures--
gift giving

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:50.910
is a part of the culture, so
they have to give you a gift.

01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:55.070
And despite our best efforts to
not go overboard, pretty soon

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.700
you realize you've
got to reciprocate.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:00.170
So I always had
wonderful American crafts

01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:03.890
and American-made products
and felt really positive

01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:04.400
about that.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:11.030
But they would give you
elaborate jewelry and really

01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:14.660
expensive handbags and things.

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.130
You would say,
thank you very much,

01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:18.380
and they would go
right in the archive.

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:25.680
So the stuff you could keep was,
I think, below like $25 or $50.

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.000
I can't remember--
if you wanted to.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.500
And I gave a lot
of my stuff away.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.380
I gave it to people who
worked in the State Department

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.580
if they wanted it.

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:39.550
So I always appreciated a
thoughtful, inexpensive gift,

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:41.560
because at least
you then would have

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:46.240
the option of maybe keeping
it or giving it away.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.300
But usually, ceremonial swag--

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:54.760
I have more sweatshirts,
more hoodies.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:59.020
I have an enormous number
of T-shirts of all kinds.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:03.400
And I hope nobody minds
that they are mostly now

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.380
in the possession of
homeless people in New

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.450
York and elsewhere,
because what's

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.800
the point of my
having all of that?

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.460
And victims of domestic
violence-- because the women

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.460
leave their homes with
nothing, so anything that

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.650
can be done to give
them a wardrobe

01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:20.770
and give them some necessities.

01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:26.120
So it's just a funny experience.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.525
When it first happens to you,
you don't know what to say.

01:19:28.525 --> 01:19:29.241
Oh, no, no.

01:19:29.241 --> 01:19:29.740
That's OK.

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:30.760
You don't have to give me that.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.120
No, no.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.161
We have to give you that.

01:19:32.161 --> 01:19:35.890
I mean, I can't go back and
tell my king or my president

01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:36.960
that you didn't take it.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:37.460
Oh, OK.

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:38.790
I'll take it.

01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:44.200
So it's a different experience
when you're in those positions.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:44.920
- All right.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.890
Well, turning to the
slightly more serious,

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:50.350
I know there are a lot of
people in the audience who

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:53.410
wish Chelsea well, and
Charlotte, and your grandson

01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:56.560
and are also looking
for some advice

01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:00.800
on how to raise strong girls
and women in today's world.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.420
Do you care to say
anything to that?

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.730
- Well, any of you
who have children

01:20:05.730 --> 01:20:09.090
know that you can do everything
you think you should do,

01:20:09.090 --> 01:20:11.950
and it doesn't work.

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:16.380
And you can also try different
approaches, different methods,

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.200
and some of it may.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.010
I really am grateful
for the experience

01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:24.300
of raising my daughter.

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.630
I think she's taught me as
much as I've ever taught her.

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:30.150
And what's a real joy
is now watching her

01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:31.944
with my grandchildren.

01:20:31.944 --> 01:20:33.110
I want to say just one word.

01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:34.710
There's a lot of things that--

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:37.200
we read, talk, and
sing to your child.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.520
Build those brain cells.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.040
I mean, there's a lot of
very practical advice.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.810
But I want to just mention
one area that I feel really

01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:48.780
strongly about,
and that is we need

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:58.800
to develop empathy and kindness
in our children for themselves

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.540
and for others.

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.910
I was really fortunate.

01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:08.140
Because when I was very
young, through my church,

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.000
I had a lot of
those experiences.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.700
I was 12 years old
and asked to babysit

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:16.660
for the children of
Mexican farm workers

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.150
who were working their way
north with the harvest.

01:21:19.150 --> 01:21:21.802
And a group of us girls
would go out to their camp

01:21:21.802 --> 01:21:24.010
and watch the little kids
of the mothers and fathers,

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:27.920
and the older brothers and
sisters could work on Saturday.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.970
And so at that very
young age, I got

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:35.500
to experience what to me
seemed like a total revelation.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.786
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:36.786 --> 01:21:37.660
They're just like us.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.960
Because when their
parents would pull up

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.060
at the end of a long
dusty road in an old

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.550
beat up bus coming
back from the fields,

01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:47.209
no matter what game
we were playing

01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:49.750
or how we were entertaining the
kids, they would break loose.

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:53.080
And they would start running
as fast as they could

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:57.460
into the arms of their parents,
into throwing their arms

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:00.310
around the legs of their
big brothers and sisters.

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:02.710
And I thought about
myself as a child

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:05.560
running to meet my father
when he got home from work.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:11.320
And so it's not as easy
perhaps now as it used to be.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.100
But creating
opportunities for children

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.740
to learn the
importance of service

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:21.920
to understand the importance
of kindness and empathy--

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.760
so with Chelsea,
we would take her

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.570
to homeless shelters and
domestic violence shelters

01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:33.190
and be part of the service
that we believed in that we

01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:35.020
wanted her to experience.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:39.490
So there's many ways of trying
to raise strong, bright kids,

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:42.460
but I hope we can raise
strong, bright, kind,

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:43.720
and empathetic kids as well.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:52.852
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:52.852 --> 01:22:54.310
And I know-- this
will be the last.

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:55.150
I know.

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:59.040
Because we do want to make
sure you get your medal.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.530
In this time where
we know we need

01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:03.270
to fight for the
rule of law, we need

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:05.070
to stand for the
Constitution, and we

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:08.880
need to enforce rights that are
on the books to protect people,

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.430
we need to fight
for a free media.

01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:15.654
We need to fight for facts and
knowledge and data to guide us.

01:23:15.654 --> 01:23:17.820
These are things I think a
lot of folks in this room

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.930
are actively engaged in.

01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:23.970
But I guess my final question
for you, Secretary Clinton,

01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:28.660
is, why are you optimistic and
hopeful as we look forward?

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.300
And specifically,
what is it that we

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.730
can be doing in our
day-to-day lives

01:23:32.730 --> 01:23:34.710
or encouraging
others to do who are

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:38.430
looking to find their agency
in this critical moment?

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:39.870
You have taught us so much.

01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:44.230
You have brought
so much forward.

01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:46.800
I think about the activism
and the town halls,

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.480
the women who are
running for office,

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.170
the women you've inspired.

01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:53.670
And there are so many ready to
go and ready to do the work.

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.500
But what work do you
think is meaningful,

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:58.770
and how should we
all get to work?

01:23:58.770 --> 01:24:02.910
- Oh, that's a really important
question that I hope all of us

01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:04.500
are thinking about,
because there's

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.450
something for everyone to do.

01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:08.160
Not everyone will
want to run for office

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.490
or run a campaign or
volunteer for a campaign,

01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:14.280
but there's something
for everyone to do.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.330
And let me just sort
of briefly refer

01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:21.960
to Madeleine with that
incredible book she has just

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.210
published, Fascism-- a Warning.

01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:29.872
At the end of it, she talks
about what is expected from us.

01:24:29.872 --> 01:24:33.600
If you see something, say
something, do something, right?

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.780
So what does that mean?

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:38.440
Well, we have to defend
higher education.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.315
I'm sorry to have to say that,
but it is absolutely true.

01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:48.690
And that doesn't mean
we defend the folks who

01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:50.670
are not worthy of defense.

01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:52.680
There are some
characters out there

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.610
who call themselves
colleges, and maybe that

01:24:56.610 --> 01:25:00.870
should not be given the name.

01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:03.630
But by and large,
higher education

01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:07.000
is one of the greatest
accomplishments of the United

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.040
States.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.930
It has been one of our
biggest selling points.

01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:16.900
And we have attracted people
from all over the world.

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:20.580
We have educated
generations of Americans

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:23.970
to pursue their own dreams,
to contribute to society.

01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:28.020
So please, anybody associated
with Harvard or Wellesley--

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:31.290
as my dear friend President
Paula Johnson knows--

01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:34.740
stand up and defend
the open inquiry.

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:38.010
Stand up and defend
reason and facts.

01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:40.710
Stand up against
alternative reality

01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:43.680
wherever it pokes
up its ugly head.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:49.020
Be ready to speak up about the
importance of the work that

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:52.560
is done at a great
institution like this.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.880
Defend the press.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:57.120
And believe me, that's not easy
for me to say all of the time.

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:03.360
But I know very
well in the absence

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.780
of a free, vigorous
press, our democracy

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.550
is not going to survive.

01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:13.200
And what I see happening
is, unfortunately, we

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.080
have seen a kind of
rejuvenation of some

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.710
of our great newspapers.

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:22.320
Subscribe to a newspaper
for goodness' sakes

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.220
if it's one that is actually
coming back and doing

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:30.960
the investigatory work
trying to call out the truth.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.360
But it's also the
fact that, as I said,

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.820
Facebook is the
major source of news.

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:40.170
And people who have a very
particular point of view,

01:26:40.170 --> 01:26:45.720
an ideology, or a commercial
perspective to try to sell

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.630
have really dominated
the TV market.

01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:49.650
It's not just Fox.

01:26:49.650 --> 01:26:53.730
It's now Sinclair where
they are essentially

01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:56.190
delivering propaganda.

01:26:56.190 --> 01:27:00.120
So we need more people to
speak up and speak out,

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.830
and we need more outlets.

01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:05.160
We need more sources of
reliable information.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.330
I don't blame citizens for being
confused about what to believe.

01:27:09.330 --> 01:27:12.930
They are bombarded day in and
day out by contrary messages.

01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:19.090
And people kind of fall back on
relying on one or two sources.

01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:21.060
And if they are
sources that don't

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:25.140
traffic in the facts,
then how can they

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:30.870
be expected to make
decisions that might further

01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:34.280
our common efforts?

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.340
And finally, I know this is
another really obvious thing

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.000
to say--

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.990
vote in every election, not
just presidential election.

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:48.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.090
It is maddening because--

01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:53.280
one of the panelists said,
we get the government

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.560
that we vote for.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.010
Now, we have this odd system
with the electoral college.

01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:03.660
And maybe we could
get President Faust

01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:06.600
to explain the roots
of that, because it's

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.789
a little troubling.

01:28:08.789 --> 01:28:10.080
But nevertheless, we've got it.

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.490
I've been against
it, by the way,

01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:16.710
since 2000, not that
you need to know that.

01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:18.210
But I have been
because I just think

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:22.390
it is absolutely contrary
to one person, one vote.

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:27.150
So you've got to find an issue
that you really care about

01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:30.150
and go deep and go long.

01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:34.050
We're not going to
change things overnight.

01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:38.910
And we have to be persistent
and sustain the opposition

01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:40.890
that we are now putting forth.

01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:42.750
Actually, I've been
pleasantly surprised

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:45.360
how well it has been sustained.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.580
So I can encourage people
to find that area that you

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:55.470
are passionate about and find
others who share your views

01:28:55.470 --> 01:29:01.180
and then figure out a way to
talk about it, write about it,

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:03.030
speak up about it.

01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:06.390
Because you never know
how the tide will turn.

01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:09.390
And I am optimistic
the tide will turn.

01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:13.560
Because once you
have a record, people

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.160
can actually measure what
you have delivered for them

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.550
and for their families.

01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:21.600
And I think we'll
be in good shape

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.040
in making the case in
2018 and then in 2020

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.380
for politics that is rooted in
evidence about what works best

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.570
and in bringing
people together to try

01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:37.230
to make common cause to actually
get the results we seek.

01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:39.280
But that won't happen
just by wishing for it.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.221
So please, everybody,
find a role

01:29:41.221 --> 01:29:42.637
that you feel
comfortable playing.

01:29:42.637 --> 01:29:51.230
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:53.090
- Well, we're going to bring--

01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:55.330
this is a conversation I
would love to continue.

01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:57.440
I'm sure many of you
would love to continue

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.850
to hear from Secretary Clinton.

01:29:58.850 --> 01:30:02.450
But suffice it to say, it's
on to the medal ceremony.

01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:03.200
And thank you.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.840
I know I'm comfortable
speaking on behalf of all of us

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.110
in thanking you for your
inspiration, your integrity,

01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:12.230
your commitment,
and your commitment

01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:14.840
to making sure that no matter
the circumstance or what

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.860
befalls us we got to get up
every day and do the hard work,

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:22.135
the long and deep work, and that
together, we will move forward.

01:30:22.135 --> 01:30:23.760
Thank you very much,
Secretary Clinton.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:45.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:30:45.490 --> 01:30:47.560
- So thank you so much,
Maura, for leading

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:50.500
such a terrific and
thoughtful conversation.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.420
And to Secretary
Clinton, thank you

01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:55.780
for sharing your thoughts,
your insights with all of us

01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:58.630
and for participating in
this special occasion.

01:30:58.630 --> 01:31:02.620
And in a minute, I'm going
to confer on you the 2018

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.400
Radcliffe Medal.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.420
But before I do that.

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:07.600
I want to recognize someone who
has delayed in getting here.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.410
But he was so determined to
get here that he persisted.

01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:15.760
And that is former Harvard
President Neil Rudenstine,

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.410
who was critical to the
creation of the Institute.

01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:35.646
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:35.646 --> 01:31:38.540
The Radcliffe Institute
wouldn't be here today

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.640
if Neil hadn't persisted.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.910
So now it's time for
me to read the citation

01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:47.270
and then to give you our medal.

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:51.230
She has lived a life
of public service.

01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:55.310
She uses her fierce
intellect and determination

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:59.330
to create meaningful social
and political change.

01:31:59.330 --> 01:32:04.970
She displays the courage
demanded of those who go first.

01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:08.570
Secretary Clinton, I bestow
upon you this Radcliffe Medal

01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:13.280
with the deepest admiration for
a lifetime of exemplary service

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.730
and profound impact.

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:47.670
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:52.740
Now please join me in
welcoming our 2018 Radcliffe

01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.814
Medalist Hillary Rodham
Clinton to the podium.

01:32:55.814 --> 01:32:58.660
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:58.660 --> 01:32:59.610
- Oh, thank you.

01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:03.390
You know, this has been
such an amazing day.

01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:08.460
I just want to express my
deep honor and appreciation.

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:12.780
Thank you so much to Dean
Cohen and to everyone

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:17.970
who was part of this
ceremony and who is part

01:33:17.970 --> 01:33:19.710
of the Radcliffe Institute.

01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:23.880
I am so humbled to accept
the Radcliffe Medal.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:27.690
I want to thank formally
my friend and colleague

01:33:27.690 --> 01:33:32.700
Madeleine Albright for her
remarks and for her leadership

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.810
and also to Attorney
General Healey

01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:39.840
for that invigorating
conversation, which I agree,

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.070
Maura, could go on and on.

01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:42.990
And I hope to keep
talking to you

01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:45.300
as you keep doing an
excellent job-- not

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:47.625
only for Massachusetts,
but for the country.

01:33:47.625 --> 01:33:55.220
[APPLAUSE]

01:33:55.220 --> 01:33:57.700
Now, I have to
confess, being here has

01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:00.820
felt a little bit like an
episode of that old TV show,

01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:03.670
This Is Your Life.

01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:05.950
But today's
conversation could not

01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:09.310
have come at a more
important moment.

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:13.180
Transformation of our economy,
our politics, and our culture

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.710
is happening in real time.

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:18.880
I recently reread those
really famous lines

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:20.980
from Charles Dickens in
A Tale of Two Cities,

01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:25.330
but I hadn't focused on them
in quite a number of years.

01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:26.920
Just remember how it went.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:30.200
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.060
It was the age of wisdom, it
was the age of foolishness.

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:39.310
It was the epoch of belief, it
was the epoch of incredulity.

01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:44.270
It was the season of light,
it was the season of darkness.

01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:49.090
It was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair."

01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:51.550
Now, Dickens was obviously
writing about the years

01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:53.230
leading up to the
French Revolution,

01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:55.660
but he could have
been describing

01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:00.130
the ricocheting highs and lows
of this moment in America.

01:35:00.130 --> 01:35:02.560
Because we're living
through a time

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:06.850
when fundamental rights, civic
virtue, freedom of the press,

01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:12.650
even facts and reason are under
assault like never before.

01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:17.260
But we are also witnessing an
era of new moral conviction,

01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:20.410
civic engagement,
a sense of devotion

01:35:20.410 --> 01:35:23.600
to our democracy
and our country.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.880
One of my heroes, Eleanor
Roosevelt, said many things,

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.710
but here's one.

01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:32.650
"You gain strength and
courage and confidence

01:35:32.650 --> 01:35:35.410
by every experience
in which you really

01:35:35.410 --> 01:35:40.210
stop to look fear in the face.

01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:42.860
And you are able
to say to yourself,

01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:44.800
I have lived
through this horror.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.580
I can take the next
thing that comes along."

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:51.260
That's resilience.

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:54.700
Resilience has been
on my mind a lot,

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.620
because everyone
gets knocked down.

01:35:56.620 --> 01:36:01.090
What matters is whether you
get back up and keep going.

01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:04.030
And it's not been an easy
time for more than half

01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:08.290
of our country since
the 2016 election.

01:36:08.290 --> 01:36:10.960
And I still think
that understanding

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.800
what happened in that
weird and wild election

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.550
will help us defend our
democracy in the future.

01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:23.020
Now, you know-- and you heard
this morning from the panel--

01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.900
our country is
dangerously polarized.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:29.850
We have sorted ourselves
into opposing camps,

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:34.510
and that shapes so much
about how we see the world.

01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:36.400
The data backs this up.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:39.250
There are more liberals and
conservatives than there

01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:42.190
used to be and fewer centrists.

01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:44.830
Our political parties
are more ideologically

01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:47.960
and geographically consistent.

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.230
There are fewer
northern Republicans

01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:52.750
and fewer southern Democrats.

01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:57.610
The divides on race and religion
are starker than ever before.

01:36:57.610 --> 01:37:04.360
And as the middle shrank,
partisan animosity grew.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.340
In 1960, just 5% of
Republicans and 4% of Democrats

01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:13.210
said they would be upset if
their son or daughter married

01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:16.450
a member of the other
political party.

01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:21.400
Now, in 2010, the number
was 49% of Republicans

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.420
and 33% of Democrats
who felt that way.

01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:27.050
So I don't want
to get political,

01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:32.980
but I want to say this is not
just a both sides problem.

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.860
The radicalization
of American politics

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:38.350
has not been symmetrical.

01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:41.440
There are forces and
leaders in our country

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.340
who blatantly incite people
with hateful rhetoric, who

01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:49.630
stoke fear of change, who see
the world in zero-sum terms

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:53.890
so that if others are
gaining, then everyone else

01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:55.810
must be losing.

01:37:55.810 --> 01:38:00.790
So that is a recipe for
polarization and conflict.

01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:03.610
And I do believe that
healing our country

01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:06.820
will take what I call
radical empathy--

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:10.900
reaching across the
divides of race, class,

01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:15.070
but mostly politics to try to
see the world through the eyes

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:18.070
of people very
different from ourselves

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:20.980
and to try to return
to rational debate,

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:24.760
to find a way to disagree
without being disagreeable,

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.570
to recapture a sense
of common humanity.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:32.620
When we think about politics
and judge our leaders,

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:37.510
we can't just ask, am I better
off than I was four years ago?

01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:40.870
We should also ask,
are we all better off?

01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:45.370
Are we as a country better,
stronger, and fairer?

01:38:45.370 --> 01:38:47.590
And empathy should not
only be at the center

01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:51.050
of our individual lives, our
families, and our communities

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:53.890
but at the center of our
public life, our policies,

01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:56.140
and our politics.

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.890
I know we don't think
of politics and empathy

01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:02.410
as going hand in
hand these days.

01:39:02.410 --> 01:39:03.700
But they can, and they must.

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:07.540
As Madeleine writes
in her new book,

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:12.580
"this generosity of spirit,
this caring about others

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:16.711
and about the proposition
that we are all created equal

01:39:16.711 --> 01:39:21.160
is the single most
effective antidote

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.970
to the self-centered
moral numbness

01:39:24.970 --> 01:39:28.460
that allows fascism to thrive."

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:32.560
So in addition to the
kinds of resilience

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.640
that have been on my mind and
that I've been talking about,

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.660
I'm also very focused on
democratic resilience.

01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:44.560
You all remember-- in 1787 after
the Constitutional Convention

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.140
in Philadelphia,
Benjamin Franklin

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.420
was asked by a
woman in the street

01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:54.040
outside Independence Hall,
well, Doctor, what have we got?

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.320
A republic or a monarchy?

01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.780
And Franklin answered, a
republic if you can keep it.

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.990
So right now, we are
living through a crisis

01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:06.700
in our democracy.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.040
There certainly are not
tanks in the street,

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:12.160
but what's happening
today goes to the heart

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.570
of who we are as a nation.

01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:16.390
And I say this not
as a Democrat who

01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:19.270
lost an election but
as an American afraid

01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:21.850
of losing a country.

01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:23.440
And there are
certain things that

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:28.900
are so essential they
must transcend politics.

01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:32.710
Waging a war on the rule
of law and a free press,

01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:36.670
delegitimizing elections,
perpetuating corruption,

01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:39.550
rejecting the idea
that our leaders should

01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:43.720
be public servants,
undermining our national unity,

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.810
and attacking truth and reason--

01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:48.010
these should alarm
us all, whether we're

01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:51.130
Republicans, Democrats,
Independents, vegetarians,

01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:53.530
whoever we might be.

01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:58.480
And attempting to erase the line
between fact and fiction, truth

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.960
and an alternative
reality is a core feature

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.390
of authoritarianism.

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:07.780
The goal is to make us
question logic and reason

01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:11.980
and sow mistrust toward
exactly the people I

01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:14.080
think we need to rely on--

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.110
our leaders, the
press, experts who

01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:21.670
seek to guide public policy
based on evidence, ultimately,

01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:23.830
ourselves.

01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:26.620
Now, just last week,
former Secretary of State

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:31.090
Rex Tillerson said,
"if our leaders seek

01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:35.350
to conceal the truth or we
as people become accepting

01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:37.900
of alternative realities
that are no longer grounded

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:42.700
in facts, then we as
Americans are on a pathway

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:45.860
to relinquishing our freedom."

01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:50.620
Perhaps a tad late, but
he's absolutely right.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.870
So how do we build
democratic resilience?

01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:55.000
Well, Maura and I talked
a little bit about that.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.180
It does begin with standing
up for the truth, facts,

01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.620
and reason--

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.720
not only in the
classroom and on campus,

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.740
but every day in our lives.

01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.100
And it means speaking
out about the vital role

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:10.450
of higher education in our
society to create opportunity

01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:12.010
and equity.

01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:16.150
It means calling out actual
fake news when we see it

01:42:16.150 --> 01:42:20.010
and supporting brave
journalism and reporting--

01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:22.030
and yes, subscribing
to a newspaper.

01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:23.920
Remember those?

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.290
Most of all, as
obvious as it seems,

01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:29.710
it means voting in
every election, not just

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:31.900
the presidential ones.

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:35.500
We've come through
challenging times before,

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.720
and it's not easy to wade
back into the fight every day.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.500
But that's exactly
what we must do.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:47.950
And finally, that's why I am
optimistic about the future--

01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:52.660
because of how unbelievably
tough we are proving to be.

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:55.270
I've encountered many
people in recent months

01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:56.680
who give me hope--

01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:00.730
the students in Parkland,
now the students in Santa Fe,

01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:04.120
many people in communities
who have responded

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.400
with courage and resolve.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.880
And the leaders and
groups that I'm supporting

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:13.840
have given me a
real rush of hope.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.180
Because when I started
it after the election,

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.530
it was to help support
this rush of activity

01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:25.210
from the grassroots level
to encourage the outpouring

01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:28.690
of that engagement--

01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:32.710
so everyone who is marching,
registering voters, diving

01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:35.440
into the issues facing
us like never before--

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:39.430
some for the first
time in their lives,

01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:41.440
the leaders here at
the Radcliffe Institute

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.990
doing cutting-edge
research bringing together

01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:47.470
some of the brightest minds in
the world to discuss and debate

01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:49.090
big ideas.

01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:53.410
And yes, I find hope in the
wave of women running for office

01:43:53.410 --> 01:43:55.030
and winning.

01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:58.090
And I find hope in
the women and men

01:43:58.090 --> 01:44:01.090
who are dismantling
the notion that women

01:44:01.090 --> 01:44:05.478
should have to endure harassment
and violence as a part of life.

01:44:05.478 --> 01:44:13.470
[APPLAUSE]

01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:16.080
So, yes, I know there
are many fights to fight,

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.420
and more seem to
arise every day.

01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.670
And it will take work
to keep up the pressure

01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:23.280
and to stay vigilant
to neither close

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:27.240
our eyes nor numb our
hearts or throw up our hands

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:30.240
and say, someone else
take over from here.

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:34.260
But there has not been a time--
certainly in 50 years and maybe

01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.360
not even for longer than that--

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.680
where our country depends
on every citizen believing

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.620
in the power of
your actions, even

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.850
when that power is invisible
and your efforts feel like you

01:44:47.850 --> 01:44:51.120
are in an uphill battle--

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.470
and yes, voting, even
when your side loses.

01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:59.640
It comes down to be really
a matter of infinite faith.

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.960
So pace ourselves.

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:02.070
Lean on each other.

01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:04.170
Look for the good
wherever we can.

01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:05.550
Celebrate the heroes.

01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:07.140
Encourage children.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:10.260
Find ways to disagree
respectfully.

01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:14.310
Be ready to lose some
fights, but don't quit.

01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:16.410
As John McCain
recently reminded us,

01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:20.820
no just cause is futile,
even if it's lost.

01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:23.830
What matters is
that we keep going.

01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:27.300
So no matter what,
think about our children

01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:30.210
and our grandchildren
who are counting on us.

01:45:30.210 --> 01:45:34.770
And think, too, that our country
and the world are as well.

01:45:34.770 --> 01:45:36.838
Thank you so much,
Radcliffe and Harvard.

01:45:36.838 --> 01:46:00.242
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:00.242 --> 01:46:00.742
- OK.

01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:07.410
I just want to say,
I want to thank

01:46:07.410 --> 01:46:10.170
Secretary Clinton one
more time for this really

01:46:10.170 --> 01:46:12.360
remarkable, inspiring day.

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.000
I want to thank Nick
and our panelists who

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:19.650
were incredibly stimulating and
gave us so much to think about.

01:46:19.650 --> 01:46:22.650
And I want to thank all of
you for coming and making

01:46:22.650 --> 01:46:26.010
this historic Radcliffe
day so memorable.

01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:28.290
So on to the future.

01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:29.030
- Yes, onward!

01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:31.180
