Eric Schmidt with

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.670
Secretary Julian Castro
January 7, 2016

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.929
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, good morning. Good morning,
everyone.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.471
You don't have to say "good morning" back.
It's not class.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.449
Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to
have the secretary with us. And I wanted to

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.141
remind everybody that this is a public event
and there's members of the press in the audience.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.590
So folks who have questions, be aware of that.
I thought we should start by welcoming you

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.210
back to Palo Alto and Stanford; right?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: That's right. First

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.690
of all, thank you, Eric, for having me. It's
great to be here at Google. And I was telling

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.460
you and some of the folks that every time
I get back here and the weather is like this,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.730
I wonder why I didn't stay in the first place.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I had a different question,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.239
you graduated in 1996?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: That's right.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.659
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So had you joined Google as
it was founded?

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.750
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: I'd have a lot nicer
car today for sure.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.039
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So you went from Stanford
-- basically, you grew up in Texas, and you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.679
went --
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: In San Antonio.

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.659
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Which surprisingly, you went
back to. So I want to explore that.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.630
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Surprisingly? That's
the best place in the world.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.829
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right? Good.
You went from -- and I'm joking, obviously.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.270
We went from -- you went from Stanford to
Harvard. Right?

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.289
So how do you go from San Antonio, Hispanic
family, you know, to Stanford, to Harvard?

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.409
Is that why you've ultimately -- you're one
of the youngest political rising leaders in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.749
our country, one of the fastest-rising political
leaders. Did you know that you were going

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.859
to become a political leader?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: You know, oddly enough,

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.880
it was at Stanford when I went -- because
I grew up, my brother, Joaquin and I, I have

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.200
a twin brother, Joaquin. And he says the way
to tell us apart is I'm a minute uglier than

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.039
he is. I'm actually a minute older. We went
through the public schools of San Antonio.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.819
And my mother had been very active in the
old Chicano movement, the Mexican-American

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.260
civil rights movement of the late '60s and
early '70s. We grew up mostly with my mother

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.030
and grandmother. We both got scholarships
to get to Stanford.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650
We had never seen the campus. It was the second
time that we'd ever been on an airplane. And

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.970
I remember that we got there on I think it
was Wednesday, September 23rd, 1992, because

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.510
Stanford's on a quarter system, they always
start late. When I got to Stanford, it was

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.480
the first time that I had ever really been
away from San Antonio. And I could see the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.230
city with different eyes. I had gone to a
school that -- a high school that was probably

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.849
85% Mexican-American, not very diverse. Obviously,
a much more diverse community, people from

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.790
all over the United States and over three
dozen countries.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.640
And I could compare what was good and what
needed improvement in my community. So, you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.349
know, the -- what needed improvement was,
in the Bay Area, you had a place that was

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.469
-- had better education levels, better income
levels, more innovative, ready for the future.

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:31.939
In San Antonio, it was a city of about a million
people, a wonderful place to raise a family.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.159
A place where people of different backgrounds
had generally gotten along well together.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.120
And the way that I've always described it
is, it was a big city where if two people

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.120
passed each other on the street downtown,
they still look each other in the eye. There's

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.930
not that disconnection that often happens
as communities get bigger and bigger.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:03.019
So my interest in politics and going into
public service came out of how could you combine

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.569
the best of that to have.
a community that was innovative and had good

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.989
income levels and education levels, ready
for the future, entrepreneurial, but also

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.980
had a good character to it?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: But when you went to Harvard,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.840
you -- you know, in -- because at the time,
obviously, you were a fantastic student, also

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.480
a minority relative to the dominant white
culture, you would have easily gone and become

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.500
very, very successful in the conventional
world, corporate world.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.990
What was it that made you go back? You went
back to San Antonio, right, to your hometown.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:47.220
Again, you're incredibly young. You're the
youngest councilman, the youngest mayor. You're

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.870
elected. You run, you lose narrowly. You then
win again. And you're only, like, 32.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.760
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: 34, yeah.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.440
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And people said -- listen
to him.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.930
And people say -- by the way, he looks 22.
Right?

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.080
So there must be something in your sense of
mission that you're trying to do.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.030
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah. Because I --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And in San Antonio, you were

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.040
seen as one of the most innovative mayors
in the country at an age where you're 20 years

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.340
younger than everybody else.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: What was burning inside

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.680
me was that I felt very, very blessed in my
own life to have this great opportunity of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.410
going to college and going to law school.
I grew up with a grandmother who had dropped

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.920
out in elementary school. And she worked as
a maid, a cook, and a baby-sitter her whole

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.190
life. And she raised my mother as a single
parent. And my mom actually had had the chance

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.460
to go and graduate from high school and go
on to college.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.030
And I felt as though by going back to San
Antonio, that I could make a contribution

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.070
in public service to make sure that more people
that were growing up like me could actually

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.250
have the opportunity to go to college and
then pursue their own American dream. And

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.580
that's pretty much what drove me.
In my first two summers, as you know, the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.340
traditional thing in law school is that folks
will go and be a summer associate somewhere.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.770
So I actually -- after the first summer, I
actually went back to San Francisco and I

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.740
was a summer associate at Baker &amp; McKenzie,
which was sometimes referred to as the McDonald's

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.740
at that time of law firms, because they had
something like 60 different offices all over

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.450
the world.
And the second year, my brother and I were

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.400
at Akin Gump and at Vinson &amp; Elkins back in
Texas. And then when we graduated from law

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.820
school, we both went back and were at Akin
Gump for a while before we pursued our public

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.380
service careers.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So at this point, you're sufficiently

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.510
successful as the mayor that you get on the
sort of interesting national character list

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:49.540
that the sort of White House is working on.
And you get involved in their programs. And

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.110
then you become one of the youngest appointments
at the national level in the Obama administration,

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:01.500
as secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
Can you summarize for us what the problems

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.770
in housing and urban development are? Because
they strike me as sort of overwhelming.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:12.330
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah. I mean, it's
fair to say that they are very, very significant.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:18.700
They're massive. I saw this both as a mayor
and now even more so as HUD secretary.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:25.500
To begin with, we have a rental affordable
crisis out there. A few months ago, the National

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:33.270
Low-Income Housing Coalition put out a piercing
study that said basically that there isn't

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:39.070
a single community in the United States of
any size where if you're working full-time,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.860
minimum wage, you can afford the rent on a
two-bedroom apartment. And very, very few

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.760
places where you can afford the rent on even
a one-bedroom apartment.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.270
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So how do people make it?
How do they get by in this situation?

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.940
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: What folks are doing
right now is that you have an unprecedented

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.900
number of families who are paying more than
a third of their income in rent. Rent is taking

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:09.300
up, eating up more and more of their income.
Or they're doubling up. Or, of course, in

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.860
our country, we still do have a significant
challenge with homelessness. Although the

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.110
president has shown great leadership on that.
Homelessness since 2010 has been trending

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.090
downward. There are cities where it's going
in the opposite direction. But in general,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.780
it has been going down.
So you have that affordable crisis. The home

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.930
ownership rate in the United States right
now is at a four-decade low. Obviously, we

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:40.190
went through the housing crisis. And if the
story ten years ago, in 2005, was that it

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:46.030
was too easy to get a home loan, the story
today is that oftentimes for middle-class

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:53.810
families, for folks who have an average credit
score but who would be responsible, they can't

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.640
get a home loan. It's too tough.
And lending to minority communities is at

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.300
a 13- or 14-year low.
So you combine those two things of less home

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:12.990
ownership, more people competing in the rental
market, and it adds up to a massive challenge

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:18.940
in terms of affordable and housing opportunity.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And -- so what are the solutions

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.300
that you would like to see?
My understanding of sort of the HUD that you've

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:30.280
inherited is, because you have a Republican
Congress, there's not much that can be changed

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:36.060
in the sense of financial allocation, the
rules that you've been given in the few years

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.650
that you've been able to be at HUD. In other
words, your degrees of freedom of fixing this

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:46.090
are lower than it might appear to an outsider,
because you can't get the money moved around

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:46.620
and things like that.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.260
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Is that true?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Let's start with a

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:57.070
baseline of, we need more resources to be
invested in affordable housing. And because

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:04.260
you have a fairly conservative Congress, we're
not getting the kind of resources that -- to

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.210
meet that demand.
Also, at HUD, HUD as a department has been

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.760
more and more stressed or burdened over time.
To give you an example of that, the day that

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.840
Reagan walked into the Oval Office in January
of 1981, HUD had over 16,000 employees.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.560
Today, it has about 8,000 employees. So it's
been cut in half. So this idea that you hear

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.190
that people think that every department of
the federal government has just run amok and

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:37.980
it's growing, that's not true.
So that's a baseline.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:43.450
However, that doesn't mean that we're powerless.
That means that we do have to be more innovative.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.480
It means that you have to make the resources
stretch further. It also means, frankly -- and

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.180
I saw this as a mayor -- that at the state
level and at the local level, that what ends

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.100
up happening is that states and localities
end up taking up more of the slack.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:02.590
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: There's a large amount of
public housing, often very old, in America.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.590
Do you manage that? Or is it managed by the
cities and states, with money that you give

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.510
them?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: It's managed by public

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.550
housing authorities.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.820
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: And there are over
3,000 public housing authorities out there,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.470
from public housing authorities that are rural
and very small, to a housing authority like

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:24.130
San Francisco or Chicago that have thousands
and thousands of units under their jurisdiction.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.370
But it's federal money.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: 'Cause one of those things

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:33.779
I wanted to explore as part of why you're
here is, we -- you suggested, and we have

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:39.100
entered into a partnership with a number of
other companies to try to get -- I would just

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.940
describe -- I'm going to use the word "public
housing" because I don't know how better to

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:48.610
describe it -- connected. Can we sort of go
through why that's important. Why isn't it

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:53.440
obviously already occurring?
You know, what are the roadblocks?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.590
Why have you made this -- I think this is
one of your signature campaigns in the White

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.790
House.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah. You know, I got

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:10.820
the call from President Obama asking whether
I'd be interested in this role on April 16th,

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.310
2014. And I remember that because it's not
every day that the president calls you, asking

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:21.300
if you want a job. Unless some of y'all have
that experience. I don't.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:27.170
And the first thing that I thought about was
what we could do to help -- and let me be

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:33.260
very explicit -- I don't believe that helping
is a dirty word. That if you do it right in

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:39.300
government, that that's something that's positive.
But how we could help folks who live in public

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:47.400
housing, where the median household income
is about $12,500, how we could help them become

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.860
more upwardly mobile and get out of public
housing.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.260
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: How does somebody live on
$12,500?

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:57.089
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: I mean, they're getting
a very significant subsidy of their housing

00:12:57.089 --> 00:13:04.450
cost. Oftentimes, maybe other subsidies.
That includes also senior citizens who are

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:13.420
on social security. And so, you know.
And I believe that, basically, that brainpower

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.270
is the new currency of success in the 21st
century global economy, and that for America

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.670
to be as competitive as possible, we need
to ensure that everyone, up and down the income

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:32.110
scale, and particularly young people, have
21st-century tools to compete in the job market.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.860
And that over half of the folks who are low
income and the vast majority of people who

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:44.779
live in public housing don't have Internet
access or in some cases the community is wired

00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:47.800
or, in theory, they could have it, but then
they can't afford it.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.680
So either way, they're not reaping the benefits
of being connected right now.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:14:00.339
So ConnectHome is a pilot project to connect
28 communities, 27 cities and one tribal community,

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:05.260
of folks who live in public housing to the
Internet. And we're very proud of that effort,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:11.740
very proud of Google Fiber's role in the effort.
You all have been fantastic.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:16.550
And at the end of the day, we want to do two
things. Number one, we want to ensure that

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.930
folks get that access, they get connected.
And secondly, we want to be able to measure

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:27.160
what difference that makes in their lives.
Because as you all know, it's not enough to

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.529
just connect them. We need to get more rigorous
about being able to demonstrate the impact

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:39.020
in their lives that that makes.
And ultimately, the long-term goal is that

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:46.930
we see more of those kids who are going to
be connected that do better on their third-grade

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.880
math and reading tests, that are more likely
to graduate from high school, that are more

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:57.310
likely to go on to college, and, hopefully,
into companies like Google and others, and

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:03.420
to reach their dreams, and that that connection
will have been one small part of that.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.820
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What I remember when you first
called on this was the observation that many

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:14.660
of these housing units are reasonably dense,
they're reasonably vertical. So they're particularly

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.320
amenable to a shared service, running a fiber
line. You can serve it with -- very many -- very

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.310
many, many people very, very efficiently.
It's sort of a no-brainer as a public act

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:32.050
for corporations and you guys to sort of make
this happen. And the benefits are very quick.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:37.320
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Absolutely. And as
you all know, you're partnering with ConnectHome

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.220
in several cities. And, by the way, I want
to say a big thank you to Google Fiber. Today

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:49.459
we learned that they're going to be connecting
the residents in Kansas City, the public housing

00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:54.170
residents that they're serving to gigabit
service for free, which is a great victory

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.830
for that community in Kansas City.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We're very, very proud of

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.560
that.
And, you know, once you -- the simple rule

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.600
about fiber is, once you've got it in place,
it's just a godsend; right? Because the bandwidth

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.940
is there, the service is there. You just have
to get these things wired.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.610
And one of our biggest projects is making
sure that the sort of local regulatory municipal

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:19.760
barriers that get in the way of doing that,
right, for whatever historic reason, are sort

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.890
of eliminated. And your organization has helped
that throughout the cities.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:30.830
We're now up to, let's see, 20 additional
cities in six Metro areas that we're now designing

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:37.330
for. We're very operational in Kansas City
and in Provo and in Austin. Right? So it really

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.480
is working.
And our strategy is, of course, you know a

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.060
national strategy, where we're in this for
the long run.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:49.170
Do you think -- what I can never tell with
programs like ConnectHome is, is it likely

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:56.000
to become a truly national program over a
decade? In other words, it looks to us like

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.480
this is going to be hugely successful in the
30 or so. But there's a lot more than 30.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.870
How do we get to 1,000 and 3,000?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: I believe that it will

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:12.449
scale. And my goal is that by the time we
walk out of there, on January 20th of 2017,

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:17.949
I would like for us to be able to say that
we have commitments so that every single household

00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:23.569
in public housing will be connected.
I do believe that that can happen.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:29.539
You have a number of partners who have been
committed to ConnectHome. And I know that

00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:33.529
we and others will keep prodding everybody
to try and get there.

00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:38.519
And then after that, you know, there's HUD
assisted housing that's mixed-income housing.

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:45.869
And so there's a base that we're working from.
And I think the drive to grow it. And so I

00:17:45.869 --> 00:17:52.200
am confident that it'll become much stronger
than 28 communities.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:58.769
Let me also just say, Eric, that, you know
-- and I saw this as mayor when we started

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:04.929
thinking about Google Fiber there in San Antonio,
that you can see these fascinating issues

00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:10.239
that present themselves with sort of the new
economy and the old economy and how that interacts

00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:15.590
with public law-making at the local level,
the state level, and the federal level. And

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:20.320
the use of poles, for instance, and the battles
that you all have had in different communities

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.110
around that is a very good example of that.
Tesla in its battle with the car dealers in

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:30.340
state legislatures -- you all know this one,
of course. Usually, you have as to go through

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:35.249
a dealership at the state level to sell a
car in many places. Tesla can only have a

00:18:35.249 --> 00:18:40.149
car there, it's almost like a show piece,
like a museum, you can only go see it. They

00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:46.480
can't even set up a sale.
Another one is Uber and Lyft and all of the

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.529
issues surrounding that and regulation at
the local level.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:57.039
,And then these craft brewers and their ability
to distribute versus the beer distributors.

00:18:57.039 --> 00:19:03.489
So what you see is this fascinating intersection
of the new economy and disruptive technologies

00:19:03.489 --> 00:19:11.100
and I think the way that local government,
state government, and federal government is

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:17.570
sort of doing a head-spinning and trying to
figure out how to respond. I think maybe the

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:23.820
best thing that comes from the work that you
all do and others do is helping to educate

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:30.220
public policymakers on how we should take
in these things as they change and understand

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:37.169
systems differently and not be afraid to regulate
in a different way, or in some cases, not

00:19:37.169 --> 00:19:38.379
regulate at all.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right.

00:19:38.379 --> 00:19:39.710
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Because things have
changed.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.139
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We would certainly take the
position that more -- that allowing a space

00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:50.259
for innovation, right, is key. Because innovation
is how companies are formed, jobs are created,

00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:53.940
wealth is created. And you can imagine there
are plenty of problems in cities that can

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:59.649
be solved if the space were -- the legal space
allowed for a local innovator to create a

00:19:59.649 --> 00:20:04.590
company to solve this particular problem.
When I was much younger, there was a fear

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:10.580
about strong mayors. And in the last couple
of decades, there's been a sort of view that

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.059
the government was relatively dysfunctional
unless you had a strong mayor. And we went

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:19.980
through a period of what I would argue was
a strong mayor. But you were a strong mayor.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:26.700
In the internal politics of these cities,
why is the mayor -- it's a simple question,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.929
but why is the mayor's power important and
how is it exercised? As you know, cities can

00:20:31.929 --> 00:20:34.340
be understood as the innovation engines now
in America.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.690
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Well, it's important
because leadership at the top, I think, whether

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:44.869
it's in a company or at one of these levels
of government, where the leader is focused

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:50.090
is oftentimes what's going to move the organization
and where the attention of the organization

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:58.700
is. And the position of mayor is important,
and a mayor has strength or doesn't have strength,

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:04.309
I think, basically by a couple of things.
Number one, whether they have the votes with

00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:07.899
the people they serve with on the city council
to actually get something done. Because at

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:13.700
the end of the day, that's the body that makes
policy decisions. And whether they're effective

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:21.070
in the organization in getting that organization
to execute well.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:26.409
And those two things, I think, are really
what add up to whether someone is successful

00:21:26.409 --> 00:21:29.999
or not successful in that office.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: But I think for our audience

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:37.629
here, people are often very, very confused
about why problems -- engineers often get

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:41.500
confused about politics, because engineers
are rational and politics is often irrational.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.120
[ Laughter ]
It's -- sorry.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.369
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Is that a comment about

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:49.570
the 2016 election cycle?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We're going to get to that.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.429
I'm going to compare you to Marco Rubio.
The --

00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:55.889
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: I'm not wearing boots
today, so --

00:21:55.889 --> 00:22:03.299
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: If we talk about the Bay Area,
you've got enormous wealth, enormous creativity,

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:07.909
many people would say that the financial results
for the stock market for the last year have

00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:12.940
largely been tech-driven. Right, there's a
lot of reasons to think that this area in

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.940
particular is a jewel. And yet we have these
crippling housing problems and crippling transportation

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.539
problems. And I don't need to tell anyone
here in the audience how difficult this has

00:22:22.539 --> 00:22:27.779
become.
Why are these problems not fixable? In other

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:31.789
words, it's pretty obvious to me that if you
had a bunch of people in a room and said we've

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:36.570
got lots of smart people coming in, lots of
people who are being dislocated in housing.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.309
We need more affordable housing, we need more
of this and more of that and so forth.

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:43.239
Why does it not work that way?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Well, it doesn't work

00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:49.809
that way for -- I agree with you that it ought
to be able to work that way. And I do think

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:54.119
that we can get closer than we are.
But let's just take the issue of housing in

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:57.509
San Francisco. Right? I imagine there are
a lot of folks in this room that are dealing

00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:04.049
with that. Or in any other city that is a
hot market.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:11.169
It doesn't work in a linear fashion because
people who represent different areas and different

00:23:11.169 --> 00:23:18.639
interests get pressure. Then sometimes they
listen to that pressure in a proportionate

00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:23.090
way, and sometimes they listen to that Flash
a disproportionate way.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:29.220
Why can't we build more affordable housing
in many areas? Because you get a lot of NIMBYism.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:36.480
I saw this every week in San Antonio. Someone
wanted to come in and create more density.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.720
Then you'd have all these folks line in this
front of the city council and say, no way.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.169
Keep this -- and I'm going to vote against
you if you vote for this.

00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:51.720
And for that elected official making that
one decision, right, and not oftentimes putting

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:58.330
it all together, because they all add up,
you know, are you going to make 200 people

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.619
angry? And for what, in their mind?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Do you think that the higher

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:07.409
levels of government, so the state or federal
government, should play a more directive role

00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:12.669
to support growth and development of, for
example, housing in general, transportation

00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:17.669
in general, affordable housing? Or are you
more in favor of letting the local authorities,

00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:22.269
mayors primarily, sort this out with the concomitant
issues that you're well familiar with?

00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:26.289
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Let me say that I do
believe there are a lot of places where mayors

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:30.840
and councils and county commissions are doing
a lot of innovative work and good work and

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.279
creating more affordable housing opportunities.
But you always have that political reality,

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:43.149
too, that sometimes cuts against that grain.
The -- generally, the posture has been to

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:48.759
deliver resources to local communities and
as much as possible, to let those local communities

00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:52.159
determine how they're going to spark greater
housing opportunity.

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:57.350
The best example of this are two of our bread-and-butter
programs, which are Community Development

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:05.609
Block Grants, it's a 41-year-old program now,
CDBG, and HOME funding, which started in 1992.

00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:10.529
And these are block grants to local communities
and states that gives them a lot of flexibility

00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:15.019
on how they use this money.
So you might have one community that is using

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:24.029
that money mostly to rehab elderly housing
and another that is using that as gap financing

00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:27.629
to create more affordable housing, but it
runs the gamut.

00:25:27.629 --> 00:25:31.090
Now, let me give you an example of something
that I'm telling mayors more and more these

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:35.109
days.
We're saying, because CDBG is often the largest

00:25:35.109 --> 00:25:40.149
allocation of money that they get, cities
get from HUD. We're saying, look, what we

00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:45.019
see out there is that we need more housing.
We need more affordable housing. And at the

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:52.929
same time, only about 29% of CDBG money is
being used directly for housing. They're using

00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:56.580
it for infrastructure projects. Because it's
flexible.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:02.009
Is it -- I'm saying, mayor X or Y or Z, you
know that you have an affordability issue

00:26:02.009 --> 00:26:07.779
in your city, and yet at the same time, you're
doling out one million dollars here for this

00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:14.409
project, for another project instead of using
those resources in a focused way on housing.

00:26:14.409 --> 00:26:20.229
And so to get back to one of my original points,
yes, we need more resources. That's definitely

00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:24.739
a big part of the story. But we also need
to be as smart as possible about the resources

00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:28.859
that are there and that we do have.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I think as we sort of finish

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:33.450
and move to audience questions, I do want
to talk to you a bit about the political landscape.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:41.799
You're often mentioned as a very significant
future leader on the Democratic side. You

00:26:41.799 --> 00:26:44.739
are -- have been, in fact, compared to Marco
Rubio.

00:26:44.739 --> 00:26:53.419
I've never quite understood in a Hispanic
context the politics on the Hispanic side.

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:57.109
Presumably, a Hispanic candidate would be
in favor of immigration, legalization, and

00:26:57.109 --> 00:27:04.659
so forth and so on. Can you sort of dissect
what's going on for somebody who's not Hispanic,

00:27:04.659 --> 00:27:09.109
sort of explain, how do the politics work?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: It's a good question,

00:27:09.109 --> 00:27:13.399
you know. And my perspective on it was first
informed, of course, by growing up in a city

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:22.229
that was 60% Hispanic, mostly Mexican-American,
and now having served as mayor, and then now

00:27:22.229 --> 00:27:28.320
at a national level getting to visit communities
like Florida and like northern Virginia that

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:36.249
are Hispanic but very diverse, people from
all over Latin America.

00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:43.109
The Hispanic community generally leans Democratic.
In 2012, you know, everybody knows that about

00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:51.690
just over 70% voted for President Obama. At
the same time, there are pockets of Hispanics,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:57.359
particularly in places like Florida and Cuban-Americans
and especially the older generation of Cuban-Americans,

00:27:57.359 --> 00:28:02.779
and in some places of Texas that have leaned
Republican.

00:28:02.779 --> 00:28:08.519
And so what you have in Marco Rubio and Ted
Cruz I think are two good examples of folks

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:14.399
from a Hispanic community that generally had
leaned Republican. That is changing. In fact,

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:19.659
2012 was a breakthrough year because the president
actually won more than 50% of the Hispanic

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:25.849
vote in Florida and a large percentage of
the Cuban-American vote.

00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:31.690
But I think that often there's this disconnect
in the media centers of the United States.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:36.999
And I'm thinking especially of New York. I
don't think that they get, oftentimes, the

00:28:36.999 --> 00:28:44.679
diversity of the Hispanic community in and
of itself, whether that's culturally or politically.

00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:51.599
I also think it's true that the Democratic
party can't, you know, -- cannot forever just

00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:57.109
count on getting the Hispanic vote. I have
seen that in Texas, you know. I saw when George

00:28:57.109 --> 00:28:59.580
Bush ran for governor in '94 and '98 and when
he ran for president.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.590
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Very popular.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah. He got about

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:08.639
40% of the vote.
So it's possible.

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:13.090
The problem that Republicans have is not the
personalities, because they have Cruz and

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:18.389
Rubio, and they have Susana Martinez and Governor
Sandoval in Nevada. The problem is, their

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:23.720
politics is their policies. They've gone crazy
on immigration. They've gone way out there

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:29.279
to the right. On tax policy, on education
policy, on just about all of the bread-and-butter

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:33.700
issues, the kitchen table issues that matter
to the Hispanic community, they're way to

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.679
the right. And I don't see from here to November
that they're going to be able to get back

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:43.659
in to the middle zone that I think would make
most Hispanics comfortable with them, even

00:29:43.659 --> 00:29:48.849
if they had somebody like Marco Rubio running
at the top of the ticket.

00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:52.739
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: No political conversation
is finished without bringing up Donald Trump's

00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:57.379
name.
So one theory of what's going on goes something

00:29:57.379 --> 00:30:03.070
like this: That many, many people have not
seen economic growth over the last decade.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:08.159
This is well established mathematically. And
there are many theories as to why this growth

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:15.169
and success has not occurred. One would be
immigrants taking your jobs. Anti-Muslim feelings,

00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:18.950
all those sorts of things. That can be argued
as a Trump position.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:22.649
Another one would be it's the banks and the
elites and the so forth. And that would be

00:30:22.649 --> 00:30:27.580
sort of the Sanders position. People are making
these arguments.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:33.889
And the core point in this argument is that
the elites, which most of us travel with,

00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:39.849
missed this anger, and that the anger is not
just exemplified by Trump, but exemplified

00:30:39.849 --> 00:30:44.309
by all of the candidates who are non-traditional,
right, non-mainstream candidates, which there

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:48.200
are in both parties.
Do you agree with that? You're a person who's

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.029
lived in both worlds; right? You grew up --
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Sure.

00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:55.970
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You grew up in a tough environment.
You went to the best schools and so forth.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.629
Do you believe the elites missed this? Do
you believe that there is a gap between, shall

00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:05.849
we say, the common person, the common person's
experience, which is exemplified by this rather

00:31:05.849 --> 00:31:09.479
odd politics as the elite like to describe
it, and the elites?

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:23.299
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: I believe that that
gap is growing. And I definitely believe that

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:29.299
there's a strong frustration there.
I vehemently disagree with what Trump has

00:31:29.299 --> 00:31:34.869
put forward as a solution. And I do agree
with those who have said that, basically,

00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:42.529
it's this boogeyman or shiny object politics
of sort of redirecting people's anger.

00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:47.519
I believe what we need to do more of is what
the president has focused on these last several

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:54.190
years, which is, you know, a plan for universal
pre-K. So people get started strong and are

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.109
able to graduate and go on and reach their
dreams.

00:31:57.109 --> 00:32:03.309
That we make community college free those
first two years and make college more affordable

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:08.369
and reduce student debt so that folks can
get on with prospering in their lives.

00:32:08.369 --> 00:32:12.599
That we make home ownership for responsible
families more accessible.

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:19.129
So, you know, at the end of the day, what
we need to do is to get back to the blueprint

00:32:19.129 --> 00:32:24.219
that gave us a strong middle class in the
United States. And that's what the president

00:32:24.219 --> 00:32:30.080
has been trying to do. And that's what I believe
that Secretary Clinton would do as well if

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.119
she were --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And you've endorsed her as

00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:33.580
a presidential candidate.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Sure.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.919
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Maybe we should move to questions
from the audience as well as we have some

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:44.200
submitted questions which we call the Dory.
So we can start with one. And if -- There's

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:52.799
a mic here as well.
The -- Let's see if I have my list here.

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:57.590
The most attractive Internet access option
for -- and I'm reading this from a submitted

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.960
question -- for disadvantaged families is
prepaid mobile broadband. What are the fundamental

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.469
reasons for its extremely high cost in the
U.S.? In my country of origin -- this person

00:33:06.469 --> 00:33:12.440
is not a U.S. person -- it costs less than
a tenth of what it does here. In other words,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.940
why does mobile broadband cost so much?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Number one, I have

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.940
a feeling there are probably three dozen people
that can answer that question better than

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.099
I can in this room.
[ Laughter ]

00:33:22.099 --> 00:33:30.969
However, I mean, let me say that I'll give
you a good example from my hometown of, I

00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:37.789
think -- you know, again, to go back to this
issue of the regulatory environment and how

00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:43.929
we can undo some of that in order to make
access more affordable.

00:33:43.929 --> 00:33:48.269
San Antonio is one of a number of cities that
has a municipal utility. We own a municipal

00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:54.570
utility. And at some point in the early '90s
or mid-'90s, they went out and built a fiber

00:33:54.570 --> 00:34:01.009
network, the municipal utility did. They built
this fiber network throughout the city or

00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:08.800
throughout their service area. In the late
1990s, the Texas legislature passed a statute

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:15.639
that said that cities that owned that kind
of fiber network could not provide -- use

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:22.169
it to provide Internet access to homes, to
their citizens. They could use it for a very

00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:23.539
--
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Really?

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:29.389
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: -- limited number of
things, and only for certain educational institutions,

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:33.589
like universities and libraries.
So you have this community, and it's not the

00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:41.159
only one, that is sitting on this fiber network
that's not able to use it to provide cheaper,

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:47.500
good Internet service.
Now, you could undo that statute to allow

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.539
them to contract with a company to go in there
and run that network.

00:34:53.539 --> 00:34:57.839
But I think that we need to find more ways
that we can lower the cost.

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:01.970
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: But was this just an industry
lobbying effort that -- I mean, sounds to

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.109
me like you have a municipal asset and people
are telling you you can't use it.

00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:08.230
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: It's a company that
shall go unnamed right now.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:13.589
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Not Google.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: No. It was not Google.

00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:19.490
But there was lobbying at the state level
to pass that kind of law. And that's a good

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.250
example, to me, of -- that we're not maximizing
our potential sometimes.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:28.730
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Next question is, FCC defiance
broadband as 25 megabits, giving close to

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:33.859
$10 billion of carriers to speed up deployment
of Internet service to rural America. ISPs

00:35:33.859 --> 00:35:38.950
are considered regional monopolies by many,
in other words, this questioner. Some states

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.809
are trying to ban municipal broadband.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah.

00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:46.130
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Can you make sense of this?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah, I mean, to go

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:51.220
to this point, from my experience in San Antonio,
that -- at least that case did not make a

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.160
lot of sense.
You know, I believe that we need all hands

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.890
on deck.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: To your knowledge, is it still

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.329
under this restriction?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: It is. Sure. Yeah.

00:36:00.329 --> 00:36:07.460
So when I was mayor, I sat on the CPS Energy
board. That has not changed. And it's not

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:12.490
the only community. I remember reading back
then of other communities in the United States.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:20.549
Not many had a network that was as developed
as San Antonio's, but there are some.

00:36:20.549 --> 00:36:24.980
I just think that we need all hands on deck
in terms of trying to make it more accessible

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.730
and more affordable for folks to get access.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Now, I'm reading -- yes, sir.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:33.450
We have a question. Let's go ahead.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Quick question. If you found yourself

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:37.890
to be the vice president of the United States
a year from now, A, how would you feel about

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.400
the opportunity, and, B, what are some of
the things you would look (indiscernible).

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.579
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: No. I appreciate the

00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:47.390
question and the confidence that you have
in me.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.980
[ Laughter ]
And thank you. However, you know, I'm trying

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:57.260
to do a good job at HUD. And, you know, just
-- I've seen many times in life that the best

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:03.510
way to make sure that you have a good future
is not to forget about your present, what's

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:08.510
in front of you right now. So I'm trying to
do a great job at HUD. And then whatever the

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.380
future brings, we'll see.
All right.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.319
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, sir.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you very much for being here.

00:37:14.319 --> 00:37:16.230
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Is that a Cal shirt
you have on?

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.029
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: It might be.
[ Applause ]

00:37:18.029 --> 00:37:21.920
I was thinking about taking it off, I thought
it will be fine.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.769
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: You all beat Navy the
other day.

00:37:24.769 --> 00:37:29.199
&gt;&gt;&gt; Air Force.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Air Force.

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:32.450
&gt;&gt;&gt; It was a great game.
My question is that you mentioned a little

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:37.270
bit earlier that sometimes cities, you know,
they have large funds allocated to them for

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.510
urban development projects and housing, but
a lot of times they don't use it for housing.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:47.549
And so I know that a lot of times the federal
government has requirements for states and

00:37:47.549 --> 00:37:51.260
cities that once they meet those requirements,
then they get the money. And it's generally

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.390
for a purpose like urban development, but
sometimes they can use it for other things.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:38:01.670
I was wondering if your department has considered
putting those requirements also on the money.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:07.710
Once you get it, here's what you have to do,
say, you know, maybe for ten years, you have

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.990
to use this for housing, and then that would
put a sizable dent in the problem.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.430
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: No. Thank you very
much for the question.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:18.849
So we do have a decent amount of money that
is more restricted in terms of that it has

00:38:18.849 --> 00:38:24.089
to be used for housing.
A lot of that money doesn't flow directly

00:38:24.089 --> 00:38:30.180
to cities; it goes to these public housing
authorities or states. Also, the treasury

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:36.510
has a very important and significant program,
the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. They administer

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:42.079
it, Treasury does, that goes to states. And
the states distribute those low-income housing

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:46.099
tax credits to local communities. And that's
just for affordable housing.

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:50.510
So, you know, I don't want to give the impression
that there's not any resources that are -- In

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:57.789
fact, most of the resources are more restricted.
However, the two big block grant programs,

00:38:57.789 --> 00:39:04.099
so to speak, are a little less so. And especially
-- I'm really thinking about Community Development

00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:09.290
Block Grants. Because home, it is shaped a
little bit more for housing.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.510
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, ma'am.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.420
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for joining us today
and for everything you do with HUD. Really

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:20.289
appreciate all the efforts you've made to
help people nationally, but so many of the

00:39:20.289 --> 00:39:25.799
communities that you are serving like through
ConnectHome, specialty minority communities.

00:39:25.799 --> 00:39:31.579
We talked about Google Fiber and the role
that can play. The other thing that affects

00:39:31.579 --> 00:39:35.760
them with mobile, knowing diverse communities
are more likely to buy a smartphone than any

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:42.750
other demographic, Latinos in particular.
Many tech companies are so quick to look to

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:47.270
other countries where we see a need, the next
billion users, something I know Eric is particularly

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:51.690
passionate about. And often, many of us who
come from communities like these think about

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:56.210
the need to look in our neighborhoods here.
When we think of innovation and thinking about

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:00.380
how can we possibly understand what it means
to come from a family that makes $12,500,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.799
that family probably has a smartphone or hopes
to have one as their first means of connecting

00:40:05.799 --> 00:40:08.440
to the Web.
So knowing all that, what are your thoughts

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.900
on the responsibility we have as Googlers
to better understand these communities and

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:16.240
develop for them?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: You know, it's a wonderful

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:22.319
question, and I know that you all are doing
some fantastic work in the Mission District

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:29.490
and other places to try and help communities
maximize their potential. And I believe that

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:35.289
there is a tremendous amount of low-hanging
fruit out there, and so many young people

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:42.430
that are growing up that have the potential
to be like y'all here, Googlers and folks

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:48.490
who have graduated from college and, you know,
reached your dreams or are reaching your dreams.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:56.039
And so how we figure out ways to scale being
able to improve their circumstances and their

00:40:56.039 --> 00:41:01.650
trajectory is fantastically important. And
so I'm glad that y'all are a part of that.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:07.369
You bring up an issue that I think, you know,
leads to a real irony, which is that especially

00:41:07.369 --> 00:41:13.960
for low-income communities, in public housing,
and communities of color that too oftentimes

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:23.359
are low income, they overuse technology in
many ways. You know, have a smartphone, use

00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:30.809
apps like Twitter and Facebook and Instagram.
And so you see that -- both that there is

00:41:30.809 --> 00:41:38.549
a market there that probably is being undertapped
a lot of times and that the private sector,

00:41:38.549 --> 00:41:44.140
I think, needs to gear itself even more toward
and focus on. I think there's a responsibility

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:50.500
there to enhance the number of folks who come
from those communities who are able to participate

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:58.589
in the success of companies. And I also believe
that in this 21st century, that as you look

00:41:58.589 --> 00:42:07.089
around the globe, that the United States finds
itself in this unprecedented competition for

00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:16.819
talent and brainpower with -- with nations
around the world that are producing tons of

00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:25.230
young people that are intelligent and talented
and tech-savvy. And we need to do our part

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:29.680
to make sure that we don't let any of that
potential go to waste.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.690
And so, you know, I applaud y'all for what
you're doing. And I hope that more of that

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:41.299
will happen and that Silicon Valley continues
to become more diverse. And I think that's

00:42:41.299 --> 00:42:46.170
going to be good not just for any one company
or for the industry, but for the United States

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.289
in making us more globally competitive in
this 21st century.

00:42:49.289 --> 00:42:55.390
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Diversity is a clear strength,
right, is the common message here.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:02.319
Another question from our electronic audience.
Homelessness in our cities is reaching epidemic

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:06.910
levels. In San Francisco, streets are lined
with tents and underpasses are filled with

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:11.730
them. Why isn't homelessness a federal issue?
These are citizens of the United States. The

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:16.170
federal government, and not cities, should
take full responsibility for their welfare.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:21.470
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Actually, the -- homelessness
very much is a federal issue. So in 2010,

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:26.480
the president laid out a blueprint for ending
homelessness in the United States called Opening

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.869
Doors. And it was significant because it was
the first presidential plan that didn't just

00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:36.130
say, we want to reduce homelessness. It said
we want to end homelessness. And the first

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:42.069
part of that was ending veteran homelessness.
So since 2010, veteran homelessness has gone

00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:50.670
down by 36%. Overall, homelessness has been
reduced by 11%, and with about a 17% reduction

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:56.400
in family homelessness. We've also seen a
reduction in chronic homelessness.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:04.990
So HUD delivers billions of dollars of resources
into what are called continuums of care that

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:14.730
are locally based partnerships of nonprofits
and governmental entities that deal with homelessness

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:23.089
and try and drive down those numbers. However,
even though we have seen that progress, it

00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:28.839
is very clear that especially in these West
Coast communities -- Seattle, Portland, San

00:44:28.839 --> 00:44:35.920
Francisco, Los Angeles -- that you have seen
a spike in the last 18 months, two years,

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.329
especially in unsheltered homeless.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right.

00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:40.769
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: People living on the
streets.

00:44:40.769 --> 00:44:48.730
So about five weeks ago, I joined the mayors
of Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and L.A.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:56.309
in Portland to talk about how we can be helpful.
We want to be proactive at HUD and help them

00:44:56.309 --> 00:45:02.930
as they address trying to get the growth in
homelessness under control because we very

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:07.970
much recognize that. But we do have a role
to play. We are playing that role, and not

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:14.289
just with money, but also helping them strategize
and getting a good system in place to drive

00:45:14.289 --> 00:45:16.450
down those numbers.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Right.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:19.269
Go ahead, yes, sir.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So -- thank you so much for being here

00:45:19.269 --> 00:45:22.599
and for the work you're doing. My question
speaks almost exactly to the previous question.

00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:29.369
But there was a lot of news coverage recently
about Utah's homelessness -- program to address

00:45:29.369 --> 00:45:33.000
homelessness. I think it was even covered
on "The Daily Show." And they described it

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.490
as basically their strategy is to provide
homes to the homeless. And they have seen

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:43.579
a lot of success. They say there are fewer
than 300 homeless people in the state of Utah

00:45:43.579 --> 00:45:49.630
at this point. I haven't heard a lot of comparisons
being drawn from the Utah program to federal

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.769
programs. And I guess I was just wondering
if you could talk about any lessons that you

00:45:52.769 --> 00:45:58.220
think could be learned from that specific
program and maybe why those lessons haven't

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:03.680
been applied nationally.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yes. So what you're

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.589
mentioning is something called Housing First.
So if you all think about public policy a

00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:15.309
lot of times, and especially as it leans sort
of center right, the idea that we have is

00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:21.079
that, okay, you show that you can take responsibility,
and then we're going to give you opportunity.

00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:26.640
Housing First flipped that on its head. It
used to be that we would have homeless folks,

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.769
you know, stay a certain number of nights
in a shelter, start going to an addiction

00:46:30.769 --> 00:46:34.690
counselor if they have an addiction or start
trying to look for a job if they're -- obviously,

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:38.720
if they're homeless, they're probably out
of a job.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.960
It flipped that on its head and said, no,
you know what? First we're going to put you

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:49.539
in permanent housing with supports. So somebody
that will help you try and find a job, help

00:46:49.539 --> 00:46:55.769
you address an addiction or other issue. But
we're going to give you the opportunity first

00:46:55.769 --> 00:47:02.349
and then stabilize you so that you can take
that responsibility. And there's a real lesson

00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:07.140
in that that we're trying to figure out, okay,
where else does that apply?

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.390
And the cities that have been most successful
in driving down their homelessness numbers

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.210
have been those cities that have been strongest
with Housing First.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:20.990
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: As a follow-up, do you -- I
imagine these are people where life just doesn't

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:27.069
work. So they have an addiction problem, they
have a health problem, a woman with children

00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:33.029
without a provider husband, and/or bad domestic
situation.

00:47:33.029 --> 00:47:39.359
Do you think that Housing First is a necessary
precondition to solving those problems? Because

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:42.990
often, my understanding of these people is
that they have compound problems, right? No

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.130
credit, criminal history, drug problem, you
know, whatever.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:51.440
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah. I would say that
that's shown itself to be the most effective.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:57.460
Because having housing stabilizes the individual
or the family so that they can then go address

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:02.359
those other issues, versus, you know, they're
having to sleep in a shelter or transitional

00:48:02.359 --> 00:48:11.700
living facility, and kind of address it -- address
their issues during the day and worrying about

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:16.109
where they're going to sleep at night, it's
not as effective that way. That's what the

00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:20.460
research has shown.
Salt Lake City and Utah in general have been

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:27.420
excellent in that regard. And so have a number
of other communities and states. In fact,

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:35.849
on Veterans Day, I was at the War Memorial
in Virginia, in Richmond, with Terry McAuliffe,

00:48:35.849 --> 00:48:42.480
celebrating that Virginia had become the first
state -- they call themselves a commonwealth,

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:49.940
I guess -- to effectively end veteran homelessness.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you just follow up real fast and say,

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.250
then, how is the federal government pushing,
given that we've seen that that's more successful,

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:56.529
to apply that everywhere?
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Yeah. So, I mean, that

00:48:56.529 --> 00:49:03.670
is what we're recommending for communities
all the time to do. And with our continuum

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:09.329
of care funding, we have favored that approach,
basically. Essentially, incentivized continuums

00:49:09.329 --> 00:49:15.009
of care around the nation to go with the Housing
First model. So we expect that in the years

00:49:15.009 --> 00:49:20.609
to come, as they get stronger at implementing
that, that we're going to see similar success.

00:49:20.609 --> 00:49:26.849
Let me just very quickly go back to the question
of San Francisco and L.A. and some of these

00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:31.680
communities that have high growth in unsheltered
populations.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:36.529
You know, there's still a need for transitional
living and shelters, and especially in communities

00:49:36.529 --> 00:49:40.750
that have an onslaught of folks living on
the streets. The fact is, you're not going

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:45.400
to find all of them permanent housing right
away. So you need an effective way to deal

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.259
with that.
One effective way, an example of that, is

00:49:48.259 --> 00:49:51.950
something called a navigation center in San
Francisco that I visited a couple of months

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:58.559
ago. It is transitional living, but they do
things a little bit differently than most

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:03.000
places. For instance, they let people go in
as couples into the shelter. And they let

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.839
folks take their pets. And maybe most importantly,
they still have an eye to getting folks to

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:11.900
more permanent housing, but they recognize
that's not going to happen right away.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.220
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Ma'am, you'll have the honor
of the last question.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.710
&gt;&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you so much.
As you know, we are facing a crisis of extreme

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:26.619
proportions around affordable housing here
in the Bay Area, and as is the case all across

00:50:26.619 --> 00:50:33.380
the country. And yet this is an issue that
has not risen to an issue of national debate.

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:37.619
How do we get this issue that is part of a
national debate, how do we get this issue

00:50:37.619 --> 00:50:43.539
to be translated from one that people see
as an individual issue, an individual responsibility,

00:50:43.539 --> 00:50:49.190
to one that is fundamental to our communities.
Our infrastructure, how we get to work, how

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:55.759
we go home at night and do our homework, how
we stay healthy, all aspects of our life are

00:50:55.759 --> 00:51:01.900
related to this issue of having a great home.
And yet this is not an issue that has adequate

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.990
resources. And we are facing a very extreme
situation here.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:11.450
I'm part of organizations that are doing affordable
housing advocacy in the Bay Area. We're facing

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:15.990
an uphill battle. And yet the solutions are
clear. We need more resources flowing.

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.269
Can you speak to some of those issues? And
thank you so very much.

00:51:18.269 --> 00:51:21.609
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Well, thank you for
the work that you and the organization are

00:51:21.609 --> 00:51:26.980
doing.
If we were to go and look at the transcripts

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:32.869
of the 2016 debates so far, I don't think
we'd find a single mention about housing.

00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:39.180
I don't even think we'd find a mention about
education so far. And so there is a -- there's

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:45.880
a disjuncture between what's being focused
on and what -- and the issues that intimately

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:51.920
impact the health, the well-being, and the
forward trajectory of families.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.440
And to your question of, okay, how do we get
this on the radar screen, I wish I had a better

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:04.490
answer than just to say that with regard to
housing specifically, people hear "affordable

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:10.049
housing," and they think, "Oh, that's poor
people." But the fact is that more and more

00:52:10.049 --> 00:52:15.099
middle-class families these days are dealing
with the issue of paying more than a third

00:52:15.099 --> 00:52:21.519
of their income in rent. And so that issue
is affecting so many more people on the spectrum,

00:52:21.519 --> 00:52:30.220
and folks that vote. So, like anything, it
depends on the activism of everyday Americans

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:35.049
to put that on the radar screen of people
running for city council and mayor, where

00:52:35.049 --> 00:52:41.630
a lot of the action on these things happen,
to state legislators, and, of course, federal

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:48.250
candidates.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I think you all see why I

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:55.759
wanted Secretary Castro to come.
I just -- I have not met very many political

00:52:55.759 --> 00:53:02.099
leaders today who have the kind of future
scale that you will have and the impact that

00:53:02.099 --> 00:53:06.589
you're going to have on America. I'm very
proud to be American, and I'm very proud that

00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:10.259
you're going to be one of our great future
and, of course, current leaders. Thank you

00:53:10.259 --> 00:53:11.329
so much for being here.
&gt;&gt;Sect. Julian Castro: Thank you. Appreciate

00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.829
it.
