00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.330
HERBERT GROSS: Hi, our topic
today sounds a little bit

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.870
naughty at first glance.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.860
It's called improper
integrals.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.780
And rather than give a long
speech about why they're

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.015
called improper, let me try and
start our lecture a little

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.370
bit different from our usual
approach, by giving you a

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.200
little bit of a mathematical
calculus riddle.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.010
Namely, let me just say this.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.110
We'll call our lecture today
improper integrals, and we'll

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.150
start off by saying
find the flaw.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.714
I would like to integrate
'dx' over 'x squared'

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:06.760
from minus 1 to 1.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.880
Using the first fundamental
theorem of integral calculus,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.800
I say this is 'G of 1' minus 'G
of minus 1' where 'G prime'

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.910
is any function whose
derivative

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.880
is '1 over 'x squared''.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.840
Well, in particular, do I know a
function whose derivative is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.230
'1 over 'x squared''?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.550
Well, I guess minus
'1 over x'.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.070
In other words, the derivative
of 'x' to the minus 1 is minus

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.360
'x' to the minus 2.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.560
With the minus in front
that makes it plus.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.880
'x' to the minus 2.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.900
That's plus '1 over
'x squared''.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.950
In any event, I can then
compute that 'G

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.660
of 1' is minus 1.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.720
'G of minus 1' is 1.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.390
Therefore, 'G of 1' minus 'G of
minus 1' is minus 1 minus

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.190
1, is minus 2.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.260
Therefore, the integral from
minus 1 to 1, 'dx' over 'x

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.030
squared', is minus 2.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.550
And the question is,
find the flaw.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.090
Find the flaw.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.660
And since again, we're on
limited time, let me, if you

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.420
haven't already discovered the
flaw, at least point out why

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.550
you should be suspicious
of a flaw.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.950
Remember, we visualized this
as an area under a curve.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.510
In other words, in a way, the
base of our region is the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.480
closed interval from minus 1
to 1, and the height of our

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.490
region at any point is given
by '1 over 'x squared''.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.870
Well, look at '1 over
'x squared''.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.390
Certainly, '1 over 'x squared''
can't be negative

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.820
because for any real number
'x', its square is

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.710
non-negative.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.250
And one over a non-negative
number is certainly

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.240
non-negative.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.870
In particular then, since my
region never goes below the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.700
x-axis, I would expect that the
area represented by this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.200
should be positive.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.960
In other words, this is the sum
of positive numbers taken

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.830
in the limit.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.110
In other words, the fact that
the integrand is non-negative

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.100
tells me that whenever the
integral turns out to be, it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.470
must be at least as big as 0,
and minus 2 does not fulfill

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.230
that criteria.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.600
In other words, something must
be wrong here because we get a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.280
negative answer in a situation
where a negative answer is

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.580
preposterous.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.590
And the reason that I wanted
to pick this approach is I

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.400
think that the best way to
motivate that something is

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400
wrong is precisely by winding up
with a preposterous answer

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.250
in a situation where we know
the answer is preposterous.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.020
Then we know we must be on our
guard to see what went wrong.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.180
And what did go wrong?

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.080
Well, the key point is this.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.590
And again, it's something that
we've said many, many times.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.290
But I think it takes a counter
example before it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.560
really sinks in.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.900
People are always quoting
the first

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.780
fundamental theorem in general.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.200
It's easy to remember that the
integral from 'a' to 'b', ''f

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.530
of x' dx' is 'G of b' minus
'G of a', where 'G

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.860
prime' equals 'f'.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.600
But the thing that we must be
extremely careful of is that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.970
this definition requires that
'f' be at least piecewise

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.500
continuous on the interval
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.810
Remember when we took the limit
and put the squeeze on,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.150
we required that there be
continuity, so we could pass

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.040
to the limit.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.730
The important point is in this
particular example that we're

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.070
dealing with, observe that '1
over 'x squared'' is infinite.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.970
I write this in quotation marks
to point out you have a

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.060
1/0 form, which we usually
abbreviate as infinity.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.120
In other words, '1 over 'x
squared'' increases without

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.380
bound as 'x' approaches 0.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.600
And notice that 0 was within the
limits of our integration

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.260
from minus 1 to 1.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.490
At any rate, without further
ado, this leads to a

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.670
fundamental definition.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.900
Which in terms of today's
lesson, I call

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.260
definition number 1.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.460
And that is the integral from
'a' to 'b', 'f of x dx is

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.280
called 'improper'.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.930
And there are going to be two
types of improper integrals as

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.450
we'll find out very shortly.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.050
But it's called improper of the
first kind, if and only if

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.730
'f' is infinite for at least one
'c' in the interval from

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.700
'a' to 'b'.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.190
And again, let me caution you
about this and I'll summarize

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.260
at the end of the lecture
again to remind you.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.340
If you look at this particular
integral, it doesn't look at

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.040
all suspicious.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.620
In fact, that's where the
trap came in in this

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.790
problem over here.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.630
The reason that we wound up with
minus 2 is that we just

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.430
integrated '1 over 'x squared'',
forgetting that

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.100
there was a point at which the
integrand was infinite in the

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.050
given interval.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.640
And so the question that comes
up is, how shall we handle

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.100
this if we have an
infinity in here?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.120
And the answer is, let's work
around the point at which the

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.700
integral or the integrand
is infinite.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.720
Let's see what that means.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.320
And this again, is a
continuation of the

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.950
definition, I guess.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.650
If 'c' is the only point in the
closed interval from 'a'

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.930
to 'b' at which 'f' is infinite,
we defined the

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.780
integral from 'a' to 'b',
''f of x' dx' to be

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.130
the following limit.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.330
It's the limit as
'h' approaches 0

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.190
through positive values.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.650
The definite integral from
'a' to 'c' minus 'h'.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.700
In other words, you're stopping
somewhere before you

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.270
get to this bad point,
evaluating ''f of x' dx'.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.200
And there's no harm done in here
because you see, 'f of x'

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.540
is infinite only at 'x' equals
'c' in this problem.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.130
Consequently, if you stop prior
to 'c', 'f of x' is at

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.720
least piecewise continuous
every place in here.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.860
Then you jump over the bad
point, pick up again at 'c

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.230
plus h' and say plus the
integral from 'c plus h' to

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.910
'b', ''f of x' dx'.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.630
This limit as 'h' approaches
0 through positive values.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.250
Now again, this may sound
very abstract.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.050
So to give this a more realistic
meaning to you,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.680
let's interpret this again
in terms of an area.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.730
What we're saying is
this pictorially.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.500
We have a function which is
piecewise continuous at least

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.370
on the entire interval from
'a' to 'b', except at the

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.370
point 'c' where we have an
infinite discontinuity, an

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.420
infinite jump.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.160
What we do is, is we pick a
positive number 'h' and knock

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.580
off the interval 'c minus h' to
'c plus h' surrounding 'c'.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.460
We then compute the area.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.450
We then compute the area
of this shaded region.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.470
That's exactly what's inside
the brackets over here.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.180
You see, notice that
this sum is what?

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.290
It's the sum of two integrals,
one of which names this area,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.020
and the other of which
names this area.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.510
And what we say is, let's put
the squeeze on and see what

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.730
limiting value this area
approaches as we squeeze all

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.650
the space out around 'c'.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.960
In other words, what's really
happening over here?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.640
What we're really saying is, why
can't we treat an infinite

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.140
region the same as if it were
a finite region taking the

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.570
limit as the size of the strip
in here goes to 0?

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.840
And here's the key point.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.430
You see, as 'h' approaches 'c'
from both sides, notice that

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.450
the width of this region
approaches 0.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.640
By the same token, the
height of the region

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.800
is approaching infinity.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.960
In essence, what we're running
into again, is the problem of

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.610
determining the area of an
infinite region involves the

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.150
study of infinity times 0.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.370
In fact, the question sort of
is, does 'h' go to 0 faster

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.450
than 'f of 'c plus or minus
h'' goes to infinity?

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.070
In fact, I think that's an
important enough observation,

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.070
so I've written it down
here to make sure

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.980
that you notice it.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.870
The question centers about the
question, the problem of

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.190
whether 'h' approaches
0 faster than--

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.380
whatever this means.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.710
Faster than 'f of 'c plus or
minus h'' approaches infinity.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.930
In our particular example,
this didn't happen.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.820
Now again, if you're afraid of
the symbol infinity, let's

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.010
deal with the finite case and
take the limit later.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.110
In other words, instead of
looking at the integral from 0

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:04.340
to 1, 'dx' over 'x squared',
let's look at the integral

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.190
from 'h' to 1.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.580
Integral from 'h' to 1, 'dx'
over 'x squared', and then

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.520
later we'll take the limit
as 'h' approaches 0.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.820
In particular, if this is my
region 'R', namely bounded

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.250
above by the curve 'y' equals '1
over 'x squared'', below by

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.290
the x-axis.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.590
On the left by the line 'x'
equals 'h' and on the right by

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.910
the line 'x' equals 1, the
area of the region 'R' is

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.490
written what?

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.790
Integral 'h' to 1, 'dx'
over 'x squared'.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.880
Notice that as long as 'h' is
not 0, our integrand is

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.900
continuous.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.600
Therefore, we can use the first
fundamental theorem to

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.590
evaluate it.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:40.140
It's what?

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.110
It's minus '1 over x' evaluated
between 'h' and 1.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.460
Putting in the upper limit
gives me a minus 1.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.580
Putting in the lower limit
gives me minus '1/h'.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.000
But I'm subtracting that, so
it becomes plus '1/h'.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.870
In other words, the area of my
region 'R' is 1/h minus 1.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.850
Notice then that 'A sub R' as
'h' approaches 0 from the

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.280
right becomes the limit of '1/h'
as 'h' approaches 0 from

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.330
the right minus 1.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.670
And the limit of '1/h' as 'h'
approaches 0 from the right is

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.560
clearly infinity.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.510
In other words, as 'h' gets
arbitrarily close to 0 through

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.450
positive values, '1/h' increases
without any bound.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.230
In other words, what this means
in plain English is that

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.730
we can make the area of the
region 'R' as arbitrarily as

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.110
large as we wish just by
choosing 'h' to be

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.300
sufficiently close to 0 here.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.690
You see, in other words, as
'h' approaches 0, what's

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.110
happening here is that this
curve is not approaching the

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.160
y-axis fast enough to allow
us to get a finite area.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.550
And by the way, let me make
one little aside comparing

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.740
this with our previous answer.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.350
You may recall, and let me just
pull this board down here

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.730
to remind you of that.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.580
You may recall that when we
worked this problem before, we

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.520
got the wrong answer,
negative 2.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.540
OK, now look it.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.370
In terms of my problem over
here, we went from minus 1 to

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.120
1 so this is only 1/2
of the region that

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.170
we're talking about.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.200
Notice that the minus
2 comes from this.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.390
See twice minus 1 by symmetry.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.030
The interesting thing is notice
here that when you take

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.010
the limit--

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.540
well, forgetting that there's
an infinite discontinuity

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.590
here, when you let 'h' approach
0, you tend to say

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.430
let's forget about the function
of 'h' in here.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.710
Notice here as 'h' approaches
0, this

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.110
thing went to infinity.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.820
By ignoring it, that's where
you got the answer minus 2.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.540
In other words, by assuming
that as 'h' got small, the

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.460
function of 'h' got small, we
threw out an infinite part of

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.400
our answer.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.420
In other words, this was
the thing that we

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.350
had to worry about.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.340
In this particular case, we
slurred over something that

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.470
wasn't going to 0 fast enough.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.300
By the way, let me caution you
and point out that in this

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.920
particular example it happened
that infinity

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.370
times 0 became infinite.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:06.120
It is possible, however, that
as 'h' approaches 0, it may

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.620
happen that 'h' approaches 0
fast enough, so that we do get

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.560
a finite area.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.880
To show you this, let's just
change the problem slightly.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.360
Instead of taking 'y' equals
'1 over 'x squared'', let's

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.180
take 'y' equals '1 over the
'square root of x''.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.700
The same problem, and by the
way, here's the subtlety of

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.410
this again.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.200
If you were to sketch 'y' equals
'1 over the 'square

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.760
root of x'' alongside of 'y'
equals '1 over 'x squared''--

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.160
in fact, fast enough so that
even though we get an infinite

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.620
region, it has only
a finite area.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.680
In particular, here's
what I'm saying now.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.840
Let 'R' be the region bounded
above by 'y' equals '1 over

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.900
the 'square root of x',
below by the x-axis.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.360
On the left by 'x' equals
'h' and on the right

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.850
by 'x' equals 1.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.450
Again, since the only place that
'1 over the 'square root

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.140
of x'' has an infinite
discontinuity is when 'x' is

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.430
0, and since 'h' is greater
than 0 here, we have a

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.900
continuous integrand.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.490
The area of the region 'R'
therefore is given by what?

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.170
Any function whose derivative is
'1 over the 'square root of

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.710
x'' evaluated between
'h' and 1.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.600
Again, sparing you
the details.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.830
Observe that if you
differentiate twice 'x to the

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.070
1/2', the 1/2 and the 2 cancel
and you get '1 over the

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.020
'square root of x''.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.130
In other words, 2 square root
of 'x' is the function whose

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.250
derivative is '1 over the
'square root of x''.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:32.120
If I now evaluate that between
1 and 'h', I get 2 minus 2

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.530
'square root of h'.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.280
If I now take the limit of 'A
sub R' as 'h' approaches 0,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.590
notice that what happens here
is that as 'h' approaches 0,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.160
so does the square
root of 'h'.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.040
And the area turns out
to be 2 in the limit.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.310
In other words, the area of
the region 'R' in this

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.980
particular case, is also
a function of 'h'.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.360
But the part that depends
on 'h' goes to 0

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.480
as 'h' goes to 0.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.530
In fact, notice in this
particular case, and why I

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.290
couldn't have started with this
example is that if I took

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.170
this example and you did it the
incorrect way, in other

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.230
words, if you failed to notice
that '1 over the 'square root

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.260
of x'' was discontinuous at 'x'
equals 0, and you just did

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.970
this problem mechanically, and
evaluated this between 0 and

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.030
1, you would have got
the right answer.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.130
And the reason that you would
have got the right answer, is

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.320
that in the limit process,
notice here that the part of

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.310
the answer that depends
on 'h' does actually

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.250
go to 0 in the limit.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.590
At any rate, using all of this
as motivation, we come to a

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.000
new piece of terminology
that we should define.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.390
Namely, if 'f' is infinite at
'x' equals 'c', where 'c' is

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.120
someplace in the interval from
'a' to 'b', then the improper

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.710
integral 'a' to 'b', ''f of x'
dx' is called convergent if

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.850
the particular limit that we
talked about previously in the

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.550
definition of how you compute
integral from 'a' to 'b', ''f

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.140
of x' dx', if that particular
limit exists, meaning it's a

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.980
finite number, then we call
the integral a convergent

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.610
improper integral.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.290
On the other hand,
meaning what?

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.440
If this limit doesn't exist, if
for example, the limit is

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.670
infinite, then we call the
integral divergent.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.680
In other words, in our
first example, the

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.590
integral was divergent.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.130
In the second example, the
integral was convergent.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.720
By the way, it's rather
interesting to point out too--

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.990
I shouldn't say it's
rather interesting.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.980
It's just my excuse of I don't
know of any other way of

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.230
motivating improper integrals
of the second kind.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.350
But the thing that's worth
observing is this.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:43.650
When we evaluated the area under
the curve here from 0 to

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.380
1, we elected to pick
strips like this.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.550
Remember this is why we
got into that infinite

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.580
discontinuity; we picked out
strips to look like this.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.290
The question that comes up is,
why couldn't we have picked

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.790
our strips to be horizontal?

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.390
In other words, if we had
in terms of say, inverse

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.860
functions, inverted the role of
'x' and 'y', why couldn't

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.940
we have computed our area by
picking strips like this and

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.670
adding them all up from 1 to
'b', and then taking the limit

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.360
as 'b' went to infinity?

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.820
In other words, if I wanted to
compute the area of this

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.960
region using horizontal strips,
I would have had what?

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.730
I would have had the area of the
region 'R' is the integral

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.660
from 1 to 'b'.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.090
And remember, if 'y' equals '1
over 'x squared'', 'x' is '1

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.580
over the 'square root of y''.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.020
Therefore, the area of the
region 'R' is the interval

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.210
from 1 to 'b', 'dy' over
the square root of 'y'.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.680
Notice that the square root of
'y' is certainly continuous.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.190
'1 over the 'square
root of y'' is

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.610
continuous in this interval.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.240
At any rate, I could then have
evaluated this integrand here

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.150
and taken the limit as 'b'
approached infinity.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.860
And by the way, the abbreviation
for writing the

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.010
limit of the integral 1 to 'b'
as 'b' approaches infinity, is

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.720
to simply write integral from
1 to infinity 'dy' over the

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.940
square root of 'y'.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.370
And this is all this
thing means.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.130
For example, in this particular
case, notice that

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.050
as 'b' goes to infinity, so does
the square root of 'b'.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.089
Therefore, 2 'square root of b'
minus 2 goes to infinity as

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.440
'b' approaches infinity.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.040
And we find by a second method
that the area of

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.460
our region is infinite.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.450
And again, we have another kind
of improper integral.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.849
But structurally, this
improper integral is

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:25.880
completely different
from the improper

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.630
integral that we had before.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.300
Namely, before we had an
improper integral where the

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.900
integrand became infinite,
even though the limits of

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.590
integration stayed finite.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.180
Notice what happens
in this case.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.160
In this particular case, notice
that the integrand

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.240
stays finite.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.660
It's the limits of integration
that become infinite.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.450
In other words, this leads to
our next definition of a new

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.810
type of improper integral.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.210
Namely, the integral say, from
'a' to infinity ''f of x' dx'.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.200
Whereby this we mean the
abbreviation limit as 'b'

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.410
approaches infinity, integral
from 'a' to 'b', ''f of x'

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.560
dx', where 'f' is continuous
in this entire range.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.050
In other words, for 'x' greater
than or equal to 'a'.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:15.030
That type of an integral is
called an improper integral of

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.630
the second kind.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.350
In other words, in the first
kind, the integrand becomes

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.170
infinite, but the limits of
integration are finite.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.970
In the second kind, the
integrand stays finite, but

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.330
the limits of integration take
on an infinite range.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.120
And the important point is
that these two are very

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.030
closely connected.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.520
In other words, in terms of the
example that I just showed

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.700
you, I wanted you to see how you
can get from an integral

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.130
of the first kind to an improper
integral of the

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.410
second kind just by replacing
your vertical strips by

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.720
horizontal strips.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.770
In fact, in terms of my first
example over here notice that

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.240
indeed, '1 over 'x squared'' and
'1 over the 'square root

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.960
of x'', where 'x' is at least
as big as 0, are inverses.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.850
By the way, the reason I say 'x'
is, in fact, bigger than

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.400
0, otherwise I'll have
a 0 denominator here.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.295
The reason I point this out is
that if you don't presuppose

00:19:05.295 --> 00:19:09.320
that x is positive, remember,
the square root function or

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.470
the squaring function is not
1:1, so I have to be very

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.400
careful when I talk about
inverse functions.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.270
The thing I want to see however
is, the graph of 'y'

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.410
equals '1 over 'x squared'' is
the inverse of the graph 'y'

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.370
equals '1 over the 'square
root of x''.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.740
In other words, essentially, by
interchanging the role of

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.270
the x- and y-axes, you go from
one graph to the other.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:34.750
You see, in particular, the
integral 1 to infinity, 'dx'

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.430
over 'x squared'.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.280
Namely, finding the area of this
particular region is the

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.130
inverse of finding the area
of this particular region.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.850
In other words, notice that
'y' equals '1 over 'x

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.590
squared'' behaves for large
values of 'x' the same as 'y'

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.880
equals '1 over the 'square root
of x'' behaves for small

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.430
parts of the values of 'x'.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.520
Again, let me point out that
much of this will be done much

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.090
more hard core in our learning
exercises and in the reading

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.220
material and the like.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.480
And so I pass over some of this
in a fairly quick way.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.800
But what I want to make sure is
clear before we begin the

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.700
exercises and the reading
material is that we have a

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.530
good idea as to what improper
integrals mean.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.480
At any rate, continuing on this
way, what do I mean by

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.170
the integral from
1 to infinity,

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.590
'dx' over 'x squared'?

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.290
Well, it's an improper integral
of a second type

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.680
because the integrand is finite
between 1 and infinity.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.050
The limits of integration span
an infinite space over here.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:33.840
At any rate, it's what?

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.710
The limit as 'b' approaches
infinity, integral from 1 to

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.910
'b', 'dx' over 'x squared'.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.140
At any rate, what
is the integral

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.926
of '1 over 'x squared''.

00:20:44.926 --> 00:20:47.520
It's minus '1/x'.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.840
If I evaluate that that's minus
''1 over b' plus 1'.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.820
And if I now take the limit as
'b' approaches infinity that

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.190
answer is 1.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.390
In other words, what this means

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.250
pictorially is the following.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.570
If I look at the area of this
region 'R' for any value of

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:09.080
'b' whatsoever, that area is
equal to 1 minus '1/b'.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.400
In other words, no matter how
big 'b' becomes, the area of

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.240
this region 'R' can never
be as big as one unit.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.320
And in the limit, as 'b' goes
out as far as we wish, what

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.850
we're really saying is what?

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.040
That the area of this region
'R' can be made arbitrarily

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.360
close to 1 just by choosing 'b'
to be arbitrarily large.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.700
And by the way, this you see
leads to an interesting

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.710
observation.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.050
Namely, at this end of the
spectrum, the curve was not

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.580
approaching the y-axis
fast enough to make

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.250
this integral finite.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.640
Remember, the integral from 0
to 1, 'dx' over 'x squared'

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.830
was infinite.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.570
However, for large values of
'x', the curve does approach

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.910
the x-axis fast enough, so that
not only is the enclosed

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.700
area finite, it can't even
be bigger than 1.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.750
I thought that might be an
interesting example for you to

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.440
think about for a while.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.960
Another type of interesting
example worth thinking about

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.530
for a while is this
second example.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.250
Let's take the region 'R' to be
bounded above by 'y' equals

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.950
'1/x', on the left by 'x' equals
1, on the right by 'x'

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.680
equals 'b', and below
by the x-axis.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.960
And let's compute the area
of the region 'R'.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.780
Again, the area of the region
'R' is a definite integral

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.210
from 1 to 'b', 'dx' over 'x'.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.840
And that's equal to the
natural log of 'b'.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.390
Namely, this integral is log
absolute value of 'x'.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.920
Log absolute value of
'b' is just 'log b'.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.200
Log 1 is 0.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.020
So the area of the region
'R' is 'log b'.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.140
As 'b' increases without bound,
its log increases

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.390
without bound, we find
that the area of the

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.230
region 'R' is infinite.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.380
In fact, another way of
saying this is what?

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.730
This is the integral 1 to
infinity 'dx' over 'x'.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.820
And this is, therefore, what?

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:02.170
A divergent improper integral
of the second type.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.300
All right, so far so
good at any rate.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.540
Let me review our volumes of
revolution and rotation.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.710
Let's take the region 'R' and
rotate it about the x-axis.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.820
If we rotate 'R' about the
x-axis, remember a volume of

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.430
revolution is just pi 'y
squared' 'dx' from 1 to 'b'.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.530
Well, my 'y' is '1/x'.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.430
That's '1 over x squared'.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:32.110
The integral of '1 over x
squared' is minus '1/x'.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.580
Notice then as before, the
volume when I rotate 'R' about

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.440
the x-axis is just pi times
'1 minus '1/b''.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.710
In other words, what this say
is as 'b' gets very, very

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.810
large, so does 'R'.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:50.230
Yet, if I rotate 'R' about the
x-axis, no matter how big 'b'

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:56.520
is the volume is just pi
times '1 minus '1/b''.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.090
As 'b' approaches infinity, this
goes to 0 and my volume

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.270
is just pi.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.170
In other words, this area
gets infinitely large.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.700
Yet, the volume generated
by rotating that

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.840
area remains finite.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.860
Again, another idiosyncrasy
of working with improper

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.730
integrals and infinite
regions.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.820
You've got to be very, very
careful about how rapidly

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.550
something approaches 0 or
infinity because infinity

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.080
times 0 is indeterminate.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.350
In other words, here is a very
important observation, an

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:33.610
infinite area can enclose or can
generate a finite volume.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.530
Be very, very careful
in dealing

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.050
with improper integrals.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.890
And by the way, let me make
one computational aside.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:46.070
In trying to determine whether a
particular improper integral

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.400
is convergent or not, we do not
have to be able to compute

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.870
the limit itself.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.490
I mention this because
it's very important.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.860
Sometime you'll be given an
integral which you don't know

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.220
how to integrate directly.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.010
A typical example that usually
comes up, integral ''e to the

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.520
minus 'x squared' dx', say
between 1 and infinity.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.430
And you want to know whether
this converges or not.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.570
You don't care what the limit
is because once you know it

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.200
converges, you can approximate
it to as great a degree of

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.550
accuracy as you wish.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.140
So the question is, does this
converge or doesn't it?

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.120
And again, the answer is, let's
see what happens on this

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.980
particular range, for example.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.060
In other words, we know, for
example, that if 'x' is

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:29.210
greater than or equal to 1 for
numbers in magnitude at least

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.180
as big as 1, the square
exceeds the number.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.930
In particular by the way, if 'x
squared' exceeds 'x', minus

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.270
'x squared' cannot
exceed minus 'x'.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.170
In other words, on this
particular interval that we're

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.890
dealing with, say from 1 to
'b', as 'b' approaches

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.620
infinity, 'e to the minus
'x squared'' is

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.465
less than minus 'x'.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.670
Therefore, because the
exponential function is 1:1,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.100
''e to the minus 'x squared'
dx' from 1 to 'b' cannot

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.850
exceed the integral from 1 to
'b', ''e to the minus x' dx'.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.290
In other words, since this
exponent is less than this

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.440
exponent, this integral
is less than this one.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.650
However, it turns out that we
know how to evaluate this one.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.630
How do we integrate 'e
to the minus x'?

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.810
It's just minus 'e
to the minus x'.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.260
And if we evaluate that between
1 and 'b', we find

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.260
that we get '1/e' minus '1
over 'e to the b'' power.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.040
'b' is some positive number.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.340
This thing here is less
than infinity.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:33.390
In fact, as 'b' approaches
infinity, this approaches 0,

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.790
and the limiting
value is '1/e'.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.360
In other words, what we now know
is, is that whatever this

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.690
improper integral is, it cannot
exceed '1/e' even

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.600
though we don't know what
the exact answer is.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.110
Pictorially, you see what
happens over here is that the

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.870
curve which I've drawn in the
accentuated chalk, this curve

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.260
is 'y' equals 'e to the
minus 'x squared''.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.960
The light curve is 'y' equals
'e to the minus x'.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.560
Notice that these two curves
crisscross when 'x' equals 1.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.280
And all we're saying is that
since the white curve chops

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.050
off a finite area and the
accentuated curve, the dark

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:15.260
curve is inside the white one,
certainly the area enclosed by

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.610
the black curve cannot exceed
that of the white curve.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.970
In other words, if this region
here approaches a finite value

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.240
as 'x' goes to infinity, so
must the other region.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.170
And this is essentially
the theory

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.490
behind improper integrals.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.700
In closing, there is one
thing I would like

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.570
to say about this.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.310
It's a short summary, but
here's the whole idea.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.700
It may be difficult to evaluate
improper integrals of

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.550
a second kind.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.830
But in the certain manner of

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.470
speaking, they're not dangerous.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:46.660
In what manner of speaking?

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.560
Well, when you see the limits on
the integral sign like a to

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.490
infinity, or minus infinity to
'b', or minus infinity to

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.135
infinity, you're
on the lookout.

00:27:57.135 --> 00:27:59.970
You're on the lookout
to be careful about

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.170
something going wrong.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.480
There's something about the
symbol infinity, which

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.860
hopefully strikes a certain fear
or respect in your minds

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.870
when you work mathematically.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.560
See, we have a warning to
be ware in this case.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.120
However, the dangerous part is
that when you're given an

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.660
improper integral of the first
type, and I don't know the

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.210
best way of saying this other
than to say perhaps, that

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.930
mathematics has no built-in
burglar alarms.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.990
What I mean by that is if you're
supposed to multiply 5

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.930
and 3 to get the right answer to
a problem, and instead you

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.170
add 5 and 3, you're going to
get 8 for the answer even

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.160
though it's incorrect.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.160
There's not going to be a buzzer
that goes off and says,

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.180
please do not add these
two numbers.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.520
In other words, if you go ahead
over here and you forget

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.660
that 'f of x' may be infinite
and you go ahead and integrate

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.670
this using the first fundamental
theorem, you're

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.650
going to get an answer just like
we did in our beginning

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.280
exercise at the beginning
of the lecture.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.130
It happened to be the
wrong answer.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.830
So in other words, the word of
warning here is whenever you

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.310
see an integral with finite
limits of integration, check

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.500
the integrand and make sure it
doesn't blow up, it doesn't

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.850
become infinite.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.170
At any rate, with these words
we finish our block on

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.240
integration.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.190
And until next time, good bye.
