00:00:00.347 --> 00:00:02.975
- [Voiceover] The amino acid
sequence of cytochrome c

00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:06.616
was determined for five
different species of vertebrates.

00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:09.054
The table below shows
the number of differences

00:00:09.054 --> 00:00:12.597
in the sequences between
each pair of species.

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:14.288
So, just to give us some context

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:15.458
for what we're talking about.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:16.726
We're talking about cytochrome c.

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:17.831
This is a protein.

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:19.298
You might remember it when we studied

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:21.216
the electron transport chain.

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:23.590
You don't really have to
know that for this question,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.442
but it's a protein that's found in a lot

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.816
of different species, and
we're going to compare the

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.644
difference in the sequence of amino acids

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:33.342
for that protein in the different species.

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:35.747
So even though you have the
same or similar protein,

00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:37.015
we call them all cytochrome c,

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:38.673
the sequence might be slightly different

00:00:38.673 --> 00:00:41.599
when you go from one species
of vertebrate to another.

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:43.807
And the way to read this is

00:00:43.807 --> 00:00:45.737
for each of these rows you could say,

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:47.403
all right, this row

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:51.095
describes D. polylepis,

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.371
and we can see the number
of sequence differences

00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:55.419
between D. polylepis and G. gallus.

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:57.012
There's 18 differences.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:58.577
There's clearly going
to be zero differences

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:01.930
between that species and itself.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.718
All right, now let's
answer their question.

00:01:03.718 --> 00:01:05.181
Using the data in the table,

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:08.822
create a phylogenetic tree
on the template provided

00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:11.065
to reflect the evolutionary relationships

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:12.397
of the organisms.

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:14.738
Provide reasoning for
the placement on the tree

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:17.761
of the species that is
least related to the others.

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.524
So, looking at these differences,

00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:22.517
it's reasonable to say, well, the things

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:25.698
that have the fewest
differences in the sequence

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:27.811
of cytochrome c, well, those are probably

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.469
most closely related.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.614
And they already gave us a tree here,

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:33.700
so whatever goes here and here

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.967
are probably pretty closely related.

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:36.142
They shouldn't have too many differences

00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:38.809
in the sequence of cytochrome c.

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.031
And these two should be pretty similar.

00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:44.311
Shouldn't have many differences.

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.822
While this one should have
a good number of differences

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:49.480
from any of the other four.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.438
So let's first look at which ones

00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:51.898
have very little difference.

00:01:51.898 --> 00:01:54.108
And I'm just scanning this chart here

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:56.221
and looking for small numbers.

00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:58.562
So you see here, there's only one

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.979
amino acid difference, or one sequence.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.778
Well, yeah, one amino acid difference

00:02:02.778 --> 00:02:06.995
between cytochrome c in
E. ferus and E. africanus.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:09.238
So I would say that these
are fairly closely related.

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:13.041
They probably share an
ancestor not too far

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:14.471
in the distant past.

00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:17.951
So let me write E. ferus and E. africanus.

00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:19.543
So, I'll do it here.

00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:20.376
E.

00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:22.489
E. ferus.

00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:27.223
And E. E. africanus.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.633
I'd do that there.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:35.765
Now where else do we see some low numbers.

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:38.397
Well, I see this three right over here

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:42.430
and so that's the number
of sequence differences

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.878
or the amino acid differences

00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:46.711
between G. gallus and A. forsteri.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.212
Forsteri, however you pronounce that.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:52.813
So I would say those are
probably pretty closely related.

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:55.090
And so let me write this here.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.923
G. gallus

00:02:58.388 --> 00:02:59.722
and A. forsteri.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.789
And who have we not dealt with yet.

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.122
Well, we haven't dealt with

00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:12.398
D. polylepis yet.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.352
We've dealt with the other four.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.435
So I'll put that here.

00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:17.518
D. polylepis.

00:03:20.726 --> 00:03:22.936
And you can see when
you compare D. polylepis

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.563
to any of the other ones,

00:03:24.563 --> 00:03:26.220
you see a pretty big difference.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.633
D. polylepis to E. ferus
is a 21 difference.

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:31.551
18 difference with G. gallus.

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:34.314
17 difference with A. forsteri

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:36.981
and 20 amino acids are different

00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:40.234
in the sequence for cytochrome c

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:43.934
between D. polylepis and E. africanus.

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:46.047
So this has the most differences.

00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:50.630
And they say provide reasoning
for the placement on the tree

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.464
of the species that is
least related to the others.

00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:56.382
So I'll provide the reasoning.

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:57.798
So, D. polylepis

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:03.812
is most,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.604
is least related, I should say,

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:10.021
is least related

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:13.832
because it has

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:19.462
a large amino acid,

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:24.733
amino acid sequence

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:29.782
difference

00:04:32.299 --> 00:04:34.475
from the other four.

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:36.725
From the other, other four.

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:40.847
Or you can say, has the largest.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:41.680
Maybe I'll write that.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.624
Has the largest amino
acid sequence difference

00:04:45.624 --> 00:04:46.664
from the other four.

00:04:46.664 --> 00:04:49.915
Because even if you were to
compare E. ferus to G. gallus,

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:52.906
E. ferus to G. gallus, you
still don't get close to 20,

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:54.466
while D. polylepis is pretty close

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:56.384
to 20 difference with all of them.

00:04:56.384 --> 00:04:58.864
And so that makes sense,
that even these four

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:00.674
share a common ancestor, that you don't

00:05:00.674 --> 00:05:02.995
have to go as far back in time

00:05:02.995 --> 00:05:04.152
to get to the common ancestor

00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:05.971
as you do to get to D.,

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:09.581
the common ancestor with D. polylepis.

00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:12.344
All right, let's do part b now.

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:13.806
So that was part a.

00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:14.639
Let me label that

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.626
That was part a.

00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:16.504
Now part b.

00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:18.943
Identify whether morphological data

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.795
or amino acid sequence data

00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:23.234
are more likely to accurately represent

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:26.939
the true evolutionary
relationships among the species

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.019
and provide reasoning for your answer.

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:30.937
So, morphological data, this is looking at

00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:35.001
the morphology of the different species.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.534
And you could say, like, what's the shape

00:05:36.534 --> 00:05:39.713
of their backbone or
their different bones,

00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:44.103
or the shape of different
parts of their body,

00:05:44.103 --> 00:05:46.734
while amino acid sequence,
you're looking at,

00:05:46.734 --> 00:05:49.693
well, how are their
proteins actually made up.

00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:53.853
I, personally, would go
with the amino acid data.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.269
So, I, I believe.

00:05:58.631 --> 00:05:59.465
I believe,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.380
I believe amino acid

00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:08.459
sequence data

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:16.247
are, data's plural, are more likely,

00:06:18.006 --> 00:06:21.734
are more likely to accurately represent

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:23.564
the true evolutionary relationship,

00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:27.064
are more acc, are more likely to represent

00:06:29.443 --> 00:06:32.437
the true evolutionary relationship.

00:06:32.437 --> 00:06:35.020
True evolutionary relationship.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.327
And let me provide my reasoning.

00:06:43.327 --> 00:06:46.513
You could have convergent morphology.

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:47.597
You can have

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.294
convergent morphology

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:56.037
and what that means is, for example,

00:06:56.037 --> 00:06:58.475
you could look at a bat's
wings and a bird's wings

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.491
and say, okay, look, they
each have similar morphology,

00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:02.581
but they aren't related just because

00:07:02.581 --> 00:07:03.968
they both have wings.

00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:05.757
Or you could look at a dolphin and a fish,

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:07.546
and you say, okay, they
both have flippers.

00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:08.985
Maybe they're more closely related,

00:07:08.985 --> 00:07:10.630
if you just look at the body type.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.607
But that's convergent.

00:07:11.607 --> 00:07:14.629
They actually came from
different ancestors,

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:15.931
but then their ancestors,

00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:17.164
because they had similar environments,

00:07:17.164 --> 00:07:20.903
had a convergent parts,
I guess you could say.

00:07:20.903 --> 00:07:22.527
Had convergent morphology.

00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:25.444
You can have convergent morphology,

00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:27.209
morphology,

00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:32.242
while having very, while being far apart

00:07:32.242 --> 00:07:34.325
on the evolutionary tree.

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:36.979
While being

00:07:39.456 --> 00:07:40.289
far apart

00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:43.943
on evolutionary,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.910
on evolutionary tree.

00:07:50.064 --> 00:07:52.720
Now there's arguments
for morphology as well,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.921
'cause you might be looking at.

00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:57.412
You know, we're only looking
at cytochrome c here.

00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:59.674
That might be some type of an anomaly,

00:07:59.674 --> 00:08:01.917
or maybe you have some
convergence or divergence

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:04.978
for that particular protein that does not

00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:07.248
actually gel with what's actually happened

00:08:07.248 --> 00:08:08.841
in evolutionary history,

00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:12.514
but in general if I can look
at the molecular sequences.

00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:14.172
If I can look at sequences of proteins,

00:08:14.172 --> 00:08:16.480
if I could look at what's
going on with the DNA,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.268
I like looking at that,

00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:20.706
because that doesn't, that
allows you to not be tricked

00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:24.673
by the convergent morphology
or far apart things,

00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:28.090
like bats and birds or dolphins and fish.
