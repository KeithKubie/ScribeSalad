00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.360
We are so mean to ourselves.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.660
So utterly, barbarically cruel.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.250
If we saw someone treating a stranger the
way we tend to treat ourselves, we’d be

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.880
appalled.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.660
We need to learn to be that most rare of things:
a proper friend to ourselves. To be our own

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.599
best friend.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:29.080
-- It doesn’t come naturally; we need to
practice saying some of the following to ourselves:

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.490
You deserve to exist;

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.750
it's OK to make mistakes;

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.140
you can be forgiven;

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.570
I know how hard you try
and all the obstacles you’ve had to overcome

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.710
I don't care what the others think;

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.440
you can be weak with me;

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.760
you can mess up

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.010
You can fall apart.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.400
You can be imperfect;

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.760
You can let me down.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.159
I’m on your side: I’m touched by how much
effort you have made and how deeply you have

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.520
suffered.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.920
You don't have to prove yourself to me;

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.310
I don't need you to 'be' somebody…

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.200
I can love you as you are - despite everything.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.490
I’m your best friend.
Always

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.720
And I’m right here.
