00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
 

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.950
Now that we've set
up our equations,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.660
let's see if we can answer some
more interesting questions.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.820
Just as a warm-up,
we're going to do

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.200
a little bit of what we
did in the last video.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.783
But I'll do it with
the equations now.

00:00:09.783 --> 00:00:13.070
The equations really are just
a mathematical representation

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.422
of the same information
that we had up here.

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:17.880
So as a starting
point, let's think

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.940
about how much,
under the basic plan,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.720
it'll cost for us to attend
3 sessions in a given month.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.020
Well, we've got our
equation right over here.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.970
Our total cost in
that month is going

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:40.140
to be equal to 20 plus 8
times the number of sessions.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.540
The number of sessions is S.
S is 3 in this circumstances,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.600
so we'll replace
the S with the 3.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.700
And so you get our cost
in this circumstance

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.150
is going to be 20 plus 8 times
3, or 20 plus 24, or $44.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
Let me erase this
right over here.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.260
So this is going to cost us $44.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.900
 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.230
Now let's do the same
thing under the trial plan.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.620
How much is it going to cost
us to attend 3 sessions?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.320
Well, this is more
straightforward,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.110
or slightly more
straightforward.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.370
Our total cost is going to be
equal to 12 times the number

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.000
of sessions.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.130
The number of sessions in this
circumstance are 3 sessions,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.160
so it's going to be 12 times 3.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.670
Our total cost is going
to be equal to $36.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.560
Let me write that down.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.700
It's going to be equal to $36.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.550
But we could also answer
more interesting questions

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.110
with these equations.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:54.650
For example, how many sessions
can I attend in a month for,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.550
oh, I don't know, let's
throw out something, $54.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.590
 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.960
Let's say that's just my budget.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.410
When I look at my salary
and how much money

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.380
I have budgeted to
health and fitness,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.930
this is what I can afford.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.690
And so based on that, I want
to ask, how many sessions can I

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.690
attend in each of
these situations?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.750
First, let's think about
it for the trial plan.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.920
How many sessions
can I attend for $54?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.650
Now let's just assume that this
is some type of a special yoga

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.030
studio where you can even
attend half a session.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.020
So if you attend half a
session, they'll charge you $6.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.640
If you attend a fourth of a
session, they'll charge you $3.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.490
So they'll actually keep
track of exactly what fraction

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.740
of a session you're attending.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.430
You don't have to just attend
whole number of sessions.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
You could attend 2 and 1/2, and
they'll bill you accordingly.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.500
With that said, how many
sessions under the trial plan

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.870
can I attend for $54?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.600
 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.780
Well, let's think about
this a little bit.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080
My cost now is going to be $54.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.470
$54 is C. It's my monthly cost.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.472
So 54 is going to be equal
to $12 per session times

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:07.430
the number of sessions.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.800
 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.180
Now I set up this equation.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.890
In order to answer
this question,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.750
I just need to figure out
what's the number of sessions

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.170
that satisfy it.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.200
Now this S is an
unknown variable.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.320
What number of sessions
times 12 is equal to 54?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.160
Well, you might say,
well, if I could

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.519
get just a S on the
right-hand side here,

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.560
then I'll have an answer.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.200
S will be equal to some value.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.730
And if I want just a S
on the right-hand side,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.550
I'd ideally just like
to divide this by 12.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.910
12S divided by 12 is
just going to give me

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.490
a S. It's just going to give
me the number of sessions.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.370
But if I have an equal
sign, I can't just

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.730
willy-nilly divide
one side by 12

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.630
without doing the exact same
thing to the other side.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.780
If that is equal to
that, in order for them

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.620
to both still be equal, I
have to do the same thing

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.020
to both sides.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.786
So on the right-hand side,
I'm left with just a S.

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:08.160
And on the left-hand side,
I have 54 divided by 12.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.800
Let me think about that.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.150
I'll just work it out.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.730
12 goes into 54 4 times.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.350
4 times 12 is 48.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.510
You're left with
a remainder of 6.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.690
So you could say
12 goes into 54,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.010
or you could say 54/12 is equal
to 4 and 6/12 or 4 and 1/2.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.220
So the number of sessions that
I could attend are 4 and 1/2.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.170
If I have $54 to spend, I
could attend 4 and 1/2 sessions

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.070
under the trial plan.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.740
If this was a yoga
studio that said,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.085
oh, you can't attend
half sessions,

00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:50.460
then you could
say, well, at most

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.835
I could attend four sessions,
because five sessions would

00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:54.500
get me above my budget.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.820
But I said that you can
attend fractional sessions,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.870
so we're going to say 4 and 1/2.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.190
Now let's answer the same
question for the basic plan.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.255
Under the basic plan, how many
sessions can I attend for $54?

00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:12.920
 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.540
Well, once again,
this is going to be

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.420
our total cost for that month.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:25.390
So we say $54 is equal to
20 plus 8 times the number

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.910
of sessions.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.360
 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.450
And once again, I'd like
to just have sessions

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.680
maybe on the right-hand
side of this equation.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.346
So I could say, oh, sessions are
going to be equal to something.

00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:41.500
This is the number of
sessions that I could attend.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.750
But I have this 20
here and this 8 here,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.656
and so I have to think about
how I can get rid of them.

00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:48.280
The first thing I've
got to think about

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.550
is, how can I get rid of this
20 from the right-hand side

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.540
of this equation?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.570
What am I going to have to
do to the entire equation?

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.850
Well, the simplest thing
is I could subtract 20

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.800
from the right-hand side.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.870
But if I subtract 20
from the right-hand side,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.310
I also have to subtract
20 from the left-hand side

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.060
in order to maintain
the equality.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.620
So I'm left with, on the
left-hand side, 54 minus 20

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.376
gets me 34.

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:16.000
And that's going to
be equal to-- well,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.450
the whole point
of subtracting 20

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.630
is so that these
negate each other.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.090
And then I have just an 8S.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.660
 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.970
So 8 times the number of
sessions has to be equal to 34

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.420
in order for 8 times the
number of sessions plus 20

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.200
to be equal to 54.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.660
And then you could add 20 to
both sides of this equation

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.490
to get our original.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.320
We're almost done.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.670
We just want to isolate
the S right here.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.630
And you can imagine
the easiest way would

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.592
be to divide the
right-hand side by 8.

00:06:44.592 --> 00:06:46.550
But if we're dividing
the right-hand side by 8,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.120
we have to do the
same to the left.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.670
And so what do we get for
the number of sessions

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.150
that we would have to attend?

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.370
Well, these cancel out.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.330
And so you get the
number of sessions

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.330
is equal to 34 divided by 8.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.640
34 divided by 8 is
equal to, let's see,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.460
8 goes into 34 four times with
a remainder of 2, so 4 and 2/8,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.000
or it's 4 and 1/4.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.370
So I could attend 4 and 1/4
sessions under the basic plan.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.540
Assuming I can do fractional
sessions, for $54,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.410
which one can I attend
more sessions in,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.280
the basic plan or
the trial plan?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.740
Well, for $54 I could attend
a slightly longer amount

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.069
of sessions under
the trial plan.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:39.569
