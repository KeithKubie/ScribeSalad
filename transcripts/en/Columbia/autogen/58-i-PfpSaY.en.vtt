00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.400

about political science know very little

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410
about political science know very little
 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.530
about political science know very little
about international institutions and are

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540
about international institutions and are
 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.120
about international institutions and are
not terribly interested in learning much

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130
not terribly interested in learning much
 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.130
not terribly interested in learning much
more and most people who know about

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140
more and most people who know about
 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.660
more and most people who know about
international institutions frankly don't

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670
international institutions frankly don't
 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.060
international institutions frankly don't
know much about IR theory maybe they

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070
know much about IR theory maybe they
 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.410
know much about IR theory maybe they
should but they don't seem to be too

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420
should but they don't seem to be too
 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.360

interested and so if there's a

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370
interested and so if there's a
 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.600
interested and so if there's a
conversation at all it tends to be a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610

these institutions not only are homeless
in in theory but they're really quite

probably would be college professors who
are completely unaccountable but

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220
are completely unaccountable but
 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.770

seems to me what we ought to be doing is

not only because he's a very

not only because he's a very

his arguments are the most easiest to
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.509
his arguments are the most easiest to
dismiss and so why not why not start

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519
dismiss and so why not why not start
 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.009

they largely control international
 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.979
they largely control international
institutions then there's nothing

the consideration of what options we
might have and this I think very

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:18.290
might have and this I think very

law and the argument is basically that
 

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.240
law and the argument is basically that
you know law is not law is not law and

to know that the council is going to be
there when we need it to be and so they

now point C proportional means and we

now point C proportional means and we
helped you be against proportional means

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520
helped you be against proportional means

of course we should be proportional you

00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:57.950
of course we should be proportional you

show of force somehow threatening the
 

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.790
show of force somehow threatening the
use of force what about a deterrent you

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800
use of force what about a deterrent you
 

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.720
use of force what about a deterrent you
know maybe if you have an effective

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:02.730
know maybe if you have an effective
 

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.130
know maybe if you have an effective
deterrent you don't actually have to use

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.140
deterrent you don't actually have to use
 

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.070

it at all where does deterrence fit

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:07.080
it at all where does deterrence fit
 

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.770

under this I don't know I don't think

you know is really a very effective

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:14.730
you know is really a very effective
 

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:16.730
you know is really a very effective
deterrent because you're just convincing

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740
deterrent because you're just convincing
 

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.230

them that you're not serious about going
 

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.900
them that you're not serious about going
forward so you know I think there are

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:20.910
forward so you know I think there are
 

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:22.790
forward so you know I think there are
maybe humanitarian cases where you could

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800
maybe humanitarian cases where you could
 

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.350
maybe humanitarian cases where you could
have a display of force the threat of
