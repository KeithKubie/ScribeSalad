00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
Big O-notation is also sometimes called Landau notation, named after

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.600
the German mathematician--Edmund Landau.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.740
He didn't invent the notation, which was done several years before him

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.700
by another German mathematician called Paul Bachman, but he popularized it in the 20th century.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.040
In a way, this is actually quite ironic that you should have popularized a notation that

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.030
contains so much approximation as big O-notation because Edmund Landau was actually known

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.690
as one of the most exact and pedantic mathematicians.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.800
His goal was to be uncompromisingly rigorous.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.710
In his lectures that he used to given, he even had an assistant who always attended his lectures

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.540
and was instructed to interrupt him if he even omitted the slightest detail.

00:00:48.540 --> 99:59:59.000
It's interesting that he introduced a notation that omits all of the details.
