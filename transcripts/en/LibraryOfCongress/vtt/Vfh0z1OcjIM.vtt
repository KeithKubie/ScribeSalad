00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.750
&gt;&gt; Michael North:
Good morning everyone.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.150
I hope are all ready for
another set of interesting

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.970
and insightful presentations
about the history

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.910
of science, medicine and books.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.760
It's my pleasure to introduce
Lilla Vekerdy, whom I've known

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.520
as a historian and fellow
curator for over 20 years.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.580
Lilla has been head
of special collections

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.010
at the Smithsonian
Library since 2008.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.880
Previously, she worked at the
Bernard Becker Medical Library

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.430
at Washington University
in St. Louis

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.340
as rare book librarian
for 13 years.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.510
Her research interests and
publications are in the history

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.070
of medicine and rare
book studies and often

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.920
about the overlay
of these two fields.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.660
Her presentation will
discuss and place

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.930
in parallel two illustrated
books about science.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.190
The 1495 edition of Johannes de
Ketham's, "Fasciculus Medicine,"

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.970
one my favorite early
printed books.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.800
And an artist book from 2004

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.410
by Joyce Cutler-Shaw
titled "The Anatomy Lesson."

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.830
The first book was the
direct inspirational source

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.180
of the second one.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.290
And they were displayed
together at an exhibition

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.160
in the Smithsonian Libraries,
science and the artist book.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.960
The comparison of the books
reveals rivaling expressions

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.770
of not just two but
three time periods.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.540
Within the Ketham
work, ideas and ideals

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.330
from the middle ages
grapple with the renaissance.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.980
And then both eras jointly
appear on oppositional pages

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.280
of modern depictions

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.670
of the 21st-century artist
book by Joyce Cutler-Shaw.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.210
Intending to untangle
this threefold conundrum,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.630
the presentation
touches on science,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.510
art and poetry, please
welcome Lilla.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.800
&gt;&gt; Lilla Vekerdy: Good morning.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.650
Thank you, Michael for
the nice introduction.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.000
And thank you for coming out
on a nice, snowy spring day.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.050
In this presentation,
I will place

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.500
in parallel two visually
intriguing rare volumes.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.850
They are closely related
and yet very different.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.840
One is an artistic medical
book from the 15th century.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.120
While the other is a medical
artist book published in 2004.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.080
I will also use images

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.430
of selected late
medieval manuscripts

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.750
and the artwork of
Andrea Mantegna.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.760
Since we'll be skipping from
book to book, from installation

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.170
to illustration, I
tagged each image

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.140
within every slide
for reference.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.130
Please watch those small labels.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.440
The first book titled
"Fasciculus Medicine,"

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.890
usually spelled with a-e at the
end, in this edition, just an e,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.720
the little bundle of
medicine was printed

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.900
by the Gregorius brothers
in Venice in 1495.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.280
Its first edition
published in 1491 is known

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.190
as the earliest illustrated
medical texts in print.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.650
And highly regarded for
its artistic qualities.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.400
The book went through
several editions

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.780
in different languages
in rapid succession.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.100
We would be looking at the
second Latin edition from 1495,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.560
held in the Dibner Library
of the History of Science

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.200
and Technology in the
Smithsonian Libraries.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.120
This relatively small
collection,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.250
with its 35,000 rare
volumes is proud to hold more

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.310
than 320 scientific incunabula,
one of which is Ketham's

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.590
"Fasciculus Medicine."

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.180
The genre of the "Fasciculus"
is typically premodern.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.630
It is a compilation of various
ancient and medieval sources.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.980
The text itself, names Johannes
de Ketham, presumed originally

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.130
from Kelkheim, mid-15th
century Venice medical professor

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.590
as the compiler.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.220
Recent scholarship, however, has
proven this proposition wrong.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.950
Offering no new proposition,
though.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.610
The question, who compiled
the book is still open.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.250
This doesn't seem to weaken
the established authority

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.430
of the work, which
is characterized

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.670
in its frontispiece shown here.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.390
The figure at the desk
Andrea Mantegna was professor

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.200
of medicine at the
University of Padua

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.200
in the middle of
the 15th century.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.520
A well-known physician,
[inaudible],

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.160
he is not the compiler
of this book either.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.460
His role here is to represent
authoritative knowledge

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.560
in the person of a respected
scholar transcribing,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.830
or maybe translating a text
that lies open on his desk.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.180
He is surrounded by books of
Greek, Roman and Arabic authors.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.150
Most of these books
are medical classics.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.670
On the shelf, left to right are
Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.890
Avicenna, Aliamte,
Rasis, Masve, and others,

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.630
with the author's
names on the covers.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.140
The ornate binding

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.900
of the Avicenna volume placed
strategically in the middle

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.760
of the shelf refers
to Avicenna's role

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.790
as princeps medicorum
throughout centuries.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.330
Pliny, the elders,
"Historia Naturalis" open

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.130
on the desk facing
us, is an indication

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.060
of the traditional
importance of natural history

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.580
in practical therapeutics.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.270
This illustration of the
medical library of Mantegna,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.610
denotes the most
reliable sources according

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.380
to contemporary medical
knowledge.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.920
Established as these books
were, their depiction,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.410
on the other hand is inaccurate
by now-a-day standards.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.520
As you see, the artist is
having a bit of a problem

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.520
with the rules of perspective.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.180
However, a crucial
moment is denoted here.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.340
The science and art of
drawing the third dimension is

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.930
in the making.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:00.730
The second book in our
discussion is an artist book,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.500
titled "The Anatomy
Lesson" conversations

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.650
with Johannes Ketham.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.390
It was published in 2004.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.230
As an artist's book, this volume
features the familiar aspects

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:20.760
of the physical book but
renders its content visually

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.510
with the liberty and endless
possibilities of the fine arts.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:32.350
The result is a piece of
art, which is still a book,

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.300
and demonstrates a distinctive
artistically emphasized

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:43.550
relationship between text
and image, form and content.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.380
The author and the artist

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.250
of "The Anatomy Lesson"
is Joyce Cutler-Shaw,

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.260
an active contemporary
artist among the San

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.190
Diego environmentalist.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.870
She started as a
traditional painter,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.980
and later turned to other media.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.410
An artist interested in science,
she is fascinated by the works

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.300
of Leonardo da Vinci,
and refers to him

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.190
as major inspiration
for her art.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.130
For years, Cutler-Shaw
was artist in residence

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:24.140
at the University of California,
San Diego Medical School.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.680
attended anatomy lab courses,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.480
namely dissections
and drew there.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.000
Drawing is a tool
for the exploration

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.710
of the world, she claims.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.070
The first version of "The
Anatomy Lesson" was designed

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.270
for the science and the
artist book exhibition

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.430
at the Smithsonian
Libraries in 1995.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.490
For this exhibition,

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.790
the libraries invited
contemporary artists to choose

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:03.890
and examine famous rare books
from those that Bern Dibner,

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:10.310
engineer, collector and science
historian considered the 200

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.250
most significant works in
the history of science.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.860
Inspired by the chosen
old scientific volumes,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.140
each artist created
a modern artist book

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.290
to be exhibited together
with the original.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:33.170
Joyce Cutler-Shaw selected
the 1495 Ketham volume

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.290
and with a great amount
of research writing

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:42.280
and artwork her new
anatomy lesson took 10 years

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.540
to appear in its final form.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:59.450
The physical structure of the
two books differ significantly.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.800
The Ketham features
traditional structure.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:10.890
Full page word cuts and
they face mainly text pages.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:24.600
On the other hand, the Joyce
Cutler-Shaw book in her book,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.480
each gathering starts
with a half title page,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.510
followed by two descriptive
expects pages.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:38.070
Which then open up
to a four-panel view.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:43.050
On the left side
we see facsimiles

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.650
from the Ketham volume facing
a new Cutler-Shaw illustration

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.030
and a poem written
by her on the right.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:58.440
The individual segments or
gatherings are bound together,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.700
but act almost like
separate books,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.630
reflecting the originally
disjointed

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:11.020
and only later compiled
content of the Ketham book.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.970
Both books alternate ideas

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.880
from two distinct time
periods in different styles.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:27.460
In the Ketham volume we see
an interplay between medieval

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.090
and renaissance elements.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.580
In content, the book
leads directly back

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.180
to medieval examples
and sources.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.990
Most of the medical ideas
of the illustrations,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:46.990
we will see later, are also
tied to the middle ages.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.150
Nevertheless, the artistic style

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.460
of the Ketham illustrations
represent predominantly

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.050
the renaissance.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.720
Note, the flow of garments.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:06.060
Both, the long academic ropes,
and the nonacademic short coats.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.270
Some feature here and there,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.180
broken straight lines,
more gothic.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:17.190
Others handle the curves
easily, more renaissance.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.700
The architectural elements in
the background, nonetheless,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:28.680
are in pure renaissance form
based on classical example.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.480
Some of the figures involved
Andrea Mantegna contemporary

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.300
drawings, as you see the arrows.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:44.690
Joyce Cutler-Shaw shows the
interplay between renaissance

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.670
and modern components
as she places facsimiles

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.400
of Ketham illustrations
next to her own.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.360
Her energetic drawing
seems to rebel

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.670
against the stiff Ketham images.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.650
In her plates, soulful
modern-day figures appear

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.220
with fleeting emotions
and rapid movements.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.800
Occasionally creating the
impression of motion pictures.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:25.670
Let us now, compare four
pairs of corresponding images

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.500
from the two books and see
how different time periods;

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.420
the middle ages, the renaissance
and the 21st-century,

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:42.320
are woven into the fabric of the
medical and artistic context.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.190
With this comparison,
I would like to argue

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.550
that the 500-year
old book can directly

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.650
and beautifully inspired
fresh content about science

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.990
and humanity in the
most modern style.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:07.800
The first image in our
comparison is the vein man.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.570
A familiar character in
most illustrated medical

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.860
and surgical texts
from the earliest time.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.770
The lines and words surrounding
the figure point out the veins

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:25.740
and arteries on the human
body for bloodletting,

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:31.290
to cure various disease.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.190
The ancient medical practice

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:38.480
of bloodletting governed
therapeutics in the middle ages

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.480
and the renaissance as well.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.680
The Ketham illustration
has numerous examples

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.450
in the medieval manuscript
tradition looking almost

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.310
like immediate predecessors.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:59.540
The figures of the vein man are
point dissimilar in the book

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.100
and in "The Anatomy Lesson."

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.200
The renaissance artists
drew stationary figures

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.760
with single contour lines.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.460
These are easy to
render to a word cut.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.360
And the body is presented

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.800
in an idealized classical
form and pose.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.970
In contrast, Joyce
Cutler-Shaw uses repeated

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.360
and varied contour marks,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.670
like we often see in
Leonardo drawings.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.900
These ragged, uneven strokes
are in constant motion,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.090
expressing fragile
forms referring

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.810
to modern vulnerabilities.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.420
The intaglio method

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.590
of photographer well
complies to the style.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.520
It may appear curious

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.080
that Ketham's vein man doesn't
really exhibit actual veins

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.060
and arteries.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.120
Depiction of these
were difficult

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.570
and the capillary
system was not even known

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.840
yet in the 15th century,

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:18.980
it was first described
Marcello Malpighi in 1661.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:24.780
Familiar with that knowledge,
the modern "Anatomy Lesson,"

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.480
conversely, delineates
the myriad of small veins

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.860
and arteries and other
anatomical intricacies

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.690
in much detail.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:41.860
The following is from
Joyce Cutler-Shaw's poem

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.940
for the vein man
page, and I quote.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:53.280
"Originally barber surgeons
were authorized to use the knife

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.860
for therapeutic bleeding,
as from waist

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.010
for purging melancholy."

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:08.590
So, let us see now how
bloodletting was supposed

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.320
to cure melancholy.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.810
The presumed effect of
bloodletting was based

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.200
on the ancient humeral
theory, which claimed

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:24.280
that diseases were caused by
an imbalance of bodily humors

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.300
such as blood yellow bile,
black bile and phlegm.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.620
The four humors were associated
with the four basic elements.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.260
Air, fire, earth, and water.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.760
And corresponded with four
qualities and four temperaments,

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.700
sanguine, choleric,
melancholic, and phlegmatic.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.040
Another ancient medical
idea embodied

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:04.420
in humanoid form is the zodiac
man, or astrological man,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.990
often depicted in medieval

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.440
and renaissance scientific
illustrations.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.600
With the signs of the zodiac
on certain body parts,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.280
the figure symbolized man's
relation to the cosmos.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.890
In other words, the microcosm
and macrocosm theory.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.460
Each body part is under the
influence of a constellation,

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.230
and the shifting patterns

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.710
of the heavens cause
changes in the body.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:41.460
Thus, the circumstances of the
universe determine what can,

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.340
should, or should not be
done to the body in terms

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.550
of medical procedures
at certain times.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:56.220
For example, when the moon
is in the sign of Aries,

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.520
it is not safe to touch
the head with iron

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.540
or use medications on it.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:12.820
Joyce Cutler-Shaw's zodiac man
brings us into a new world.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.500
Instead of Ketham's standing
figure with the signs

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.410
of the zodiac on
his athletic body,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:26.720
here we see a skeletal cadaver
lying in the pose and angle

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.050
in extreme foreshortening.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.440
Just like the famous
Mantegna tempura painting,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.830
The Lamentation of Christ.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.590
The body's covered
with a shroud.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.450
So, what is the significance
of the shroud

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.830
for Joyce Cutler-Shaw?

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:53.110
It covers and obstructs
the body,

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.730
like the astrology-based
microcosm macrocosm theory

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.060
obstructed real anatomical
knowledge in ancient

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.120
and medieval medical theory
for several centuries.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:13.490
Lifting the shroud, leads to
new anatomical understanding

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:19.850
to empirical science based
on observation and not only

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:23.490
on ancient written resources.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:32.490
The third figure in our
comparison is the wound man.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.740
He has numerous representations
in the late middle ages

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.730
and the renaissance, both
in manuscript and print.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:49.480
This long-suffering character
can bravely bear all possible

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.220
wounds caused by all
possible weapons.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.600
Maybe because treatment
is close,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.530
written right around the figure.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:05.170
The Ketham wound man
has much in common

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:09.040
with the manuscript counterpart.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.030
Each has the same number of
weapons hitting the body.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.550
The weapons are pictured

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.360
in the same position causing
the same kind of injury.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.100
Yet, the artistic style
is very different.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.010
The late medieval image
features a schematic rendition

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.450
of the human body in a
somewhat awkward pose.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.880
Whereas the Ketham figure
radiates naturalistic

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.370
renaissance harmony.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.840
I'm trying to start
a video here.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.360
The modern version
of the wound man

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.840
in "The Anatomy Lesson"
draws our attention

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.630
from the wide array of
early weapons and wounds

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.230
to ultimate destruction.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:19.750
In her dramatic image, Joyce
Cutler-Shaw concentrated

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.720
on human's ever escalating
skill to devise more

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.060
and more deadly weaponry
throughout history.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.040
And especially in
the modern era.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.850
Her illustration for this
topic commemorates the tragedy

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.610
of the victims of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:46.530
She conducted thorough
research for these pages,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.430
which extended not only
to scrutinizing rare books

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.770
but also visiting
military museums.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.430
The last Ketham illustration

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:07.500
in our comparison is
titled traditionally,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.800
The Anatomy Lesson, and
depicts dissection scene.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:18.110
It was not yet present in the
1491 first edition but appeared

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.580
as a new image in 1493,

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:26.920
when Mondino de Luzzi's anatomy
text was also newly added

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.220
to the volume.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.000
The appearance of this image,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.910
and the new text marks a
transformational moment.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.940
It represents that what we
described as the lifting

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.250
of the shroud by
Joyce Cutler-Shaw,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:49.660
mainly the beginning of
observational anatomy.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.070
The central figure
here is the surgeon,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.210
who exemplifies specific
practical

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:02.330
and professional competence
at the moment more important

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.850
than the academic rank

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.500
of the professor sitting
in the background.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.800
It is also notable that
the other central figure

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.470
in this illustration
is the student.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:24.950
This is Joyce Cutler-Shaw's
"Anatomy Lesson" illustration.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:31.450
She writes in her poem, "Anatomy
by authority from a book,

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:37.570
as a professor reads from
his cathedra, as physician

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:42.870
and obeisance students stand
below to watch a barber surgeon

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:48.330
of the lowest rank to
perform the cuts until dazzled

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:54.670
by computerized cadavers,
3D artists spin their magic

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.560
for students at their screens.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.980
And finally, the volume of

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:16.490
"The Anatomy Lesson" has an
intricate stitched concertina

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:20.150
binding, which was co-defined

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:24.330
by Joyce Cutler-Shaw
and Daniel Kelm.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.440
The brown paper on the spine
is a continuous sheet folded

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.930
in accordion style to
create narrow tabs.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.170
Between two tabs stitching
fastens each gathering

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:48.750
to three white linen bands
going across the spine.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.100
On the front cover,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:57.760
a holographic image shows an
18th-century lancet in 3D.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.970
The book then fits in
an elegant metal box.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.910
Ketham's volume is
called a herald

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.970
in the development of science.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.950
And it marks the dawn
of empirical anatomy.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:23.020
It is also considered one of
the most beautiful books made

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.240
in the first century
of printing.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.110
Joyce Cutler-Shaw's modern
rendition is not only an equally

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.500
beautiful reworking
of the Ketham book,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:41.700
but also thought-provoking new
creation through its own merit.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.780
She thus, summarizes
her artistic intents.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:52.560
I am interested in
new iconography

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.060
without losing a sense
of the physical self.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.790
More and more in media, we
are fragmented, time-eclipsed,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.920
dissolved and scale shifted.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.720
We read ourselves
miniature on screens.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.450
I want to have a
contemporary language

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.720
that addresses this
kind of fragmentation.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.570
And I also want to
put it in the context

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:27.290
that makes us aware
of the whole.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.970
I think Joyce Cutler-Shaw has
wonderfully achieved these goals

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:40.610
in her book, which was
inspired by the age-old Ketham.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.410
Thank you.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:49.500
[ Applause ]

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.030
&gt;&gt; Katherine Blood:
Good morning.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.100
I'm Katherine Blood, the
library's curator of fine print

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.770
in the Princeton
Photographs Division,

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.070
where I have the opportunity
to work with everything

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.690
from etchings by
Rembrandt and Mary Cassatt

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:20.790
to born digital artists
protest posters from the Library

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.330
of Congress collections.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.710
Here, on the second day

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.050
of our symposium exploring
scientific illustration

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.680
and intersections between art
and science it is my pleasure

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.020
to introduce artist and
neuroscientist, Dr. Greg Dunn.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.780
Dunn, who received his PhD in
neuroscience from the University

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.940
of Pennsylvania in 2011, has
devoted his career to the fusion

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.160
of art, neuroscience
and engineering

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.870
to explore the mystery
and beauty of the mind.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.570
Working with fellow artists
and applied physicist,

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.790
Dr. Brian Edwards, Dunn has
created an extraordinary

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:03.370
mind-bending and extraordinarily
beautiful artwork called

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.230
Self-Reflected, which we will be
hearing about in detail shortly.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.820
Dr. Dunn's larger body of work
also reflects his admiration

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.310
of Asian art and
aesthetic connections

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.240
between neuro features and
tree-like branching forms

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.450
that suggests Sumi ink
scroll and screen paintings

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.010
from Japan's Edo period.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.700
Other artworks carry titles
like Cortical Columns,

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:34.180
Neuro Migration, and my personal
favorite, Brainbow Hippocampus.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.660
In exploring Dunn's work, I
started seeing connections

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.070
with aspects of artworks
I've had the opportunity

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.370
to spend quality time with,

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.550
with my own personal
bias and interests.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.570
Including artist responses to
issues of the body and health

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.010
and the environment for example.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.160
I thought of Eric Avery.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.350
An artist, printmaker and
longtime practicing physician,

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:59.860
known for his artworks
responding to the AIDS epidemic

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.160
and related to other infectious
diseases including performative

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.950
on-site testing for
diseases in artist settings.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.860
I also thought of Sandy
Gellis and her Spring

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.040
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.880
It's a series of abstract
images with marks made

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.850
by laying etching plates
exposing her etching plates

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.290
to rain and other
natural elements.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:27.190
And of course, we could go on
and on and pause at a multitude

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.130
of kindred spirits from
different approaches.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.160
But I came away feeling

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.380
that Dunn's work really also
fills utterly unto itself,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.860
with wonder and deep
first-person knowledge

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.920
as key ingredients.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.430
You can read media responses
to Self-Reflected in "Wired,"

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.530
"The Atlantic," and "The
Huffington Post" to name a few.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.590
And when talking about the work
in a filmed PBS segment called

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:55.000
"Greg Dunn Thinking About
Thinking," Dunn explained

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.360
that the reflective
micro-etching technique

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.360
that he uses was always in
service to the idea of how

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.500
to show the brain in all
of its full complexity.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.310
He has also placed his
impulse to depict the beautiful

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:11.640
in science and nature within the
larger art historical movement

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.680
of naturalism but using
modern technology toward

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.710
envoi naturalism.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:20.410
Deeper still, Dr. Dunn
invites us into a shared state

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.150
of meta-awareness, in
considering his art,

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.350
saying in his words,
"Self-Reflected is designed

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.810
to reflect what is
occurring in our own minds

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.440
as we observe this work of art.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.150
Reminding us all that the
most marvelous machine

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.870
in the new universe is
at the core of our being

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.340
and at the root of
our shared humanity."

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.510
Now, to guide us on this journey
please welcome Dr. Greg Dunn.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:53.810
[ Applause ]

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.980
&gt;&gt; Greg Dunn: Thank you
very much Katherine.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.980
Thank you to Mark and
Stephanie in the Library

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.320
of Congress for having me here.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.850
And as excited as I am
to be here, I have to say

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.250
that the most exciting thing
for me right now is that unlike

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.280
in the dram that I had the other
night, I actually remembered

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.540
to put pants on this
morning [laughter].

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.310
So, I'm pleased that that.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.960
So, I have a lot to say, so
I'm going to get started here.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.260
And I want to talk a little bit

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.480
about the intersection
of art and science.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.840
And what my definition of it is.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.490
This is an oil painting,
incredibly.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.300
And this, in my opinion
is a science experiment.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.480
Why? If you had 100
sufficiently skilled artists,

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.550
the results of their
experiments would be identical

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.780
because they're referencing
external reality

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:45.660
to collect the data to be
able to make this work of art.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.960
Which is exactly what you want

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.890
when you're doing
experiment in the lab.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.870
Science is about describing
the external universe.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.630
Whereas art if you want
to think about it in terms

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.380
of this spectrum, I think is
more about bringing something

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.140
out of our subjective
of experience

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.810
into objective reality for
others to be able to appreciate.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.040
So, this Gerhard Richter
abstract piece might have been,

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.470
you're asking an artist paint
what frustration feels like.

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.860
And every single artist is going

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.170
to paint something a
little bit different.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.520
Because it's not something
that we can really reference

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.850
through external reality.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.150
And almost every single thing

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.400
that we do all the time is
some blend of those two things.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.700
Like this Craig Mullin's piece,

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.870
where he clearly understands the
rules of how the universe works;

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.750
perspective and the
reflectivity,

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.050
and this sort of thing.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.010
But brings us to a place
which doesn't actually exist.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.700
And I think that this is
the most fertile territory

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.510
for both art and science.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.130
And scientists, I think are
constantly intuitively turning

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.780
inward in order to
gain inspiration

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.080
for their experiments as well.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.820
So, how does this
kind of translate

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.610
into scientific imagery?

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.000
Well, this is a photomicrograph.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.810
If you're infusing fluorescent
proteins into a section

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:53.510
of tissue, this is pretty much
as verbatim as you're going

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.390
to get in terms of being able
to analyze the anatomy here.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.410
Whereas this would be the
other side of that spectrum.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.830
A representation
of the brain done

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.280
in watercolors by
Holly Warren here.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.390
But I'm going to go here and a
little bit out on a limb and say

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.570
that Santiago Ramon y Cajal
who is widely recognized

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.050
as the godfather of
modern neuroscience.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.110
He won the Nobel Prize in
1906 for Spain for some

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.880
of his work kind of
elucidating the world of neurons

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.180
in the neural circuitry.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.330
As you can see here on the
right that you have some

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.430
of his slides immediately
juxtaposed

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.810
with his illustration
of the slides.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.200
And at this time, a lot

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.150
of researchers were using a
technique called camera lucida.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.930
Which is a technique
that enables you

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.990
to sort project the image of
a microscope onto a surface

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.280
so that you could
trace it more or less.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.570
And Cajal used this
only sparingly.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:51.880
And what I don't think is really
appreciated as much these days,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.150
and it's a little bit of a
difficult comparison to make

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.740
because imaging technology
is so vastly superior

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.930
to what it was in Cajal's time.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.180
But when you're looking at a
slide, it's one very small slice

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.280
of a much more complex system
that you're looking at.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.580
These neurons are snaking

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.880
around in three dimensions
you're looking

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.180
at a lot of different slides.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.720
You're bringing in the
context of your other knowledge

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.500
about neuroscience in order
to interpret what's happening.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.000
And Cajal, I think,
rightly recognized

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.730
that making an illustration

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.710
that caricaturing the circuit
was actually a more effective

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.550
way to communicate these
difficult points then was

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.470
showing a photograph, verbatim.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:30.530
And when I think
about, you know,

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.410
what the average person thinks

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.220
about when they think
about their own mind.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.700
The thing that is at the
most fundamental aspect

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.620
of who we are as people.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.320
The sort of depressing answer is

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.450
that this is probably what
most people think about.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:47.550
It is a translucent blue walnut
with lightning coming out of it.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:52.060
As is sort of the
illustration meme de jure.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.360
And this is another kind
of common one that you see.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.000
You know, neurons floating
in space with a little bolt

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.890
of electricity traveling
between them.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.370
Which is illustrating the
point that neurons communicate

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.670
through action potentials.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.060
Which are indeed, darts
of electrical potential

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.300
which travel along their axon.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.440
Which is the part that
communicates activity

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.070
to downstream neurons.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:14.590
And that receives
these electrical inputs

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.690
through their dendrites,
which is their kind of branch

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.270
like structure that they use
to collect information from.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.750
And they also kind of look
like those robot octopuses

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.320
from "The Matrix to me.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.750
So, this is telling you a
little bit about the brain.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.600
This is just a tiny fraction.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.210
The brain has 86
billion of these things.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.510
And that's only the neurons.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.610
There's a lot of other
stuff going on as well.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.190
So, in terms of being
able to elucidate

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.980
for the average person what it
is that were dealing with here,

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.510
I think these communicate
a very specific point,

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.730
but not a particularly
broad one.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.750
And a lot of people are familiar

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.050
with the scientific
imagery here.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.350
This is a functional
magnetic resonance image.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.060
And this is telling you
while you're in the scanner,

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.910
what might be happening
in your brain

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.560
when you're picking your
nose, for example in this.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.060
That's the brain area
that controls that.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:11.870
And this is telling us that
the brain is compartmentalized

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.700
in terms of its activity.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.300
And I suspect that these
types of images were also key

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.480
in communicating the incorrect
conclusion that we only use 10%

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.100
of our brains at any
really in totality.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:31.880
Which is so utterly ridiculous
as to, it boggles the mind.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.140
If the most energy hungry part
of our body was only using 10%

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.300
of its capacity, then
evolution would have evolved

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.600
that out instantaneously.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.790
It is completely incorrect.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:47.710
So, this is now more of the kind

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.320
of fluorescent scientific
imagery.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.210
This is probably, some

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.530
of you may have seen
this type of thing.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.050
And this is starting to
belie the true complexity

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.700
of the anatomy here.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.510
Of course, this is not
telling us what it looks

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.810
like in three dimensions.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.110
And typically, microscopy
is only able

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.960
to show us a little
bit at a time.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.050
And it's not able to show us
how the brain evolves in time,

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.960
and what it looks like in time.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.310
Which is really one of its
most incredible aspects.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.610
And of course, we're
all familiar

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.970
with what the meat
of it looks like.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.300
And I remember holding a
brain in graduate school

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.600
and being surprised

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.150
at how little you can actually
understand about it just

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.450
by holding the thing
in your hands.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.980
It's like all the vein
diagrams as Lilla was talking

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.290
about earlier, pointing to
all the different regions.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.060
It is very difficult
to tell what going on.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.610
It's just this kind of peach
and lighter peach color,

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.530
kind of intermixed int his way.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:43.640
So, I became kind of inspired
to represent the brain

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.880
in different qualities
and methods

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.290
when I was in graduate school.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.200
And one of the reasons
is you're just exposed

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.760
to so many gorgeous pictures
of the brain all the time.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.610
And I've always been a
fan of Asian art too,

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.910
which is part of this context.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.470
This is one of my
favorite paintings, the red

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.770
and white plumb blossoms.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.090
This is the from the
Edo period in Japan.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.670
And this type aesthetic was also
happening in China and in Korea.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.670
And one of the things
I love so much

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.170
about this art is
typically that it's sparse.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.810
There's a lot of negative space.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.150
And they tend to emphasize
the incredibly beautiful

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.400
and spontaneous branching
patterns

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.830
that you would find in nature.

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:23.050
One thing that's difficult to
paint, that's difficult to do

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.290
in this type of painting is
that your brain is not good

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.930
at generating randomness.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.370
It tends to want to build
patterns out of things.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.150
So, actually the Zen approach
is to paint and to try

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.040
to release your mind
from its instinct

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.220
to make those types of patterns.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.690
But what I found when I was
looking at neurons all day is

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.490
that these branching
patterns are absolutely

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.260
in common with neurons.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.770
And the reason is that nature
has encountered a similar

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.220
problem at different scales.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:57.040
In the world of neurons, the
goal is to splay your dendrites

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.700
out in order to collect as
many synapses as possible,

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.470
whereas a tree, of course,
is trying to collect

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.770
as much light as possible.

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.930
A lightning bolt is trying

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.400
to discharge its electrical
potential down to the earth

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.760
and it finds the path
of least resistance.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.760
That's essentially what
this shape is, it's the path

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.230
of least resistance,
which is controlled

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.330
by other detailed variables
depending upon the system.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.630
What I didn't have,
unfortunately,

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.050
for the astronomers in the
audience, which there are a few,

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.350
is that the orientations

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:26.870
of galactic super clusters also
look like this neural shape.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.480
This is a fractal.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.690
And fractal is a common
shape which repeats

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.090
through different
orders of magnitude.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.840
So, some of my initial
work, like this piece Basket

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.400
in Pyramidals which is you
know, a simple ink painting

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.660
on gold leaf, is as much
a declaration saying

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.150
that the world of neurons fits
very cleanly into the canon

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:52.120
of Asian art, but also that
the world is made of fractals.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.450
Because somebody who doesn't
know about neuroscience,

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.440
might look at this and
say, oh this is trees.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.990
But it's kind of not like trees.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.290
What's going on here.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:02.410
And to have somebody be in
that state of uncertainty

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.870
for a little while
is kind of the point.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:09.210
That there's a comfortable kind
of presentation of the idea

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.510
that then stretches you

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.740
as you consider it a
little bit more deeply.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.280
And to further this point home,
these are some of the scrolls

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.590
that I painted, and still
paint every once in a while.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:19.830
This one on the left
is of the retina.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:24.420
Here's one of after sights, and
one of the emerging complexity

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:28.140
and kind of opaqueness of
complexity in the brain.

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.620
And this is to further
drive that point home

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.000
between the connection
of these two worlds.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.110
I began to experiment with
reflectivity in my art

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.770
as something akin to form and
color in order to emphasize.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.680
You can draw the viewer's
eye to specific things

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.980
when you're using reflectivity.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.890
And it's not something that
has been very deeply explored

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.190
in the history of art.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.510
And so, unfortunately, I don't
have a video of this piece,

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.700
but when you move around
it, those white stripes

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.370
or these lighter stripes
right here would actually move

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.670
depending upon where
the light is.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:01.950
My sister kind of describes
this as looking like the scales

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.970
of a trout is the idea.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.180
And it puts things into
and out of silhouette.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.170
Here's a piece of
the spinal cord.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.880
And Pedro was saying yesterday,

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.230
which I thought was a really
good point is that it's nice

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.960
to be able to give
somebody familiar context

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.580
when you're describing
something is unfamiliar to them.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.340
And so, this piece I
kind of stylized to look

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.300
like the blue iridescence
of a morph of butterfly

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:30.130
as the anatomy of the structure
is definitely reminiscent

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.590
as such.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.010
Katherine mentioned, I'm
really interested in the idea

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:40.860
that your brain has evolved
to investigate itself.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.750
What a weird concept that is.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.250
And this piece is really
exploring that idea.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.020
that this is a multi-electrode
chip.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.590
So, right now in neuroscience

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.490
at the forefront you stick
these electrodes in the brain

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.690
and are reading the
brain activity

00:43:55.690 --> 00:44:00.570
of this neural network here
and you're reading essentially,

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.510
these electric pulses which
are going between the neurons.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.020
And this piece is
style is to look

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.950
like almost an alien
abduction to call you know,

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:13.650
the point being that there is
the sort of strange relationship

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.410
to the brain wanting
to understand itself.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.520
This piece is called
Axon Pathfinding,

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.880
and it's about chaos that
emerges when you have many,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.220
many axons growing towards their
locations at a similar time

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:29.390
and make chaotic patterns
which emerge from that process.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.140
This piece is called
Hippocampal Formations.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.500
The hippocampus is
a part of the brain

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.600
that controls learning
and memory.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.900
And this is equally inspired
by the hippocampus itself

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:41.960
and by the erosion patterns
in the desert in Jordan.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.400
I was looking at some
satellite imagery

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.410
and sure enough rain hitting
mountains and then shedding off

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:53.930
into the rivers down below is
also major solution in a path

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:56.730
of least resistance that
really resembles this type

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.030
of neural form.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:00.880
So, this is kind of a hybrid,
and again is commenting

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.000
on that fractal nature
of the universe.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.390
And I do occasionally do things

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.120
which are not related
to the brain.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.210
This is a recent piece called
Photosynthesis which is about,

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.640
a simulation of how nutrients
and water would be transported

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.050
in the vasculature of leaves.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.820
But this this next
piece, Self-Reflected,

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.590
is I think a categorical
difference

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.510
in how I had been
illustrating the brain

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.480
and painting up to this point.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.860
And it emerged from an
existential frustration

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.850
that I felt in graduate school.

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.150
Where you're working

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:37.080
on a project that's
pretty complicated.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.790
You make a breakthrough
on it and you feel

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.150
like you finally understand
something about the brain.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.170
And Lester Hubris,
take you to a place

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:46.630
where you really shouldn't be.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.340
And lest your hubris
take you to a place

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.090
where you really shouldn't
be, it's always a good idea

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.390
to be searching the
literature and find

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:52.690
out what other people
are thinking about that.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.870
Which point you find 600 papers
that you had never considered

00:45:55.870 --> 00:46:00.050
and then you consider that the
amount that people actually know

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:05.260
about the brain is a fraction
of what is actually going on.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:10.510
So, to be able to communicate
the incredible awe and beauty

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:11.940
that I saw in the brain.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.630
I wanted to invent a technique
that would be able to kind

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:20.950
of communicate that emotionally
and perceptually to people.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:23.030
So, what you're about to see
is a reflective micro-etching

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:26.780
and this is the world's
most complex depiction

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.080
of the human brain.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:48.040
[ Music ]

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.580
[Background Music] This
is what's happening

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.680
in your brain at this moment.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.210
This is not a digital
piece of art.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.700
This is a physical
object hanging on the wall

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.210
which is being illuminated
from overhead

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:03.160
by various light sources.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:10.150
This is the collective
simulated activity

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.260
of half a million
neurons at once.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.220
And this object is made
of millions and millions

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.170
of tiny etches that
are microscopic

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.630
in the surface of
this gold plate.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:31.870
The color that you're seeing
is not inherent to the piece,

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.170
the color comes from the fact

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:35.730
that there are these different
colors of light source which are

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:38.230
above the piece and are
reflecting off of the service.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.590
So, really the aesthetic
innovation

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.260
of reflective micro-etching is
the color has now been turned

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.130
into an infinite variable.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:50.450
This is a demonstration of when
you're passing kind of a sheet

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.880
across the various lamps
that are over the piece,

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.460
and you can see that each one
of those colors has essential,

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:01.510
a channel of reflectivity,
which it's optimized towards.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:09.140
[ Music ]

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.860
So, this shot now is really the
meat of what the project is.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.390
This is what it is
in animation mode

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.260
when the light is
draping over the surface.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.370
And you'll see in the lower
left-hand corner here coming

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.460
up that this is where we
are zoomed into the piece.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.630
And right now, we're
in the cerebral cortex,

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.220
which is that walnut shaped
covering of the brain.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.560
This right here is
the parietal cortex.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.420
Where you're integrating your
vision and your movements.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.870
So, you're reaching
out to pet a cat

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.900
or to punch somebody
in the face.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.790
This is the somatosensory
cortex.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.670
This is where you
would feel sensations

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:44.630
on your skin, for example.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:49.360
Right now, coming into the
motor cortex, this contains some

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.250
of the largest neurons
in the body.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.820
And these are the types of
calculations that are being made

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.690
when you're playing
piano for example.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.380
And you're learning, and you're
refining these circuits in order

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.850
to optimize what it is that
you're doing with your brain.

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.990
And you can see how the neurons
are arranged in these kind

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.090
of laminar type structures.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.210
Particularly, in the
rear part of the brain

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.890
where they communicate both
vertically and horizontally

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.570
to integrate information.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.300
And as we continue here
into the frontal cortex.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.820
So, we're about right
here right now.

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:22.120
Right behind the forehead.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.590
You'll notice that the activity
becomes more chaotic here.

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:28.270
There's a lot more
interneurons which help

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:30.820
to refine the local circuitry.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.120
This is the part of the brain

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.980
which is controlling
logic and planning.

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:39.790
And this is what differentiates
us from the higher primates.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.050
This region of the
brain spins on its own,

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:45.310
even without any sensory input.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.680
This is what thinking
looks like.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:57.640
And these neurons are sending
their information down,

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.400
back into the central
brain structures which tend

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.400
to be the more evolutionarily
distant types

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.950
of very basic emotional
movement type centers.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:13.460
And now we're getting
into the basal forebrain

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.570
where you have a lot of
the structures involved

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.320
in motivation and reward.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.940
That big burst that
you'll see at the bottom

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.300
of your screen right
there, is what it might look

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.720
like when something pleasurable
and unexpected happens,

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.250
or like snorting a line

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:31.500
of cocaine would be the
activation of that region.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.800
We're now in the
basal ganglia here.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.100
The caudate nucleus.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.700
This is where you integrate your
kind of logical perceptions.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.750
Your emotions, your memories,
your sensory perceptions

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.100
in order to plan your movements.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.220
And now, we're in the
thalamus which is the very,

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.520
very center of the brain.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.170
And there is so much
stuff happening here.

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:53.720
So many things being
routed in and out.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.920
And the way in which this is
region gates information allows

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.580
us to pay attention to
things more or less.

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.820
There's a lot of important
regions involved in attention

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:08.690
and arousal, and these large
tracks coming down here,

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.900
which are coming from the
motor cortex will become the

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.200
spinal cord.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.990
And are executing the movements
that you are planning kind

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.910
of in your higher
order cerebral.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:21.770
A lot of these structures here

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:24.060
in the brainstem are
very basic to life.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.490
Like breathing and hunger.

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:29.900
And now we're getting into the
cerebellum, which is right here

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.060
at the very back of your
brain, which is kind

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.510
of a brain in and of itself.

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.530
This involves movement
and proprioception,

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.720
which is how you sense
your body in space.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.180
And this region by
itself contains half

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.480
of the neurons in your brain.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.340
There are 50 billion
neurons in this region.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:51.620
Coming back up, now
the spinal cord

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.700
and we see the colliculi here
this is for auditory information

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.170
and for visual information,
respectively.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:03.310
And then we're coming into,
back around to where we started.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:05.830
This is the lateral geniculate
nucleus of the thalamus

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.130
which is receiving information

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.080
from the optic nerve,
from the eyes.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.870
Which is sending
information here

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:12.450
to the primary visual cortex,

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:15.100
where these neurons are
calculating very simple things

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.400
about your visual system,

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.320
like where all the
angles are for example.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.970
And that gets passed up into
higher order visual cortex here.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.890
So, that is what
Self-Reflective looks like.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.910
And of course, I want
to credit my good buddy

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:35.200
and collaborator Brian,
who also worked tirelessly

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.530
on this project.

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:38.980
So, what is a micro-etching?

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.900
So, I mentioned again
previously,

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.130
that a micro-etching is
millions of tiny little etches

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:48.010
in the surface of
a metallic surface.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.630
This is a very, very close up
photo of what that looks like.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.450
You can see that whatever
is a specific color is made

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.260
up of etches of a
specific angle.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.110
So, the blue is at a different
angle than the red is.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:02.370
But again, the color is not
inherent in the surface.

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:06.040
Nor does the color from light
splitting off of the surface

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.780
like you seen a hologram.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:11.080
It's due to the fact that the
lamps are different colors.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.150
And that the consequent of
that is that when you move

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:16.720
around this those colors
are going to be shifting,

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.720
which is how we are able to
engineer the lighting in this.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.340
And this is what that
the surface looks

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.840
like under scanning
electron microscope.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.800
This is a 1200 x
image on showing you

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.020
that we have these
wavelike reflectors.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.640
And this kind of doesn't
look like anything here.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.120
But the business end of
this is so abstract compared

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.890
to what the macroscopic
perspective of it is.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:39.190
And just quickly, I
wanted to show you this.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:41.150
So, this is really
the primary data,

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.910
which goes into the
creation of this piece.

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.400
Just look at this little
structure right here that's

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.900
going out here, this
little dendrite.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.420
You can see that the
angle changes gradually

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.840
as you move across the surface.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.560
When a light moves over that
surface, the consequence

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:59.370
of that is that you're going
to get this angle is going

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:02.940
to be optimal to where the light
is at a very specific point.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.880
So, you'll see a bright
spot originate here,

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.710
and then travel along
the structure,

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:10.010
which is how we're able

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.800
to achieve those animated
effects using this technique.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.920
And around this time,
and I'm forever grateful

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.320
to the National Science
Foundation for believing in us

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.730
to give us this grant
to fund this project.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.500
Because we're essentially
funding a visualization.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:28.230
And the thing we told them is,
look, we're in the golden age

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:29.530
of neuroscience right now.

00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:32.130
I consider it of great
philosophical importance

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.430
that people have a more
enriched understanding

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:35.890
of what their brain is.

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:39.400
And the goal of this
project is to change the way

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.810
in which the average person
thinks about their brains.

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:44.260
And they indeed rewarded
us with the grant.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.580
And we were very
grateful for that.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.880
So, one of the first
things that we had

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.400
to decide is what
we're going to show.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.190
And we decided to show
a sagittal section,

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:54.960
oblique sagittal, so it's coming
through your head like this.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.040
Because there's a lot of
really interesting structures.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.240
You can show things to their
completion and it seemed

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.600
like a good region to begin.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.560
And this is a representation of
the best data that was available

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.760
at the time for the human brain.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.290
Compared with the
resolution that we were trying

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:15.020
to work with, this was
woefully inadequate.

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.730
So, this piece would not scan.

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:19.080
It's so far from that.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.490
It was made entirely
from scratch.

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:24.290
And I'll tell you more
about how that was done.

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:26.670
And one of the things I
really want to emphasize too,

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:30.690
is that there was a lot of
kind of balancing the art

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:32.360
and the science in this piece.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.150
You know, what are the things
that are crucial to be able

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:37.400
to show verbatim and
what are the things

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.850
which could be bent
a little bit in order

00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:42.320
to make a point more strongly.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.230
And one of the things that
was really nice actually

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:48.590
in some ways at least, is
that the state of the data

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:51.820
in the human brain is so poor
compared to what it would be

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.920
in mice, or rats, or even like
a rhesus monkey that we just had

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.550
to fill it in you know, with our
best guess in a lot of cases.

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:02.540
So, this is a map of where all
the gray matter regions are.

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.650
Gray matter is where
the cell bodies are.

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:06.780
So, each color here is
indicating a different

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.080
functional region.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.380
This is a rough map.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.350
It's more complicated than this.

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:14.360
But with the help of some
of our neuroscience students

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.430
at the University Pennsylvania,
we went through each

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.990
of these regions and just
did a ton of research

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.110
in the primary literature as
to what the neurons look like,

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:22.410
what they're connected to,

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:25.170
what their firing patters
are like, blah, blah, blah.

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:27.510
So that we could
get this accurate.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:30.210
And as there were no
really good pictures

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.890
for what all the neurons look
like, and because I wanted

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.710
to infuse more of an artistic
sort of flare to this.

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:39.240
Almost an abstract
expressionism,

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.020
using the technique
I'm about to show you,

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:44.540
we decided to paint all
the neurons by hand.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.760
[Background Music] So, this
technique was invented to get

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.400
over the fact that your
brain again is terrible

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.190
at generating randomness.

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:57.530
When you try to paint neurons
with your hand, you're going

00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:01.000
to put a node every 2
centimeters and you're going

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.700
to find that rule, and you're
going to undo it and then some

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.480
of the rule is going to emerge.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.360
With this technique,
you're allowing nature

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:12.110
to make fractals, just
like it wants to do.

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:15.440
You have loose control over it,
but the turbulence of the error

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.770
and the inconsistency
of the fiber direction

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.270
of the paper is going to cause
that ink droplet to split

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.820
up into these beautiful
fractal -like patterns,

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:26.080
which are highly reminiscent
of neurons to begin with.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.430
So, we painted about 150
different categories of neurons

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:31.490
and a few examples of each,
scanned them into the computer

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:35.540
and turned them into vector
objects, which we then used

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.320
to paint the gray matter down.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.730
We painted down about a million
neurons using this technique.

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:44.790
So, that's how the
gray matter was made.

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:48.360
But the white matter is
in this image right here,

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.660
whatever is black stained

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.980
in that image is what
the white matters.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.410
The white matter
are the collections

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:55.630
of axons traveling long
distances, carrying information

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.480
between the different
brain regions.

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.060
And what's impossible
to see in this image is

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:02.900
that this is incredible very,
very beautiful structure,

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.560
very complicated of
many highways kind

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.470
of traversing one another.

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:11.400
And so, we had to send
our friend Dr. John Pyles

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:15.240
into the future with this time
machine to bring this image back

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.650
to us via diffusion
spectrum imaging.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:23.740
This is a render of a magnetic
technique that's similar to MRI.

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.850
And we filtered this dataset to
be in the plane of our dataset

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:29.280
that we're interested in here.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.510
And this became then, the
inspiration to paint all

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:34.890
of the vector shapes of
the axons by hand as well.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:37.230
So, this was done mostly
in Adobe Illustrator.

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:39.700
And this is an example
of two of these sets.

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:46.140
These are cortical sheets that
we used to input into the piece.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:49.030
So now we have a lot of neurons
and we have a lot of axons.

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:53.070
But there is no connection,
nor causality sort

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.950
of between these circuits.

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:56.360
And as complex as
it was already,

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.950
this has already
taken over a year.

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:01.850
This next part is really what
brought the piece to life

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.750
and infused the third
dimension into it.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:07.900
Because micro-etchings
essentially allow you through,

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.600
through reflectivity to impart
a third dimension into the art.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.130
And in this case, it's time.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:15.730
So, you have a neuron, it
fires an action potential,

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:17.430
it travels down its axon.

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:19.670
You have a group of
neurons that's communicating

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:23.770
with a downstream group of
neurons, via their axons.

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:26.960
So, this is one step of
choreography as we called it.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.990
One set of neurons communicating

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:31.790
with the next downstream
set of neurons.

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:34.230
And this is what my
artist palette looked

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:35.990
like at some point.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:37.970
So, less you think that
as an artist I was walking

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:41.340
into my studio and flinging
my cape off and saying,

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.860
well what am I going
to create today.

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.790
I sat down in front of this
damn computer and just,

00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:49.300
it was basically
coding at some point.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:52.570
There's about 30 variables
controlling the speed

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:55.060
of the impulses, whether or
not the neurons are firings

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.450
as a group or individually,
etcetera.

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:58.940
And there's about
there's about 600 lines

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.240
of this choreography here.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.220
So, this is much more like
taking some artsy fartsy hippies

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:10.310
and forcing them to do the
most brutal corporate taxes

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.360
[laughter] that have existed.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.840
So, this is definitely a bridge

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.260
between art and engineering
here.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.300
I don't have a whole lot
of time to go into this.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.880
But what I wanted to say

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.440
with this slide is again
we're dealing with time here.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.620
So, when we're programming
a circuit, neuron a is going

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.090
to fire at time equals 0.

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.510
Neuron b is going to fire

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.430
at time equals some
time later than that.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.620
And when we're working with
two-dimensional images,

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.690
the way that we encode that
time is through hue space.

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:40.700
Through these different colors.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.800
So, neurons which
are firing early

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.730
in the animation
will be a red color.

01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:48.110
Then you'll see the orange
neurons, then the yellow ones,

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.090
then the green ones,
blue ones, etcetera.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.090
So, as the light moves
over it, you're not going

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.900
to see these colors
in the final piece.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.760
You're going to see the
neurons which are red

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.590
in the computer data
as being illuminated

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:03.790
when you're standing all the
way to the left of the piece.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.670
And then if you were to walk
from one side to the other,

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.960
you'd see the orange ones,
yellow ones etcetera.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.330
So, this is a close up of
what this render looks like.

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:15.120
And this is what the whole
brain looks like after,

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.950
I don't even remember
it was days' worth

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:20.470
of crunch time for
this algorithm.

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:23.590
To give you a sense of what
the complexity of the math is

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:28.060
like here, it's similar to a
logistics company's solving,

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.960
we need to deliver 100
packages and we need

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.170
to find the optimal
route to do it.

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.510
Which is a notoriously
challenging math problem.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:36.150
There's a lot of different
variables at play there.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:39.280
And we're doing this for
half a million neurons.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.630
So, that took a good long time.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.900
And then the question
is how do we turn this

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.300
into a physical object, right?

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.220
Because we now have this
data in the computer,

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.630
but we need to turn it into
the physical micro-etching.

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:52.700
We have the data plotted
out into two dimensions,

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:57.200
and we have this third
dimension of color in the piece.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.030
So, the thing that
you must know.

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:01.060
The very first thing
you need to know is

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.560
where the light source
is going to be.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.060
And let's just choose
any pixel randomly

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.980
on the surface micro-etching.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:11.720
We know based on that pixel's
color where we want the observer

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.200
to be able to see it from.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.710
So, we know then what the
position of the viewer is,

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:17.760
and we know the angle
that we need the light

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.660
to come off of that surface at.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:23.070
Knowing these two angles, now,
this angle to light source,

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.370
this angle to the observer.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:27.160
We can now extrapolate
the angle at which we need

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.210
to make a little tiny
mirror at that spot.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:32.480
And rather than make
bevels like in a diamond,

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.070
which would be reflecting a ray
of light to very specific point.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:38.220
We're actually making
little cylinders

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.770
which splay the light out more.

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.150
So, that if you're
short or if you're tall,

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:44.000
you can see the reflections
coming off of it.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.410
And we're actually, for each
pixel making a little grid

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:51.150
of these cylindrical reflectors.

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:54.010
So, the rendering
at the end of this,

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:56.870
is we've increased the
resolution by factor of 10,

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.640
And this is what it looks
like in great detail here.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.990
So, you can see the
outline of a neuron here.

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:07.430
Which is made of one
specific angle of hatching.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.080
Those are printed
onto transparencies

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.380
at ultrahigh resolution.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.420
You would never be able to
see that with your naked eye.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.350
The feature size in this is
about 100 microns which is

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:20.970
about as big as an
average human hair.

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:24.170
Then we used those
transparencies

01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:25.860
to do photolithography.

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.380
This is how computer
chips are manufactured,

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.150
and how etched plates have
been made in the past as well.

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:33.820
So, you start with
a sheet of steel.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.980
We laminate a photoresist,

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.700
which is an ultraviolet
light-sensitive polymer

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.000
on top of that.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.730
And then we put our
transparency on top of that.

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:44.400
So, of course, in the
transparency you have regions

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.060
which are printed and
regions which are clear.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.440
When you turn on the UV
light, the light penetrates

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.580
through the clear
region and polymerize,

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.950
makes that part directly
under here hard.

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.430
Everything else underneath the
black printing is protected

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:03.570
by that black printing,
it remains soft.

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:06.470
So, turn off the UV light,
remove the transparency,

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:08.900
dip the whole place
into a basic solution.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.220
And it eats away anything

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.780
that was underneath
those black lines.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.580
And we can do this in
very, very high resolution.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:18.180
So, you're using light, and
chemicals, and transparencies

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.810
to essentially burn this
image into three dimensions.

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:25.610
Here's some images of
laminating the materials.

01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:28.260
This is in the clean
room in the studio.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.840
This is the UV light
source right here.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.700
Here's the plate being
exposed on the wall.

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.400
And so, now this is what the
photo-resist surface looks like.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.250
That's where the etching
is actually done in,

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.680
it's this dark purple,
which is reflective,

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.520
but not super reflective.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.790
And because this art is
completely based upon

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:48.860
reflectivity, we need to
brighten it up a little bit.

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.830
And we learn that gold leaf
is the perfect solution

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:53.130
to this problem.

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:56.760
Because gold leaf is super
thin, it's 200 nanometers thick.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.460
So, it's so much thinner than
our relevant feature size

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.810
that it's not going
to fill in all

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:03.290
of our topography and wreck it.

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.580
It's malleable enough
that you can force it

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.970
into all those tiny
little crevasses.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:11.500
It's never going to tarnish,
and it looks awesome.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.870
And everybody likes gold.

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.220
So, it was the perfect
engineering

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.620
and aesthetic solution
to this problem.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.040
This is the initial kind
of lining up of the plates,

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.310
which then needed to be
cut down in the final step,

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.790
and here's Brian here, when
we developed this method

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:27.780
to cut these plates to
within about 100th of an inch

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.910
of one another, so that they
would line up seamlessly.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.420
And this is an assembly of nine
of those plates on the floor

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.520
of my studio on the first
day that we assembled.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.240
And Brain stressing out
about some tiny little detail

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.310
that nobody would ever see.

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:45.380
We built a light source for
the piece where it's installed

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.120
at the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia,

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.840
so that we could get
all these effects.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.860
These are some of the
students that worked

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.350
on it with us, and us.

01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:55.840
This kind of looks like
the Ghost Busters' car now

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.560
that I look at it
better right here.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.190
And this is what the
image looks like just

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.740
under a single white light.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.400
But again, a micro-etching
has so much flexibility

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.190
in how it's viewed that this is
only a fraction of the amount

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:08.870
of data which is really in it.

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:10.920
You can put different
colors of light around it.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.190
This image just won the National
Science Foundation's Science

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:16.760
Engineering Contest last year.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.890
And it's surrounded by three
or four different lights.

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:24.320
And here's just some other
quick, kind of close-ups

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.120
of what the image, or
the piece looks like

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.790
and that color is
kind of cool here too

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:31.250
because color is
indicating what is firing

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.550
at that particular moment.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.610
So, all the red neurons in
this image would be firing

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:36.200
at the same time.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.990
So, there is data encoded into
the colors of these images.

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:43.650
And this is what it looks
like in situ in the museum.

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:47.410
And I can guarantee you

01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:49.860
that there were many times
during the production

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.210
of this piece, for the three
years of my life it took

01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:56.200
to make this thing, the hardest
thing I'd ever worked on,

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.160
where I was asking myself,
why am I doing this?

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.030
You know, like what really
is going to come of this.

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:07.500
And the thing that really kept
me going was imagining a kid

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.970
going into this museum
and standing in front

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:14.130
of this gigantic gold
glittering object.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:18.360
And have the light strafe over
the piece for the first time.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.760
And the kid to look up
at it and just say, wow.

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:26.490
And then for them to jump
up and down and run off

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:28.510
to the next thing and mash
buttons somewhere else

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:31.250
in the museum, or
for them not to.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:34.020
Or for them to look
at it more deeply.

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.320
But, you know what.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.830
I don't care if people
look at this piece

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:41.950
and they don't remember
that the thalamus

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:43.920
and the cortex have
recurrent connections.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.160
Or they don't understand
where the cerebellum is.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.060
I don't care about any of that.

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.120
All that's there if
you're looking for it.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.040
The thing that's most
important about this piece is

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.690
that it makes that initial
emotional impact we learn

01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:58.990
through our emotions.

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:01.010
It's the most important
thing we can do

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.830
to communicate effectively
with people.

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:12.490
Excuse me, and to that end,
one of the most important parts

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:16.600
that I learned in grad
school was this idea that,

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.760
so the visual system is
ridiculously complex.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.390
I mean we're very
visual creatures.

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:23.340
We navigate the world with it.

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.300
And we use vision to
keep us safe, right?

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.440
We need to be constantly
analyzing our environment

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.700
and make sure we don't get
bitten by a snake for example.

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.750
And milliseconds here.

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:34.170
So, when light hits your retina,
it goes to the optic nerve

01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:36.840
through the thalamus and into
the primary visual cortex,

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.250
where you have you're
processing again.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.580
Things like basic angles.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.120
You're combining those
into form, you're looking

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.150
at whether motion is happening,
you're looking at color.

01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:47.890
And these are higher
order structures

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.660
where the information
gets passed to.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.620
But this is being processed
largely in parallel,

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.530
which is a more efficient
processing technique.

01:08:55.530 --> 01:08:57.340
If you were to process
it in series

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.620
where each step is contingent
on the data being complete

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.800
from the previous one, it would
take a lot longer to do this.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.240
So, you need more machinery
to process in parallel,

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.780
but you can do it faster.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:10.210
Basic form and silhouette
information is being siphoned

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:13.430
off of this pathway and is being
sent to your limbic system.

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:16.070
Which is basically
your emotional systems,

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:17.720
the amygdala right here.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.860
This is before you're seeing it.

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.410
This is way subliminal.

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:24.170
You're not actually
consciously aware

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.780
of what's happening
at this point.

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:31.110
It's being processed through the
amygdala for emotional valance.

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:33.170
It's making sure that
there's nothing happening

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.380
in your visual field,
which is a threat.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.400
Because if there is,
you want that data

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.230
to be there as fast as possible.

01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:43.740
Which is why you get it there
in as early a state as possible.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:47.100
Then that data is sent back
into your visual system

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.670
and is combined with the
rest of what's happening

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:52.440
in your visual system to
actually make this world

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.320
that we're seeing
on a daily basis.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.140
But the implication of this is

01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.060
that you are not
seeing verbatim reality.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.110
You're seeing what your
emotions are coloring for you.

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:06.660
And I'm sure many of
you can understand

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:10.330
that the implications
of this are extreme.

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:11.630
And we don't have time to talk

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:13.920
about the societal
implications of this.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.950
But in the context of
art, what's important is

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:20.310
that your silhouette
has got to be strong.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:22.440
Because it's being analyzed

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:29.480
for emotional character before
anything else is even happening.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.570
Illustration and making fine
art can really teach you a lot

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:34.940
about what your subject
material is too.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.940
And I learned some interesting
kind of meta-realizations

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.540
from essentially
building a brain.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:44.770
This one in particular,
normally people think

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:47.740
about brain development as
taking place with genetic

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.240
and epigenetic components.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.240
So, genetics, of course, are the
genes we get from our parents,

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.750
our hardwired DNA sequences.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.050
Which control who we are.

01:10:56.050 --> 01:10:58.930
Which control how neurons grow
and find their destinations.

01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:00.790
And then you have epigenetics.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.950
Epi meaning outside of genetics.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:06.410
This is how our environment
controls the expression

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:07.710
of our genes.

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.740
It's basically the software
of how we are functioning.

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.410
So, you could have a gene
which is folded up in its DNA,

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:17.610
in such a way the
machinery can't access it.

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.250
So, the genes can be turned on

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.530
and off via these
epigenetic mechanisms.

01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:26.140
So, via these two
mechanisms you have billions

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:30.130
of axons growing towards their
targets in early development.

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:34.270
Try to imagine what it's like at
a place like St. Mark's Square

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:37.150
in Venice, where you have many
inputs into this huge plaza

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.480
which is just packed
with tourists constantly.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.980
And they're all trying
to get somewhere.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.860
And they're all bumping
into one another,

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.290
and they're all generally
getting to where they're going

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:49.180
with a large amount of chaos
happening at the same time.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.650
This is what's happening in
early development as well.

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:56.460
Such that, if you had
even an identical brain,

01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:00.460
in an identical environment
that the randomness involved

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.860
in this process, particularly
you're talking about billions

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.080
of objects moving against
one another at the same time,

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.790
means that the brain is going to
develop differently every time.

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:12.370
At this resolution
you're looking at it,

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.960
you might not be able
to see a difference.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.420
But the devil is definitely
in the details here.

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:22.580
Where an axon might arrive
a little bit off target.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:27.190
And if any of you have built
complicated things in your life,

01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:30.730
you know that as you approach
perfection, once you get

01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:34.930
that last 1% of details,
that last .01% of details,

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:39.180
or even more detail than
that, the ability to reach

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.100
that perfection becomes fleeting
and basically impossible.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.450
And in particular
when you're working

01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:47.320
with a system this complex.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.710
The brain knows this, and
it is compensating for it.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:56.590
The brain over connects
early in development.

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:58.900
It's at its maximum potential
early in development.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:01.350
This is why your damn
kid can learn words

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.230
in a foreign language
way faster than you can.

01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:05.030
Because their brain is much
more plastic it has way

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.410
more potential.

01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:10.510
Then, the brain perfects itself
depending upon what input you

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:11.810
give it.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:15.110
So, in early life you know,
if you're reading a lot,

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:17.200
if you're playing outside
a lot, if you're you know,

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.510
learning a new language,
something like this,

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:23.490
it prunes away the irrelevant
connections and leaves you

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:26.050
with a much more kind
of refined template

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:28.480
than you would have
had otherwise.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:35.820
And now, I guess kind of in sum,
just talking about what I try

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:40.640
to make my illustrations
to be and what I think

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.190
that Eleanor really
did very well yesterday

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.490
in some of her pieces.

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:46.790
Particular her Mars map,

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:50.300
I thought it really encompassed
a lot of these very well.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.380
Is what components you need
in a truly effective image

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:55.990
that can change people's
perceptions.

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:58.540
I mean obviously the scientific
content has got to be there.

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.200
And it's got to be right
and it's got to be clear.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.640
Having it be emotionally
engaging is also extremely

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.380
important because people
have got to care about it.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.930
There's way too many
things to learn

01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:10.670
about in our world right now.

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:13.450
We're consuming more data
at this moment than we have

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.070
in history by orders
of magnitude.

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:18.010
So, your thing had
better be interesting

01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:19.760
and emotionally engaging.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.010
Adding your own kind
of aesthetic and style

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:24.990
to it can also help to
differentiate it a little bit.

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:29.610
And one that I, like a practice
that I use too is to use what's

01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:34.250
out there as almost a
negative inspiration in a way.

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:39.260
To use it as a constraint to
further refine my thinking away

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:42.290
from what currently
exists in the world.

01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:45.980
Because there are a lot
of terrible ideas in here.

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.080
And one of the reasons I
become better as an artist is

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.360
because I've been better at
figuring out what is a good idea

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.660
and what isn't a good idea.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.960
What do you want to
spend your time on?

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.730
I mean I don't think that
it's a measure of success

01:14:56.730 --> 01:15:00.070
to relentlessly throw yourself
at a problem until you solve it.

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:03.940
It's much wiser to figure out
if a problem has potential early

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:06.950
on so that you can prune
it off and save your time,

01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:09.360
other than waste your life.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.370
So, when all these things are
there, and like I said with some

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:15.380
of Eleanor's pieces yesterday,
this was me at the center

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.060
of the Venn diagram [laughter].

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.470
Because that's how
the world moves ahead.

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:27.050
The humble scientific goal
of Self-Reflected was to blow

01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:28.690
as many minds as possible.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:32.200
That was that what we
were really going for.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.060
So, if you want to
read more about,

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.390
there's a bunch articles
about this.

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.620
This is some of the place that
my work is hanging as well.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:42.960
And I wanted to thank
sincerely, Mark, and Stephanie,

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.510
and everybody at the
Library of Congress

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:45.880
for giving me the
opportunity to speak here.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.590
And all the scientists,
and artists and physicians

01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:52.000
who contributed their knowledge
and expertise to this project,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.310
as well as the students,
of course.

01:15:55.310 --> 01:16:01.470
And that's, in the long-term
goal of this project again is

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:03.320
to transform the way in which
the average person thinks

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.620
about the brain.

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.440
So, some of the next steps
are in getting these pieces

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.800
into museums around the world.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.260
And not just science museums.

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:13.150
I want to get them in
contemporary art museums.

01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:18.690
Because I think that it would,
this term, neo-naturalism is one

01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:22.410
that I'm trying to throw
around a little bit.

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:26.370
About this is a step forward in
the sense that I want to be able

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:29.330
to show things that the
average person just can't see

01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:30.630
with their naked eyes.

01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:32.970
I mean we, as scientists,
are incredibly privileged

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:35.100
that we get to use these
sophisticated tools

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.400
to see what many can't.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.980
And I think bringing that
to the public's imagination

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:42.660
and inattention is
an important goal.

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.270
So, I'll be around afterwards
if you guys want to chat.

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:46.940
I have a sample of
a micro-etching

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.480
to show you if you're
interested.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.510
And thank you so
much for listening.

01:16:51.510 --> 01:17:02.500
[ Applause ]

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.290
&gt;&gt; Shelby Callway: All right.

01:17:11.290 --> 01:17:12.590
Morning everyone.

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:15.010
My name is Shelby
Callway, I'm the historian

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.320
at the US Department

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.770
of Agriculture's Natural
Resources Conservation Service.

01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:23.670
And I'm delighted to be here
at this wonderful symposium.

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:25.500
And to get to introduce you all

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.590
to our next speaker,
Dr. Catherine Newell.

01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:32.200
Professor Newell holds a
PhD from UC Santa Barbara,

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.610
and currently serves as a
professor of religious studies

01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:37.930
at University of
Miami in Florida.

01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:41.750
She has far too many honors for
me to list them all right now,

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:44.400
but just one that seems
especially relevant,

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.820
she's also the 2017/18
Larson Fellow in Health

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.670
and Spirituality
here at the Library

01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:53.350
of Congress' John W.
Kluge Center for the Book.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:55.240
Dr. Newell is an
outstanding scholar

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.120
of both the phenomenology
of religion

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.610
and the history of science.

01:17:58.610 --> 01:18:00.930
Her research focuses on
the conjoined histories

01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:02.430
of religion and science.

01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:05.250
Particularly, the way in which
scientific paradigms frequently

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:09.030
owe their genesis to a
religious idea or belief.

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:11.050
Her forthcoming book,
which intersects

01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:12.440
with several areas
we've discussed

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:17.020
at the symposium is tentatively
titled "The Wheels of Titan:

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.050
Faith, the Future and
the Final Frontier."

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:22.740
The book traces post-World
War II American zeal

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.250
for space exploration back

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:27.410
to 19th century religious
discourse surrounding belief

01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:29.520
in American manifest destiny.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.870
The volume focuses on
the artists, historians,

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:34.540
and scientists who
popularized space expiration

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.350
by framing the conquest
of the final frontier

01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.950
as a modern religio-cultural
legacy

01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:42.550
of the conquest of
the American west.

01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:45.080
I'm sure you're all going to
want to rush out and buy it

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.520
as soon as it becomes available
after you hear this talk.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.510
So, please join me in welcoming
Professor Catherine Newell.

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:57.500
[ Applause ]

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.520
&gt;&gt; Catherine Newell:
Good morning.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.190
Thank you for that.

01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:13.270
And thank you for
having me here today.

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:15.760
And I would say especially
thank you to Stephanie.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.750
She told me about this symposium
I think it was this summer.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:25.000
And I said I want to come, and
she said, you want to present.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.570
So, here I am.

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:28.700
It's very exciting.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.920
So, what I want to talk about
today is a little bit having

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:34.270
to do with again my
forthcoming volume,

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:40.030
and in particular the question
of where we got the idea

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:44.020
that space is the
final frontier.

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.720
So, it's not something
that maybe would occur

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.450
to us naturally to look at say
the surface of Mars, and say,

01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:55.790
let's go there and explore,
on you maybe, not me.

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:59.180
But, I think for a long
time we've had a narrative

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.490
that this comes from
science fiction.

01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:06.330
The most famous split
infinitive in TV history,

01:20:06.330 --> 01:20:09.180
'seek out new life and new
civilizations and boldly go

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.380
where no one has gone before.'

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:15.620
And that's at least
partially true.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.800
I found this letter to Willy
Ley, one of the people I'm going

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.190
to talk about today, in the
archives of the National Air

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:26.930
and Space Museum being
thanked by Gene Roddenberry,

01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:29.800
himself inviting him
to come visit the set

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.480
of his very successful
television show, saying,

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.660
'we're looking forward to
meeting one of the pioneers

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:39.080
who made a space travel
television show possible.'

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:43.450
So, again these intersections
of science, arts,

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:46.220
culture, popular culture.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:50.130
But Gene Roddenberry
did not invent the idea

01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:53.440
of space as a frontier.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.090
And in fact to understand more
about why we think of space

01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:03.240
as our frontier, it's useful
to look back to images

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.670
that we're actually
surrounded by all

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:07.100
over here in Washington DC.

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.490
We're going to see
a lot of them today.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:13.060
And this is actually one of the
later images I will talk about.

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:18.190
It was I think it even just
started life as a lithograph

01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:22.750
in 1872 and it was
meant to illustrate

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:24.050
and it's very problematic.

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:28.630
And I know that we have people
fleeing before the power

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:33.260
of the image of Columbia,
heading west

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:37.030
from the east bringing with
her technology, like railroads,

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:40.190
and telegraph wires,
and chasing all

01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:43.630
of the scary people
out of the way.

01:21:43.630 --> 01:21:46.230
But it's useful as
a representation

01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:49.090
of this concept of
manifest destiny.

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:52.580
Because even though we associate
manifest destiny with this kind

01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:59.130
of conquest of the west,
it's also alive and well in

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:02.830
and around, particularly
the history of space

01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:05.930
and most particularly
for my purposes,

01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:10.600
what the people I called
the space proselytizers.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.900
That even proceeded

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.990
to the American space
program were revitalizing

01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:17.440
with their work and their art.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.240
So, today we're going
to be talking

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.750
about these two gentlemen.

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.720
On the left, we have Chesley
Bonestell, actually sitting

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.850
in front of his background
for the film

01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:30.210
"Destination Moon"
that he designed.

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:33.290
And next to him is Willy Ley.

01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:35.330
Bonestell was an
architectural designer,

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:36.970
he became a movie
special effects artist.

01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:38.930
We'll talk more about that.

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:41.300
And Ley actually started
his career in Germany

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:45.370
as a rocker expert
and science reporter.

01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:49.800
And together they are more
than the sum of their parts.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.910
I believe they created one
of the most influential books

01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:56.420
on space exploration,
possibly ever written.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.450
It was written for lay
audiences, published in 1949.

01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:03.350
And build as a preview

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:06.770
of the greatest good venture
awaiting mankind with texts

01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:11.050
and pictures based on the
latest scientific research.

01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:12.990
And we'll get more into it.

01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:17.020
but Ley and Bonestell wanted
to introduce the possibility

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:20.440
of the exploration of space,
but the idea of exploring space

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.870
in 1949 was so implausible
to the average person

01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:29.020
who maybe wasn't engaged in
science fiction, that the two

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.950
of them had to connect
space exploration

01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:34.000
to its more terrestrial cousin.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.370
The historical conquest of
the American west we saw

01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:38.910
in that John Gast painting.

01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:43.870
So, the idea of exploration, and
the eventual settlement related

01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:46.380
to the exploration of
outer space in general,

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.110
and for the purposes
of this book,

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:50.290
our solar system in particular.

01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:54.010
So, what was at stake in
their idea of conquest

01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:56.950
of space wasn't homestead
and settlements,

01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:00.100
but actually the acts
of exploration itself.

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:04.410
So, I'm a scholar of religion
and we love having ideas

01:24:04.410 --> 01:24:07.290
to frame what we do so we can
point at them and say, well,

01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:09.430
I'm saying it, they're
saying it.

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:11.360
So, the person I
am using to kind

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.170
of frame this conversation
today is Edmundo O'Gorman

01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:18.650
in his 1961 book, "The
Invention of America."

01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:21.870
He said that the old notion
that imprisoned the world

01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:26.690
within the bounds of an island
had been overcome with this kind

01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:30.240
of so-called discovery
of the new world.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:34.240
That essentially, it wasn't
just that Columbus sailed away

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.590
in 1492 and suddenly a
new world was discovered.

01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:42.360
It was more that when he came
back, there was a reframing

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.360
of our understanding
of the world

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.730
and that was the
invention of America.

01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:50.690
And I just want to point out
that this image, I just found

01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:54.880
out the other day is actually,
it might have been done

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.640
for the Adler, I
meant to look it up,

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.700
but it's obviously an image of
earth rise from the moon done

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.710
by Chesley Bonestell, and
I think it was 1951 or '52

01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:07.490
and it's going to be at the Air
and Space Museum, nest year.

01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:10.580
So, they are in the
process of flattening it out

01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.480
and making it look pretty
again, because it's been

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.130
in storage for a while.

01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:17.380
But, so, O'Gorman's idea

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.050
that the old nation then
imprisoned the world

01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:21.980
within the bounds of the
island had been overcome,

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.360
the possibility was open
of accepting as parts

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.850
of the world not only all that
is contained in our planet,

01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:31.360
but also other planets and
any other heavenly bodies.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:36.590
So, again this expansion of
our understanding of who we are

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:38.320
and where we are
isn't just limited

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:42.740
to what O'Gorman called
a lump of cosmic matter

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.820
that already existed, but
can be given a new life

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:51.070
and be discovered, in the case
of America, or become explored

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:52.440
in the case of the solar system.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.400
And that itself is
a kind of invention.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.070
So, in order to close the gap
between remote physical frontier

01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:03.120
and the anticipated
imaginary frontier,

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.410
the method of discovery
needed to be a new technology

01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:11.590
that merged the fantastic
with the scientific.

01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:14.830
So, what we're going to talk
about today is the ability

01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:18.200
of scientific illustration,
specifically,

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.770
the science of space art

01:26:19.770 --> 01:26:23.680
to introduce space exploration
to reveal the future.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.270
So that one does not need to
believe without having seen.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:30.670
And our space program's
founders were pretty clear

01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:32.980
that the space program was one

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:36.060
of the biggest institutionalized
acts of faith

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.800
in all of human history.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.270
But I choose to talk about
the scientific illustration

01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:44.770
of space art, because Bonestell
and Ley were not only able

01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:48.440
to capture the scientific
elements of space exploration,

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.100
but also tapped into
a revitalization

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.670
of American faith
and manifest destiny.

01:26:53.670 --> 01:26:57.460
This belief that Americans are
destined and called to explore

01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:02.000
and settle the frontier, in this
case, the frontier of space.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.260
And just a shout out from
everybody's favorite public

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:11.170
scientist, that's Carl Sagan
was one of the first to say

01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:16.050
that Bonestell's images helped
him understand what it was he

01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:18.230
was actually looking
at and looking for.

01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:23.300
So, we're going to be looking at
mostly his images between 1944

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:29.370
and 1955 as an invitation to
explore and discover new worlds.

01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:33.730
So, go back to 1944.

01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:36.670
With this issue of
"Life Magazine."

01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:39.370
It was published
on May 29, 1944,

01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:41.260
it was a week before D-Day.

01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:43.920
And two weeks after this issue,

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.070
this cover would feature
the very famous photos

01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:51.870
by Robert Capa of the
Beach at Normandy.

01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:54.790
And this issue, you can find it
online, it's pretty ordinary,

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:57.720
it's full of war news,
and black and white photos

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.500
of the European front.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.400
But at the back of the issue,
there's this article titled

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.880
"Solar System" it is modelled
in miniature by Saturn,

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.330
its rings and nine moons.

01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:11.190
And even the advertisements

01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:13.720
in this issue reference
the war effort.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:19.570
So, this article seems
a little bit off topic.

01:28:19.570 --> 01:28:22.060
And it's actually, the
exception that proves the rule.

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.520
It is virtually the only
six pages in the magazine

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.730
that don't mention the war.

01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:29.840
And in contrast to the issues
of black and white photos,

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:32.360
it's the only portion
of the magazine

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.550
to have full color pictures.

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:38.230
And so, the article's
purpose is revealed

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.890
in this first paragraph,
which I'm sure you can't read.

01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:44.170
But, it promises a visit
to the planet Saturn,

01:28:44.170 --> 01:28:46.810
where the pictures show the
changing aspect of Saturn

01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:48.750
and its satellite
family as it would appear

01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:52.210
to a traveler hopping towards
the planet from moon to moon.

01:28:52.210 --> 01:28:56.050
These astronomically accurate
pictures are photo montage

01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:58.020
paintings made by
Chesley Bonestell,

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:02.290
Hollywood miniature set
designed and amateur astronomer.

01:29:02.290 --> 01:29:04.760
So, we've heard a little bit
about Bonestell yesterday.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.740
But he actually started
his career as an architect.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:10.670
That was a compromise with
his grandfather who said,

01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:12.720
I think people have had this
conversation with their kids

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.660
from the beginning of time,
I will only pay for you to go

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.970
to college if you
do not study art,

01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:18.800
and study something practical.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.650
So, their compromise was
he studied architecture,

01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:25.950
and as we'll hear, he
eventually left architecture

01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:28.600
to become a matte
painter in Hollywood.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.140
But he's remembered
today primarily

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:33.270
as the father of
modern space art.

01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:37.350
He was born in San Francisco
in 1888, he lived until 1986.

01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:40.560
So, he saw the whole
span of space exploration

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.660
and space science be
revealed over the course

01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:46.730
of his almost century-long life.

01:29:46.730 --> 01:29:48.980
And throughout that long life,

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:51.900
his two great loves
were art and astronomy.

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.650
And he liked to joke
to his friends

01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:58.210
that he was an astronomer
to his architecture friends

01:29:58.210 --> 01:30:00.050
and an architect to
his astronomer friends.

01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:04.580
So, kind of living
between these two worlds.

01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:06.960
And, again, he eventually
left architecture.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:11.290
Probably one of his most famous
contributions to architecture

01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:13.960
as a designer was the exterior

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.780
of the Chrysler Building
in New York City.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.850
It's one of his better-known
projects.

01:30:18.850 --> 01:30:20.970
But just before he
left architecture,

01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:25.670
he worked with Joseph Strauss,

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:30.240
who was constructing
this mad idea for,

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.260
following through this
mad idea to put a bridge

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:35.990
over the Golden Gate
Street in San Francisco.

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:40.790
And Bonestell was recruited to
work with Joseph Strauss et.

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:45.260
al. Because Strauss was an
architect and an engineer.

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:50.100
And he couldn't explain to the
directors, i.e., the money,

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.670
where the money allocated to
the plans were supposed to go.

01:30:54.670 --> 01:30:58.200
Strauss thought in
architectural renderings,

01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.860
but Bonestell thought
in pictures.

01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:05.910
So, Bonestell's drawings of
how the project would progress,

01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:09.470
and you can see the
sinking of our pillars here

01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:12.760
and the ghosted outline of
what will eventually become the

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:18.660
bridge, were put together to
give to the Board of Directors.

01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:23.380
But actually, were repackaged
as a booklet that was available

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.910
to be purchased at newsstands,

01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:28.580
called "The Golden Gate
Bridge a Technical Description

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:31.170
in Ordinary Language."

01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:36.200
And I love this pamphlet because
it's Bonestell in a nutshell.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.910
Because it's this tremendous
architectural engineering

01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:46.550
triumph that is rendered in
these clear and really nice

01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:50.060
to look at images that
include tiny people

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.960
that are showing kind of
the scale of the project

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.980
that is being attempted.

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.760
And this was actually
the last thing he did

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.180
in architecture more or less.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:05.080
The bridge was completed in 1937
and Bonestell left San Francisco

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:10.150
for Hollywood to work
as a matte artist.

01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:12.610
Before we had computers that
did a lot of things for us

01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:16.440
and this is still skill that
shows up in some movies,

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:20.500
there were artists who
were skilled painters

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:24.460
that created backgrounds for
foregrounded live action shots.

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:26.150
And the matte artist's job was

01:32:26.150 --> 01:32:28.820
to render a background
that textureless.

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:30.880
It was supposed to
look like the film

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.450
in which it was being
merged with.

01:32:33.450 --> 01:32:36.600
And this is from "Citizen Kane."

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.500
This is one of the first films
that Bonestell worked on.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:47.130
And a history of a book, that's
the history of matte artistry,

01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:50.770
they actually quote
various matte artists

01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:53.140
who still can't believe the
Bonestell managed to match

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.920
up the shadows with
the image and the door.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:58.420
So, this art is still
responsible for some

01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:03.200
of our favorite, well my
favorite scenes in films

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.120
and it's still considered
a very technical

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.230
and very important skill today.

01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:13.550
But, again one of the first
films that Bonestell worked

01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:20.100
on was "Citizen Cane" and he
was particularly interested

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.420
in Orson Wells opening
shot of Xanadu,

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:24.910
which is Charles
Foster Cane's castle.

01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:30.120
It begins at the gates of the
castle, and through a series

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.230
of dissolves we move, some
people probably remember this,

01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:36.480
we move through the
gardens, then to the zoo,

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.780
then to the front door.

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:42.420
And then we kind of float up to
the window of Cane's bedroom.

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.990
And in each shot, the castle
gets bigger as we get closer

01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:49.140
to it but maintains
its aspect ratio.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.640
In other words, it
illustrates a journey.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.310
And this is what gave
Bonestell the idea

01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:58.000
for a journey to
the plant Saturn.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.150
Because as a fan of astronomy,
he's been incredibly frustrated

01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:05.890
with the current
status of space art.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:09.370
It was either scientifically
correct, but maybe not

01:34:09.370 --> 01:34:12.670
that lively to look at.

01:34:12.670 --> 01:34:17.790
Or it was fantastically lively,
and moderately inaccurate.

01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:20.790
So, he wanted to use
his technical skill

01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:24.130
as an architectural designer
and his artistic skill

01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:28.170
as a matte artist to do his
own version of space art

01:34:28.170 --> 01:34:30.480
and essentially improve
on techniques

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.090
that people had used before.

01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:37.820
So, this is why life promises
us a visit to the planet Saturn,

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.160
even ending on the
planet's surface.

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:45.100
So, we start out
on a tiny Phoebe

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.900
where Saturn is still far
away, but the view of Saturn

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:51.500
from Phoebe is almost exactly
proportional to the perspective

01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:54.220
of the moon seen from earth.

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:56.980
And, at this point,
Phoebe was thought

01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:58.520
to be Saturn's most
distant moon,

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.310
we now know that
that's not true.

01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:03.960
But, from there we move
to Lapetus , where,

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.360
please note we have tiny
explorers here toddling

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.370
around the canyons there.

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:12.980
And then, the one-two of
them all, the Saturn scene

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:16.910
from Titan, which is probably
not only Saturn's best-known

01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:19.650
moon, but this image made
it into your program,

01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:23.580
this is almost definitely
Bonestell's best-known painting,

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.900
and another artist actually
called it the painting

01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:27.880
that launched 1000 careers.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.890
Because so many people, like
Carl Sagan were inspired

01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:33.890
to become astronomers,
astrophysicists, astronauts,

01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:36.050
engineers, space artists.

01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:38.390
And ironically, Carl
Sagan was one

01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:41.260
of the scientists
responsible for the discovery

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:44.180
that Titan's atmosphere
is actually opaque,

01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:45.890
so you would never have
this view to begin with.

01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:47.290
So, oh well.

01:35:47.290 --> 01:35:51.780
From there we go to Dione,
which is known for its volcanos.

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:55.940
So, we're looking at Saturn
from inside of a lava tube.

01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:59.880
Our last moon is Mimas,
where Saturn is so close

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.050
that it fills the entire sky.

01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:04.560
And you can actually see
the shadow of Dione there

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.470
and the shadow of the rings
being cast on the side.

01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:12.780
And finally, we go to
the surface of Saturn.

01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.150
We're actually looking up
through the methane clouds.

01:36:15.150 --> 01:36:18.360
Standing just a few degrees
north of the equator.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:22.180
And to get this perspective,
Bonestell stood himself

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:26.470
at 15.5 degrees latitude in
Saturn's northern hemisphere.

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:29.100
And as Willy Ley later
explained, if you were on earth

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.220
and wanted this view of Saturn's
rings, all you would have

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:35.130
to do is go to Guatemala
and look up.

01:36:35.130 --> 01:36:37.670
And this is an image
by Ron Miller.

01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:40.880
He's a contemporary
space artist.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:43.790
But what was perhaps the
most extraordinary element

01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:46.170
of the paintings was
the stylistic choice

01:36:46.170 --> 01:36:50.120
that enchanted Bonestell's
first admirers.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.370
So, in the foreground of two
of these paintings as we saw,

01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:55.280
there are tiny people.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.480
They first appear
here on Lapetus.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.280
They are also again on Mimas.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.910
And they're wearing spacesuits

01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:03.540
that are pretty prescient
for 1944.

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.250
They shielded helmets
and oxygen packs.

01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:09.940
And all five of these figures
are depicted inspecting this

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.310
rocky new frontier.

01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:16.590
So, even though one very
unimaginative editor

01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:19.260
at "Life" felt to explain
that they were put there

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.970
for perspective, what Bonestell
was doing was adding more

01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:25.430
than perspective.

01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:29.810
He was brought back to life the
Hudson River School of painting,

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:32.270
an artistic movement that
faded with the closing

01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:34.240
of the Western frontier.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.400
And Bonestell's assertions that
his paintings were based on fact

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.420
and not fiction placed
in the legacy

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:43.380
of these romantic landscapes of
the 19th century of painting.

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.280
And has actually led some

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.880
to call Bonestell the
last Hudson Valley River

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.600
School artist.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.220
So, beginning in the
Hudson River Valley,

01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:00.080
which the father is
considered to be Thomas Cole.

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.260
In the decades leading into
and out of the Civil War,

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.000
these paintings evolved
with the time

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.380
to share the cultural enthusiasm
for exploration and expansion,

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:11.700
but also expressed a
nationalistic belief

01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:16.320
that nature was both a source of
spiritual renewal and a location

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.970
of cultural and national
identity.

01:38:18.970 --> 01:38:24.830
And here we have this is
actually the explorer Ferdinand

01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:30.100
Hayden and presumably a
Native American guide standing

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.800
on the edge of the Grand
Canyon of the Yellowstone.

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.150
And of course, you can see this
painting just down the road.

01:38:37.150 --> 01:38:39.360
But we know Bonestell was
a fan, or we can conjecture

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.280
that he was a fan because he
frequently reproduced elements

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.580
of those paintings in his own.

01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.970
And this is from another
article in "Life Magazine"

01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:52.580
about the origins of the earth.

01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:56.370
But the scope of Bonestell's
paintings of Saturn's moons

01:38:56.370 --> 01:39:00.150
and the diminutive foregrounded
figures set against a backdrop

01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:02.280
of a frontier are
tropes in these paintings

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.120
of the American west
made by some

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:08.450
of the school's most famous
artists, such as Thomas Hill,

01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:11.930
Frederick Edwin Church,
Albert Bierstadt's.

01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:15.990
Note the tiny train coming
through the mountain there.

01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:19.090
And especially Thomas Moran.

01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:20.490
But I just wanted to
show really quick.

01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:23.530
So, this is an image that
Bonestell did in 1949,

01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:25.770
the same year that the
"Conquest of Space" came out.

01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:29.270
And this gentleman in the red
shirt here is actually Chesley

01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:30.570
Bonestell, Right.

01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:35.480
So, a little picture of home.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.730
So, artists like Moran travelled
with government research teams

01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:42.300
to explore the Yellowstone,
the Grand Canyon, the Rockies.

01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.060
And brought back
landscapes of vast panoramas,

01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:47.910
which included scientifically
precise renderings

01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:51.150
of regional flora and geology.

01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:53.030
And Moran's images
were significant,

01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:56.170
not only because they encouraged
further scientific study,

01:39:56.170 --> 01:40:00.410
and ultimately the preservation
of places like the Yellowstone

01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:04.730
for their remarkable scientific
curiosities full for freaks

01:40:04.730 --> 01:40:06.520
and phenomena of nature.

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.500
But also, because they
revitalized the sense

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:11.690
of a calling to settle and
explore that had been lost

01:40:11.690 --> 01:40:14.820
in the spiritual
crisis of the Civil War.

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:17.290
And that spiritual crisis
was answered with calls

01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:19.880
to explore God's new
Israel, in the language

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:22.020
of many of these proponents.

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:23.860
And double down on
their sense of a faith

01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:26.380
and a calling to
conquer frontier.

01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:29.040
But in the same way
that Moran's paintings

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.290
of the western frontier
comforted a nation unsure

01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:33.340
of their next step
after the Civil War,

01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:36.470
Bonestell's images were a step
towards revitalizing a sense

01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:39.900
of faith and calling, and
an evocation of a nostalgia

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.780
for the exploration of
the western frontier.

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:46.590
And actually to show viewers
something beyond the horizon

01:40:46.590 --> 01:40:49.480
of the Second World War,
this is actually a quote

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.450
from a gentleman from Ohio,
writing letter to the editor

01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:56.690
about three weeks after
these images appeared

01:40:56.690 --> 01:41:00.480
in "Life" saying, "If mankind
in its frenzy should succeed

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:03.140
in utterly destroying itself,
the destruction would create not

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.500
so much as a ripple
in the great universe

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:08.220
of which we are only
an insignificant part.

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:11.270
May "Life" publish more about
the universe that we may learn

01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:15.490
from its law and
order to avoid war.

01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:19.130
And they also arguably,
these paintings,

01:41:19.130 --> 01:41:24.150
evoke what Elizabeth Kessler
calls the astronomical sublime.

01:41:24.150 --> 01:41:27.640
An extreme aesthetic experience
that threatens to overwhelm even

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.250
as it affirms humanity
potential.

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:33.240
If it makes us feel
small but connected

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:36.520
to a larger and wider universe.

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.480
And apparently, "Life"
realized that that was true

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:43.560
of these paintings, because they
paid Bonestell the equivalent

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.620
of about
a-quarter-of-a-million-dollars

01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:50.040
today for the rights to them.

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.590
But these paintings
set Bonestell on a path

01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:55.820
that eventually led
him to our other hero

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:57.360
for the day, Willy Ley.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.780
He was born in Berlin in 1906
with a passion for exploration.

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:04.670
And he actually recounts
in one of his books

01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:06.450
that when a teacher asks,

01:42:06.450 --> 01:42:08.310
an elementary school teacher
asked them what they wanted

01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:10.890
to be when they're grown
and why, he said he wanted

01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:12.880
to be an explorer and the
teacher said that's not a

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.180
real profession.

01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.730
Think of something else.

01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:18.070
But Ley was undeterred.

01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:20.690
He was actually, as he
described it, born in the shadow

01:42:20.690 --> 01:42:23.800
of the Museum of Natural
History in Berlin.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.180
And he spent his whole life look
especially into as he put it,

01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:31.070
such corners as others
had neglected

01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:32.970
through the natural
sciences and physics.

01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:36.230
And when he went to university,
he couldn't actually figure

01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:40.670
out what he wanted to study
and he took on subjects ranging

01:42:40.670 --> 01:42:43.660
from astronomy to zoology,
which sounds like a bad joke.

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.570
But was actually what
he was trying to study.

01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:50.280
But his curiosity and passion
eventually took him beyond the

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:51.810
neglected corners of science

01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:54.500
and even beyond the
ends of the earth.

01:42:54.500 --> 01:43:00.230
And he, at the age of 20,
published his first book,

01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:01.530
"The Journey into Space."

01:43:01.530 --> 01:43:05.540
That was the first of many books
written by Ley that attempted

01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:08.480
to translate a dense
and convoluted science

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.000
for an ordinary reader.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.720
So, he was taking other things
that were being published

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.590
at the time that were basically
just equations and turning it

01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:19.870
into a narrative that anybody
could pick up and understand.

01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:23.300
And his first book
was successful enough

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:27.280
that he was asked by Fritz
Lang, the writer and director

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.260
of the 1927 film,
"Metropolis" to act

01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:34.120
as a technological
consultant for his new film,

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.940
"Woman in the Moon," or,

01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.180
"By Rocket to the
Moon" at the age of 23.

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.190
So, that's pretty decent.

01:43:41.190 --> 01:43:45.880
But, Ley eventually
came to America in 1934.

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.590
He had been one of the founders

01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:50.620
of Germany's famous
Spaceflight Society

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.280
that would eventually be sort
of subsumed into the German Army

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.410
and start building V-2 rockets.

01:43:55.410 --> 01:43:59.130
And he left, in part, because
he was of Jewish heritage.

01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:02.010
But also, because he
was dismayed by the idea

01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:04.710
that these beautiful rockets
that he was helping build

01:44:04.710 --> 01:44:07.750
and design were going
to be used as weapons.

01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:10.150
That wasn't really
what he wanted to do.

01:44:10.150 --> 01:44:13.510
So, he moved to the US
to begin his career again

01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:15.740
as a science writer
and journalist.

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:19.610
And his first and most
famous books were about,

01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:22.960
as he called them
exotic zoology.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:26.620
But by far, the best
seller published in English

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:31.080
in the 1940s was his, I believe
it was a 1942 book, "Rocket,

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.440
Missiles and Space Travel."

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:36.580
When it first came out,
nobody was very interested,

01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:38.670
aside from a small select group

01:44:38.670 --> 01:44:41.010
of people were very
interested in rockets.

01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:44.330
About three months after
the book premiered,

01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:46.710
Germany had their
first successful test

01:44:46.710 --> 01:44:49.840
of the V-2 rocket, and suddenly
everybody was very interested

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:51.760
in how rockets worked.

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:54.180
And this became an
overnight best-seller.

01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:56.780
And made him very famous,

01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:00.890
but even though he was
suddenly asked to write about

01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:03.940
and to give interviews on
the purpose of rockets,

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:06.710
he refused to say that they
were solely for the purpose

01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:08.700
of blowing up London and Paris.

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.210
That actually after the
war, everybody would see

01:45:11.210 --> 01:45:13.730
that we would be able
to use these rockets

01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:16.450
to explore our solar system.

01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:20.400
That they weren't a weapon, they
were a mode of transportation.

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:26.190
So, in 1945, "Mechanics
Illustrated" asked him

01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:28.590
to essentially tell
us how this will work.

01:45:28.590 --> 01:45:30.570
How would we take a
rocket to the moon.

01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:31.940
And they said, we'll
get you somebody

01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:33.970
to illustrate this,
so it makes sense.

01:45:33.970 --> 01:45:35.780
And this is how Ley
and Bonestell met.

01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.490
So, this is the first
article of the feature.

01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:41.160
Ley's prose with
Bonestell's paintings.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.840
And Bonestell actually later,
it's the favorite theme

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.750
of science fiction is no
longer fantasy, latest advances

01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:52.720
in rocket research will
make space exploration a

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.020
distinct possibility.

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.880
So, again this idea that
rockets will be the way

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.410
in which we get to the moon.

01:45:59.410 --> 01:46:03.180
And moving beyond what
he did for the magazine,

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:07.720
Bonestell actually created, with
Ley's help, he created a trip

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:11.540
to the moon that
begins on earth,

01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:16.370
kind of slingshots us toward the
moon, comes in for a landing,

01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:19.140
over Aristarchus crater.

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:25.120
And lands not too far
away from Mounts Pico.

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.970
And points out that the
landscape is broken rock

01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:31.510
because there's no water
to erode river valleys.

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:35.040
But, and here we have
a very hard to see,

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:38.470
but there are explorers again.

01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:41.300
Yes, the moon is not this
mountainous, but it makes

01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:44.860
for a lovely picture to think
that this is what it looks like.

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:46.390
But, what was especially
significant,

01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:49.350
or I think significant about
this particular journey was

01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:52.450
that it's easy to forget
that at this point,

01:46:52.450 --> 01:46:54.860
no human had seen this view.

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:57.300
We were still, about a
decade away from some

01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:02.390
of the first satellite images of
the earth surrounded by space.

01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:07.680
And it would be another
25 years before the crew

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:11.600
of Apollo 15 took
this image in 1972.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.300
And it's accurate, we'll say all

01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:17.380
but for the upside-down martini
glass, this maybe not part

01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:20.190
of the original Apollo Mission.

01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:25.280
But, Bonestell had
eventually become so in demand

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:31.540
that he left, more or less,
working in Hollywood and began

01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:36.080
to produce so many
images that they became,

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.380
reached a critical mass.

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:38.830
He didn't know what
to do with them.

01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:40.960
A friend suggested why
don't you write a book

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:43.180
with your friend
and mine, Willy Ley.

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:44.480
So, the two of them worked

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:46.950
out that the book
would be a guided tour

01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:49.410
of the solar system by rocket.

01:47:49.410 --> 01:47:52.270
So, in chapter 2 Ley tells us,

01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:56.950
we are in New Mexico
waiting for liftoff.

01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:59.220
We're going to use
the Earth's gravity

01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:01.690
to slingshot ourselves
towards the moon.

01:48:01.690 --> 01:48:05.040
And here, we're flying
over New York City.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.740
You can see Central
Park down there.

01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:12.500
We will reach the moon and
spend a week or two there

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.730
to explore a little bit.

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:21.690
And this image became pretty
iconic when it was more

01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:24.580
or less the inspiration

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:28.960
for George Pal's science fiction
classic, "Destination Moon."

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:32.900
He even borrowed the
rocket, named it Luna

01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:36.900
and asked Chesley Bonestell
to do the background.

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.440
And my favorite thing about
this film is that it ends

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:43.000
with the title card, this
is the end of the beginning.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.330
So, this is just our
first dip into space.

01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:49.890
But back to our explorers
in the conquest of space.

01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:53.310
They are, again, spending some
time getting to know the surface

01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:55.730
of the moon, making
astonishing discoveries

01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:58.250
in the surface of rock there.

01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:01.240
But, because there's
less gravity

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:04.270
on the moon it is
easier to create liftoff.

01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:08.310
The plane of the solar system is
such that it allows us to move

01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:12.130
around the sun and go
land on sunny Mercury,

01:49:12.130 --> 01:49:15.800
where the temperatures
are so high,

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.490
that our visiting explorers are
forced to wear asbestos suits.

01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:21.580
Because we should all
wear our asbestos suits

01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:24.140
when we go to Mercury.

01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.660
We then pass through
Venus' dust bowl,

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.980
where actually earth
is the morning star.

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:31.660
You can see the morning
star right there.

01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:38.730
We hop right over the earth
and head to the moons of Mars,

01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:41.350
pour a little [inaudible]
before heading

01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:44.890
down to tour the
famous canals of Mars.

01:49:44.890 --> 01:49:48.670
And this image in the book
is accompanied by the note

01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:52.190
that it was check for color by
Dr. Edison Petit of Mount Wilson

01:49:52.190 --> 01:49:53.860
and Palomar Observatories.

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:59.600
So, again the idea that we
are using the best scientific

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:04.210
knowledge at our hands in
order to create these images.

01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:08.490
But from Mars, Ley takes what he
tells the reader is beyond the

01:50:08.490 --> 01:50:12.970
realm of the dwarves,
earth, Mars, etcetera,

01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:15.620
where just as the
fairytales always existed,

01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:17.320
there's the kingdom
of the giants.

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:20.560
So, our first stop is
the moons of Jupiter.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.720
I think this is Europa.

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:28.430
And then we head to the surface
of Jupiter, which his depicted

01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:31.870
as frothy with hydrogen,
lava, and liquid ammonia.

01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:35.890
After, we go to Saturn, same
images appear in conquest

01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:37.350
of space as were
in "Life Magazine."

01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:40.260
Then we go to Uranus, Neptune,

01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.070
and then out to lonely
little Pluto,

01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:44.720
back when it was still a plant.

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.690
Before it was fired.

01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:49.090
That is so far away from
our son, that it appears

01:50:49.090 --> 01:50:53.800
as only a slightly larger
star on the horizon.

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:57.950
And, this jaunt around the solar
system led the Robert Heinlein

01:50:57.950 --> 01:51:00.710
in review for the Saturday
Review of Literature

01:51:00.710 --> 01:51:05.410
to have jokingly, half sincerely
call this book the Baedeker

01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:06.710
of the solar system.

01:51:06.710 --> 01:51:09.710
It was a huge bestseller.

01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:15.120
And in thinking about,
not only its purpose,

01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.770
but also its effect,
it reminded me,

01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:21.750
and I think it's reminded
others of Captain Cook's voyage

01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:25.570
in 1768, when he took
a long naturalist

01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:28.570
with him named Joseph Banks
who was only 24 years old.

01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:34.120
He volunteered to accompany
the crew and came back

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:38.340
with an entire ship stuffed with
plants, flowers, fish, insects,

01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:41.520
birds, mammals, reptiles,
shells, rocks.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.480
He returned back to London to
unpack and catalog these foils

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:49.300
and to eventually
publish his journals.

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:53.780
So, his narrative of his time in
a place that nobody in England,

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:56.350
for the most part,
would ever see.

01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:58.910
But the apophysis
of his collection,

01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:02.020
actually was nearly a
thousand botanical paintings

01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:06.770
by Sydney Parkinson, a
young Scottish Quaker artist

01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:08.590
who accompanied the voyage.

01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:15.250
Banks also created almost 1400
drawings of plants that went

01:52:15.250 --> 01:52:17.260
on to be published separately.

01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:23.860
But what Parkinson and Banks
did was bring back these images

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:29.010
of Pacific Islanders, of
new harbors, new horizons.

01:52:29.010 --> 01:52:33.740
And brought back a new world
that was invented again

01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:36.100
through the process of
interpretation of the hordes

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:39.890
of information that Banks
stowed away in his house.

01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:42.800
So, the books and discoveries
that came from Bank's collection

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.970
and Parkinson's drawings
proliferated

01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:48.030
and popularized the
pursuit of natural history.

01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:52.630
Both as a calling unto itself
and as an accumulation of facts,

01:52:52.630 --> 01:52:54.480
figures, statistics,
characteristics,

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.930
and data from around
the natural world.

01:52:56.930 --> 01:53:00.250
In short, what Banks et.

01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:04.030
al did was become what historian
Richard Holms calls in his book,

01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:06.760
"The Age of Wonder" a kind
of chorus figure or guide.

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:09.610
A scientific Virgil, who
was warning young men

01:53:09.610 --> 01:53:11.760
and some women away
from the life

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:15.310
of a quiet country gentlemen
and encouraging them to go out

01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:19.190
and see new life and new
places for themselves.

01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:23.810
So, he ended up becoming; Banks
ended up becoming an example

01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:26.970
to the young curious,
passionate explorers

01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:29.750
of a generation of
his disciples.

01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:32.080
And this was more or less
the effect that the conquest

01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:36.870
of space had on a
generation of people in 1949,

01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:38.230
when it was first published.

01:53:38.230 --> 01:53:42.190
They had grown up,
more or less in shadow

01:53:42.190 --> 01:53:45.330
of two great World Wars
and the Depression.

01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:51.730
And to see these new horizons,
served as an incredible source

01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:54.530
of excitement and
hope for the future.

01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:59.530
And Ben Bova, a very well-known
science fiction writer said

01:53:59.530 --> 01:54:02.250
that as a strong league writer,
"it was as if Bonestell had gone

01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:04.170
out to Mars and the
moons of Saturn

01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:06.460
to survey the territory
I wanted to write

01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:09.120
about long before the
first spacecraft arose

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:12.020
from Earth's surface, Bonestell
had been there and his vision

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:15.920
of these worlds is still the
most vivid, the freshest,

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:19.240
the one that excites
me even now."

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:23.130
Arthur C. Clarke in a
contemporary review of;

01:54:23.130 --> 01:54:24.710
Clarke and Bonestell would
actually publish together

01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:29.900
at one point, but he was
relatively unknown at the time,

01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.200
or becoming better known.

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:36.320
And in a review for the
Saturday Review of Literature,

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:37.690
I think it was he said,

01:54:37.690 --> 01:54:39.860
Mr. Bonestell's remarkable
technique,

01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:41.900
produces an effective
realism so striking

01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:43.700
that his paintings have
often been mistaken

01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:46.840
for actual color photographs
by those slightly unacquainted

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.970
with the present status
of interplanetary flight.

01:54:51.970 --> 01:54:54.590
So, and here are brave
explorers hopping

01:54:54.590 --> 01:55:00.330
around in the low gravity
of one of Mars' moons.

01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:05.800
But, the book made
Ley very famous,

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:07.440
made Bonestell very famous.

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.290
And Ley used some of this
momentum to work with other,

01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:15.140
again, space evangelists
to put together a series

01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:16.440
for "Collier's Magazine."

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:22.440
And it was a series of articles
that ran from 1952 until 1954.

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:27.200
Included people like the great
ringmaster himself, von Braun.

01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.190
There's Bonestell, there's Ley.

01:55:29.190 --> 01:55:32.040
There was also the
astronomer Fred Whipple,

01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:35.960
physicist Joseph Caplan,
Heinz Haber a medical doctor.

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:42.400
And they all, for this
first issue wrote a series

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.780
of articles, each a
couple thousand words.

01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:47.530
And the premiere
issue was titled,

01:55:47.530 --> 01:55:49.500
"Man Will Conquer
Space Soon," and opens

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:52.900
with an editorial titled,
"What are we waiting for?"

01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.730
And the short introduction
asserts

01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:57.690
that on the following pages,
Collier's presents the story

01:55:57.690 --> 01:56:01.360
of the inevitability of
man's conquest of space.

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.130
What you will read here is
not science fiction it is

01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:06.140
serious fact.

01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:09.370
And so, with that begin our
hearing into the wilderness

01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:12.980
with van Braun's article,
"Crossing the Last Frontier."

01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:16.530
And the title itself is one of
just a dozen references to space

01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:20.280
as the last frontier a
literal space for civilization,

01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:23.190
settlement and technological
conquest.

01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:25.670
Von Braun closes the
article by explaining

01:56:25.670 --> 01:56:28.660
that Americans are ready for
a journey to "man's oldest

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.840
and last frontier, the
heavens themselves."

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:39.110
Ley, wrote on the topic of
one of his favorite inventions

01:56:39.110 --> 01:56:40.630
which was the space station.

01:56:40.630 --> 01:56:43.520
If this looks familiar, it's
because it was the inspiration

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:48.040
for the space station in
2001, "A Space Odyssey."

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:52.390
But he actually uses his
article to explain not only

01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:56.290
that this station will
be a useful platform

01:56:56.290 --> 01:56:59.060
for acquiring scientific
knowledge,

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:03.150
but that it is also a good
position from which to move

01:57:03.150 --> 01:57:06.810
from Earth's orbit out
to the other planets

01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:09.480
to continue to explore.

01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:14.130
And this image is by [inaudible]
it's not Chesley Bonestell, but.

01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:21.230
The next issue, in October 1952
is about a trip to the moon,

01:57:21.230 --> 01:57:24.080
and it begins with this fleet
of three cargo ships carrying

01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.060
between 10 and 20
crewmembers a piece.

01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:31.420
The ship is actually meant
to be assembled in space.

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:35.500
And features some of the ships
from the original article

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.870
and the space station
kind of hovering nearby

01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:40.290
as the finishing touches
are put on the lunar ship.

01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:43.260
So, we have our space station,

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:44.590
this is from the
original article.

01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:48.520
These are space taxis that are
bringing our crew up to work on

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:56.120
and assemble their ships that
will take them to the moon,

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.090
where they will land and set

01:57:58.090 --> 01:58:00.750
about exploring for
about six weeks.

01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:04.150
They will turn the ships
into essentially habitats

01:58:04.150 --> 01:58:09.360
and from them will emerge,
their transport vehicles

01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:11.480
that will take them all
over the lunar surface.

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:15.290
And they'll actually leave
these, according to the plan,

01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:18.870
they will leave some
of these things there

01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:22.110
for the next expedition
to the moon.

01:58:22.110 --> 01:58:24.590
And I love this image
on the right,

01:58:24.590 --> 01:58:27.750
because it is just
indisputably prophetic.

01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:30.010
This is the Eagle taking
off from the surface

01:58:30.010 --> 01:58:32.460
of the moon, 17 years later.

01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:36.180
So, after further issues dealing
with the practical questions

01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:38.890
of how humans will fare in
space, "Collier's" turns

01:58:38.890 --> 01:58:43.010
to humanity's most ambitious
endeavor yet, to Mars.

01:58:43.010 --> 01:58:45.490
So, on April 30, 1954,

01:58:45.490 --> 01:58:47.580
von Braun's article,
"Can We Get to Mars?"

01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:50.630
was the anchor piece in
a three-article issue

01:58:50.630 --> 01:58:53.130
on the exploration
of the red planet.

01:58:53.130 --> 01:58:54.880
And in the two-page spread,

01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.600
we have the Mars fleet
assembling 1075 miles

01:58:58.600 --> 01:58:59.900
above the earth.

01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:03.170
And there is our space station,
and again, our space taxis.

01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:07.850
They ready themselves to
again slingshot themselves

01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:13.380
around the earth, head out to
Mars, where they reassemble

01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:15.540
above the Martian surface.

01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:22.510
And descend to land on
the north pole of Mars.

01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:26.110
And will drive down
to create habitats,

01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:30.490
which will be their base
while they are exploring Mars.

01:59:30.490 --> 01:59:33.370
And less we forget to pay
our debt, there's plenty

01:59:33.370 --> 01:59:37.490
of Bonestell to go around, and
continue to inspire us all.

01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:41.940
This is from "The Martian,"
The 2015 Ridley Scott film.

01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:45.060
And I said that that
image of Saturn seen

01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:47.740
from Titan is the most
famous Bonestell image,

01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:49.810
it actually shows
up in the movie.

01:59:49.810 --> 01:59:53.280
You can kind of see it
behind Sean Bean's head.

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.770
It's in the head
of NASA's office,

01:59:55.770 --> 01:59:58.130
hanging there on the wall.

01:59:58.130 --> 02:00:03.560
But, again, inspirations
reassert themselves

02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:04.860
through generations.

02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:08.880
This final image, if it will
ever come up, when it appeared

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:12.140
in "Collier's" in 1954,
summed up the hope not just

02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:15.840
for a space program,
but for a new frontier.

02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:19.020
Weapons have become ships
and heroes are geologists.

02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:21.280
We've taken technology
and science

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.530
to their furthest points.

02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:27.470
You can see this image in the
Air and Space Museum there.

02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:30.470
And you can see this
image across the street.

02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:32.700
This is one of Moran's paintings

02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:38.130
that I think is pretty
unmistakable image represented

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:41.950
in the Mars image.

02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:46.970
The "Collier's" series of
articles didn't just inspire

02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:49.820
"Collier's" readers, it
actually inspired Walt Disney,

02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:53.170
who had been looking for content
for the Tomorrowland portion

02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:54.920
of his new amusement park.

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:57.960
And, his producer Ward
Kimball suggested that he look

02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.260
at the "Collier's" articles.

02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:00.960
So, over the next two years,

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:03.270
Disney &amp; Company
produced a series

02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:07.810
of centrally live-action
versions of these articles

02:01:07.810 --> 02:01:11.370
that stared von Braun,
Ley and Heinz Haber.

02:01:11.370 --> 02:01:20.160
The first is "Man in Space," in
1955 it was earlier in the year.

02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:23.800
And there is Haber,
von Braun, and Ley.

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.290
It was followed, at the end of
the year with "Man in the Moon"

02:01:28.290 --> 02:01:31.210
about the first excursion
to the moon

02:01:31.210 --> 02:01:36.530
and this is Ley's space station
redesigned so they wouldn't get

02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:40.060
into trouble with "Collier'"
for reproducing that.

02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:45.640
But, and eventually,
Frontierland and its mirror

02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:50.740
of Tomorrowland mirrored across
each other, would be anchored

02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:55.130
by their respective
forts, and by the rocket

02:01:55.130 --> 02:01:58.660
that Ley helped Disney
&amp; Company design for it.

02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:01.890
With a little ride that you
could go on a trip to the moon,

02:02:01.890 --> 02:02:03.190
around the moon, and on the back

02:02:03.190 --> 02:02:06.720
of the moon there was some
kind of alien base there.

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:12.310
And yeah. Everybody's
favorite trip to the moon.

02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:15.920
But two years after
the Disney's specials

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:20.140
and the "Collier's" articles,
theologian Paul Tillich wrote

02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:24.260
in his famous book that
"man is driven toward faith

02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:27.320
by his awareness of the
infinite to which he belongs.

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:31.640
An active of faith is an act of
a finite being who is grasped by

02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:33.940
and turned to the infinite.

02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:39.320
So, what I love and find myself
wondering is the invention

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.780
of space an example
of being grasped by

02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.930
and tuned to the infinite.

02:02:44.930 --> 02:02:48.420
Essentially, is the exploration
of faith an act of faith

02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:50.940
by an finite being
here on this earth,

02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:53.480
looking for new frontiers?

02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.780
Because in the same way

02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:56.860
that 19th century Americans
couldn't support expansionism

02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:59.390
or believe in manifest destiny
before they had seen the

02:02:59.390 --> 02:03:02.060
frontier rendered by
artists like Moran.

02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:04.620
Twentieth century Americans
couldn't believe their new

02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:07.610
frontier or the value of space
exploration without Saturn seen

02:03:07.610 --> 02:03:11.140
from Titan, or the
surface of Mars.

02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:14.540
But the question my work picks
up on is is the imagining

02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:17.840
of space something that
can be revitalized again?

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.750
And on August 12, 2012, the
whole world, more or less,

02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:28.010
tuned in to watch what NASA had
billed at 7 minutes of terror.

02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:30.080
In a highly produced,
animated short,

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:32.970
the landing of the Curiosity
rover on the surface of Mars

02:03:32.970 --> 02:03:37.680
by a sky crane, very James Bond,
had circulated on social media,

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:40.080
introducing the global public,

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.740
not only to the lander's
purpose, but the planet

02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:46.390
for which it was
designed to explore.

02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:54.310
And this image was the first one
that went live on the Internet.

02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:58.100
Curiosity has its own Twitter;
his, her own Twitter feed.

02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:03.700
And so, this image of
her foot, some said,

02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:06.480
was the substance
of things hoped for.

02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:13.610
And there was much rejoicing,
not just amongst the scientists,

02:04:13.610 --> 02:04:17.460
but also amongst the public.

02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:22.710
And I just have to say I love
this guy's face right there.

02:04:22.710 --> 02:04:25.750
These are people who
spontaneously gathered

02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:28.970
in Time Square in New
York City to listen

02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:30.460
to essentially the broadcast

02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:34.610
that was happening rom the jet
propulsion lab in California,

02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:37.420
after having watched
this animated version

02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:39.940
of Curiosity landing on Mars.

02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:44.180
And when the rover was
said to have landed,

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:47.730
and that Tweet went
live of the foot

02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:51.670
of the rover the whole group
just exploded with joy,

02:04:51.670 --> 02:04:54.380
and apparently started chanting
things like "NASA, NASA,"

02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:56.320
and "science, science."

02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:00.190
But for me, what I
think is exciting is

02:05:00.190 --> 02:05:03.780
that it's an expression of
collective effervescence,

02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:08.470
in which an entire tribe joins
together to celebrate a totem,

02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:11.480
in this case Curiosity,
which then becomes sacred

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.320
through the collective
gathering of the clan.

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:17.760
So, I think scientific
illustration can help the whole

02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.920
world partake ng of the claim
illustration can help the whole

02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:23.950
world in science and
space exploration

02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:25.250
and in a new frontier.

02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:26.920
So, oh, that was our
friend Curiosity.

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:29.820
By situating his
paintings in the tradition

02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:34.840
of the Hudson River School,
Bonestell connected his project

02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:37.520
to that of artists like Moran,

02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.120
who illuminated the Western
frontier in the previous .

02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:42.270
And perhaps Ley's desire

02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:45.440
to explore space revitalized
the sense of the calling

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:48.180
to explore these new
frontiers in new ways

02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:50.150
such as sending rovers
like Curiosity

02:05:50.150 --> 02:05:51.780
to the surface of other planets.

02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:55.500
So, I believe Ley and Bonestell
illustrate the way in which,

02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:56.800
as they would put it,

02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:58.810
ideas become effective
forces in history.

02:05:58.810 --> 02:06:02.460
They created an enthusiasm
for the frontier so powerful

02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:05.350
that just 25 years
after Bonestell's images

02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:07.100
of Saturn appeared
in "Life Magazine,"

02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:10.020
two Americans walked
on the moon.

02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:14.430
America's faith was rewarded,
the frontier had been conquered.

02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:16.510
So, thank you.

02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:21.230
