but I feel like they can go even a step

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509
but I feel like they can go even a step
 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:00.320
but I feel like they can go even a step
further so let's jump into the the

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330
further so let's jump into the the
 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.480
further so let's jump into the the
redesign this is one possible way that

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490
redesign this is one possible way that
 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.850

you can imagine a tablet version of

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860
you can imagine a tablet version of
 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.159
you can imagine a tablet version of
kayak to look so in the top you have

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169
kayak to look so in the top you have
 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.279
kayak to look so in the top you have
your standard action bar with there's no

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289
your standard action bar with there's no
 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.049
your standard action bar with there's no
real need for an up affordance in this

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:15.059
real need for an up affordance in this
 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.510

case because this is a single screen

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520
case because this is a single screen
 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.249
case because this is a single screen
you'll notice that we combine three

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259
you'll notice that we combine three
 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.760
you'll notice that we combine three
screens into one effectively at the left

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770
screens into one effectively at the left
 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.219
screens into one effectively at the left
you have the same kind of hotel search

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:25.229
you have the same kind of hotel search
 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:27.799
you have the same kind of hotel search
and you know we've kind of redesigned

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:27.809
and you know we've kind of redesigned
 

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:30.139
and you know we've kind of redesigned
some of the elements to fit better into

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:30.149
some of the elements to fit better into
 

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:34.189
some of the elements to fit better into
the holo design the holo styling we've

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199
the holo design the holo styling we've
 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.749
the holo design the holo styling we've
also given more prominence to recent

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759
also given more prominence to recent
 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.609

searches this is something that Ian

00:07:37.609 --> 00:07:37.619
searches this is something that Ian
 

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:39.649
searches this is something that Ian
pointed out last weekend app clinic

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:39.659
pointed out last weekend app clinic
 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.929
pointed out last weekend app clinic
recent searches is something that's

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:41.939
recent searches is something that's
 

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:43.879
recent searches is something that's
that's really commonly used right I mean

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:43.889
that's really commonly used right I mean
 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:45.739
that's really commonly used right I mean
you really want to have access you don't

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:45.749
you really want to have access you don't
 

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:47.929

want to lose something you just did
 

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:49.070
want to lose something you just did
right so if you went into the app and

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080
right so if you went into the app and
 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.570
right so if you went into the app and
did a search maybe did another search

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
did a search maybe did another search
 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.009
did a search maybe did another search
you would go back to the other one you

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:52.019
you would go back to the other one you
 

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:53.689
you would go back to the other one you
really don't have to rewrite everything

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699
really don't have to rewrite everything
 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.309
really don't have to rewrite everything
or re-enter all that information

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319
or re-enter all that information
 

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.519
or re-enter all that information
essentially it's actually a property

00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:58.529
essentially it's actually a property
 

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:00.439
essentially it's actually a property
like kayak which it has that rich web

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:00.449
like kayak which it has that rich web
 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:03.230
like kayak which it has that rich web
property so if you're able to take that

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240
property so if you're able to take that
 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.989
property so if you're able to take that
search history from the desktop to your

00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:05.999
search history from the desktop to your
 

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:07.399
search history from the desktop to your
devices as well that can be a killer

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:07.409
devices as well that can be a killer
 

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:09.290
devices as well that can be a killer
feature that can save you a bunch of

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300
feature that can save you a bunch of
 

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.790
feature that can save you a bunch of
time like Google Maps does for example

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800
time like Google Maps does for example
 

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.699

that's like a in Russian we would say
 

00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:17.209
that's like a in Russian we would say
some awesome way that's like a whole

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:17.219
some awesome way that's like a whole
 

00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:20.480
some awesome way that's like a whole
separate story but sync absolutely this

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:20.490
separate story but sync absolutely this
 

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.980
separate story but sync absolutely this
would that would make this whole

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:21.990
would that would make this whole
 

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.369
would that would make this whole
experience just like seamless so yeah so

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379
experience just like seamless so yeah so

version of the app uses icons and tablet
 

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.639
version of the app uses icons and tablet
version doesn't it seems kind of silly

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:37.649
version doesn't it seems kind of silly
 

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:38.990
version doesn't it seems kind of silly
to have to redesign in the same screen

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000
to have to redesign in the same screen
 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.689
to have to redesign in the same screen
across different or massively redo the

form factors if you like in this case

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.110
form factors if you like in this case
 

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.660
form factors if you like in this case
they could have just you know combined

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:47.670
they could have just you know combined
 

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.329
they could have just you know combined
certain elements from vote and had less

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339
certain elements from vote and had less
 

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:51.889
certain elements from vote and had less
work to do when porting to different

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:51.899
work to do when porting to different
 

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:55.069
work to do when porting to different
sizes but anyway so that's that's kind

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:55.079
sizes but anyway so that's that's kind
 

00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:56.449
sizes but anyway so that's that's kind
of this screen you'll notice that we

00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:56.459
of this screen you'll notice that we
 

00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:56.990
of this screen you'll notice that we
it's

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000
it's
 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.030
it's
touch-ups on the map balloons or map

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040
touch-ups on the map balloons or map
 

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.580

bubbles and things like that but one

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:01.590
bubbles and things like that but one
 

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.020
bubbles and things like that but one
question is you know what about core

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.030
question is you know what about core
 

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.460
question is you know what about core
navigation right switching between

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:04.470
navigation right switching between
 

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.850
navigation right switching between
hotels flights cards things like that so

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860
hotels flights cards things like that so
 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.490
hotels flights cards things like that so
for that we decided to use the the

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500
for that we decided to use the the
 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.310
for that we decided to use the the
action bar spinner navigation so

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320
action bar spinner navigation so
 

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.010
action bar spinner navigation so
basically at the top level you start off

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.020
basically at the top level you start off
 

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.110
basically at the top level you start off
with hotels or whatever you feel is the

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120
with hotels or whatever you feel is the
 

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.650
with hotels or whatever you feel is the
most common or most important you know

most common or most important you know
 

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.620
most common or most important you know
aspect of my app so you can start with

notifications since that was in the
 

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.940
notifications since that was in the
phone version of the app and you can

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:31.950
phone version of the app and you can
 

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.830
phone version of the app and you can
also one one minor point is you can make

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:33.840
also one one minor point is you can make
 

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.200
also one one minor point is you can make
it sticky right so if somebody most

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.210
it sticky right so if somebody most

recently used flight search in kayak

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.370
recently used flight search in kayak
 

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.210
recently used flight search in kayak
then we know when they back out and go

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220
then we know when they back out and go

kayak again you can start them off in

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.030
kayak again you can start them off in
 

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.400
kayak again you can start them off in
flight search right it's totally up to

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.410
flight search right it's totally up to
 

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.830
flight search right it's totally up to
you where you start the user give a

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:48.840
you where you start the user give a
 

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.180
you where you start the user give a
strong indication that they're into

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:50.190
strong indication that they're into

flights right now then start them up
there and then lastly you know you have

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:55.890
there and then lastly you know you have
 

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.560
there and then lastly you know you have
this kind of area on the right to put

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:57.570
this kind of area on the right to put
 

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.480
this kind of area on the right to put
extra functionality so in the action

00:09:59.480 --> 00:09:59.490
extra functionality so in the action
 

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.370
extra functionality so in the action
overflow you can put things like you

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.380
overflow you can put things like you
 

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.260

know price alerts or packing list stuff
 

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.450
know price alerts or packing list stuff
that's not really commonly used probably

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:05.460
that's not really commonly used probably
 

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.610
that's not really commonly used probably
me like five over ten percent of the

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620
me like five over ten percent of the
 

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.710
me like five over ten percent of the
time so what'd you guys think so far

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720
time so what'd you guys think so far
 

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.530
time so what'd you guys think so far
yeah I think I really liked it

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.540
yeah I think I really liked it
 

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.810
yeah I think I really liked it
two to one question first of all the

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820
two to one question first of all the
 

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.360
two to one question first of all the
diagonal up pointing arrows by the

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:20.370
diagonal up pointing arrows by the
 

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.650
diagonal up pointing arrows by the
search history I gather that

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660
search history I gather that
 

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.579
search history I gather that
pre-populates

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:22.589
pre-populates
 

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:25.400
pre-populates
yeah I think that's a great feature like

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:25.410

time or chronological flows so in this
 

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.190
time or chronological flows so in this
case we have the hotel search which is

part of this left pane which is

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120
part of this left pane which is
 

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.300
part of this left pane which is
basically an itinerary so as you scroll

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.310
basically an itinerary so as you scroll
 

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.430
basically an itinerary so as you scroll
up you get earlier in your itinerary and

as you scroll down you get further down
 

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.840
as you scroll down you get further down
in your itinerary so your your arriving

in your itinerary so your your arriving
 

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.450
in your itinerary so your your arriving
flight is above the hotel search which

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:08.460

a hotel booking card and then you can

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940

notes of ways of doing that so I had

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:51.980
notes of ways of doing that so I had
 

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.710
notes of ways of doing that so I had
tried you know trying to pair these two

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720
tried you know trying to pair these two
 

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.060
tried you know trying to pair these two
images together and you could have some

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.070
images together and you could have some
 

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.919
images together and you could have some
overlap or maybe have it slightly

00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:56.929
overlap or maybe have it slightly
 

00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:58.899
overlap or maybe have it slightly
indented but it ends up looking kind of

00:24:58.899 --> 00:24:58.909
indented but it ends up looking kind of
 

00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:01.539
indented but it ends up looking kind of
uneven and jagged so it was a suggestion

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:01.549
uneven and jagged so it was a suggestion
 

00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:03.610
uneven and jagged so it was a suggestion
from a friend as you go for that kind of

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:03.620
from a friend as you go for that kind of
 

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.430
from a friend as you go for that kind of

want to call it and I like it cool and
 

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.980
want to call it and I like it cool and
it's just a couple of notes here like as

any phone redesigns here you might end

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.110
any phone redesigns here you might end
 

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.529
any phone redesigns here you might end
up either reprioritizing or kind of

00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:17.539
up either reprioritizing or kind of
 

00:25:17.539 --> 00:25:19.120
up either reprioritizing or kind of
showing slightly different content on

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.130
showing slightly different content on
 

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.620
showing slightly different content on
the phone because there might be a

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:20.630
the phone because there might be a
 

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.840
the phone because there might be a
different context and users in like I

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:22.850
different context and users in like I
 

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.549
different context and users in like I
can imagine saying that my stuff the

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559
can imagine saying that my stuff the
 

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.899
can imagine saying that my stuff the
reasons they might say is it's gonna be

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:25.909
reasons they might say is it's gonna be
 

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:27.639
reasons they might say is it's gonna be
a really prominent but some of the big

00:25:27.639 --> 00:25:27.649
a really prominent but some of the big
 

00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:30.430
a really prominent but some of the big
visuals might kind of be a bit too bit

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440
visuals might kind of be a bit too bit
 

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.820
visuals might kind of be a bit too bit
too heavy for a phone you might want to

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:32.830
too heavy for a phone you might want to
 

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.870
too heavy for a phone you might want to
de-emphasize those slightly or perhaps

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880
de-emphasize those slightly or perhaps
 

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.419
de-emphasize those slightly or perhaps
even not show them I think the approach

00:25:37.419 --> 00:25:37.429
even not show them I think the approach
 

00:25:37.429 --> 00:25:39.669
even not show them I think the approach
I've really taken here is thinking about

00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679
I've really taken here is thinking about
 

00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.019
I've really taken here is thinking about
this from a tablet point of view so

00:25:41.019 --> 00:25:41.029
this from a tablet point of view so
 

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:42.730
this from a tablet point of view so
you're thinking about these big visual

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:42.740
you're thinking about these big visual
 

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.139
you're thinking about these big visual
engaging experiences lots of visuals one

00:25:47.139 --> 00:25:47.149
engaging experiences lots of visuals one
 

00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:48.880
engaging experiences lots of visuals one
one other minor thing we're running

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:48.890
one other minor thing we're running
 

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.799
one other minor thing we're running
super low on time but I just really want

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:50.809
super low on time but I just really want
 

00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:52.570
super low on time but I just really want
to call this out in general when

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:52.580
to call this out in general when
 

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.519
to call this out in general when
designing with photos some folks may

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:54.529
designing with photos some folks may
 

00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:58.120
designing with photos some folks may
think oh my photo is like you know you

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.130
think oh my photo is like you know you
 

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.919
think oh my photo is like you know you
know certain aspect ratio so the UI

00:25:59.919 --> 00:25:59.929
know certain aspect ratio so the UI
 

00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:01.659
know certain aspect ratio so the UI
element also needs to be that aspect

00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:01.669
element also needs to be that aspect
 

00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:04.060
element also needs to be that aspect
ratio don't don't lock yourself in that

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:04.070
ratio don't don't lock yourself in that
 

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.430
ratio don't don't lock yourself in that
way especially for photos where the

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440
way especially for photos where the
 

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.519
way especially for photos where the
subject is in the center feel free to

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:09.529
subject is in the center feel free to
 

00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:11.230
subject is in the center feel free to
use something called Center crop which

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240
use something called Center crop which
 

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.899
use something called Center crop which
is scale type on image views

00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:13.909
is scale type on image views
 

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:16.210
is scale type on image views
we're basically you know you select the

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:16.220
we're basically you know you select the
 

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.519
we're basically you know you select the
aspect ratio and the image is cropped

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:18.529
aspect ratio and the image is cropped
 

00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:21.130
aspect ratio and the image is cropped
within the UI element so you'll chop off

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:21.140
within the UI element so you'll chop off
 

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.590
within the UI element so you'll chop off
either the sides the the the left and

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600
either the sides the the the left and
 

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.360
either the sides the the the left and
the right or the top and the bottom to

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:25.370
the right or the top and the bottom to
 

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.799
the right or the top and the bottom to
make sure that the image itself

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:26.809
make sure that the image itself
 

00:26:26.809 --> 00:26:29.139
make sure that the image itself
maintains its aspect ratio while fitting

00:26:29.139 --> 00:26:29.149
maintains its aspect ratio while fitting
 

00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:30.789
maintains its aspect ratio while fitting
within the UI element so I think this

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799
within the UI element so I think this
 

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.899
within the UI element so I think this
works really well for things like

00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:31.909
works really well for things like
 

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:34.690
works really well for things like
avatars like people avatars where their

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:34.700
avatars like people avatars where their
 

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.120
avatars like people avatars where their
face is usually in the center and you

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:37.130
face is usually in the center and you
 

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.970
face is usually in the center and you
know photos of Big Ben for example

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980
know photos of Big Ben for example
 

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.460
know photos of Big Ben for example
how much time I just want to say I like

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.470
how much time I just want to say I like
 

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:50.360
how much time I just want to say I like
it okay so let's move on to the the

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.370
it okay so let's move on to the the
 

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.169
it okay so let's move on to the the
detail yeah we did one more screen so I

00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179
detail yeah we did one more screen so I
 

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:55.549
detail yeah we did one more screen so I
see you're eating it was having so much

00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559
see you're eating it was having so much
 

00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:57.350
see you're eating it was having so much
trouble in searching for Venice in the

app clinic if you caught it last Friday
 

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.830
app clinic if you caught it last Friday
we decided to take a little look at

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840
we decided to take a little look at
 

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.570
we decided to take a little look at
Venice here so this is what happens when

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580
Venice here so this is what happens when
 

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.549
Venice here so this is what happens when
you search for for Venice it just give a

you search for for Venice it just give a
 

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:06.350
you search for for Venice it just give a

really important especially on tablets I

really important especially on tablets I
think that the bottom screen that you've

00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679
think that the bottom screen that you've
 

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:42.710
think that the bottom screen that you've
designed here just makes better use of

third pane off to the right as it were
so

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.020

you could have that slide in and perhaps

00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:58.900
you could have that slide in and perhaps
 

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.430
you could have that slide in and perhaps
perhaps collapse the leftmost panel and

something along those lines there but

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:14.530
something along those lines there but

unfortunately just one very quick thing

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:19.570
unfortunately just one very quick thing
 

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.540
unfortunately just one very quick thing
is I'm looking at the the design center

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:21.550
is I'm looking at the the design center
 

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.160
is I'm looking at the the design center

side-by-side sort of small versions I

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.070
side-by-side sort of small versions I
 

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.260
side-by-side sort of small versions I
can't really see the text or anything

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:28.270
can't really see the text or anything
 

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.150
can't really see the text or anything
properly but the redesign just strikes

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:30.160
properly but the redesign just strikes
 

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.100
properly but the redesign just strikes
me is very clean and I can actually

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.110
me is very clean and I can actually
 

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.560
me is very clean and I can actually
almost make out like a lot of the

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:34.570
almost make out like a lot of the
 

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.000
almost make out like a lot of the
components even without being able to

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.010
components even without being able to
 

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.890
components even without being able to
see it see exactly what's there in there

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:37.900
see it see exactly what's there in there
 

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.420
see it see exactly what's there in there
so I think I think it the design like

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:39.430
so I think I think it the design like
 

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.010
so I think I think it the design like
looks it looks really good from that

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.020
looks it looks really good from that
 

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.450
looks it looks really good from that
perspective like it's very easy to make

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:42.460
perspective like it's very easy to make
 

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.580
perspective like it's very easy to make
out the most interesting pieces of

you can roughly make out the structure

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:58.270
you can roughly make out the structure
 

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.910
you can roughly make out the structure
right you know if they're obviously read

00:29:59.910 --> 00:29:59.920
right you know if they're obviously read
 

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.780
right you know if they're obviously read
the text because that's probably

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:00.790
the text because that's probably
 

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.360
the text because that's probably
impossible but it should it should be

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:03.370
impossible but it should it should be
 

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.250

clear to you what the screen does what
 

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.810
clear to you what the screen does what
it's you know what its information is

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:06.820
it's you know what its information is
 

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:16.910
it's you know what its information is
about so here's so this is that seems

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:16.920
about so here's so this is that seems
