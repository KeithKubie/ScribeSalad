00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.860
Okay, so I see that this recipe makes this cake. But what happens if

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.580
any parts of these recipes change because

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.340
there's millions of cake recipes out there?

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.520
&gt;&gt; Right. Just like there are millions of cake recipes, there are tons of

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.940
different gene recipes, as well. And this

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.250
changes over generations. For example, your grandmother's recipe

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.550
gets passed down to your mother. I want you to look at the Mother's Recipe

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.420
because there was a mistake made when

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.860
it was passed down from grandmother to mother.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.670
See if you can spot the mistake and select the answer of the most likely change.
