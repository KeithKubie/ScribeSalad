00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.760
For this question, you need to create the data frame

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.860
that would give us the data to construct this plot. Here's

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.280
how I would go about constructing the code. First, I'll

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.140
load the dplyr package and then I'm just going to leave myself

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.040
a comment that I'm going to chain these functions together. So

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.205
I'm using this symbol. I'm going to save my data frame as

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.880
pf.fc by age gender, and I'm going to work from my existing

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.400
data frame and group it. So, here's my first chain command,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.180
and I'm going to group by age and gender. Now, I'm going to

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.119
summarize getting the mean friend count, the median friend count, and

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.130
n, the number of people in each group. Now, summarize will

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.460
remove one layer of grouping when it runs, so we'll remove

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.030
the gender layer. So, we need to ungroup one more

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.120
time to remove the age layer and finally I'll arrange my

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.040
data frame by age. Now, it looks like that I have

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.630
everything, but I actually forgot to filter or subset the data.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.020
I could use the subset command but I'm actually going to show you

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.840
the filter command. I'll filter the data so that I remove any people

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.480
that have a gender marked as NA and then, I just need

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.180
to remember to chain that together with the rest of the functions. Alright,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.680
let's run this code and see if our data frame looks good. It

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.260
looks like I actually forgot to run my library first, so let me

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.700
do that. We have our new data frame up here, so let's print

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.660
out some of the rows to make sure we're right. I'll hit out a

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.840
couple of the first rows to the console, and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.680
I can see that I have my groups split

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.230
by age and gender, the mean friend count, the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.690
median friend count and n, the number of groups.
