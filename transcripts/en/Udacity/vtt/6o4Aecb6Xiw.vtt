00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.580
So indeed these big price drops
were caused by stock splits,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.520
why do stocks split?

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.970
The most common reason and
as far as I know,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.340
the only reason,
is that the price is too high.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.170
Why is a high price a problem?

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.090
Well, consider for a moment that stock
may be above say $500 per share.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.850
People like to buy
stocks in groups of 100.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.335
So that means, for instance,
it would be $50,000 to buy or

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.710
sell a block of 100
shares of a $500 stock.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.180
Now, of course,
you can buy it in smaller blocks.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.400
That's fine.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400
But another aspect is that
options when they're traded on

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.890
stocks are usually traded
with regard to 100 shares.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.450
So options covering 100
shares of $500 stocks,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.420
becomes suddenly very expensive and
less liquid.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.310
So from the point of view of options,
and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.739
also individual stock shares,
very high prices are a problem.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.950
Even in the case where you want to
buy just one share of the stock,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.700
let's suppose you're setting
your kid up with an account, and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.720
you want to buy one share of Apple.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.660
Earlier this year that
would have cost you $600.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.910
So even buying one share of a very
expensive stock can be a problem.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.465
Finally, one other issue here is if
you're building a portfolio and you

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:33.460
want to have a finely tuned proportion
of each stock in your portfolio.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.560
If some of the stock
prices are very high,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.390
it becomes difficult to get that
fine resolution that you want.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.459
So, when the prices get very, very high,
what the companies do is they say, look,

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:53.740
let's take that 1 share that's price at
$300 and break it into 4 shares at 75.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.290
So that's called a 4 of a 1 split.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.250
In this case, we had a 2 for 1 split.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.690
So that's why splits happen.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.550
Now let's look at this data.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.229
Suppose you read this data
into your computer and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.780
you were going to analyze it and
look for trading opportunities.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.040
Well, your algorithm might discover,
hey,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.510
look, here's a great
shorting opportunity.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.530
Whenever this condition occurs, whatever
that was, you want to short the stock,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.070
and then you'll see a 75% drop, and
you'll reap a significant reward.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.750
And also here,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.520
you might identify this time as
a good opportunity to short as well.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.710
Well, of course, that's wrong
because what's happening underneath,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.700
is that the value of the company
isn't really decreasing.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.500
You just have more shares.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.480
So if you want to trade using this

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.570
actual closed data, you have to
account for all these splits.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.710
And that becomes cumbersome.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.160
So someone came up with a great
solution to this problem.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.510
Mainly, adjusted close.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.300
Or adjusted prices.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.310
And the idea is to create a timeline of
prices that are adjusted to account for

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.870
these changes.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.810
Such that you can look
back over adjusted close.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.340
Simulate buying at a particular time.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.240
And seeing how the value
increases over time

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.590
accurately without having to account for
these splits.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.070
Here's how it works.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.980
The first thing to point out is that
at the very last day, in other words,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.620
today, adjusted close and
actual close are always the same.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.860
Now we track back in time and
adjusted close and

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.120
actual close are exactly the same.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.360
But then, on this day,
when we see this 2 to 1 split.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.100
What we do is we go back over
all the historical data, and

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.650
we divide it all by 2.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.790
So the first day before the split,

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.270
we get about a $125 price
instead of that 250.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.514
Then when we get to this 4
to 1 split we divide by 2,

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:11.879
and then by 4, so
that on this 1 day before that split

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.890
our price is in
the neighborhood of about $70,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.130
and that continues back in time.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.530
As we go back we adjust for
each of the splits in history.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.560
So now we have a nice smooth price
timeline without these big jumps.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.270
And for instance, if you consider that
you bought the stock on this day and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.710
held it until this day, the accumulation
in value that you see there is accurate.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.020
That reflects all those splits and
you would have a lot more shares here,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.180
but this would also correctly
represent the increase in value.
