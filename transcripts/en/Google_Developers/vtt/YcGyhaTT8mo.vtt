TODD KERPELMAN: Hello, I'm Todd
Kerpelman for The Developer

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.750
Show, and this is your weekly
update on the coolest developer

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.820
news from Google.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.450
Android Studio 3.4 is ready to
download on the stable release

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.260
channel.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.210
This update includes
a new resource manager

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.060
for improved asset management,
a new project structure

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.310
dialogue as a front end
to manage Gradle project

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.550
files, R8, replacing
ProGuard as the default code

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.690
shrinker and deobfuscator,
as well as over 300--

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.290
whew, 300-- bug fixes and
stability enhancements.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.310
To get started with
Android Studio 3.4

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.020
and find out
everything that's new,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.650
check out the link in the post.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.280
The Cloud Functions
for Firebase team

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.790
has released a turnkey solution
for secure scheduled functions

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.920
using Firebase tools and SDKs.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.660
So if you want to
schedule a function

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.600
to run on a regular basis,
similar to a cron job,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.550
Firebase now has a special Cloud
Functions convenience method,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.890
which will do this for you.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.988
How convenient.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.030
To find out more about
how to use this new method

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.380
and see some sample code, check
out the details in the post.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.750
The Indie Games Accelerator
is a special edition

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.270
of Launchpad accelerator
to help top Indie game

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.090
developers from emerging markets
achieve their full potential

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.590
on Google Play.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.090
The team is very
excited to announce

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.840
that applications for the
class of 2019 are now open.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.540
Selected participants will
attend two gaming boot camps

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.570
all expenses paid at the
Google office in Singapore

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.100
where they will
receive personalized

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.310
mentorship from Google
teams and industry experts.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.100
Details about the program and
instructions and how to apply

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.200
are on the post.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.480
In order to better protect
you and your users from

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.270
man-in-the-middle attacks,
Google will block sign-ins from

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.550
embedded browser frameworks
like the Chromium Embedded

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.760
Framework, or CEF,
starting in June.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.115
If you are currently
using CEF for sign-in,

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:45.990
you should switch to
using browser-based OATH

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.400
authentication.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.158
This also enables users to
see the full URL of the page

00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:52.200
where they're entering
their credentials, thereby

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.930
reinforcing good
anti-phishing practices.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.700
More details about
this change are--

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.640
you guessed it-- on the post.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.410
Deep neural networks
are great at solving

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.930
hard problems such as image
classification and text

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.950
recognition.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.690
However, designing a
network from scratch

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.460
for your specific
application can

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.160
be a challenging task in terms
of computational resources

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.450
and time.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.520
One solution to this
problem is MorphNet,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.950
a sophisticated technique
for neural network model

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.080
refinement.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.730
MorphNet takes an existing
neural network as input

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.610
and produces a new neural
network that's smaller, faster,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.580
and yields better performance
tailored to a new problem.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.320
More details about
MorphNet as well as

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.002
the open source TensorFlow
implementation are on the post.

00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:33.210
Hey, did you like this video?

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.860
Well, why not like,
subscribe, and share?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.650
I'm Todd Kerpelman for
The Developer Show.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.847
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:40.472
[CLAPPING FAST]

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:42.840
This was, like, the
world record [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.280
and, like, this
is how he did it.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.780
SPEAKER 1: Uh-huh.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.370
TODD KERPELMAN: I don't know.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.990
It's a thing.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.070
SPEAKER 1: What was the record?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.737
Do you remember?

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:50.374
TODD KERPELMAN: Much faster
than I am able to do it.
