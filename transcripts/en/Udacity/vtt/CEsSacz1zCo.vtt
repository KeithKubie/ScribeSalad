Now that we understand the problem we need to write some code. First, add a

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.439
deferredKill list to the game entity class. Then, as you walk through the

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.448
entity's list, add any killed entities to the deferred list. After that, we

00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:15.633
walk through the differed list again removing all elements from the original

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.100
entities list.
