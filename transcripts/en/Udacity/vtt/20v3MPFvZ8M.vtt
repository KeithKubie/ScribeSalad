00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.043
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Even though this parabola looks really different from the graphs of linear

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.076
equations we've been playing around with recently, we actually know a fair

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:12.002
amount about it. Start off by telling me the x-coordinates at the point where

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:16.047
the curve intersects the x-axis or the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts. There

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:17.135
should be two of them.
