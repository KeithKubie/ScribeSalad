&gt;&gt; Hi You Tube. I am Josette Sherran, Head
of the World Food Program.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.850
And as you may know, we reach out to 90 million
people every year who don't have enough to

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.620
eat and we try to provide them lifesaving
food. With the soaring food prices the bottom

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.490
billion are really getting hit hard.
So we have one request here at Davos: fill

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.310
this cup. This is a cup from a school in northern
Uganda and everyday we fill this cup for 20

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.780
million children in the world. It would cost
three billion a year to say that every child

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.239
that goes to school in the world has something
to eat. For most of these kids, this is all

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.050
they get to eat every year everyday is one
cup of food. So we're asking it costs a Euro

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.639
a week to fill. This is a practical step.
Maybe we can't end human hunger this year,

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:57.589
but can we at least say that no child on earth
goes to school hungry? Can we at least say

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.819
that each child gets one cup of food? By the
way, for many of the children who get this

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:08.399
cup of food, it's the only food they get all
day. So that's our request. It's something

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.470
practical. Something real. Let's end hunger
for school children so they can listen and

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.900
learn and create a new future for themselves.
So that's our request is fill the red cup.
