00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.010
Every movie fan knows that some of a film's
key scenes can wind up cut down, skipped over,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.950
or removed from the finished movie completely.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.700
Usually, that means some welcome moments are
missed, but other times, it creates plot holes

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.990
and obvious questions the movie never answers.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.730
Either that, or the writers and directors
never cared to actually come up with an explanation

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.730
at all.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.430
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movie Plot Holes
That Can't Be Explained.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.721
Star Trek
There actually IS an explanation for what

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:35.260
the movie's villain did for the twenty five
years between his arrival in the past - killing

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.360
Kirk's father - and kidnapping Spock.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.780
Deleted scenes showed he and his crew were
locked up in a Klingon prison.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.329
But there's no way to explain how, or why
Spock entered the wormhole with the enemy's

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.870
ship, but was spit out twenty five years after.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.190
And the idea that a mining crew would be able
to predict where or when Spock's ship popped

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.940
out is practically impossible.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.130
The Avengers
In the emotional climax of the Marvel team-up,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.070
it's Tony Stark who sacrificed himself to
save New York, flying into a portal above

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.430
the city to destroy the alien invaders' ship.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.890
The plan works, too: when the nuke detonates,
and the portal closes, the enemy forces drop

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.890
dead.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.890
Wait, what?

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.270
Why would living, breathing soldiers die when
their command ship was destroyed?

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.530
Even director Joss Whedon has admitted that
there's no explanation, and that even though

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.180
he isn't proud of the conclusion, it worked
to end the fight fast.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.580
The Hobbit&nbsp;
There are plenty of reasons why the giant

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.810
eagles of Middle-Earth didn't just fly Frodo
and the One Ring to Mt. Doom, but in the first

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.770
prequel, it's an even bigger problem.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.140
After saving the dwarves, the eagles make
sure to drop them off miles from their goal

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.380
- guaranteeing a second movie, but making
no sense.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.479
The explanation from the books isn't possible
here either: since these eagles can't speak,

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.270
they can't tell Gandalf that the favorite
they owe only gets the dwarves this far.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.729
And the mountain they're headed for?

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.630
It's still 200 miles away.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.390
Director Peter Jackson wanted to show it much
closer, creating one ridiculous ending, and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.390
an insane plot hole.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.390
eagles don't speak, mountain shouldn't be
visible

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.790
Iron Man 2
You gotta hand it to Whiplash, the villain

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.009
of Iron Man's second movie: he knows how to
make an entrance.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.740
Disgusting himself as a pit crew member during
a race in the streets of Monte Carlo, he jumps

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.560
onto the track, unleashing his weapons on
Tony Stark when he's most vulnerable.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.700
But there's a problem: Tony only decided to
race the Stark car minutes before the race,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.500
which Whiplash couldn't have known.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.620
That makes the stolen disguise and the rest
of his plan either insanely lucky, psychically

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.340
predicted, or just a plot hole they hoped
fans would overlook.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.510
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
Believing that witches and wizards cast magical

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.310
spells and charms is easy enough, but control
over time and space is something completely

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.310
different.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.370
Still, time travel was introduced in the third
movie, which let Harry and Hermione rescue

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.430
themselves.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.900
Even if you accept that turning back time
was only allowed for taking multiple classes,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.090
not undoing murders - which is hard to believe
- the characters had no reason to feel rushed

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.260
or panicked in the final act.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.910
If they screwed up completely, why wouldn't
they just go back and try again, knowing they

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.860
already pulled it off?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.400
Iron Man
Tony Stark might have used the magnet in his

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.720
chest to keep him alive AND power his Iron
Man armor, but things changed fast.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.239
You would think that making the armor run
on his own arc reactor was a foolproof security

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.910
system: since only he could use them.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.099
It's impossible enough that the suit can fit
perfectly around almost anyone, but why would

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.840
Tony leave them powered up, ready to be flown
away by anyone who came across them?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.900
It's required for the plot and villains to
get the upper hand, but makes zero sense when

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.900
you think about it.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.150
Anyone can use the armor?

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.170
A massive security problem?

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.810
Transformers
It isn't coincidence that brings massive alien

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.760
machines to Earth in Transformers, but the
AllSpark - the cube of energy that brings

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.970
each Transformer to life.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.610
When the heroes take the cube on the run to
keep Megatron from building a new army from

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.200
Earth's machines, things go wrong, fast.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.819
But the AllSpark just gives life - so is every
single machine born evil, immediately attacking

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.819
innocent people?

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.930
The only answer is that it's a chest by the
filmmakers - or all Transformers are Decepticons

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.930
at birth.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.159
It's a shame, too.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.409
Seeing Earth machines joining the up with
Optimus Prime would've been even cooler.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.590
Fast &amp; Furious 6
No fan can forget the massive action set piece

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.790
that closed out the movie, with the stars
fighting to keep the villain's plane from

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.790
taking off, fighting in, under and around
it.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.580
But the thirteen minute sequence raises one
big question: How long is this runway?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.629
Movie magic is one thing, but when people
actually sat down to do the math, they realized

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:21.590
the runway would need to be close to 30 miles
long for the scene to work as shown.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.950
Even for this series, that's a stretch.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.279
Back to the Future Part 3
The final chapter in the trilogy kicks off

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:33.680
when Doc Brown is sent back into 1885, frying
his time machine's circuits, and stranding

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.650
him without repairs or even gasoline to return
to the future.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.440
When Marty travels back to rescue him, half
the problem is solved, but he has his own

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.270
gas lines sliced, stranding them both.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.319
But it shouldn't have: Doc claims a gas station
is still decades away, but by 1885, California's

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.389
oil rush was well underway - producing a ton
of gasoline as a byproduct.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.939
Since combustion engines hadn't been invented,
Doc and Marty would have all the fuel they

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.630
needed - for next to nothing.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.119
The Empire Strikes Back
Once the opening battle on Hoth ends, the

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:05.919
Star Wars heroes head their separate ways:
Han and Leia head to Cloud City, while Luke

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.300
sets out to find Yoda, and begin his Jedi
training.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.270
The movie cuts back and forth, with Lando
welcoming his friends, only to betray them

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.490
to Vader immediately - and Luke undergoing
what seems to be weeks, or months of training

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.430
until he senses his friends in danger.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.099
The timelines don't add up, and fans have
crafted some wild ways to explain the difference.

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.219
Either it's a plot hole, or becoming a Jedi
was a lot easier than we thought.

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:33.789
Those are the clumsy, unnecessary, or unexplainable
plot holes we found in some of our favorite

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.879
movies, but which ones did we miss?
