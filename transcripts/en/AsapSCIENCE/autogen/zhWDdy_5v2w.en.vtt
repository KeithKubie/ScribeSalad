00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
 In just one minute your body produces about 120 to 180 million red blood cells. 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.800
 Google searches for 2.4 million questions. 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.880
 25 million Coca-Cola products are consumed. 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.200
 Many of these bottles will end up in a landfill, where the World Bank estimates we produce 5 million pounds of garbage. 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.020
 We lose 108 human lives at the moment, and lose 96 million cells. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.700
 Fortunately, 96 million cells are divided to replace those lost. 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.660
 Speaking of divisions: In the USA 1.5 people will be divorced, while around the world 116 people will get married. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.160
 83,300 people will practice love, but will only generate 258 children. 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.500
 The fetal neurons develop at a rate of 250,000 per minute. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.480
 So no wonder that computer simulation takes 60 quadrillion bytes to simulate one minute. 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.300
 The average rainfall in the world is 1.38 micrometers, which is equivalent to filling 4.7 billion tubs every minute. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.120
 And with the storms comes nearly 6,000 thunderbolt from the earth fasteners. 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.720
 And 150 pounds of people consume 1.1 calories per minute of energy during sleep. 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.780
 While the sun provides about 83.33 TW of energy. 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.660
 The Earth will move 1,800 kilometers from the 940 million around the Sun, so it moves at a rate of 1034 times faster than the Cheetah. 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.060
 70,000 hours of Netflix are watched, 300 hours are uploaded to YouTube, you can watch this video and subscribe to the channel.
