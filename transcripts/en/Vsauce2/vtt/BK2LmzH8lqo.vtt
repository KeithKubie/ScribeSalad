Vsauce!

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:02.099
Kevin here.

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:06.749
Cerbera Odollam also known as "The Suicide
Tree" contains a potent alkaloid toxin that

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:12.480
is nearly impossible to detect in autopsies
making it a common choice for murder when

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.240
masked by spices in food.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.080
What the FAK!?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.100
The facts and knowledge on Deadly Plants.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.500
The neurotoxin delivered from the Gympie Stinger
of Australia is strong enough to kill certain

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560
animals and humans.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.660
When the broad leaves of the plant are touched
by human skin, small needle-like hairs penetrate

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.719
it causing a horribly painful sting.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.429
Entomologist Marina Hurley describes the experience
as, "like being burnt with hot acid and electrocuted

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.600
at the same time."

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.820
Moroidin, a bicyclic octapeptide is the compound
believed to cause the excruciating pain and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.269
symptoms can last months after contact, especially
in the cold.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.359
There is no cure for the sting, and using
wax to pull the hairs from the skin is the

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.890
only recommendation for relief.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.039
Conium maculatum commonly known as poison
hemlock is known for killing Socrates.

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.360
It's widely distributed throughout the world
and is considered an invasive species in 12

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.430
U.S. States.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.729
Conine, the dangerous chemical found in Hemlock
has a structure similar to Nicotine that disrupts

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.520
the central nervous system and leads to respiratory
failure.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.369
Ingesting any more than six to eight leaves
can be fatal without artificial ventilation

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.560
for the 48-72 hours it takes for the effects
to wear off.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
&nbsp;

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.030
Water Hemlock and is commonly mistaken for
parsnip which is a problem because it's North

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.649
America's most toxic plant.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.700
Within 30-60 minutes of consumption people
experience nausea, vomiting and tremors - followed

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.570
by severe cramps, projectile vomiting, and
convulsions.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.500
Any amount of the Water Hemlock will likely
cause death or permanent neurological damage.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.979
Livestock is highly susceptible to the poisoning,
causing death to cattle within as little as

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800
15 minutes.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.409
The sap that covers the large broad leaves
of the Giant Hogweed plant is extremely dangerous

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.610
when combined with human skin and sunlight.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.170
It grows all over the world and the sap contains
photosensitizing furanocoumarins, which cause

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.170
severe burns when exposed to sunlight.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.750
The scars can take 6 years to heal and minute
amounts in the eye can cause permanent blindness.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.700
It's so toxic that it's illegal to import
into the United States without permission

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.920
from the Department of Agriculture.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.410
The Angel's Trumpet contains toxins that induce
hallucinations described as terrifying.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.390
The tropane alkaloids cause paralysis of the
smooth muscles, confusion, auditory and visual

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.370
hallucinations, increased heart rate, and
even death.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.500
Another effect is turning people into so-called
zombies, with alleged stories of unsuspecting

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.440
victims being drugged and then obeying the
commands of a criminal, allowing themselves

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.110
to be robbed of all their possessions.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.340
Abraham Lincoln's mother was possibly killed
by White Snakeroot.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.180
It's native to North America, contains the
poison Tremetol.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.670
Drinking the milk or eating the meat of livestock
that have consumed it causes severe trembling,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.190
vomiting, and intestinal pain.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.050
Despite being rare today, during the early
19th century it was the cause of death for

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.540
thousands of European Americans.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.760
The Castor Oil plant is used in medicine as
well as for lubricating car parts but the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.180
seeds contain a highly poisonous toxin called
Ricin.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.930
It inhibits protein synthesis and a dose the
size of a few grains of salt can kill an adult

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.900
human when inhaled or injected.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.180
Symptoms include abdominal pain, severe diarrhea,
and circulatory shock.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.610
Death occurs within 3-5 days but a full recovery
is expected as long as medical treatment is

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.610
administered.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.610
&nbsp;

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.820
I'm gonna leave you with this plant - what
is it and what is it rumored to kill?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.620
Before we go here's last video's winner.
