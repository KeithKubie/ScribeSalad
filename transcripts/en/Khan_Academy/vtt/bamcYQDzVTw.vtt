00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.110
Find the volume of a tank whose
base has an area of 3x

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.860
squared plus 30x plus 5
square feet and whose

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.690
height is 8x minus 5.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.880
So let me draw a potential
tank here.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.150
Maybe it's a cylinder, so let
me draw a cylindrical tank

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.160
here, just like that.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.260
It's supposed to be a cylinder,
and maybe if it was

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.860
transparent, you would see this
back side over there.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.980
And these two are the same.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.850
These are supposed to
be straight lines.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.659
And the volume of a-- let me
just label it first. So the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.130
area of the base, which is the
same as the area of the top

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.690
here or of the base here, the
area of that is 3x squared

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.330
plus 30x plus 5.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.920
And they tell us the height
is 8x minus 5.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.600
The height of this tank
is 8x minus 5.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.080
And if you want to find the
volume of a three-dimensional

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.540
object like this, you just
multiply the area of the base

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.720
times the height.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.350
So the volume is going to be the
area of the base, which is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.500
3x squared plus 30x plus
5, times the height,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440
times 8x minus 5.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.030
Now, to multiply something like
this out, it might seem

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.550
really complicated, but we once
again, we just have to do

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.070
the distributive property.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.720
If you viewed this big thing in
pink here as just a number,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.890
if this was like the number 7,
you'd just say, well, this is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.430
going to be 7 times 8x minus 7
times 5 or minus 5 times 7.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.580
You would just distribute
it out.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.400
You would just multiply this
entire thing times each of the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.510
terms. That's what the
distributive property tells us

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.480
when you first learned it.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.410
So let's do that.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.940
So it's going to be this entire
thing times 8x, or we

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.440
can view it as 8x times
this entire thing.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:05.600
So 8x times this entire thing:
3x squared plus 30x plus 5,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.979
minus 5 times the entire thing
again, or the entire thing

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.670
times minus 5.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.360
So once again you get 3x squared
plus 30x plus 5.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.840
And now we just multiply
these out.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.410
We just distribute out the 8x
over this whole thing and we

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.940
distribute out the negative
5 over that whole thing.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.050
So then we get 8x times
3x squared is 24x

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.570
to the third power.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.570
8x times 30x is what?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.060
That's 240x squared, so
plus 240x squared.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.620
8x times 5 is plus 40x.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.490
And then we multiply this
negative 5 out.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:57.020
Negative 5 times 3x squared
is negative 15x squared.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.030
Negative 5 times 30x
is negative 150x.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:11.460
And then negative 5 times
5 is negative 25.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.450
And then we just have to
simplify it from here.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.220
So we only have one third-degree
term, one thing

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.550
that has an x to the
third in it.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.780
We have this term right here,
so we'll write that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.810
as 24x to the third.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.950
And then what are our
x squared terms?

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.510
We have 240x squared
minus 15x squared.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.020
So what's two 240 minus 15?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.960
It's 225x squared.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.240
So plus 225x squared.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.940
That's adding that term to that
term right over there.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.100
And then we have
40x minus 150x.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.300
That would be negative 110x.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.330
And then finally we have just
this negative 25 out here.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.240
That's the only constant term.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240
And we're done!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.420
We found the volume
of the tank.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.010
It's given by this polynomial
expression right here.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.540
So this right here is the
volume of the tank.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.090
It's equal to 24x to the
third plus 225x squared

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.680
minus 110x minus 25.
