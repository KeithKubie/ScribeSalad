00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.320
Okay, so this is going to be attendee, it does start with a vowel sound.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, on data type.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.800
&gt;&gt; So this is what it's going to by default make the name, and so I guess

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.640
in the case of attendees we'll have real names, we can just leave it as text.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.235
&gt;&gt; And.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:20.580
&gt;&gt; There's optional features, we can go back

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.850
and add them if we need them later.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.260
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.610
&gt;&gt; It's deployed, and actually, you might want to click

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.690
to launch the New Custom Tab wizard.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. What would have happened if, what does that do?

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.369
&gt;&gt; If, it's going to allow us to create a tab automatically, so

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.030
we can add it into our app, just like how we have

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.680
the festival tab. If we didn't check that box, we could just

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.000
go create a tab by going through the setup tree on the left.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.510
&gt;&gt; The tab, so these guys up here?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.960
&gt;&gt; At the top.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.750
&gt;&gt; Home chatter files.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.100
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.850
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, Save. Oh, New Custom

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.810
Object tab. Alright. Object attendee. Tab style.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.940
This is fun. This is just like some image that represents our attendees?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.980
&gt;&gt; Yup. This'll be the image that goes at the top when we click

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.980
into the tab. It can be random, it really doesn't matter what it is.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.590
&gt;&gt; No, I want a good one. Okay, people, people, right?

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.850
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.060
&gt;&gt; Okay. this optional. If it's optional

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.730
I'm basically just going to forget about it, Sam.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.210
&gt;&gt; It's okay, yeah, don't fill it out.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.190
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.880
&gt;&gt; This again is security. Just leave a default on.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.780
That's fine. Everyone will be able to see this tab.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.500
And then this one is actually important, because it's choosing

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.790
which apps to add this tab to. So, we don't

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.460
really need to include it in all the other ones.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.380
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.160
&gt;&gt; But we want to select the festival app to add it to our festival app.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.580
&gt;&gt; Save.
