00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.280
Welcome to lesson two.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.680
In this lesson we talk more about
cultural differences between Dev and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.080
Ops working groups.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.160
We'll also focus on one
specific area of difficulty,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.320
compatibility between development and
production environments.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.210
&gt;&gt; As we've said before,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.030
you can't solve cultural tensions just
by deploying some software tools.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.480
But in this specific area, we can make
a big difference by making it much,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.650
much easier for
people to build compatible environments.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.810
The tool we use to do this
is called Packer, and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.980
what it does is to build standard
deployment images that will work in both

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.730
production and development systems.
