00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.520
The Truth About the Bermuda Triangle

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.920
The Bermuda Triangle is a large area of ocean
between Florida, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.249
Over the last few centuries, it’s thought
that dozens of ships and planes have disappeared

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.429
under mysterious circumstances in the area,
earning it the nickname “The Devil’s Triangle.”

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.009
People have even gone so far as to speculate
that it’s an area of extra-terrestrial activity

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.390
or that there is some bizarre natural scientific
cause for the region to be hazardous; but

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.380
most likely, it’s simply an area in which
people have experienced a lot of bad luck—the

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.790
idea of it being a “vortex of doom” is
no more real than Bigfoot or the Loch Ness

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.570
Monster as you’ll soon see.
The Bermuda Triangle’s bad reputation started

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.300
with Christopher Columbus. According to his
log, on October 8, 1492, Columbus looked down

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.740
at his compass and noticed that it was giving
weird readings. He didn’t alert his crew

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.840
at first, because having a compass that didn’t
point to magnetic north may have sent the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.000
already on edge crew into a panic. This was
probably a good decision considering three

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.580
days later when Columbus simply spotted a
strange light, the crew threatened to return

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.830
to Spain.
This and other reported compass issues in

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.730
the region gave rise to the myth that compasses
will all be off in the Triangle, which isn’t

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.630
correct, or at least is an exaggeration of
what is actually happening. Despite this,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.560
in 1970 the U.S. Coast Guard, attempting to
explain the reasons for disappearances in

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.970
the Triangle, stated:
“First, the “Devil’s Triangle” is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.620
one of the two places on earth that a magnetic
compass does point towards true north. Normally

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.080
it points toward magnetic north. The difference
between the two is known as compass variation.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.990
The amount of variation changes by as much
as 20 degrees as one circumnavigates the earth.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.159
If this compass variation or error is not
compensated for, a navigator could find himself

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.979
far off course and in deep trouble.”
Of course, despite this now being repeated

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.979
as an explanation for disappearances in the
Triangle on numerous documentaries and articles

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.590
since then, it turns out magnetic variation
is something ship captains (and other explorers)

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.090
have known about and had to deal with pretty
much as long as there have been ships and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.510
compasses. Dealing with magnetic declination
is really just “Navigation by Compass”

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.469
101 and nothing to be concerned about, nor
anything that would seriously throw off any

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.529
experienced navigator.
In 2005, the Coast Guard revisited the issue

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:27.920
after a TV producer in London inquired about
it for a program he was working on. In this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.360
case, they correctly changed their tune about
the magnetic field bit stating,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.939
“Many explanations have cited unusual magnetic
properties within the boundaries of the Triangle.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.930
Although the world’s magnetic fields are
in constant flux, the “Bermuda Triangle”

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.439
has remained relatively undisturbed. It is
true that some exceptional magnetic values

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.930
have been reported within the Triangle, but
none to make the Triangle more unusual than

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.110
any other place on Earth.”
The modern Bermuda Triangle legend didn’t

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.489
get started until 1950 when an article written
by Edward Van Winkle Jones was published by

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.609
the Associated Press. Jones reported several
incidences of disappearing ships and planes

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.920
in the Bermuda Triangle, including five US
Navy torpedo bombers that vanished on December

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.799
5, 1945, and the commercial airliners “Star
Tiger” and “Star Ariel” which disappeared

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:25.030
on January 30, 1948 and January 17, 1949 respectively.
All told, about 135 individuals were unaccounted

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.669
for, and they all went missing around the
Bermuda Triangle. As Jones said, “they were

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:35.629
swallowed without a trace.”
It was a 1955 book, The Case for the UFO,

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.199
by M. K. Jessup that started pointing fingers
at alien life forms. After all, no bodies

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:47.269
or wreckage had yet been discovered. By 1964,
Vincent H. Gaddis—who coined the term “Bermuda

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.219
Triangle”—wrote an article saying over
1000 lives had been claimed by the area. He

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.999
also agreed that it was a “pattern of strange
events.” The Bermuda Triangle obsession

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:02.549
hit its peak in the early 1970s with the publication
of several paperback books about the topic,

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.319
including the bestseller by Charles Berlitz,
The Bermuda Triangle.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.260
However, critic Larry Kusche, who published
The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved in 1975,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.310
argued that other authors had exaggerated
their numbers and hadn’t done any proper

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.049
research. They presented some disappearance
cases as “mysteries” when they weren’t

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.159
mysteries at all, and some reported cases
hadn’t even happened within the Bermuda

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.050
Triangle.
After extensively researching the issue, Kusche

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.780
concluded that the number of disappearances
that occurred within the Bermuda Triangle

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.650
wasn’t actually greater than in any other
similarly trafficked area of the ocean, and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.990
that other writers presented misinformation—such
as not reporting storms that occurred on the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.530
same day as disappearances, and sometimes
even making it seem as though the conditions

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.259
had been calm for the purposes of creating
a sensational story. In short: previous Bermuda

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.099
Triangle authors didn’t do their research
and either knowingly or unintentionally “made

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.300
it up.”
The book did such a thorough job of debunking

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.919
the myth that it effectively ended most of
the Bermuda Triangle hype. When authors like

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.900
Berlitz and others were unable to refute Kusche’s
findings, even the most steadfast of believers

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.639
had difficulty remaining confident in the
sensationalized Bermuda Triangle narrative.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.919
Nevertheless, many magazine articles, TV shows,
and movies have continued to feature the Bermuda

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.729
Triangle.
Because the number of disappearances in the

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.699
Bermuda Triangle is no greater than any other
similarly trafficked area of the world’s

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.540
oceans, they don’t really need an explanation.
But if you’re still convinced that the Triangle

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.790
is a ship graveyard, relative to other regions
that get around the same number of travelers,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.610
here are some natural explanations from the
Coast Guard to combat some of the “alien”

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.530
and other fantastical theories.
“The majority of disappearances can be attributed

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.759
to the area’s unique features. The Gulf
Stream, a warm ocean current flowing from

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.669
the Gulf of Mexico around the Florida Straits
northeastward toward Europe, is extremely

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.219
swift and turbulent. It can quickly erase
any evidence of a disaster.

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:04.759
The unpredictable Caribbean-Atlantic storms
that give birth to waves of great size as

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.650
well as waterspouts often spell disaster for
pilots and mariners. (Not to mention that

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.000
the area is in “hurricane alley.”) The
topography of the ocean floor varies from

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.280
extensive shoals to some of the deepest marine
trenches in the world. With the interaction

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.530
of strong currents over reefs, the topography
is in a constant state of flux and breeds

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.800
development of new navigational hazards.
Not to be underestimated is the human factor.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.639
A large number of pleasure boats travel the
water between Florida’s Gold Coast (the

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.139
most densely populated area in the world)
and the Bahamas. All to often, crossings are

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.639
attempted with too small a boat, insufficient
knowledge of the area’s hazards and lack

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.409
of good seamanship.”
Bonus Facts:

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.100
• Whatever the rumours might have you believe,
insurance companies don’t actually charge

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.580
higher premiums for shipping in the Bermuda
Triangle.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.460
• Another mysterious “triangle” is the
Michigan Triangle—an area stretching between

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.800
Michigan and Wisconsin over the centre of
Lake Michigan where disappearances have occurred.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.719
One disappearance was Captain George R. Donner
who supposedly simply vanished from his cabin

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:12.310
on the O.S. McFarland as it carted coal to
Wisconsin. On April 28, 1937, his second mate

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.400
went to tell him they were approaching port,
but no one could find him anywhere aboard

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.660
the ship. In another instance, a plane was
flying above the triangle and *apparently*

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.669
just disappeared. Small amounts of debris
were found floating in the water, but the

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.120
rest of the wreckage and bodies of passengers
weren’t found. If you guessed that little

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.800
credence is given to this triangle being an
area of unusual activity for similar reasons

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:50.310
as the Bermuda Triangle misrepresentations,
you’d be correct.
