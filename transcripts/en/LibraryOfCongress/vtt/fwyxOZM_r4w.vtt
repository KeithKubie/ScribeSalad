00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.500
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: Thank you
so much for coming today.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.500
I would like to welcome you
to the Library of Congress,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.430
to this concert, which I
expect to be wonderful.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.240
I'm so pleased to see
you here and with us

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.710
to enjoy our visitors from Malawi.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.100
My name is Laverne Page.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.640
I'm in the African
section of the African

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.610
and Middle Eastern Division
here at the Library.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.630
And my comments are short because
I want to have the time for you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.040
to enjoy our visitors, our
performers from Malawi.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.560
So, now I will introduce
the Chief of the African

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.440
and Middle Eastern Division,
Doctor Mary Jane Deeb.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.510
Thank you.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Thank you.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.170
Thank you, Laverne
and your Excellency.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.430
Ladies and Gentlemen,
good afternoon and welcome

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.990
to the Library of Congress.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.250
I am Mary Jean Deeb, and I'm
delighted to see you all here

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.740
in the Whittall Pavilion
of the Library.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.890
I'd like to thank Ambassador
Necton Mhura

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.570
for having made possible
this program.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.090
He visited the Library
less than a month ago

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.370
and already we have a new project.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.690 position:56%
So, I mean, that's really wonderful.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.660
This is a most appropriate location
to hold this very exciting cultural

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.010
and musical program from Malawi

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.570
with legendary performer
Giddes Chalamanda

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.080
and with I understand
Edgar and Davis

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.720
who are actually the
students of the Ambassador.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.340
They are lawyers themselves.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.260
The Whittall Pavilion is located
in the Thomas Jefferson building.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.210
And this building was the
first separate Library

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.690
of Congress building,
which opened its doors

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.930 position:56%
to the public on November 1st, 1897.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.910
It represented an unparalleled
national achievement.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.140 position:56%
At that time, it had a 23-karat gold
plated dome capped with the largest

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.380
and costliest and safest dome.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.430
And it had the Library
building, which was at that time,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.660
the largest library
building in the world.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.850
Its elaborately façade and
interior was designed by more

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.330
than 40 American painters
and sculptors

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.440
and surpassed any other
library building of its kind.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.090
The Whittall Pavilion in which you
are now sitting was opened in 1939

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.780
and holds some of the
rarest musical instruments

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.610
in the world including
some Stradivarius violins,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.910
which are there.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.690 position:56%
It has hosted numerous national and
international artists and musicians.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.390
And so we are really happy
that we could host here

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.830
in this building Giddes
Chalamanda and his group.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.130
As we mentioned, our
division, the African

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.010
and Middle East Division is
made up of three sections,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.890
the African Section,
the Middle Eastern,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.540
and the Hebraic section were
responsible for materials

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.230
from 78 different countries.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.830
And we hold collections.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.130
We do programs.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.880
We do exhibits, and we
bring together our readers

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.530
and our visitors from all over
the world to hear and to enjoy

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.850
and to participate in the
culture programs that we hold.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.280 position:56%
And now do you want to start or do
you want to introduce or Ambassador,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.490
would you like too say a
few words to our guests?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.290
Thank you.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:36.970
[ Applause ]

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.070
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Necton Mhura:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.460
I also want to welcome
you to this performance

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.810
by the legendary Giddes Chalamanda.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.300
He is 86 years old.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.000
The story about Giddes
Chalamanda and Edgar

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.550
and Davis will be told
very briefly by Davis.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.720
My job really is to introduce
something about Malawi.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.970
Malawi is known as the
warm heart of Africa.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.140
It's known as such
because it is friendly

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.170
and it is, it has smiling people.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.650
You find people smiling
all over the country.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.340
It is small as a country.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.380
Land locked.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.410
Bordered on the east and
southeast by Mozambique,

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.190
on the east by Zambia,
on the north by Tanzania.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.090
Malawi is unique in sense
despite its relatively small size,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.060
it has a number of tribes and clans
from the north to the south flanked

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.850
by a beautiful lake, which if I may
do a little tourism advert here,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.710
I would advise everyone
and urge them to come

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.570 position:56%
and visit the waters of Lake Malawi.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.460
But most importantly, Malawi
is a very peaceful country.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.000
Perhaps that's why
you hardly hear of it.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.660
Dance and music are an
integral part of Malawian life.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.690
Each of the tribes have their
strong cultures and beliefs

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.550
which give them their
own identities.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.550
These cultures influence the
arts, particularly music.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.570
Just to give a few examples
of Malawi and music.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.750
There is vimbuza, which is
a traditional healing dance.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.460
It is practiced in the
northern part of Malawi.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.960
There is gule wamkulu, translated
literally, the big dance.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.130
It is practiced in the
central region of Malawi.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:05.740
Tchopa is a celebratory
and sacrificial dance.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:15.930
It is important at this point to
mention that vimbuza, gule wamkulu,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.060
and tchopa have been
recognized by UNESCO as part

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.620
of Malawi's intangible heritage.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.960
Malawi and music largely mirrors
the diversity of Malawian culture

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.970
and is strongly influenced by
popular music sung by people

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.560
in the moonlight during
harvest times, weddings,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.850
and such other locations
including funerals.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.390
Modern day artists have used the
same traditional templates of music

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.790
to spread messages, social
developmental messages for instance

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.340
about HIV and AIDS, civic education

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.190
and such other developmental
matters.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.940
To this end, therefore, one
would say that music is used

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.870
as a tool for social development.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.910
Perhaps one would say a
tool of social engineering.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.780
In my days as a law professor,

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.690
I used to say that law is a
tool for social engineering.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:23.490
Now I am saying music is a
tool for social engineering.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.440
Giddes Chalamanda is a legend
in Malawian music and one

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.740
of the most recognizable
faces in Malawi.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:36.410 position:56%
He is 86 years old and has played
the guitar since he was a young boy.

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.930
He plays traditional music

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:44.010 position:56%
and has composed many songs although
only a few have managed to make it

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.560
to the international stage
but he is still soldiering

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.680
on as perhaps you'll hear
from one of these songs called

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.010
"Buffalo Soldier,"
in which he talked

00:08:55.010 --> 00:09:00.000 position:56%
about his dreams to come to America.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.120
Edgar and Davis are the
two young men that play

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.590
with him these days are
lawyers and part-time musicians

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.240
who have taken Giddes
Chalamanda as their protégé

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.320
for now close to 12 years.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:22.010
Just as with Giddes Chalamanda, the
music duo of Edgar and Davis talk

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:27.580
of every day lives in their
music to ordinary Malawians.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:33.690
Their songs are [inaudible]
fused with poetry, humor,

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.270
and a lot of double entendre.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.880
They play folk music,
which is an adaptation

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.540
of traditional story telling
where African Children would sit

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.730
under a fire and listen
to stories told by elders,

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.850
which stories which will
be interspaced with music.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.430
I said before, these stories

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.530
and songs make social
commentary are used

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.170
to educate people,
especially the youth.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.560
Music like law, as I
saw, is therefore used

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.880
as a tool of social engineering.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.590 position:56%
And I would like to say by recording
Giddes Chalamanda at the Library

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:22.660
of Congress, we are making an
invitation to researchers to come

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.400
and study Malawian music.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.460 position:56%
One of the possible areas of study
that could be looked at is an impact

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.090
of music on societal
values and behavior.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.880
Developmental practitioners
would therefore be interested

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.760
in that kind of research.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.290
Edgar and Davis are in the U.S.
primarily to fulfill the dream

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.980
that Giddes Chalamanda
had as a young man to see

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.960
and taste the United
States of America.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.190
Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.080
to enjoy this afternoon's
performance

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:04.940
by Giddes Chalamanda accompanied
by Edgar and Davis all the way

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.610 position:56%
from Malawi, the warm art of Africa.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.090
I will ask Davis to
say one or two things

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.040
about their collaboration
with Giddes.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.300
And then we can get on to the
program, the musical program.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.100
Thank you so much.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:29.050
[ Applause ]

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.620
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Thank you
very much Ambassador Mhura.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.930
I will just let my colleague Mr.
Edgar Kachere introduce the members

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.230
of the band.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.840
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Thank
you very much.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.310
Ambassador Mhura and everybody.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.300
I am Edgar as already told.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.580
And this is Davis.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.100
We're accompanied by Uncle Lai.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.400
Uncle Lai is a producer.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.390
He has produced two
of our four albums.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:57.740
So, he's a genius in his own right
and he's also a musician as well.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.580
At the far end we have
Mr. Chimwemwe Maloya.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.890
He does vocals for our band.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.620
He's been with us for
more than ten years now.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.340
So, he's part of the group.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.530
And of course Mr. Giddes
Chalamanda himself.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.480
So, I'll let Davis explain
a bit about our project.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.140
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: We
met, Edgar and myself,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.670
we met in high school in Malawi.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.610
I think that was in the early '90s.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.050 position:56%
We started playing in a school band.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.310
Then we didn't really have much
in terms of technical knowledge,

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.180
but we did have a lot
of passion for music.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.820
We had a school boy band.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.560 position:56%
And then later on, we met in college
where we were both doing law,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.500
and we were being taught
by the Ambassador Mhura.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.830
We still kept on playing music.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.880
And this band, you know, started
as a duet between myself and Edgar.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.170
We produced our first album I think
around 2000 after receiving a lot

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.970 position:56%
of encouragement from students and
Malawians living around the college.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.640
When I graduated, I was lucky
to meet Mr. Giddes Chalamanda.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.860
And, you know, naturally
I introduced him to Edgar,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.570
and we started playing together.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.720
you know, because the
idea was to try and see

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.300
if we can give a platform
to Mr. Giddes Chalamanda

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.150
who has played music
for well over 40 years.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.540
And he has, as the Ambassador said,
a very recognizable face in Malawi.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.650
But we felt that he was not
maybe getting the recognition

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.470
that he should have been getting.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.180
He was still carrying his guitar,
you know, every day walking

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.780
in town playing for less than,
I'm actually thinking it is

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.600
about a quarter of a dollar
for a song [multiple speakers].

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.760
We felt it wasn't right.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.460
He should have maybe
had a bigger platform.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.480
So, the whole idea was to
see if we can use the fact

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.850
that we are law students
and we're lawyers, you know,

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.690
maybe to fool some
people to inviting us.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.190
And then we bring, we
thought the real deal.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.100
You know, Giddes Chalamanda
comes now [inaudible] to perform.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.350
So, we can see that
we're still managing

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.490
to fool some people [laughter]
because we are not the,

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.050
you know, it's not about us.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.290
You know, the stage is
for Mr. Giddes Chalamanda.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.150
And that is the idea of bringing
it to the United States of America.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.420
You know, at the same time, as the
ambassador said, he sang a song.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.100
This song has been
playing for 40 years.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.220
He sang this song before
we were born.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.520
You know, none of us were there.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.220
He sang, "I would want
to go to America."

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.600
Today, he is in America.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.900
I will not talk much.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.900
I will just let him
say hello to you.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.580
He does speak English, and he
understands everything I'm saying.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.530
Mr. Giddes, could you greet the
people before we start playing

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.530
our songs.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.490

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.590
It was very good.

Now I am here to America to
see it's a very good country

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.490

if we can start with the song

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.650
that we say has been playing
for over 40 years where he sang

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.870
about wanting to come to America.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.170

You see, one of the
things that amazes me

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.260
and I wish I had never found

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.580
out from Giddes Chalamanda is how
did he come to know about Indiana

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.880
and all those places, you know?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.830
Because he was singing
this in the early '70s.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.840
You know, that was
quite some way back.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.400
But he had the knowledge.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.280
You know, he knew where
he wanted to go.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.790
And tomorrow he will be going to
Indiana to cross the boundaries

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.040
of Indiana and see America.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.340
That's the song.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.000
He has his own style of play.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.090
You know, the style of singing as
you're going to see in this song.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:35.940
He does something with his voice.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.560
It's unique.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.160
Nobody else does it in Malawi.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.910
Maybe it's, the closest you can
come is what you call yodeling.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.830
You know, I think here
that's what you do.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.510

telling you about that he is unique.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.960
I don't know how he got it.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.260
I think that's [inaudible] believe

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.620
that music is a natural
in born talent.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.960
Either you are Giddes
Chalamanda or not.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.940
You know? We have only
one Giddes Chalamanda.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.810
His wife is called Abiti Alafuledi.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:49.290
And there is a special song that he
did, but, you know, it seems to me

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.130
that he did this song
before she became the wife.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.430
I don't know.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.140
Maybe. I don't know [laughter].

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:59.480
And what he talks about in this
song is not very wife-husband stuff

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.570
because he is saying that she left
him and ran off to another man to,

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.190
you know, Zambia, the
border, the bordering country

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.110
that the Ambassador
was talking about.

she came back [multiple speakers].

gone through the visa applications

and all that I think she can't
understand how did she pull it off.

his most danceable tunes.

to say that we have these CDs here.

All right.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.730
Mr. Giddes Chalamanda has been,
you know, out of Malawi before.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:37.700
He worked, I think he went to work
in the 1930s, '40s as a teenager

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.990
because he was born in 1931.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.540
So, you know, he would
have been a teenager

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.480
around late '40s and early '50s.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.400
He worked in Zimbabwe and I
think after I came to know him,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.570
we were lucky to have some people
who invited him to Germany twice.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.360
He has been to Germany twice.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.500
But on this particular trip, we
had to do some fundraising shows

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.060
because we didn't have any,
you know, funders for the trip,

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.360
but we really wanted to make
sure that his dream is realized.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.050

the people of Malawi, you know,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.030

everybody gave him something

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:20.330

know, here you call it flash floods.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:06.830
And back in Malawi, you
know, it's not flash floods.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.350
There's a snake that
lives in the mountain.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:17.210
This snake decides, you know,
when it pleases to move,

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:20.460
you know, maybe go around.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:32.120 position:56%
So, it comes from one mountain,
maybe moving to another part, maybe,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.040
you know, to go to
Zambia across the border.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:44.300
So, it sweeps whatever
it finds in its way.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:52.370
And Mr. Ingram typically of an
English person didn't listen

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:59.130
to the warnings that
the villagers told him.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:05.370
You know, they said
there is a snake here.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.670
And [inaudible] said
I'll drive past.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:17.660
Unfortunately, he became
history and he became a song.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.490
So, in the song, the
wife is crying, you know?

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.410
"My husband has gone away."

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:30.970
So, that is the song that Mr.
Giddes Chalamanda is talking about,

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:34.310
this snake that took
away [inaudible] is

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:35.610
like [inaudible] the boss.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.410
OK.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:42:03.510

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:11.810
Thank you.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.390
In the song he also
mentions his mother.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:19.200
You know? Mr. Giddes Chalamanda's
songs are quite lauded because,

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.290
you know, in there he talks
about his children, his wife,

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:22.590
the village, you know, Malawi.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:26.460
I think he has given
a brief introduction

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.760
about the country of Malawi.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:34.980
He said something like we
use, we use needles to eat.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.170
You know? And he actually
also interprets

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.660
to say by that he means forks.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.660
Yeah? Here, come to Malawi.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.830
We eat with fingers and needles.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.540
You know, we can choose whatever.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.840
That's what he says.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.140
One of the things I
wanted you to know is

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.710
that Mr. Giddes Chalamanda
plays the guitar.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.880
These songs that we're
playing, he composed,

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.720
he composed the music
and, you know, everything.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.120
In fact, he's very particular

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.550
about how we should play
the guitar [laughter].

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.970
Last night he was trying
to teach me a new song.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:14.860
You know? So, he wasn't very happy
with the way we were playing it.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.260
He wants the guitar to
sound the way he plays it.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.970
And I can get quite [inaudible]

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.680
if it's not coming out
the way you want it.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.490
So, if you see him
frowning just know

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:27.750
that I'm not [inaudible] the music.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.190
It's not easy, you know,
to play the way he plays.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.950
Let's see if we can give you,
there's a song that he did

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.790
for women, you know,
the women of Malawi.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.090
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Yes.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:43.120
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: But, you know,
we believe a woman is created

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.470
as a woman, so this song, although
it is talking about the women

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.710
of Malawi, it applies to
the women of America as well

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.610
and all the ladies in the house.

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.970
OK. I will not say what it says.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.270
I will let him [laughter].

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.510
All right.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:18.990
Mr. Giddes Chalamanda is quite a
very well liked figure amongst,

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.420
you know, people.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.330
It's the same wherever we've gone.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.190
Especially young ladies
that like him so much.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:26.490
I don't know.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.230
Maybe they think of
their grandfathers.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.610
But we usually get in trouble
with young ladies wanting to come

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.220
and get photographed with him.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.480
And they like to post on Facebook.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.920 position:56%
Right now in Malawi they're actually
sending us questions to say, OK,

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.020
so what exactly is
happening here [laughter]?

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:48.190
You know because they, they
just like to do that, you know?

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:51.600
It's something that we
can't explain especially

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.940
because my colleague here thought
maybe he would be the one getting

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.240
all that [laughter].

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.540
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Yeah.

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:58.840
I thought I would get
the attention but.

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.140
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: It's not
quite happening that way.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.440
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: We
are not there yet.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.740
We are not there yet.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.040
But we will get there, you know?

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.340
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: One day.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.640
It gives us a little
of encouragement.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.940
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Yes.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.240
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: You know, we are
looking forward to getting old and,

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.640 position:56%
you know, being like Mr. Chalamanda.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.640
We are going to play
our own songs as well.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.600
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Just maybe
two songs because of the time.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.900
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Yeah.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.200
Yes.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.500
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: So you
see what we have as well.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.800
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Exactly.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.100
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Taught
by Mr. Giddes Chalamanda.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.400
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Yes.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.710
We've been influenced
by Mr. Giddes Chalamanda

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:28.300
and quite [inaudible] musicians
that we've come across.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.660
We are [inaudible] as a band.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.030
We play also live,
you know, heavy band.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:36.940
But this is how we started out.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.740
Very acoustic.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.510
But we like it, you know?

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.190
We can adapt to any situations.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:47.050
Our music contains a lot
of education and messages

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.430
but we fuse it with a lot of humor.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:53.580
And as the Ambassador
said, double meanings.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.280
We don't mean to say
anything really.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.170
It's up to the people to
interpret the way they see it.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:04.190
This one talks about [inaudible].

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.490
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Yes.

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.010
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Yeah
[inaudible] can mean the job.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.310
The job.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.610
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: It
means a profession.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.910
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: It can.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.210
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Some
jobs are dangerous.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.370
Some professions are dangerous

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:18.810
like the law profession
[multiple speakers].

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:25.220
Yeah. So, we say that some
occupations can be very hazardous

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.740
especially, you know,
if they require to come

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.020
in contact with certain situations.

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.020
Yes. People of the opposite making.

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.470
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Yeah.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:38.820 position:56%
As well as people of similar making.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.120
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Of course.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.420
Of course [multiple speakers].

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.720
It's a very dangerous
job being a tailor.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.020
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Yeah.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.160
Yes. Because you have to take
measurements of a woman [laughter].

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.460
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Yes.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.760
Yes.

&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Even a pastor too.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.360
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Even a pastor
sometimes when you're a priest.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.660
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Yes.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.960
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Because
it's very difficult as well

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.260
because they have to
work at all hours.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.560
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: And you
ask to close your eyes.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.860
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Yes.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.160
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Yeah.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.460
So, that's.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.760
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Yes.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.060
In front of a woman.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.360
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: Or anywhere else.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.660
All right.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.960

Yeah. Yes.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.160
So, that's what this
song talks about.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.460
As you can see it talks about
occupations, professions.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.760

That was a special
dedication to Mr. Edgar here.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.700
&gt;&gt; Edgar Kachere: Thank
you very much.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.000
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: By me.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.300
Yeah? Is it?

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.600
That's it.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.900
OK. Thank you.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.700

thank you very much.

Wasn't that wonderful?

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.460
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yes.

give them another round of applause?

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:12.610
[ Applause ]

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:18.890
For someone at the age of 86 to be
able to perform and sing as well

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:21.520
as he does, it's a
great achievement.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.570
You should have seen
him on Saturday.

01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:26.650
The kind of energy that
Giddes Chalamanda has.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:30.670
I mean, it puts some of us
younger people to shame.

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:37.750
It remains for me to appreciate
the fact that the younger people

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:42.750
who are supposed to be taking over
from Giddes Chalamanda have managed

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:46.890
to make his dream of coming
to America true and performing

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:50.830
at the Library of Congress is
part of that dream coming true.

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:54.510
And thank you so much
Edgar and Davis.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:05:00.230
[ Applause ]

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.330
I may have taught these
young men law in law school

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:06.400
but I didn't teach them
their kind heartedness.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.520
It came from their heart
and we appreciate that.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.380
I didn't teach them music either.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.700
I only taught them law.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.780
I would also wish to thank you all
for coming to attend this concert.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.650
Thank you for coming to
appreciate Malawian music.

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:29.780
I believe that that's only a
taste of what Malawi can offer.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.340
And I would invite you to
sample what is available.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:40.040 position:56%
I believe the CDs will be available
for sale at some point as we go out.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:44.560
But I also wish to thank
particularly Mary Jane Deeb,

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:52.160
the Director of the Department
that is hosting us this afternoon.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:58.290
It was a chance meeting at which
we talked about the possibility

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:02.310
of these young men and
Giddes Chalamanda performing

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.390
at the Library of Congress.

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:08.920
And they agreed that they
should host the old man

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.470
in fulfillment of his dream.

01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:16.510
And I thank you so
much for hosting us.

[ Applause ]

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:25.720
I must say that this event
would not have taken place

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.370
without Laverne Page.

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:31.220
I would like Laverne
Page to stand up please.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.020
Well.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:37.070
[ Applause ]

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:43.270
It was a, Madam Deeb put me
in the hands of Laverne to go

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:44.570
around the Library of Congress.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:47.430
It was out of the conversation
with her that the idea

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:50.300
of performing here came up.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.450
And she worked tirelessly.

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:56.080
Actually pushing me
and my staff and others

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.340
to make sure that this does happen.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.120
Making all the behind
the scenes arrangements.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.760
I would like to thank you
particularly Laverne for ensuring

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.440
that this indeed does happen
and it has taken place.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.680
There are others behind the scene
who will have worked to make sure

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.260
that this event actually
takes place.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.520
I would like to record my
thanks to them as well.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.210
Once again, thank you all for
coming to attend this event

Yes. One more from, yes?

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:43.300
If I had a choice I
would choose my own,

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:48.510
but I'm sure they have one ready.

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:55.040
[ Music ]

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:03.510
&gt;&gt; Davis Njobvu: We'll let him
choose a song [multiple speakers].

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:09.310
[ Music ]

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:13.380
He says [inaudible].

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:28.140
[ Music ]

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.900
In this song, he is talking
about the death of his parents.

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:37.210
I think it must have been a very
sad time, you know, for him.

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:41.090
I know, you know, I've
gone through that.

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:44.990
He says, but the way he is,
you know, very artistic,

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:48.920
he says he was dreaming about
the death of his parents.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.760 position:56%
So, he is not talking about the time
that they actually died but the time

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.140
that he was dreaming about it.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.340
I don't know whether
it was before or after

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:00.080
because he also says
now he is alone.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.770
You know? Now he is alone.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.440
He was dreaming about their death

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.420
but now he is alone
[multiple speakers].

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.510
OK. So [inaudible]
but that's the song.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.600
We hope this song is not prophetic

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.510
because it says he will die
far away from home [laughter].

please [inaudible].

01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:35.550
We need to go back with him.

we need to [inaudible]
