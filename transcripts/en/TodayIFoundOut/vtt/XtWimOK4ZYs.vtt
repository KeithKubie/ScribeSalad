00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.889
The Real Life Indiana Jones

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.710
From the picture in the show notes, you might
mistake Roy Chapman Andrews for Indiana Jones.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.200
In fact, Andrews’ life is like something
out of an Indiana Jones movie, but without

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200
the Nazis.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.980
Not surprising, since it has been widely speculated
that he was the man who Indiana Jones was

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.980
based on.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.029
(Although, no one associated with the movies
has officially confirmed this, and it’s

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.880
thought by many that the link is indirect,
with Andrews providing the model for many

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.149
portrayals of adventurers in 1940s and 1950s
films, which in turn influenced Lucas in his

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.449
creation of the character of Indiana Jones).

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.930
Born on January 26, 1884 in Beloit, Wisconsin,
Andrews’ fascination with the natural world

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.499
started at a young age.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.030
In This Business of Exploring, Andrews later
wrote: “I was born to be an explorer…There

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.639
was never any decision to make.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.489
I couldn’t do anything else and be happy.”

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.819
He spent his childhood roaming the wilds of
Wisconsin, exploring everything from the woods

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:57.010
to the waterways.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.729
He developed skills as a marksman and as a
taxidermist, and used the money he earned

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.330
from the latter hobby to fund his education
at Beloit College.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.940
He started off his career at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York City…

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.300
as a janitor.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.740
Not exactly glamorous, right?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.690
But while he was sweeping the floors of the
taxidermy department, he also brought in specimens

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.690
to display.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.980
Over the next few years, he worked his way
up in the museum while working toward a Master

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.070
of Arts degree in mammalogy (the study of
mammals).

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.630
His big break came in 1908 when he was invited
by the museum to travel the world studying

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.630
whales.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.630
Andrews jumped at the opportunity.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.570
For the next eight years, he could be seen
on board various whaling ships.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.880
He circled the globe twice while on this particular
adventure, particularly being interested in

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.350
finding beaked whales, but they eluded him
in the wild.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.370
Funny enough, he found a beaked whale skeleton
in the Natural History museum’s collections

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.000
later, and was able to name it Mesoplodon
bowdoini after the man who funded the whale

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
trip.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.820
While he was out and about in the ocean, and
in his following years of fieldwork, he ran

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.240
into a few life-threatening situations as
you might expect of an explorer/adventurer

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.470
in that era, and a man often compared to the
character of Indiana Jones.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.840
Writing in On the Trail of Ancient Man, Andrews
shrugged off his brushes with death:

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.730
“In [my first] fifteen years [of field work]
I can remember just ten times when I had really

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.069
narrow escapes from death.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.349
Two were from drowning in typhoons, one was
when our boat was charged by a wounded whale,

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.430
once my wife and I were nearly eaten by wild
dogs, once we were in great danger from fanatical

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.040
lama priests, two were close calls when I
fell over cliffs, once was nearly caught by

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
a huge python, and twice I might have been
killed by bandits.”

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.569
But it wasn’t whales that made Andrews famous
world-wide.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.939
It was a trip to the Gobi desert that did
that.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.170
In 1922, Andrews carried out his first expedition
into the harsh Gobi Desert.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.430
The main goals were to chart the area and
bring back fossils and live creatures, and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.680
perhaps prove the museum director’s theory
that all life stems from Central Asia.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.010
On the expedition, Andrews employed the use
of camels and automobiles to trek across the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.510
desert—an odd combination, and the use of
automobiles in the desert got him called a

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.420
“fool”, but in the end it worked.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.670
Between 1922 and 1930, Andrews and his team
went out on five different expeditions into

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.939
the region.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.689
In the Gobi desert, “while his paleontologist
used a camel hair brush, Andrews hacked away

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:18.730
with a pickaxe.”

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.400
But his “scientific cowboy” methods worked
in this instance; his team found a treasure

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.019
trove of large and small dinosaur fossils,
the skull of an early mammal, and, most significantly,

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.219
a nest of dinosaur eggs- the first ever found.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:36.769
Previous to the dinosaur egg find, scientists
had correctly theorized that dinosaurs hatched

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.559
from eggs because they were reptiles.

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:42.610
However, this was the first time that they
had solid proof that this was the case.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.170
Because of this, the find was hugely significant
in providing knowledge about how the dinosaurs’

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.870
life cycles began.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.069
In all, the expedition recovered 25 dinosaur
eggs and brought them safely back to the museum.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.859
Chapman ended up selling one in an auction
in order to help fund additional trips.

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.340
The egg sold for $5000 (about $64.7K today)
to one Mr. Colgate, but the auction also helped

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.290
to accumulate over $50,000 in donations.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.230
People wanted to see what other natural history
had been hiding in the Gobi desert for centuries.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.870
But discovering new species of dinosaurs and
dinosaur nests weren’t the only adventures

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.780
that Andrews and his team had.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.320
In one notable instance, Andrews was carefully
making his way down a steep, winding road

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.410
when he saw a group of bandits waiting for
him at the bottom of the hill.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.780
The bandits were on horseback and wielding
rifles.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.820
Andrews couldn’t go back up the slope—there
was no room to turn around—but letting the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.560
bandits take what they wanted was unacceptable,
as he’d just come back from a supply run.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.120
So what did Andrews do?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.450
In true Indiana Jones form, he decided the
best course of action was to plough straight

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.010
through the rifle carrying men at great speed.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.530
The bandits’ horses panicked.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.370
Three of them bolted off with their riders
barely hanging on, unable to reach for their

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.790
guns; a fourth remained, and Andrews sidled
up next to it, pulled out his gun, and shot

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.480
at the rider’s hat as he scurried after
his fellows

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.440
Not only that, but there was also a scary
night when the entire campsite became infested

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.750
with deadly snakes!

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.620
It was a family of venomous pit vipers—not
exactly the kind of thing you want to see

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.590
slithering past your tent flap.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.530
After someone raised the alarm, the team set
to work ridding their campsite of the creatures.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.340
They killed 47 in all.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.620
As for Andrews, at the end of the evening,
he accidentally trod on a long, soft something

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.320
near his bed, and screamed.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.000
It turned out to be a coil of rope rather
than a snake.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.180
Luckily for the expedition, everyone emerged
in the morning unscathed—other than perhaps

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.230
Andrews’ hurt pride—because the cool temperatures
meant the snakes weren’t at the top of their

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.230
game.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.250
Unfortunately, in 1930, the Gobi Desert was
closed off to Andrews.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.790
The Great Depression made it difficult to
raise the funds necessary for such a trip,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.610
and the area had recently been overrun by
communism, meaning Western visitors were generally

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.640
unwelcome.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.060
That wasn’t the end for Andrews, though.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.500
In 1934, he became the Director of the American
Museum of Natural History—quite the step

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.110
up from the janitor he was back in 1906.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.270
He also served as the president of the Explorer’s
Club in New York from 1931-1934, originally

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.960
joining in 1908.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:24.180
He retired in 1942, and lived in California
until his death in 1960.
