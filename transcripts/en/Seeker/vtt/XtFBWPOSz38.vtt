"This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the Toyota Corolla.

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.080
Let’s lead the way."

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.360
Oh man, sorry guys, I’m just not in the
mood for DNews, I’ve got a headache.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.150
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.850
Headaches are the oldest excuse in the book,
but what are they and why do we get them?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.190
There are over 200 different kinds of headaches
or cephalalgia as they are called, but we’ll

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.910
just stick to the most common.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.359
Most people will experience one in their lifetime,
one study indicates 64-77% of us will get

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.910
at least one at some point.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.050
But as annoying and common headaches are,
not a lot is known about them.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.740
There are two main kinds, Over 90% of common
headaches are what are called primary headaches.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.550
These are episodic and by their definition
not caused by some underlying medical issue.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.899
Migraines and tension headaches fall under
this category.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.870
Secondary headaches on the other hand might
be a sign of something serious.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.190
They’re caused by things like an inflammatory
disease, meningitis, aneurysm, tumor, etc.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.280
But why do headaches hurt?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.090
I mean our brain tissue can’t feel pain,
it doesn’t have any brain receptors.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.899
But other parts of your head do.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.999
Arteries, veins, sinuses, muscles, eyes, ears,
and even meninges can feel pain.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:17.959
So it’s not your brain hurting, it’s most
likely inflammation of the blood vessels or

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.829
an irritation or the swelling of the MEN-IN-GEES
meninges, which is the tissue covering the

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.829
brain.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.819
So tension headaches, like the name suggests,
are triggered by stress and tension from daily

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:27.819
life.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.359
The prevailing wisdom suggests muscle pain
has a lot to do with it, since, muscle tenderness

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.549
and psychological tension are associated with
and can aggravate headaches.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.899
Maybe you slept on your neck wrong, maybe
you’ve had a long day at work, but keeping

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.430
your neck and shoulder muscles too tight can
trigger inflammation and thus a headache.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.540
Sometimes the pain comes from your blood vessels.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.600
For example, wine gives some people headaches,
possibly because of histamines and tyramine.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.929
Histamine dilates blood vessels and tyramine
first constricts then dilates blood vessels.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.109
A similar thing happens to blood vessels when
they come in contact with cold things, like

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.109
ice cream.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.159
Blood vessels on the roof of your mouth constrict
from the ice cream and when they warm up again,

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.159
they dilate.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.189
Thus, a brain freeze.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.879
Maybe you skip your morning coffee and you
get a headache, a 2009 study from the University

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.799
of Vermont suggests an increased blood flow
from a lack of caffeine might lead to a headache.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.540
It’s all this constricting and dilating
of blood vessels that’s painful.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.230
Which is why nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs like ibuprofen work on some headaches.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.360
We know a little bit more about migraines,
which are intense nasty, debilitating headaches.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.939
They feel like a pulsing, throbbing pressure.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.120
Sometimes they come with nausea and you can’t
stand light or sound.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.379
Scientists used to think dilation of blood
vessels was the culprit, but it seems some

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.890
dysfunction of nerves in the brain is really
to blame.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.659
A 2001 study published in the journal Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences showed

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.739
how varying brain activity triggers aura.

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.120
Aura is a type of visual hallucination that
happens before 20% of migraines.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.260
The study showed that a wave of increased
activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.670
followed by a period of depressed activity
was related to patients seeing an aura before

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.000
they got a migraine.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.250
Other studies, like one from Johns Hopkins
University, point to the trigeminal nerve,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.489
which can release chemicals that irritate
and cause swelling of the meninges, the tissue

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.709
covering the brain, and could be triggering
migraines.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.209
Even though migraines affect only 12–18%
of the population, tension headaches will

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.680
affect most of us at least once in our lifetimes.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.280
So it’s surprising not more is known about
them.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.489
In the meantime, the best way to nip the pain
in the bud is to relax.

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.469
Like i said earlier most headaches are the
result of stress.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:36.040
Some studies suggest mediation might ease
a migraine, so do some yoga, listen to some

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.780
enya, have a bubble bath, just chill for a
sec.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.329
Alright guys, do you get headaches?

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.329
