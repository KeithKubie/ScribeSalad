00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.530
Recall that by default, the browser assumes that

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.250
css is blocking, hence the first link tag will

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.340
block rendering. The screen query will evaluate the true,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.050
since we are rendering the content on the screen

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.300
and hence it will also block rendering. The

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.320
third declaration depends on the orientation of the device.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.300
In this particular case because the handset is in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.270
portrait orientation. It won't be a render blocking resource.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.580
Finally, the last declaration is only applied

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.450
when the page is being printed. Hence,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.410
it is not render blocking when the page is first being loaded in the browser.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.400
&gt;&gt; Nice. So, only two of the four are

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.050
render blocking. I can feel the pages getting faster already.
