00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:08.580
Around the globe,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.246
there are approximately 60 million people
who have been forced to leave their homes

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.561
to escape war, violence, and persecution.

00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.818
The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons,

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:25.884
which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries.

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:31.028
Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries.

00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:33.818
They are commonly referred to as refugees.

00:00:33.818 --> 00:00:37.253
But what exactly does that term mean?

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.973
The world has known refugees 
for millennia,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:44.720
but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's 1951 Convention

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.808
relating to the status of refugees

00:00:46.808 --> 00:00:52.433
in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:57.036
It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality,

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.852
and is unable to return 
to their home country

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:03.751
because of well-founded fears
of being persecuted.

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:08.753
That persecution may be due to their race,
religion, nationality,

00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:12.882
membership in a particular social group,
or political opinion,

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:16.964
and is often related to war and violence.

00:01:16.964 --> 00:01:20.847
Today, roughly half the world's refugees
are children,

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.441
some of them unaccompanied by an adult,

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:27.092
a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor

00:01:27.092 --> 00:01:29.845
or sexual exploitation.

00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:31.966
Each refugee's story is different,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.811
and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes.

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.280
But before we get 
to what their journeys involve,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.907
let's clear one thing up.

00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:44.222
There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms

00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:46.570
"migrant" and "refugee."

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.062
"Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country

00:01:50.062 --> 00:01:52.849
for reasons not related to persecution,

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.498
such as searching 
for better economic opportunities

00:01:55.498 --> 00:02:00.127
or leaving drought-stricken areas
in search of better circumstances.

00:02:00.127 --> 00:02:03.309
There are many people around the world
who have been displaced

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:05.060
because of natural disasters,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.624
food insecurities,

00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:08.406
and other hardships,

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:10.714
but international law, rightly or wrongly,

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:16.876
only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees.

00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:21.218
So what happens when someone
flees their country?

00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:24.470
Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.215
with limited access to shelter,
water, or food.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:30.934
Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected,

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:33.102
belongings might be left behind,

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:37.876
and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents,

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:42.631
like visas, to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries.

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:46.410
Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.190
by standard routes.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.813
This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea,

00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:54.760
and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.164
to help them cross borders.

00:02:57.164 --> 00:03:00.033
Whereas some people seek safety
with their families,

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:03.973
others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:06.847
with the hopes of being reunited later.

00:03:06.847 --> 00:03:10.190
This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.880
While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.465
sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp,

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:23.414
usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments.

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:26.757
Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures,

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:30.659
offering short-term shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home,

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.626
be integrated to the host country,

00:03:32.626 --> 00:03:35.138
or resettle in another country.

00:03:35.138 --> 00:03:39.762
But resettlement and long-term 
integration options are often limited.

00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:44.284
So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years

00:03:44.284 --> 00:03:47.440
and sometimes even decades.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.106
Once in a new country, the first legal
step for a displaced person

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.135
is to apply for asylum.

00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:56.067
At this point, they are an asylum seeker

00:03:56.067 --> 00:04:01.472
and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted.

00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:04.943
While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee,

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:09.683
every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:13.816
and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:17.355
Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially.

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:19.820
Host countries have several duties

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.618
towards people they have 
recognized as refugees,

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:27.874
like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and non-discrimination.

00:04:27.874 --> 00:04:31.891
The most basic obligation towards refugees
is non-refoulement,

00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:35.139
a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.723
to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened.

00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:41.881
In reality, however, refugees are
frequently the victims

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:45.378
of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment.

00:04:45.378 --> 00:04:49.376
They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:50.974
and racism.

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:54.192
And all too often, they aren't permitted
to enter the work force

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:57.135
and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid.

00:04:57.135 --> 00:05:01.135
In addition, far too many refugee children
are out of school

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.845
due to lack of funding 
for education programs.

00:05:04.845 --> 00:05:07.434
If you go back in your own family history,

00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:11.061
chances are you will discover that
at a certain point,

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:13.878
your ancestors were forced 
from their homes,

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:19.246
either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution.

00:05:19.246 --> 00:05:22.569
It would be good of us to remember
their stories

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.594
when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced,

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:28.307
searching for a new home.
