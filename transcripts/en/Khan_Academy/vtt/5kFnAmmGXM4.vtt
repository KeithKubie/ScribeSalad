00:00:00.507 --> 00:00:02.590
Let's say that the settlement
price for delivering

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.020
1,000 pounds of
apples on October 20,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.590
which we're going to assume
is one year from now,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.090
let's assume that it's $200.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.640
Let's also assume that
the current market

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.960
price for 1,000 pounds
of apples is also $200.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.870
So that future settlement
price is the same

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.211
as the current market price.

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:24.460
And we're also going to
assume, like the last example,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.630
that these apples that
we have never go bad.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.210
They're just things that
they never rot or anything.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.620
So they're as good in a
year as they are right now.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.920
Let's also assume, above
and beyond the assumptions

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.750
of the last video, that
we can borrow and sell

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840
apples in the current market.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.230
That we can actually
short apples.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.917
So I go to someone who's got
1,000 pounds of apples who

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:46.250
doesn't really see any need
for them over the next year,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.170
and I say, can I
borrow those apples?

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.470
And what I do is I say,
I'll borrow those apples.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.120
I'll sell those apples
in the market today.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.450
And of the interest that
I get on those apples,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.770
I'm going to give you
1%, the person who

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.350
actually owns the apples.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.310
And that person says,
oh, sure, why not?

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.550
That way I actually get
some money on my apples

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.210
that I had no intention
of using for a year.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.160
And then I, as the borrower
and seller, will get 4% net.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.440
I'll get 4% net on the apples.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.670
So given this reality, what
could I do, once again,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.890
to make a risk-free profit?

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.330
Well, as you could imagine,
I can borrow and sell

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.320
the apples for a year.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.410
So let me write this down.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:36.080
I'm going to borrow and
sell 1,000 pounds of apples.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.130
So if I just borrow
it today and sell it,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.880
today's market price is
$200 for 1,000 pounds.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.760
So I'm going to get $200.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.050
Now on top of that,
what I want to do

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.567
is agree to be the buyer
on this futures contract.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:57.650
So let me write that down.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.410
Agree, you could say to go
long the futures contract,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.370
or agree to be buyer
on futures contract.

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.370
So I'm agreeing,
a year from now,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.340
to buy 1,000 pounds
of apples for $200.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.670
So let's fast forward.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.410
Let's fast forward one year.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.730
So what's happened?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.160
So of the $200 I got
from shorting the apples

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.810
I got 5% on that.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.620
But I had to give
1% to the person

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.440
I borrowed the apples from.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.340
So I'm getting 4% net.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.490
4% on $200 is $8.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.850
So now I now have $208 because
I got that 4% interest.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.020
It was $210.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.010
I gave $2.00 to the person
who lent me the apples.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.170
Now I can use $200 of
that to essentially

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.650
uphold my part of
the futures contract,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.990
to buy the apples for $200,
for that agreed upon price.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.840
So $200 to buy apples.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.090
And I know I can do this
regardless of what the market

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.020
price is because that was the
delivery price on the futures

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.030
contract.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.960
So now I have $8 net.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.060
And those apples that
I've just bought,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.400
those 1,000 pounds
of apples, I can then

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.190
use those apples to
return it to the person

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.830
that I borrowed the apples from.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.190
So they got their apples back.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.300
And they got that 1% on the $200
over the course of the year.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.490
And I made a risk-free $8.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.260
So if you think
about it once again,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.150
this is setting a lower bound
on what the actual settlement

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.880
price on the
futures contract is.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.640
I should not be able to
make this risk-free profit.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.830
If it's available,
then people will do it.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.810
And what it will do is
it will increase demand

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.380
to be the buyer here.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.250
So this price should go up.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.570
And it would increase supply
on the selling side here.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.770
And so maybe this price
over here would go down.
