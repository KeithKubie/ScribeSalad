[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.970
SPEAKER 1: This is
the AIY project kit.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.740
With this simple
cardboard box, it's

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.250
easy to get a natural language
recognizer up and running.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.840
And there are
limitless possibilities

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.210
for what you can build once
the kit is ready to go.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.102
JAMES MCLURKIN: Can
you sing a song?

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:18.994
SPEAKER 2: (SINGING)
This is my song.

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:21.202
It's not very long.

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:22.840
JAMES MCLURKIN: Well, hi, Erwin.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.090
My name is James, as you said.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.540
I'm a hardware engineer
here at Google.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.290
I did work on the
hardware on the kit.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.970
There's a whole
team of people who

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.159
did the software, the
hardware, the interface,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.360
the low-level drivers.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.060
And we're [AUDIO OUT] the
Google machine intelligence

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.440
that the kit lets
you tap into, I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.870
hope, in a very
easy and fun way.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.480
They do exactly what
you program them to do,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.070
not what you want them to do.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.400
Exactly the same thing goes
with AI or machine intelligence.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.330
There's no magic.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.850
There's no top
secret way to make

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.290
them act like R2-D2 or
Lieutenant Commander Data,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.090
or BB-8.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.160
It depends how old
your references are.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.669
So you will find
things like that.

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:02.460
SPEAKER 1: After a
quick demo and tutorial,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.678
it was the students'
turn to build something.

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.140
SPEAKER 3: Well,
personally, I want

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.349
to make a little spider
leg device that walks--

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:13.140
JAMES MCLURKIN: OK.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.480
SPEAKER 3: --with extra servos.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.230
SPEAKER 1: The students
took the kits home

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.597
and came back five days later
to show us what they built.

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:23.680
SPEAKER 3: What this does
is it adheres to action.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.410
It [INAUDIBLE] cereal,
through cereal.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.840
And it goes right into
that device right there.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.370
Go forward.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.780
JAMES MCLURKIN: Nice.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.446
SPEAKER 3: Stop.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.350
SPEAKER 4: It was pretty
simple servo code just

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.290
to ask it to go from neutral
to 90 degrees and then back.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.840
Candy.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.171
SPEAKER 5: Getting your candy.

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.415
SPEAKER 6: [LAUGHS]

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:54.290
SPEAKER 7: And then for
this one, since we're

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.090
using the servos that
only get 180 degrees,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.670
ideally you'd want to be
able to select all four.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.378
But right now, you
can only select three.

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:00.950
So it can only turn so far.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.710
SPEAKER 6: That's
why we prototype.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.050
Right?

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.883
SPEAKER 7: Yep, yep.

00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:04.280
Enable toothbrush head rotator.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.775
SPEAKER 8: Enabling
toothbrush head rotator.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:15.962
SPEAKER 7: Ah, this
came unplugged.

00:02:15.962 --> 00:02:17.170
SPEAKER 6: Oh, there it goes.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.735
OK, so white's
obviously facing me.

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:19.360
SPEAKER 7: Yes.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.527
SPEAKER 6: How cool is that?

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.610
SPEAKER 1: These are a
couple of the projects that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.460
use servo motors
controlled by the hats that

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.335
comes with the AIY.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:29.130
It was a really nice surprise
that the regular Raspberry Pi

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.590
IO libraries just worked
out of the box with it.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
It made building the
projects that much easier.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.170
Some of the kids, though,
took a decidedly more software

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.530
approach.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.146
Let's take a look at the voice
services that they implemented.

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:43.270
SPEAKER 8: Push the button.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.920
Shop for something.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.920
SPEAKER 6: Shop for New
York Yankees baseball hats.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.813
So what's actually
happening now?

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:50.680
SPEAKER 10: Done.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.325
SPEAKER 6: Whoo, so she
just said done, right?

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:52.650
SPEAKER 9: Yep.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.260
SPEAKER 6: OK.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.759
SPEAKER 9: So what
actually happened

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:58.150
was that when it said done, it
just sends links to my email

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.800
after finding it on eBay.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.384
So it'll find results online,
send links in an email to me,

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:05.050
and I'm going to
receive those so then I

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.840
can quickly click and buy
something if I wanted to.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.820
SPEAKER 11: OK, so when
you say a command to it,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.080
so in this case, that's
food, it goes to a function.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.345
And then it takes this
picture with the camera

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:19.360
by using the Pi Camera library.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.920
SPEAKER 6: OK.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.040
SPEAKER 11: What food is this?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.702
SPEAKER 12: The
food item is within

00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:29.740
the following-- candied apple,
raw tomato, Rainier cherry,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.165
or hardboiled egg.

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:33.450
SPEAKER 6: [LAUGHS] They
can see where it would also

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.180
think of a Rainier cherry,
because it's kind of yellow.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.450
SPEAKER 13: Pick a
color, any color.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.690
SPEAKER 6: OK, I'll be blue.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.300
Is that black?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.540
SPEAKER 13: It's black.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.748
SPEAKER 6: OK, I'll be black.

00:03:39.748 --> 00:03:43.474
SPEAKER 13: So we start off
with a new game as black.

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:45.302
SPEAKER 14: E5 takes D5.

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:46.014
Your move.

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:46.680
SPEAKER 13: Yep.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.320
I'm gonna do here.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.750
SPEAKER 6: So I'll
move this one.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.510
So what is that?

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.590
D7 to D5?

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.720
SPEAKER 13: OK, pawn to D5.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.544
SPEAKER 14: E4 takes D5.

00:03:55.544 --> 00:03:56.094
Your move.

00:03:56.094 --> 00:03:57.510
SPEAKER 6: I like
how sassy it is.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.500
It's like E4 takes D5.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.431
Your move.

00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:01.680
SPEAKER 1: This is what
happened when some high school

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.030
kids got the AIY kit and hacked
on it for just a few days.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.400
All of them were
inspired to do more,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.440
from expanding their
hardware projects

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.790
to using more cloud services.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.270
Many of them had never
even used Python before.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.000
And the open source code
that comes with the AIY

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.829
was a great launchpad
for them to learn.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.320
So what will you build?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.180
Learn more at
aiyprojects.withgoogle.com

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.700
and do let us know.
