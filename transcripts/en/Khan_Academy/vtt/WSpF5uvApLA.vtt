00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.880
Is the system of
linear equations below

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.600
dependent or independent?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.430
And they give us two
equations right here.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.650
And before I tackle
this specific problem,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.590
let's just do a little
bit a review of what

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.050
dependent or independent means.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.770
And actually, I'll compare that
to consistent and inconsistent.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.380
So just to start
off with, if we're

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.250
dealing with systems of linear
equations in two dimensions,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.620
there's only three possibilities
that the lines or the equations

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.015
can have relative to each other.

00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:29.640
So let me draw the
three possibilities.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.189
So let me draw three
coordinate axes.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
So that's my first
x-axis and y-axis.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.620
Let me draw another one.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.220
That is x and that is y.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.950
Let me draw one
more, because there's

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.130
only three possibilities
in two dimensions.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.100
x and y if we're dealing
with linear equations.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.290
So you can have the situation
where the lines just

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.310
intersect in one point.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.720
Let me do this.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.040
So you could have
one line like that

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.630
and maybe the other line
does something like that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.360
and they intersect at one point.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.870
You could have the
situation where

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.880
the two lines are parallel.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.380
So you could have a situation--
actually let me draw it over

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.580
here-- where you have one
line that goes like that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120
and the other line has the
same slope but it's shifted.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.840
It has a different y-intercept,
so maybe it looks like this.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.800
And you have no points
of intersection.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.050
And then you could
have the situation

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.660
where they're actually the same
line, so that both lines have

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.540
the same slope and
the same y-intercept.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.520
So really they
are the same line.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.290
They intersect on an
infinite number of points.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.790
Every point on
either of those lines

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.060
is also a point
on the other line.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.210
So just to give you a little
bit of the terminology here,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.520
and we learned this in the
last video, this type of system

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.030
where they don't intersect,
where you have no solutions,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.575
this is an inconsistent system.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.270
And by definition, or
I guess just taking

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.100
the opposite of
inconsistent, both of these

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.391
would be considered consistent.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.140
But then within consistent,
there's obviously a difference.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.830
Here we only have one solution.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.440
These are two different lines
that intersect in one place.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.800
And here they're essentially
the same exact line.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.450
And so we differentiate
between these two scenarios

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.440
by calling this one
over here independent

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.830
and this one over
here dependent.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.980
So independent-- both lines
are doing their own thing.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.260
They're not dependent
on each other.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.360
They're not the same line.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.410
They will intersect
at one place.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.440
Dependent-- they're
the exact same line.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.950
Any point that satisfies one
line will satisfy the other.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.533
Any points that
satisfies one equation

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.500
will satisfy the other.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.540
So with that said, let's see if
this system of linear equations

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.532
right here is dependent
or independent.

00:02:55.532 --> 00:02:56.990
So they're kind of
having us assume

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.364
that it's going
to be consistent,

00:02:58.364 --> 00:03:00.430
that we're going to
intersect in one place

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.360
or going to intersect in an
infinite number of places.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.640
And the easiest way to
do this-- we already

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.710
have this second equation here.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.500
It's already in
slope-intercept form.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.450
We know the slope is negative
2, the y-intercept is 8.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.709
Let's put this first equation
up here in slope-intercept form

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.250
and see if it has a different
slope or a different intercept.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.930
Or maybe it's the same line.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.370
So we have 4x plus
2y is equal to 16.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.640
We can subtract 4x
from both sides.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.750
What we want to do is isolate
the y on the left hand side.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.020
So let's subtract
4x from both sides.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.470
The left hand side-- we
are just left with a 2y.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.810
And then the right hand side,
we have a negative 4x plus 16.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.270
I just wrote the negative
4 in front of the 16,

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.880
just so that we have it in the
traditional slope-intercept

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.439
form.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.480
And now we can divide both
sides of this equation

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.910
by 2, so that we can isolate
the y on the left hand side.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.180
Divide both sides by 2.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.160
We are left with y is equal
to negative 4 divided by 2

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.830
is negative 2x plus
16 over 2 plus 8.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.780
So all I did is algebraically
manipulate this top equation up

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.480
here.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.610
And when I did that, when
I solved essentially for y,

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.450
I got this right
over here, which

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.149
is the exact same thing
as the second equation.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:23.590
We have the exact same slope,
negative 2, negative 2,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.870
and we have the exact
same y-intercept, 8 and 8.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.070
If I were to graph these
equations-- that's my x-axis,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.520
and that is my y-axis-- both
of them have a y-intercept at 8

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.090
and then have a
slope of negative 2.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.750
So they look
something-- I'm just

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.270
drawing an approximation of it--
but they would look something

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.100
like that.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.530
So maybe this is the graph
of this equation right

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.174
here, this first equation.

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:53.590
And then the second equation
will be the exact same graph.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.110
It has the exact
same y-intercept

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.850
and the exact same slope.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.426
So clearly these two
lines are dependent.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.010
They have an infinite
number of points

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.393
that are common to both of them,
because they're the same line.
