much more in my career in my personal

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
much more in my career in my personal

age with a doctor telling me who knows

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
age with a doctor telling me who knows
 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970
age with a doctor telling me who knows
how much longer how much time you really

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

pretty sobering statement to receive at
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.530
pretty sobering statement to receive at
that age and I took that as really a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
that age and I took that as really a
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170
that age and I took that as really a
call to action and I did many things

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
call to action and I did many things
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.000
call to action and I did many things
personally and professionally at that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
personally and professionally at that
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429
personally and professionally at that

perhaps that's not a virtue but I think

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
perhaps that's not a virtue but I think
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.590
perhaps that's not a virtue but I think

honest i think a lot of women tend to
sit back and see what's going to happen

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
sit back and see what's going to happen
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.480

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.809
but I think a healthy sense of urgency
and willingness to take some risks and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
