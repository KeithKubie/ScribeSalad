At this point let's turn to an overview of our immune system to help us

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:06.968
understand exactly what's happening in our bodies and our ability to fight off

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:12.555
illnesses. There are two types of defense we have as humans, we have natural

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:17.400
immunity and we have acquired immunity. Natural immunity refers to the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.458
processes that we have to remove foreign substances from our bodies.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:27.749
Inflammation, and phagocytosis, are two forms of natural immunity. Inflammation

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.905
occurs when tissues are restored following some type of injury. Where as

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:36.195
phagocytosis occurs when white blood cells take in a substance, and digest it,

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:41.610
or, move it to a place where it can be destroyed. So these are two types of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.150
natural immunities. And we have acquired immunities when we get antibodies that

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.242
are produced in the body in response to specific antigens. We get these through

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:55.288
experience. For example, when you become sick from a virus, you develop

00:00:55.288 --> 00:01:00.305
antibodies that defend against that virus. And that's why specific viruses

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:05.062
cannot affect you again in the future. This is an example of an acquired

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:06.316
immunity.
