00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If acceleration is proportional to 1/r², I can write an equation like this a₁ /a₂ = (r₁/r₂)⁻²

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the negative is because this is in the denominator and the 2 is because r².

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well let's take a₁ to be our normal acceleration due to gravity g, a₂ would be our acceleration

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
on the top of the mountain, we call that a₂ still,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
r₁ is our distance from the distance center of the earth when we're at sea level

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so that's 6,400 km and r₂ is 9 bigger than that because we're on the top of Mt. Everest.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And when you do this math out, you find that the acceleration on the top of Mt. Everest

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is equal to the normal acceleration times 0.997.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well that's exactly equal to 99.7% of the normal acceleration due to gravity,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which means we've decreased by about 0.3% and if you had made this negative, that was okay too.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So going from sea level to the highest place on earth, the acceleration due to gravity

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
only changes by &lt;1%.

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So g really is pretty close to being constant when you're on the surface of the earth.
