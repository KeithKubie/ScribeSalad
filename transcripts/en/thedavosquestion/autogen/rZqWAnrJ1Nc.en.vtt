00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910
I think it's but most of the time I

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
I think it's but most of the time I
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.200
I think it's but most of the time I
spent here at Davos there on the

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210
spent here at Davos there on the
 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.599
spent here at Davos there on the
environment and I think actually there's

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609
environment and I think actually there's
 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.039
environment and I think actually there's
a perverse logic because we have to

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
a perverse logic because we have to
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.570
a perverse logic because we have to
reinvent the way we do sense and get

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580
reinvent the way we do sense and get
 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.490
reinvent the way we do sense and get
more efficient as a chance to actually

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500
more efficient as a chance to actually
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.560
more efficient as a chance to actually
integrate the environmental issues with

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
integrate the environmental issues with
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.120
integrate the environmental issues with
into the same thing so we can have a lot

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
into the same thing so we can have a lot
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.620
into the same thing so we can have a lot
of discussions and Roscoe Murray's I

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630
of discussions and Roscoe Murray's I
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.840
of discussions and Roscoe Murray's I
really I think exciting stuff we may be

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
really I think exciting stuff we may be
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.220
really I think exciting stuff we may be
able to make some these efforts together

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
able to make some these efforts together
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320
able to make some these efforts together
that will have a big effect on the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
that will have a big effect on the
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.689
that will have a big effect on the
environment as well as the epicenters of

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
environment as well as the epicenters of
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.580
environment as well as the epicenters of
money now so I think actually both of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
money now so I think actually both of
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.470
money now so I think actually both of
them to be decremented recent our

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
them to be decremented recent our
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810
them to be decremented recent our
business
