00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.658
my name is Jon Stewart!

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.993
We got a good one

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.762
my guest tonight,
very funny author,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.031
Mary Roach is gonna be
joining us, but first!

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.466
I wanna talk to you about
spring, it's finally here,

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.903 align:start size:97% position:3%
first robin, the Easter
bunny, delivering to children

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.672
the unholy, tinted
spawn of a chicken

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.174
and its chocolate bar lover.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.909
(audience laughs)

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.045 align:start size:84% position:16%
The Mets undefeated
in first place,

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.014
but enough about our spring!

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.582
Enough about our spring!

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.385
Of course, the Arab Spring,
the flourishing of democracy

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.321
in the Middle East, countries
formally run by dictatorship,

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.390
that the US mostly supported.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.259 align:start size:81% position:19%
Eeh!
(audience laughs)

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.760
Hey, just out of curiosity.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.496 line:0%
How are things going today
in, I don't know, Egypt?

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.998 line:0%
- The economy in
Egypt, what a mess.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.434 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Unemployment at 13%,
inflation's almost doubled

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.902 line:0%
since November.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.037 line:0%
- [Reporter] Cairo's aging
infrastructure goes untended.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:13.273
- Since the revolution,
we've seen tourism drop

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.208
annually about $4 billion.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.610 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Reporter] The huge
spike in sexual assaults

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.145
against women.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.580
- Okay, I'm gonna put you
down for work in progress.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.950
(audience laughs)

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.418
Wow!

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.420
I gotta tell ya, it sounds like
this new Egyptian president,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start size:84% position:16%
Mohamed Morsi's
got his hands full.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.191 align:start size:81% position:19%
I can't wait to
see how he tackles

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.827 line:0%
these complex and urgent issues.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.962 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Egypt's public prosecutors
ordered the arrest

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.631 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
of popular television
presenter, Bassem Youssef.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.966
- Oh, good!

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:40.800
Who's that guy?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.335
I bet he's a terror!

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.270 align:start size:94% position:6%
What's he been, sabotaging
Egypt's infrastructure?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.039
Or harassing Egyptian
women on the streets,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.943
or unemploying Egyptian
people, what's he do?

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.811 line:0%
- Bassem Youssef hosts a TV show

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.581 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
known for poking fun
at the president.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.318
(audience laughs and cheers)

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.988
- Wait a minute.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.325
Our Bassem Youssef?

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:09.129
The comedian who hosts the
incredibly popular weekly

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.132
political satire
show, Al-Bernameg?

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.067
Now, I know Bassem pretty well.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.137
You can imagine that I was
shocked that this whole time,

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.339 align:start size:84% position:16%
I have been consorting
with a criminal!

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.508
(audience laughs)

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.342
What did he do?

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.643
I'm ready, I'm ready!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Reporter] The
country's top prosecutor

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:28.081 align:start size:88% position:13%
issued an arrest warrant
charging the comedian

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.519
with insulting both the
president and Islam.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.453
- That's illegal?

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.089
(audience laughs)

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.490
Seriously, that's
illegal in Egypt?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.360 align:start size:88% position:13%
'Cause if insulting
the president and Islam

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.863 align:start size:94% position:6%
were a jailable offense
here, Fox News go bye-bye.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.032
(audience laughs and cheers)

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.834
Yeah, they go bye-bye.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:52.005
But they don't go bye-bye.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.074 align:start size:97% position:3%
But you know, I guess the
rules on freedom of expression

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.609
are a little different in Egypt.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.678
Obviously, over there,
you cannot sow hatred

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.780
or insult religion.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.148 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm just curious,
what would something

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:04.551 align:start size:88% position:13%
like insulting religion
sound like, anyway?

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:08.454 line:0%
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh, that's insulting,
alright, I mean!

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.463
(audience laughs)
Wow, that's, woo!

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:21.100 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's, I'm sure that
when President Morsi
hears about that,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.669
he is going to be
so ang, I'm sorry,

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.304
that is President Morsi, really?

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.407
(audience laughs)

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.143 align:start size:97% position:3%
He didn't by any chance
precede those remarks with,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.178
"Here's the sort of thing
you really shouldn't say

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.313
"in Egypt," did he?

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.814
(audience chuckles)

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:35.648
No?

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.318
Oh.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.253
By the way, if you are
gonna nurse your children

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:43.122
on Zionist and Jew hatred,
you really gotta breastfeed,

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.225 align:start size:94% position:6%
(audience laughs)
I mean, it's the only way

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.027
to ensure that your kid gets
all the antisemitic nutrients

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.562 align:start size:84% position:16%
that he needs, I mean,
(audience laughs)

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.497 align:start size:84% position:16%
I guess in a pinch,
you could buy Gerber's

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
Elders of Zion formula, but,
(audience laughs)

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.535
it's a lesser product.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.004
Nah, you know what,
that was probably

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.739
a one-time thing
from Morsi, we all

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.942 align:start size:97% position:3%
lose our heads occasionally,
and insult religion,

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.611
even in Egypt, just once, right?

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:05.545 line:0%
Once?

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:09.115 line:0%
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.187
Okay, okay, two things!

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.123
On the descendant
from apes front,

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.558
I've got some bad news for you.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.127
(audience laughs)

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:25.465 align:start size:97% position:3%
It turns out, it's more
common than you might think.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.367
(audience laughs)

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:30.303 align:start size:81% position:19%
And as for the pig
thing, come on!

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.638 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're gonna insult
the Jews, you can't go

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.407 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a kosher
animal, your goats?

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.943
So clearly President
Morsi knows his way

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.911
around a good religious insult.

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.947 align:start size:88% position:13%
Is there anything Bassem
may have done here,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.983 line:0%
perhaps concerning
the President himslf?

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:45.418 line:0%
- [Reporter] The show mocked him

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.187 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
when he was awarded an
honorary degree in Pakistan,

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:50.089
and also took aim
at the President's

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.158
less-than-fluent English.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.662
- Making fun of the
President's hats,

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:59.499 align:start size:97% position:3%
and less-than-fluent English,
that was my entire career

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:00.833
for eight years!

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.635
(audience laughs and cheers)

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.370
Do you have any idea?

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.773
That's all I did!

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I'm sorry, you
should hear what we say

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:15.715
about the President
we supposedly like!

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.016
Barack!

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.252 align:start size:88% position:13%
You smoke so much,
your lungs are the only

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.287
authentically black
things about you!

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.755
(audience laughs)

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.223 align:start size:97% position:3%
Kinda reminds me, actually,
of his campaign slogan,

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.292
yes we can, but should we?

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.194
(audience laughs)

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.029 align:start size:84% position:16%
What happened to
Barry from the block?

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.365
(audience laughs)

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:35.768 align:start size:94% position:6%
Have we been fooled by the
Bar-rocks that you got?

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.136
(audience laughs)

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.638 align:start size:84% position:16%
All that people
that you didn't like

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:41.808
when someone else had it,
you decided to keep it.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.309
Oh my God, you're Frodo.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.277
You're Frodo!

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:47.513
(audience laughs)

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.681
Don't arrest me!

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.450
I don't get this man!

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.288
You're the President of Egypt!

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.123
The inheritor of
one of the greatest

00:05:57.123 --> 00:06:00.660
lands and people in
recorded history!

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.297 align:start size:84% position:16%
Your people invented
civilization!

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:08.167
The Ancient Greeks went
to Egypt, and were like,

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.969
"What do you got there,
geometry and mythology?

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.705
(audience laughs)

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You gonna finish those,
could we use those?"

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.275
(audience chuckles)

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:18.478 align:start size:84% position:16%
The Egyptians invented
written language,

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:21.013
and paper, toothpaste!

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:23.516
People buying buried with
their cats, that was you!

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.017
(audience laughs)

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:29.522
A style of walking people
sing about, even today!

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:32.125
Egypt built the Great Pyramids.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.794
Maybe you could get some of
the folks who built those

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:36.829
to work on getting
you a thicker skin!

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.065
Well, not the same people.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.701
(audience laughs)

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:45.938
I obviously, I can't
handle two Passovers,

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:46.973
I can't handle it!

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:49.575
(audience laughs)

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.845 align:start size:84% position:16%
So Bassem Youssef
pokes fun of your hat.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:56.249 align:start size:94% position:6%
And your lack of promised
democratic reforms.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.317
What are you worried about?

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:01.187
You're the President of
Egypt, you have an army.

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:04.090
He's got puns in a show,
you have tanks and planes,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.192 align:start size:88% position:13%
we should know, we
still have the receipts!

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.928 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience laughs)
Look!

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.197
Silencing a comedian
doesn't qualify you

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.065
to be President of Egypt.

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.668
Just President of NBC, I mean!

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:17.470 align:start size:97% position:3%
(audience laughs and cheers)
Woo!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.639
I gotta tell ya something.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.278
Talk about a once-proud empire.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.413
(audience laughs)

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:28.915
Whatever problems
you have in Egypt,

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.017
at least you didn't
greenlight Smash.

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.119
(audience groans and laughs)

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.953
Look.

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:37.757
When you're...
(audience laughs)

Sorry, a couple of
bloggers just went nuts.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:44.397
(audience laughs)

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:47.967 align:start position:0%
When you are actually powerful,
you don't have to be petty.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.103
I know, I'm petty all the time.

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:54.440
And the truth is,
look, come here,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.876
let me talk to you
over here, come here.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:59.879
(audience chuckles)

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.714
Boobie.

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:05.451 align:start size:97% position:3%
What are you worried about,
Mr. President of Egypt?

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:08.654
The power of satire to
overthrow the status quo?

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.824
I've been doing this
crapfest for 15 years.

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:13.359
Granted, I'm not as
popular as Bassem,

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.294
but we've had our nights.

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:18.798 align:start size:97% position:3%
And just so you know,
there's been a grand total of

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:21.501 align:start position:0%
zero toppled governments we
brought about during that time.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.369
(audience laughs)

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.404
We couldn't stop the
Iraq War, we tried.

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.139 align:start size:88% position:13%
I couldn't even get
Jim Cramer off the air.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:30.309 align:start size:88% position:13%
Jim Cramer's a money
show where sound effects

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:31.878 align:start size:94% position:6%
give you stock investment
advice, it's a--

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:34.380
(audience laughs)

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.882
But come on!

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:39.051
Charging Bassem Youssef with
insulting Egypt and Islam?

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.086
I know Bassem.

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.655
Bassem is my friend, my brother!

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.524
There are two things
he loves in this world

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.460
with all his heart,
Egypt and Islam.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.761
And his family.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.029
Three things.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.431
There's three, and the,
what is that flat bread

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.567 align:start size:88% position:13%
with the cheese, it's
tart, it's like a white,

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.702
it's not baba ganoush, it's
like, there's four things

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:57.870
that he loves.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.374 align:start size:97% position:3%
My point is, Bassem Youssef
loves Egypt so much,

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.709
he chooses the live there,
even though some crazy guy

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.145 align:start size:84% position:16%
is threatening to
arrest him, oh, right.

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:10.149 align:start size:81% position:19%
Um...
(audience laughs)

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
But by the way, without Bassem,
and all those journalists,

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.321
and bloggers, and
brave protesters,

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.090 align:start size:88% position:13%
who took to Tahrir
Square to voice dissent,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.593
you, President Morsi,
would be in a position

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.094
to repress them.

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.563 align:start size:94% position:6%
(audience cheers)
For someone who spent time

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.997
in jail yourself!

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:27.867
For someone...

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.471
For someone who spent time in
jail yourself under Mubarak,

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:34.240
you seem awfully eager to
send other people there

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.409
for the same non-crimes!

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.377 align:start size:97% position:3%
And just like you, they
will only emerge from prison

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:41.180
stronger and more
determined, so.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.015 align:start size:84% position:16%
All sending comedians
and bloggers

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:46.819
to prison accomplishes
is, lowering the quality

00:09:46.819 --> 00:09:48.521
of prison-yard athletics.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.357
(audience laughs)

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.429
Obviously, look, you don't
have to take democracy advice

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.098
from a ape pig-man like myself!

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.933
(audience laughs)

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.602
But perhaps you'll
listen to this brave

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.971
Egyptian revolutionary.

Whoever criticizes me

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:07.673
has the full right to do so.

I welcome any criticism.

There is no way that any
harm can befall them,

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:30.162 line:0%
because of their opinions,
or their personal opposition.

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.998

that a great nation
like Egypt deserves.

the world is watching!

No one wants to see Egypt
plunge into darkness,

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:42.608 align:start size:94% position:6%
democracy isn't a
