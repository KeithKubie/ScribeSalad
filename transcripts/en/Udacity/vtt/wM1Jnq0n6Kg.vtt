00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.360
Reshooting video 11 solution.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.710
So, previously we found a histogram of the signed errors of using our

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.820
guess of 1,451 and a half seconds.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.200
Here we're trying to find a similar histogram, but of the absolute errors.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.770
So, to do that we're going to do something extremely similar.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.520
let's again run through the time until next list.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.870
So, here again we're going to run through the time until next list.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.060
But instead of just depending the signed difference here,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.950
we're going to create a new list, abs_diffs.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.220
And we're going to append the absolute value of the very same difference.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.760
So, let's just go ahead and evaluate that.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.960
Now that we have those values, we can create a histogram.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.730
So, let's just recall what we're looking at, we're looking at each actual

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.030
intertweet time and subtracting from it, our guess of 1,451 and a half seconds.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.000
We've collected all of those differences together in a list and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.490
this is the histogram of those differences.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.910
And, let's use describe to get the answers that we want.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.819
You can see here that the mean absolute difference is 4446.8.
