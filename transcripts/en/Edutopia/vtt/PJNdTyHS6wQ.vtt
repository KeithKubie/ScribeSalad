00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:12.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Arne Duncan was appointed
CEO of Chicago Public Schools

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.196
in 2001 by Mayor Richard Daley.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.076
A champion of community schools
and after-school programs,

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:21.706
Duncan helped create
the Ariel Academy,

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:26.826
a unique public school backed by a
private firm that supplies each class

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.856
with a $20,000.00 stock
portfolio to manage.

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:33.816
He graduated magna cum laude
from Harvard University

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:36.346
and was co-captain of
the basketball team.

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.936
He has played professionally
in Australia

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:42.766
and in countless pickup games
with President-elect Barack Obama.

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:46.446
&gt;&gt;Arne: I was just so lucky to grow
up -- I was always the young guy.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.786
I was part of my mother's program,
so I'd grow up playing against guys

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:51.986
who were a lot older and a lot
better than me and was able to learn

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:56.006
from them and get beaten enough times
to get a little toughness maybe,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:01:00.716
but it's just sort of shaped me
growing up, and I was able to sort

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:03.636
of travel the city and play in
playgrounds all over the South

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:07.206
and West Side, and you just
learn so much through sports.

00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:12.696
It's all the values that we're trying
to instill in our kids of hard work

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:16.736
and unselfishness and being part
of a team and teamwork and sort

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:21.216
of sacrificing personal goals or
personal glory for the larger good.

00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.116
And it's easy to talk
about those values.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:27.296
It's another thing to try
and live them and living them

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.706
on whether it's a basketball court

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:30.256
or a football field or
whatever it might be.

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:33.926
I think sports is just an
extraordinary teaching ground,

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:38.006
and so I was able to have great,
great mentors like John Rogers

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:41.036
and others, who I learned
from, and those lessons

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:45.206
on the court have helped to shape my
character and I'm so lucky for that.

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:47.526
I got to play in lots
of neighborhoods

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:50.226
that were tough neighborhoods and
you learned to judge character very,

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.936
very quickly and who you could
trust and who you couldn't.

00:01:52.936 --> 00:01:55.916
And I wouldn't be doing
what I'm doing today

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:58.476
if I didn't have those skills,
and it's a real way for me

00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:00.056
to relate to our students.

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:01.706
I'll go out and play
with the high school kids

00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:04.506
or play the elementary kids and
rather than seeing a guy in a suit,

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:08.026
you can sweat a little bit and
have a real nice shared experience,

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.446
and then you can really sit down and
talk afterwards and get a real sense

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:12.536
from students in terms of
what's working, what's not,

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:20.636
so it's been a real bridge-builder
for me and it's a lot of fun as well.

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:23.216
&gt;&gt;Overall, I'm extraordinarily
proud of the progress we're making.

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:27.306
Over the past five years,
we've actually improved at more

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:29.466
than twice the rate of
the rest of the state.

00:02:29.756 --> 00:02:31.316
It's been dramatic improvements.

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.516
We are absolutely closing
the achievement gap.

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:37.646
Twenty years ago we were called
the worst school system in America

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:40.376
by the former secretary of
education, Bill Bennett.

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:41.736
I don't know whether
that was true or not,

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:44.256
but we definitely didn't have a
school system we could be proud of.

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:46.386
We've come an extraordinarily
long way,

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.266
particularly since the
mayor took over in 1995.

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:51.266
But our goal is very ambitious.

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.506
We want to go from worst to best,
and I absolutely am convinced

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:56.536
that we have a chance to
become the best big city,

00:02:56.596 --> 00:03:00.586
the best urban school system in
the country over the next couple

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:04.106
of years, and that's what we're
trying to work extraordinarily hard

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:07.216
to do and there are lots of
strategies we can get into,

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:08.836
but the bottom line is we have

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.386
to dramatically increase
graduation rates.

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:14.256
We need to continue to
dramatically reduce dropout rates,

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:17.806
and we have to make sure all of our
students upon graduation are ready

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:20.756
to go to college and have the
academic skills or are ready to go

00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:21.656
into the world of work,

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:23.816
and ultimately that's how
I want to be measured.

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:31.306
&gt;&gt;The core of our work is a focus
on instructional excellence,

00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:35.196
sort of a back-to-basics curriculum
and reading, first and foremost,

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:37.696
and I'm just convinced that if
we can teach our children to read

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:41.116
and to love to read at an early
age that they have this world

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:42.756
of opportunity available to them

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:45.696
if they can express their
ideas verbally and on paper.

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:48.406
And if we don't do that well,
frankly, nothing else we do matters,

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:53.516
so it's a huge, huge laser-like focus
on great instruction, great teaching

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:56.146
and a laser-like focus on literacy.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.796
Second is what we call our
"Human Capital Initiative,"

00:04:00.176 --> 00:04:02.356
which is really trying to
recruit the best and brightest

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:04.016
into every level of the organization.

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:07.966
We've gone from 9,000
applicants wanting to teach

00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:12.276
in Chicago public schools
to over 20,000 applicants.

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:14.956
We're actually more
selective than universities

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:16.586
like Stanford now in terms of hiring.

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:19.256
WE have about 12 applicants
for every position.

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:21.316
&gt;&gt;The third-quarter
strategy's a bit of a broad one.

00:04:21.316 --> 00:04:23.226
I call it sort of more
learning opportunities.

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:25.146
It's sort of challenging
the assumption that --

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:29.946
if I don't really think a school
day that is five days a week,

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:32.326
six hours a day, nine
months a year --

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:35.386
I just think that's an
outmoded model; it's broken.

00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:37.876
It's based on the agrarian economy.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:40.136
Last time I checked here
in Chicago not too many

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:43.466
of our children are working in farms,
and so we have to do a lot more,

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:46.376
so after-school programming
is a huge one for me,

00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:49.096
really making our schools,
community centers open long hours,

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:51.716
where our schools can become
the hearts of the community,

00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:56.956
make good things happen for children
and going to more detail on that.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.046
We're trying to do a lot on
early childhood education,

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:03.186
getting to children younger, three-
and four-year-olds, more preschool,

00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:04.686
more full-day kindergarten.

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:06.536
We can get those literacy
skills intact.

00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:08.936
When our students hit
kindergarten, they're ready to go,

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:11.366
and then finally we have
a very ambitious effort

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:14.756
that the mayor's done a great job
leading called the Renaissance 2010

00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:19.436
Initiative to create 100 great new
schools in the city by the year 2010,

00:05:19.436 --> 00:05:20.486
and we're about halfway there.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.476
We opened 15 great
new schools this fall.

00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:24.366
We're at about 48 total now.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:28.256
We have 17 planned for fall
'07, and we want to, again,

00:05:28.256 --> 00:05:29.996
continue to create
great, new opportunities

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.796
where they haven't existed
historically, and so there's a range

00:05:32.856 --> 00:05:36.136
of just more -- the large bucket I
use has more learning opportunities,

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:39.956
more time on task, more time during
the day, getting to children younger

00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:42.156
and creating more opportunities
where they didn't exist.

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:44.686
But those three core strategies,
instructional excellence,

00:05:44.976 --> 00:05:46.896
getting the best and brightest
to work at every level

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:49.426
of the organization and trying
to do more for our children,

00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:52.766
both in terms of early childhood
and after school, more new schools,

00:05:53.076 --> 00:05:55.996
if we can continue to execute
on those every single year,

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:58.356
I'm convinced we'll get
where we need to go.

00:06:02.786 --> 00:06:04.376
&gt;&gt;This piece of it's
a really personal one.

00:06:04.376 --> 00:06:08.256
My mother tried to start an
after-school program in 1960

00:06:08.256 --> 00:06:11.356
and started it at the local public
school, and they didn't allow her to,

00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:12.436
so she had to start
-- she had to work

00:06:12.436 --> 00:06:13.846
in the church basement
across the street.

00:06:14.366 --> 00:06:17.166
And then about 30 years later, my
sister and I came back and tried

00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:19.436
to also start an after-school
program, and we weren't allowed

00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:20.536
into the schools and so we ended

00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:22.116
up in the same church
basement as my mother.

00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:25.656
And so when I got in this position,
the first thing I said we'd do is

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:27.276
that we'd open the
schools to the community,

00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:29.356
that these are these
fabulous resources.

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:30.706
We have over 600 buildings.

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:36.346
Every single one have classrooms and
libraries and computer labs and gyms

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:41.096
and you name it, swimming pools,
these fabulous physical resources

00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:44.546
that previously at two-thirty in
the afternoon the kids were swept

00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:46.356
out of there and into the streets.

00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:48.386
It's incomprehensible to me.

00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:50.156
And so what we tried to
do is create a culture

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:52.506
where we welcomed the
children but, most importantly,

00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:54.526
welcomed the community in
with all the nonprofits

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:55.696
and social-service agencies

00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:57.536
who are now providing
services in the schools.

00:06:57.886 --> 00:07:03.166
And we have a set of over 100
schools now that're open 11, 12, 13,

00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:06.836
14 hours a day, 6 days a week,
11 months out of the year

00:07:07.086 --> 00:07:09.186
with a whole host of
after-school programming,

00:07:09.186 --> 00:07:13.126
whether it's academic enrichment
for our students but also drama

00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:16.146
and sports and music and
chess and debate and yearbook,

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:19.366
whatever it might be, and then
activities for older brothers

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:22.136
and sisters and parents
as well: GED and ESL

00:07:22.136 --> 00:07:24.256
and family-literacy nights
and family counseling.

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:28.916
And, again, I'm just convinced
where school becomes the true heart,

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.766
the true center of the
community, which is the center

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:33.856
of a family's life, our students are
going to do extraordinarily well,

00:07:33.856 --> 00:07:35.046
and we're seeing those results.

00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:38.166
This is hard work, and, again,
it's harder to keep schools open.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:38.716
It's messier.

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:39.436
It's dirtier.

00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:42.306
You got to figure out hours;
there's some challenges there,

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:46.056
but it's the right thing to do and
our children desperately need it,

00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:49.166
and they need it more than ever,
and to me this is an issue that cuts

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:53.286
through race and class, whether it's
two parents or both parents working

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:55.186
in an affluent family
or whatever it might be,

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:59.846
whether it's a single mom working
whether it's a job or two jobs

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:03.686
or three jobs, or we have
about 9,000 homeless students,

00:08:03.746 --> 00:08:06.546
and whether it's students going
home, frankly, to no-parent families,

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.826
whatever the family situation,
whatever the socioeconomic status,

00:08:10.216 --> 00:08:13.226
our children need great
after-school programming.

00:08:13.506 --> 00:08:14.976
We have some extraordinary kids.

00:08:14.976 --> 00:08:17.956
We have some extraordinary kids
who're beating the odds every single

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:22.296
day after coming from some very tough
situations, and we owe it to them

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:25.466
to do our best and to create the
best opportunities possible for them.

00:08:25.536 --> 00:08:27.366
I can't think of anything
I'd rather be doing.

00:08:32.336 --> 00:08:33.976
&gt;&gt;I've been fortunate
growing up as part

00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:36.956
of my mother's after-school program
to see phenomenal young people

00:08:37.386 --> 00:08:39.296
who happen to be poor, happen not

00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:41.216
to always have the most
put-together families,

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:45.096
but to see how much those students
wanted to succeed academically

00:08:45.096 --> 00:08:48.816
and to see how successful they were,
given her support and other support

00:08:48.816 --> 00:08:51.016
over the long haul, and so rather

00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:53.636
than just running an after-school
program, could you create a school?

00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:55.576
And then if you could do
that, could you create a --

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:57.776
creating a system of schools,
a whole city of schools

00:08:58.106 --> 00:09:00.656
that really help students
fulfill their tremendous academic

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:01.716
and social potential.

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:04.536
Quite frankly, most of the
time growing up as part

00:09:04.536 --> 00:09:07.196
of my mother's program the
public schools were the enemy.

00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:10.386
We were trying to do from three
o'clock to eight o'clock at night

00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:13.396
with students what wasn't
happening during the school day.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.586
And I'm a little radical on this.

00:09:15.586 --> 00:09:18.246
I think when public
education doesn't do its job,

00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:22.136
public education perpetuates poverty
and perpetuates social failure.

00:09:22.136 --> 00:09:25.366
And, when it does do its
job, it really is the --

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:29.366
it opens the door of
opportunity to the mainstream

00:09:29.366 --> 00:09:30.886
of America and to the middle class.

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:36.206
And so, for me, it's a labor
of love; it's a passion,

00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:40.276
and I think quality public
education is the civil rights issue

00:09:40.276 --> 00:09:42.086
of our generation.

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:48.796
&gt;&gt;Ariel is how I got my
start in public education.

00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:52.246
I ran John Rogers'
nonprofit Ariel Foundation

00:09:52.846 --> 00:09:58.626
for about six years starting in
1992, and in 1995 we were young

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:02.026
and dumb enough to think that we
could create a great public school,

00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:04.626
and that was one of the first things
the mayor did when he took control

00:10:04.626 --> 00:10:09.076
of the public schools in 1995, along
with the previous CEO, Paul Vallas

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:11.006
and the board chair Gery Chico.

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:13.386
They issued an RFP,
request for proposals,

00:10:13.826 --> 00:10:14.876
for groups that were interested

00:10:15.066 --> 00:10:18.236
in running new schools,
new public schools.

00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:21.676
And myself and my sister and a
small team of us, again, were young

00:10:21.676 --> 00:10:24.576
and naïve enough to think that
we had a few ideas about how

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.916
to create great education in
the heart of the inner city,

00:10:26.946 --> 00:10:28.716
and we had applied and we were one

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:31.796
of six groups chosen
to open new schools.

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:34.356
It has enabled us to do lots
of things you couldn't just do

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:37.276
as a public school here, because
public education in Illinois is

00:10:37.276 --> 00:10:38.816
so desperately underfunded.

00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:41.096
So, whether it's a
curriculum director,

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:44.436
whether it's extensive after-school
programming, whether it's a chance

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:47.446
for our students to actually
invest in real stocks and be part

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:48.606
of this investment curriculum,

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:52.386
which is this fascinating whole
series of summer opportunities.

00:10:52.776 --> 00:10:56.036
Literally today we have almost
50 of the Ariel Academy students

00:10:56.296 --> 00:10:58.856
at a McDonald's board
meeting with [inaudible],

00:10:58.856 --> 00:11:04.336
and it's just been a phenomenal
partnership and it is exactly a model

00:11:04.336 --> 00:11:07.516
that we'd love to try and replicate
and get other companies to step up

00:11:07.786 --> 00:11:12.206
and similarly invest and invest
deeply and over the long haul

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:16.976
with a school and really make a huge
difference in those students' lives.

00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:18.406
