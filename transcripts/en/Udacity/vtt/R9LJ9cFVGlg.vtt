00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.097
To make sure we have our rational function written in simplest form, I'd like

00:00:03.097 --> 00:00:06.121
you to cancel out any common factors that are shared by the numerator and the

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:11.308
denominator, then write the simplified form of the function right here. Note

00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:14.636
that I've still included our domain restrictions here, which means we won't

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:19.152
lose any information, even if we cancel out some factors. I also would like you

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.142
to make sure that in this final form down here, there's no constant factor left

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:27.058
in the denominator. I'd like the only constant factor to be in the numerator.
