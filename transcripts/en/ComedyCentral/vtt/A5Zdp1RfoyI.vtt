- YOU--LET ME THROUGH.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.706 line:0%
THIS IS BULLSHIT, GENE.

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.708
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, RICH?

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:09.876
- IN THE NEXT EPISODE

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:13.446
STEVE URKEL TURNS CARL
INTO A GIANT SANDWICH

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.047
AND ACCIDENTALLY EATS HIM?

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.882
- HA-HA, BUT WAIT,
THAT'S HILARIOUS, BUDDY.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.117
IT'S HILARIOUS.
- COME ON!

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.753
I'M AN ACTOR, GENE!

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.554
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.955
- I KNOW,
BUT YOU KNOW, AFTER THAT--

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.757
AFTER THAT FIRST GUEST SPOT
WITH STEVE URKEL,

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.426
I MEAN, AMERICA FELL IN LOVE
WITH HIM, MAN.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.261
WE HAD TO MAKE HIM A REGULAR,
AND NOW, YOU KNOW--

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.429
HEY, LISTEN, HE'S THE STAR
OF THE SHOW NOW, SWEETHEART.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:31.564
WE GOTTA PLAY BALL, BUBBELEH.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.866
- DON'T YOU DARE
"BUBBELEH" ME, GENE.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.869
NOW, LAST WEEK, STEVE USED
HIS TRANSFORMATION MACHINE

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.404
TO TURN CARL INTO A CAR

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.473
AND DRIVE HIM AROUND
THE MONACO GRAND PRIX?

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.740
COME ON!

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.410
HOW MANY TIMES YOU GONNA
USE THIS TRANSFORMATION MACHINE?

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.912
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BLUE COLLAR<i>COSBY SHOW.</i>

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:48.881
NOW YOU'RE TURNING IT
INTO GODDAMN<i>QUANTUM LEAP.</i>

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.316
WHO WRITES THIS SHIT?

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.551
- OKAY, I COULDN'T TELL YOU
EVEN IF I WANTED TO, OKAY, MAN?

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.087
WE GOT, LIKE,
21 WRITERS UP THERE, OKAY?

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.421
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,
REGINALD?

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.156
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT THEY DON'T DECIDE

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.425
WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS SHOW, OKAY?

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:00.326
WE BOTH KNOW WHO DECIDES
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SHOW.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.663
- TWO WEEKS AGO STEVE URKEL USED
HIS INVISIBILITY RAY ON CARL

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.731
AND I WASN'T
EVEN IN THE GODDAMN EPISODE.

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.166
IT WAS JUST MY VOICE.
- YES, I KNOW.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.467
I KNOW, REGINALD.
I'M SORRY.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.503
I FUCKING APOLOGIZE.
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.672
- THEN STEVE USED HIS
VOICE-CHANGING RAY TO TURN CARL

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:14.273
INTO A HIGH-PITCHED,
NERDY VOICE.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.075
WHO DO YOU THINK
PROVIDED THE VOICE FOR THAT?

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.277
- DON'T GET TOO FEISTY
ON ME NOW, REG.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.645
LET'S NOT GO DOWN THAT PATH,
OKAY?

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.281
- OH, OH, WE ARE GOING
DOWN THAT PATH, GENE.

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:26.352
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
HARRIET, EDDIE, LAURA, GRANDMA,

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.022
AUNT RACHEL, LITTLE RICHIE,
AND THE OTHER LITTLE KID

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.323
ARE GONNA GET TELEPORTED
TO ANOTHER DIMENSION,

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.959
AND THEN STEVE INJECTS CARL
WITH HIS OWN DNA,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.128
SO CARL
TURNS INTO ANOTHER STEVE URKEL.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:37.997
THAT'S TWO STEVE URKELS
AND NO FAMILY

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.265
ON A SHOW CALLED<i>FAMILY MATTERS.</i>

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.766
HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT WORK?

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.301
- LISTEN, LISTEN, REGINALD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.436
URKEL MANIA IS UNSTOPPABLE,
OKAY?

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:45.604
HE'S A PHENOMENON.

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.173
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT, OKAY?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.675
IT'S UP TO S--

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:49.675
HIM.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:51.878
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.113
I'M AN ACTOR.
I'M A FUCKING ACTOR.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.781
I AM A REAL ACTOR.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.016
I DID<i>RICHARD III.</i>

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.051
I WAS IN<i>TRUE WEST</i>â– 
WITH SHERMAN HEMSLEY.

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.686 size:88% position:44%
I WAS IN<i>DIEHARD,</i>DAMN IT.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.187
FUCK STEVE URKEL!

00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:03.790
- FUCK--
YOU WILL SUCK

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.358
STEVE URKEL'S FUCK
IF HE WANTS YOU TO!

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:07.560
YOU WILL SUCK HIS FUCKING DICK,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.962
HE IS OUR BREAD AND BUTTER,
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:11.297
I AM HIGH ON COCAINE!

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.832
- I'M A FUCKING ACTOR, GENE!

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.334
I DONE MORE COCAINE
THAN YOU WEIGH, MOTHERFUCKER!

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:17.803
- I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT YOU
ARE, REGINALD VELJOHNSON.

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:21.841
YOU'RE A FUCKING PAWN
IN THAT NERD'S GAME.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.176
YOU ARE A FUCKING PAWN!

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.413
DO YOU THINK I HAVE ANY POWER
OVER WHAT THAT MONSTER DOES?

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.514
ANY POWER AT ALL?

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:30.683
- AHH!

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:34.186
- I AM THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
OF DEVELOPMENT

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:37.223
FOR THE AMERICAN BRO--

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:41.360
- GENE?
GENE?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.199
GENE, WHAT'S BECOME OF YOU,
GENE?

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:51.037
- I AM NOTHING.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.872
- GENE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT, GENE,

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.406
BUT YOU'RE SCARING ME.

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.509
OH, NO, DON'T, DON'T,
DON'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY, GENE.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.043
EVERYONE DOES TOO MUCH COKE
SOMETIMES,

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:00.346
BUT DO THE--JUST, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH THE GUN, GENE?

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.682
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
DON'T--NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.784
WE CAN TALK THIS THROUGH.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.219
OKAY?

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.122
- THE KING IS DEAD.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.723
LONG LIVE THE KING.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.127
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.869
- DID I DO THAT?

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.378
- JALEEL.
- JALEEL?

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.280
THERE IS NO JALEEL.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.415
ONLY STEVE.

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.651
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STEVE.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:44.122
- YIPPIE KI-YAY, MOTHERFUCKER!
[gun clicking]

00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:46.759
- FORGETTING SOMETHING, CARL?

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.893
- DON'T YOU COME NEAR ME.

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:49.595
STAY AWAY FROM ME, YOU HEAR?

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:53.266
- COULD HAVE ALL BEEN SO SIMPLE,
CARL.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.268
JUST SAY YOUR LINES

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.437
AND TAKE THE MONEY.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.005
- YOU'RE A MONSTER.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.644
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:07.246
I, I, I, I CAN'T CONTROL--

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.148
- AM I DOING THIS?

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.349
- NO, NO, NO,

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.484
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.620
STEVE, I'LL DO ANYTHING.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.522
- YOU WILL DO
WHAT I WANT ON<i>FAMILY MATTERS.</i>

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.992
- YES, YES.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:21.628
OF COURSE, STEVE.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.669
- SEE YOU ON SET, CARL.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:37.644
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, STEVE!
