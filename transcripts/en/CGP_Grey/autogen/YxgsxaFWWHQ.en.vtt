00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
 The Lord of the Rings has many different types of people: 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.809
 elf people, dwarf people, tree people, middle-class people, and even people. 

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.633
 There are about a million pages of backgrounds telling this world 

00:00:09.657 --> 00:00:11.757
 That goes far beyond books and movies 

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.181
 but if you do not want to read them all, 

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:14.805
 here you have a stand of four minutes. 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:15.729
 Let's start with the magicians. 

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:18.553
 It is easy to confuse magicians as trained humans in magic, 

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:19.477
 as in any other place. 

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.901
 But in the Lord of the Rings, the wizards are angels of a lower level. 

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:25.625
 They are called "Istari" (prepared for many names in this video) 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.649
 and there are five: Saruman el blanco, Gandalf el gris, 

00:00:28.673 --> 00:00:30.673
 Radagast the brown and the two blue magicians. 

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:35.297
 Its power basically comes from being supernatural beings, and not so much 

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:35.645
 of later learning. 

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:38.745
 They are sent to help people 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.169
 of the world to deal with evil (for whom? we will see this more strongly) 

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:42.193
 Not totally successful. 

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:45.017
 Saruma, the leader of the five, with an iron mentality and "wheels" 

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.741
 It is corrupted, Radagast is distracted by the beautiful nature, the Blue Magicians 

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:52.165
 they fade to the east, possibly beginning magic sects, 

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:54.689
 and only Gandalf remains loyal to the cause. 

00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:57.813
 Now, where there are angels, there is a God, and in this universe 

00:00:57.837 --> 00:00:59.037
 is Eru Ilúvatar. 

00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.661
 In the beginning, there was nothing except Eru, and the infinite and eternal nothing, 

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:06.385
 which is quite boring, so he created many angels to make him company. 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.709
 The angels of Ilúvatar are called Ainur and are divided into two groups: 

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.333
 the Valar, guardians of the world, of whom there are fourteen 

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:14.157
 (or fifteen, depending on who you want to count) 

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:15.181
 and their lack, the Mayar. 

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:18.305
 The wizards are the Istari, a subgroup of the Mayar, who serve the 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.329
 Valar, all creatures created by Ilúvatar. 

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:23.653
 Ilúvatar and all his angels sang together to create the world. 

00:01:23.677 --> 00:01:26.877
 Harmony started well, but there was a Valar, called Melkor, 

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:30.501
 And just by name, Melkor, you know what will happen 

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:33.925
 before knowing that it is also the most intelligent and the most powerful 

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:34.649
 of the angels 

00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:35.973
 And also a bit lonely. 

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:38.897
 Melkor did not want to be part of the choir, like his classmates Valar 

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:39.421
 less bright, 

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:41.545
 wanted his own song in creations. 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.069
 And so his voice became disagreeing with that of others ... 

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:46.493
 and created all the suffering and evil in the world. 

00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:49.317
 But Melkor's song also attracted some Maylar towards his band, 

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:53.041
 including the Balrogs, which means that Balrog is an angel of lower level, 

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:56.565
 putting it at the same level of power as Gandalf. 

00:01:56.589 --> 00:02:00.489
 Which explains why an old man can fight a lava monster 

00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:00.937
 giant 

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:03.837
 Through his disagreeable melody, Melkor also created some of the creatures 

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.261
 wicked people of the world, like dragons and trolls, what brings us 

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:08.285
 to think about things that are not angels. 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:12.409
 Other Valar also created their own non-angelic creations, though 

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.833
 in a more cooperative spirit with Ilúvatar. 

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:16.357
 Manwë created the Giant Axes, Aulë created the dwarves, 

00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:20.281
 and his wife, Yavanna created all the animals and plants of the world, 

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:23.505
 Before finishing it with the Ents, his 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:24.829
 own race of conscious creatures. 

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.953
 While Ilúvatar seemed content to leave his Vala 

00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:29.577
 To create the majority of things, he personally created 

00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:30.801
 the men and the elves, 

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.825
 which makes them special, and in some way above all other creatures 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.273
 you live 

00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:35.373
 Sorry, dwarves 

00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:39.297
 And, among these two, men are the favorite child of Ilúvatar. 

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:43.021
 And shows them by giving men a shorter life than the rest 

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:45.045
 and also the present of death? 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.269
 Thank you very much, papa. 

00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:48.893
 But his short life makes them separate from the other creatures, and no 

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.517
 They are linked to the music of creation and the world, something that others do. 

00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:55.041
 So, they are able to forge their own futures. 

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:58.665
 This quality makes them the "We do things" of Middle-earth species. 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.089
 The elves, on the other hand, are so much linked to the world as practically 

00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:05.113
 They are made of nature. The same thing happens with the dwarves in their own way 

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:06.137
 and the Ents, of course. 

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:10.061
 These species basically follow the course of nature, and this is partly why 

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:13.385
 It's hard for humans to get them to do anything. 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.809
 Even when faced with armies of orcs, what brings us to the orcs. 

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:20.533
 In Melkor he was powerful, but he could not make creatures as bright as elves and men, 

00:03:20.557 --> 00:03:23.357
 so he cheated some of them at first and 

00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.881
 raising them selectively over generations until they reach these creatures. 

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:30.305
 These issues were carried out by Melkor: torturing elves, creating monsters, 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.129
 Recruit angels on the other side, eventually, but not surprisingly, they brought 

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:37.453
 to a war that Melkor loses and is banished into the void. 

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:40.477
 All the conflicts of the Lord of the Rings come long afterwards 

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:43.501
 of the epic battle between God and the evil of this universe. 

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:46.325
 Sauron, the great bad guy, who causes all the problems in the books, 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.349
 It was only a Mayar, though an unusually powerful one 

00:03:49.373 --> 00:03:52.073
 He began his career as a lieutenant in Melkor. 

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:55.197
 After the war he made a ring to concentrate all its strength, but that 

00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:56.721
 It's a story for another day. 

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:59.045
 Last but not least, we have Hobbits. 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.869
 Although they seem related to dwarves, since they live underground and 

00:04:01.893 --> 00:04:04.393
 The vertical challenge, the Hobbits are a subspecies of men. 

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.617
 For being such an important race, there is little written about its origin, 

00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:09.441
 Apart from the phrase "related to men". 

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:12.765
 Apparently, in a million pages still without being able to talk about everything, 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.789
 like in a four-minute video.
