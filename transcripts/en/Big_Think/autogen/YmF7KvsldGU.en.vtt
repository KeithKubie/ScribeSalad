00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 align:start position:0%
building is in that graph yeah I took a
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
building is in that graph yeah I took a

also lets you apply basically your idea

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
information about Who I am or later you
 

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.020 align:start position:0%
information about Who I am or later you
find<00:11:46.140><c> out</c><00:11:46.260><c> I'm</c><00:11:46.380><c> a</c><00:11:46.470><c> liar</c><00:11:46.680><c> or</c><00:11:47.160><c> later</c><00:11:47.550><c> you</c><00:11:47.790><c> find</c>

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.030 align:start position:0%
find out I'm a liar or later you find
 

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.820 align:start position:0%
find out I'm a liar or later you find
out<00:11:48.120><c> the</c><00:11:48.270><c> class</c><00:11:48.450><c> with</c><00:11:48.720><c> someplace</c><00:11:49.140><c> else</c><00:11:49.530><c> can</c>

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
out the class with someplace else can
 

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.490 align:start position:0%
out the class with someplace else can
weigh<00:11:50.010><c> those</c><00:11:50.280><c> previous</c><00:11:50.960><c> recordings</c><00:11:51.960><c> against</c>

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
weigh those previous recordings against
 

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.060 align:start position:0%
weigh those previous recordings against
ya<00:11:53.400><c> so</c><00:11:53.940><c> so</c><00:11:54.420><c> it's</c><00:11:54.780><c> sort</c><00:11:54.990><c> of</c><00:11:55.050><c> the</c><00:11:55.500><c> idea</c><00:11:55.800><c> is</c><00:11:56.040><c> that</c>

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.070 align:start position:0%
ya so so it's sort of the idea is that
 

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
