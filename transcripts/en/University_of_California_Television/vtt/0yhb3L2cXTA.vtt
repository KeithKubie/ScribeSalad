00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.286
(logo swooshing)

00:00:01.286 --> 00:00:04.536
(clicking and beeping)

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.358
(slow piano music)

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.504
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical eight.

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:15.004
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.756
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:25.987
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.987 --> 00:00:29.102
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:31.185
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:34.063
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.977 --> 00:00:37.611
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:39.694
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.187
We shape the future

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:46.515
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:48.563
Carta brings together experts

00:00:48.563 --> 00:00:50.326
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:53.363
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:55.030
and how we got here,

00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:58.163
an exploration made possible

00:00:58.163 --> 00:01:01.246
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.138 --> 00:01:24.721
(lively music)

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:30.299
(lively music)

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.310
- In the 1860s or so, a Scottish essayist

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.753
who I'm very fond of, Alexander Smith,

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.012
wrote, "It is our knowledge
that we have to die

00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:53.347
"that makes us human."

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:57.760
Couple of decades later,
William James in the 1890s,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.461
he called death

00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.807
"The worm at the core of
the human experience."

00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:06.201
Then if we fast forward
a couple of decades,

00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:09.824
almost a century after that, in the 1970s,

00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:12.866
the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker,

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:17.047
he won a Pulitzer Prize for
his book The Denial of Death,

00:02:17.047 --> 00:02:20.605
in which he basically
elaborated on that basic idea,

00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:24.772
it is our knowledge that we
have to die that makes us human.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.474
He did so by trying to frame these ideas

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:33.427
in both an evolutionary
as well as an existential,

00:02:33.427 --> 00:02:35.260
psychodynamic fashion.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.607
What Becker does, even though
this may sound a tad dated,

00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:41.384
given some of the ideas that we've already

00:02:41.384 --> 00:02:43.381
been exposed to today,

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.532
is to just start with, I think,

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.319
the relatively simple Darwinian assumption

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.499
that people are very similar
to all other forms of life

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:56.378
in that we're biologically
predisposed to survive,

00:02:56.378 --> 00:02:58.788
both in the interest of self-preservation

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:03.283
as well as reproducing and
extending our genes over time.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.528
On the other hand, Darwin
noticed very early on

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:08.648
that there's lots of ways,

00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:10.711
over billions of years of evolution,

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.190
that different forms of
life have accomplished

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.681
that most arduous task
of persisting over time.

00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:18.906
So everything from the turtle shells

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:21.011
to the eagle's eyesight.

00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:23.832
It raises the question of well, what is it

00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:27.754
that is responsible for
our fantastic success?

00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:30.234
The answer is, there's lots of things,

00:03:30.234 --> 00:03:33.021
both physical and psychological,

00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:36.357
including our relatively large forebrain

00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:37.771
that gives us the capacity

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:40.742
to think abstractly and symbolically,

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:44.188
to the point, Becker notes,
that only human beings,

00:03:44.188 --> 00:03:46.615
as far as we can tell,
can imagine something

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:48.266
that doesn't yet exist

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:50.826
and then have the audacity
to take our dreams

00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:53.376
and render them into reality.

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:55.460
Some of you probably, I
see a few head shakes.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.602
I know it's late in the day.

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:59.915
Who's seen Da Vinci's
drawings of helicopters

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:00.998
in the 1500s?

00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:05.618
When he did that, people
said, "Wow, that's crazy."

00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:08.014
And yet today, we are
routinely transported

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.806
by what was originally denounced

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:12.119
as the doodlings of madmen.

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:16.023
So abstract symbolic thought has certainly

00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:17.571
served us very well.

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:20.424
I like how Otto Rank, one
of Freud's disciples, put it

00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:24.591
when he said that only human
beings make the unreal real.

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:27.084
What Becker then does, though,

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:29.594
is to move back in time
a couple of decades

00:04:29.594 --> 00:04:33.186
and to think about this
idea in light of the Danish

00:04:33.186 --> 00:04:36.769
existential philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.133
It was Kierkegaard who pointed out

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.822
that human beings are so smart

00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:44.989
that we come to realize that we exist.

00:04:46.132 --> 00:04:49.549
Self-awareness, a complex theory of mind,

00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:52.470
the way that Kierkegaard put it,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.021
it takes a ridiculously
sophisticated cognitive apparatus

00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:58.353
to render yourself the object

00:04:58.353 --> 00:05:01.649
of your own subjective inquiry.

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.914
What Kierkegaard did in a little book

00:05:03.914 --> 00:05:06.679
called Fear and Trembling
that I always recommend

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:09.756
you buy for your in-laws'
coffee table as a holiday gift,

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:10.589
(audience laughs)

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:13.645
what Kierkegaard said was that there are

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:17.812
emotional ramifications of
being explicitly self-aware.

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:23.220
He described them as being
both awesome and dreadful.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.170
Kierkegaard said, "You know what?

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.337
"It's really great to be
self-aware and to be alive."

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.512
Who's ever had one of those magic moments,

00:05:33.512 --> 00:05:36.080
you wake up on a beautiful day like today,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.606
you didn't win a Nobel Prize,

00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:39.621
you didn't win a great fortune,

00:05:39.621 --> 00:05:41.934
and yet you're just sublimely appreciative

00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:43.770
of the fact that you're alive?

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.692
Everybody does look pretty happy today.

00:05:45.692 --> 00:05:46.997
I grew up
(audience laughs)

00:05:46.997 --> 00:05:48.931
in New Jersey, so it's a little dicier.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.197
But I think for the most part,

00:05:51.197 --> 00:05:53.701
we all understand just the sublime

00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:57.397
and spontaneous exuberance
that comes from being alive

00:05:57.397 --> 00:05:58.896
and knowing that we're here.

00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:01.035
On the other hand,
Kierkegaard turns right around

00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:03.918
and he says, "Yeah, but it's also dreadful

00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:06.251
"to be alive and to know it,

00:06:07.372 --> 00:06:09.959
"because lest ye be either a small child

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.818
"or neurologically impaired,

00:06:11.818 --> 00:06:13.827
"if you're smart enough
to know that you're here,

00:06:13.827 --> 00:06:15.857
"you're also smart enough to know that,

00:06:15.857 --> 00:06:19.626
"like all living things, your
life is of finite duration.

00:06:19.626 --> 00:06:21.813
"Moreover, you're smart enough to realize

00:06:21.813 --> 00:06:24.040
"that your life could end at any time

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.247
"for reasons that you could
never anticipate or control,

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:30.569
"and that from a purely
biological perspective,

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.756
"you are a breathing
piece of defecating meat

00:06:32.756 --> 00:06:35.770
"that is no more fundamentally
significant or enduring

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.874
"than a lizard or a potato."

00:06:37.874 --> 00:06:39.040
(audience laughs)

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.789
What Becker argued is that
the explicit awareness

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.562
of the reality of the human condition,

00:06:45.562 --> 00:06:49.535
we will all someday die,
we can die at any time,

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:53.055
we're breathing pieces of
meat, cold cuts with attitudes,

00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:54.268
we're Spam,
(audience laughs)

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:56.008
we're the plan but we got no can,

00:06:56.008 --> 00:06:58.425
would literally debilitate us

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:02.702
with paralyzing existential terror.

00:07:03.564 --> 00:07:06.488
What Becker proposed is that human beings

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:09.676
manage the terror that is engendered

00:07:09.676 --> 00:07:12.032
by the awareness of their mortality

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:16.443
by embedding ourselves in
what the anthropologists call

00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:18.773
culture, humanly constructed beliefs

00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:20.330
about the nature of reality

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.838
that we share with our
fellow human beings,

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:25.384
that give us a sense that life had meaning

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:27.948
and that we have value.

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.416
What Becker points out
as an anthropologist is

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:34.607
that all cultures have a story or accounts

00:07:34.607 --> 00:07:36.517
of the origin of the universe.

00:07:36.517 --> 00:07:38.525
All cultures have prescriptions

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:40.911
for how we ought behave while we're here.

00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:43.343
All cultures offer hope of immortality,

00:07:43.343 --> 00:07:45.568
either literally through the having souls

00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:48.281
and afterlives of the
world's great religions,

00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:50.471
or symbolically through the belief that,

00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:53.750
while you may not be here and
I may not be here forever,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.132
we're comforted by the prospect

00:07:55.132 --> 00:07:57.964
that some manifestation of our existence

00:07:57.964 --> 00:08:01.063
will persist over time,
perhaps from having children,

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.308
perhaps from amassing great fortunes,

00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:07.475
perhaps from producing great
works of art and science.

00:08:08.776 --> 00:08:11.124
Moreover, what culture does for us

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:12.948
is to give us each social roles

00:08:12.948 --> 00:08:15.401
with associated standards of conduct

00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:17.604
that, if we meet or exceed them,

00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:20.681
allow us to think that
we're persons of value

00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:22.228
in a world of meaning.

00:08:22.228 --> 00:08:24.743
And when we do think
that way about ourselves,

00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:27.213
Becker called that self-esteem.

00:08:27.213 --> 00:08:31.102
His argument is that because
our beliefs about the world

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:34.297
and because self-esteem are so important

00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:36.576
that whether we're aware of it or not,

00:08:36.576 --> 00:08:39.275
most of our behavior from day to day

00:08:39.275 --> 00:08:43.442
is motivated in the service
of maintaining those beliefs.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.163
Two questions.

00:08:45.163 --> 00:08:47.404
One question is, so what?

00:08:47.404 --> 00:08:50.957
The other question is,
is any of this true?

00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:54.825
The so what question in our
world is generally framed

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:57.264
in terms of conceptual power.

00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:59.121
What is it that you could understand

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:03.493
if you momentarily accept the
veracity of Becker's claims

00:09:03.493 --> 00:09:06.999
that might be less easy
to understand otherwise?

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:09.079
And then the second question is,

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:13.246
well is there any evidence
in support of these views?

00:09:13.246 --> 00:09:15.231
What we did, and when I say "we," I mean

00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:18.351
my buddies Jeff Greenberg, now
at the University of Arizona

00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:21.419
and Tom Pyszczynski, now at
the University of Colorado

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:23.200
at Colorado Springs,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.704
we developed a very simple
laboratory paradigm.

00:09:26.704 --> 00:09:30.095
It's called the Mortality
Salience Paradigm.

00:09:30.095 --> 00:09:32.568
The logic, I think, is disarmingly simple.

00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:34.262
We just said, "All right.

00:09:34.262 --> 00:09:37.773
"If these ideas are correct,
if our beliefs about reality

00:09:37.773 --> 00:09:40.801
"serve to mitigate death anxiety,

00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.519
"well, let's bring people into the lab

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:47.739
"and let's remind them
that they're going to die,

00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:49.749
(audience laughs)
"in controlled conditions.

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:51.732
"Let's remind them," it's
not as gory as it sounds,

00:09:51.732 --> 00:09:54.055
"let's remind them in
controlled conditions

00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:56.798
"of something unpleasant but not fatal."

00:09:56.798 --> 00:09:59.638
For students, think about your next exam.

00:09:59.638 --> 00:10:02.620
For regular people, think
about going to the dentist

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.497
and needing a root canal
without anesthesia.

00:10:05.497 --> 00:10:07.574
Think about being in a car crash

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:09.906
and having a limb amputated.

00:10:09.906 --> 00:10:13.805
All unpleasant but not particularly fatal.

00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:17.002
In our typical paradigm,
we bury in a bunch

00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:20.326
of personality scales
two open-ended questions.

00:10:20.326 --> 00:10:22.129
"Please briefly describe the emotions

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:24.877
"that the thought of your
own death arouse in you,"

00:10:24.877 --> 00:10:27.552
and "jot down, as specifically as you can,

00:10:27.552 --> 00:10:31.021
"what you think will happen
to you as you physically die."

00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:32.637
We do this in a lot of ways, though.

00:10:32.637 --> 00:10:34.980
Sometimes we'd go outside the lab

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.802
and we stop people either
in front of a funeral parlor

00:10:38.802 --> 00:10:41.651
or 100 meters to either side,

00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:44.570
thinking that, when you're
in front of a funeral parlor,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.120
death may be on your mind
even if you don't know it.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.484
Then the most subtle paradigm,

00:10:50.484 --> 00:10:52.915
we call it subliminal death primes,

00:10:52.915 --> 00:10:54.933
if you come to my office at Skidmore,

00:10:54.933 --> 00:10:56.642
you can read your email.

00:10:56.642 --> 00:10:59.770
And while you're doing that,
we'll flash the word "death"

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.639
for 28 milliseconds,

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:06.227
so fast that you don't know
that you have been exposed

00:11:06.227 --> 00:11:09.295
to that rather unwelcome stimulus.

00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:10.451
That's what we do.

00:11:10.451 --> 00:11:13.461
All of these methods
produce the same outcomes.

00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:17.503
Let's briefly talk about
some of the areas of inquiry.

00:11:17.503 --> 00:11:22.012
A lot of them Ad-jeep mentioned
earlier in his fine talk.

00:11:22.012 --> 00:11:26.367
So what do we know based on
almost 40 years of research?

00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:28.969
Our original interest
was trying to understand

00:11:28.969 --> 00:11:31.324
why people can't get
along with other people

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:35.148
who don't share their beliefs
about the nature of reality.

00:11:35.148 --> 00:11:38.870
What Ernest Becker said in a
book called Escape from Evil

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.523
is that other people pose
an existential challenge

00:11:43.523 --> 00:11:46.452
to our belief systems,
because if you accept

00:11:46.452 --> 00:11:49.445
an alternative conception of a reality,

00:11:49.445 --> 00:11:51.809
you do so by undermining the confidence

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:54.755
with which you subscribe to your own.

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:58.529
And when you do that,
you undermine the beliefs

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:02.135
that serve to minimize your anxiety.

00:12:02.135 --> 00:12:04.617
What he proposed is that,
when we run into people

00:12:04.617 --> 00:12:06.723
who are different, the first thing we do

00:12:06.723 --> 00:12:08.815
is to denigrate or belittle them.

00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:12.306
While we do that, we
simultaneously try to get them

00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:16.333
to get rid of their ideas
and adopt ours instead.

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:18.288
If that doesn't work,
just kill those people,

00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:21.980
thus proving that my God
is better than your God

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.570
and we will kick your ass to prove it.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.559
Now, in support of that view,

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:29.675
what we know in several 100 studies

00:12:29.675 --> 00:12:32.379
conducted all over the world by our people

00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:34.162
and independent researchers,

00:12:34.162 --> 00:12:38.146
is, for example, Christians
reminded of their mortality,

00:12:38.146 --> 00:12:40.422
they like fellow Christians a lot more

00:12:40.422 --> 00:12:42.744
and they hate Jewish people.

00:12:42.744 --> 00:12:44.850
If you go to Israel and
remind Jewish people

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.411
of their mortality,
they love Jewish people

00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:49.760
and they hate Arabs and Christians.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.728
Germans reminded of their mortality

00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:55.896
sit closer to fellow Germans
and they sit further away

00:12:55.896 --> 00:12:58.575
from people who look
like Turkish immigrants.

00:12:58.575 --> 00:13:00.993
Iranians reminded of their mortality

00:13:00.993 --> 00:13:04.111
become more supportive of suicide bombers

00:13:04.111 --> 00:13:08.325
and more willing to become
a suicide bomber themselves.

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:10.399
In America, as you know,
we're very practical.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.050
We're not about to blow ourselves up,

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.144
but we're happy to blow up other people.

00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:16.606
When we remind Americans
of their mortality,

00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:19.327
they become more supportive
of the preemptive use

00:13:19.327 --> 00:13:22.352
of biological, nuclear
and chemical weapons

00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:26.158
against countries who pose
no direct threat to us.

00:13:26.158 --> 00:13:28.036
Another area of inquiry for us,

00:13:28.036 --> 00:13:30.647
(audience laughs)
that's not funny,

00:13:30.647 --> 00:13:31.867
(audience laughs)

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:36.131
has been understanding
how existential anxieties

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:39.050
have a radical effect on
political preferences.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.509
Max Weber, the German sociologist

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:43.865
at the beginning of the 20th century,

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.936
coined the term "charismatic leader."

00:13:46.936 --> 00:13:49.937
He said that in times
of historical upheaval,

00:13:49.937 --> 00:13:53.372
when existential anxieties
are apt to be aroused,

00:13:53.372 --> 00:13:57.070
that we often embrace a
certain kind of seemingly

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.539
larger than life leader,
who he called charismatic,

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:03.883
and he said that very
often these are people

00:14:03.883 --> 00:14:07.251
who believe to be either divinely ordained

00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:11.378
or self-appointed, in order
to rid the world of evil.

00:14:11.378 --> 00:14:13.549
We got interested in this

00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:17.312
in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.

00:14:17.312 --> 00:14:20.347
Old timers may remember
than in a three-week period,

00:14:20.347 --> 00:14:23.738
President George W. Bush
went from the least liked

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:27.085
to the most like President
in American history.

00:14:27.085 --> 00:14:31.393
We did a lot of studies leading
up to the 2004 election,

00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:34.157
where we showed that Americans preferred

00:14:34.157 --> 00:14:37.052
Senator John Kerry to President Bush

00:14:37.052 --> 00:14:39.377
in a benign state of mind.

00:14:39.377 --> 00:14:42.739
However, when they were reminded
of their mortality first,

00:14:42.739 --> 00:14:44.988
they liked President Bush a whole lot more

00:14:44.988 --> 00:14:47.025
than Senator Kerry.

00:14:47.025 --> 00:14:48.531
Ditto in this election.

00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:51.231
This summer, we found in several studies

00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:54.336
that our respondents
preferred Secretary Clinton

00:14:54.336 --> 00:14:56.476
to now-President Trump

00:14:56.476 --> 00:15:00.555
when they were in a psychologically
benign state of mind.

00:15:00.555 --> 00:15:03.941
However, when they were reminded
of their mortality first,

00:15:03.941 --> 00:15:07.752
their affection and support
for President Trump increased

00:15:07.752 --> 00:15:11.933
and they now liked him more
than they did Secretary Clinton.

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:14.712
Let's keep going and let's
see how death anxiety

00:15:14.712 --> 00:15:17.568
fosters an alienation from nature

00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:20.662
and contempt for the environment.

00:15:20.662 --> 00:15:23.293
John Locke in the 1890s,

00:15:23.293 --> 00:15:25.341
in the second treatise on
government, pointed out

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:30.301
that anything that's natural
is of finite duration.

00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:32.247
Of course, that's what we chafe at

00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:34.282
and that may have been
the psychological impetus

00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:37.882
for the construction of the supernatural.

00:15:37.882 --> 00:15:39.649
To the extent that that's true,

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:43.101
when death is on our mind, we
should chafe at the prospect

00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:47.594
that we're animals and we should
be uncomfortable in nature.

00:15:47.594 --> 00:15:49.547
And that's exactly what we find.

00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:52.319
People who are reminded of their mortality

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:56.363
take issue with claims
that humans are animals.

00:15:56.363 --> 00:15:58.817
They have more negative
attitudes towards animals

00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:00.738
and think it's okay to kill them

00:16:00.738 --> 00:16:05.013
for reasons other than
food and medical research.

00:16:05.013 --> 00:16:07.003
People reminded of their mortality

00:16:07.003 --> 00:16:11.170
become more uncomfortable
when they're out in nature,

00:16:12.312 --> 00:16:14.652
and people reminded of their mortality

00:16:14.652 --> 00:16:17.801
become more willing to greedily exploit

00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:20.707
non-renewable natural resources.

00:16:20.707 --> 00:16:23.357
Of course, we can't talk
about the plundering

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:27.620
of the environment without
a concurrent consideration

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.787
of our seemingly insatiable
desire for money and stuff.

00:16:32.844 --> 00:16:35.956
I like how Big Daddy in Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof put it

00:16:35.956 --> 00:16:38.925
when he said, "The human
animal is a beast that dies

00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:41.163
"and if he's go money, he
buys and buys and buys,

00:16:41.163 --> 00:16:43.997
"and I think the reason he
buys everything that he can buy

00:16:43.997 --> 00:16:46.944
"is that in the back of his
mind he has the crazy hope

00:16:46.944 --> 00:16:50.815
"that one of his purchases
will be life everlasting."

00:16:50.815 --> 00:16:53.176
Research shows that Big
Daddy's right on the money.

00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:57.022
People reminded of their mortality say

00:16:57.022 --> 00:16:59.970
that they have higher fiscal aspirations.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.263
They say it would take more money

00:17:02.263 --> 00:17:05.416
before they would perceive
themselves as wealthy.

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:08.960
People reminded of their
mortality want more stuff,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.380
not just any stuff, they want
high-status luxury items,

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.463
like a Lexus and a Rolex.

00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:17.929
When people are reminded
of their mortality,

00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:20.345
and you ask 'em to draw pictures of money,

00:17:20.345 --> 00:17:23.595
they draw bigger pictures,
as if money looms larger

00:17:23.595 --> 00:17:25.903
when death is on their mind.

00:17:25.903 --> 00:17:28.536
Just giving people money to count,

00:17:28.536 --> 00:17:31.336
not to keep, just counting money,

00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:33.169
reduces death anxiety.

00:17:34.335 --> 00:17:36.183
If you like cookies
(audience laughs)

00:17:36.183 --> 00:17:39.187
and you're reminded of
death, you eat more cookies.

00:17:39.187 --> 00:17:41.817
If you smoke cigarettes and
you're reminded of death,

00:17:41.817 --> 00:17:43.326
you smoke more cigarettes.

00:17:43.326 --> 00:17:46.588
If you drink alcohol and
you're reminded of death,

00:17:46.588 --> 00:17:48.505
you drink more alcohol.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.837
Well, so what?

00:17:52.272 --> 00:17:54.527
Thomas Hardy, one of my
favorite novelists, said,

00:17:54.527 --> 00:17:56.475
"If a way to the better there be,

00:17:56.475 --> 00:18:00.973
"it comes from taking a
close look at the worst."

00:18:00.973 --> 00:18:02.776
Just to follow up on some of the things

00:18:02.776 --> 00:18:07.119
that Ar-jeep talked about
at the end of his talk,

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:10.917
I would argue that
malignant manifestations

00:18:10.917 --> 00:18:15.084
of death anxiety surely do
not bring out the best in us.

00:18:16.353 --> 00:18:20.542
They seem to turn us into
hateful, war-mongering

00:18:20.542 --> 00:18:22.917
proto-fascists plundering the planet

00:18:22.917 --> 00:18:26.609
in our insatiable quest
for dollars and draws in a

00:18:26.609 --> 00:18:30.381
television-alcohol-drug-Facebook-Twitter-induced
stupor.

00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:32.968
(audience laughs)

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:35.968
Danny Brower might be right in 2007,

00:18:36.997 --> 00:18:40.914
when he said that "Wow,
an ironic effect of RZO

00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:47.376
"to deny death may be that
we are the first form of life

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.175
"to have the ignominious distinction

00:18:49.175 --> 00:18:52.303
"of being responsible for our extinction."

00:18:52.303 --> 00:18:53.292
All right, having said that, though,

00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:55.023
let me close on a more positive note

00:18:55.023 --> 00:18:56.611
and just point out,
(audience laughs)

00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:57.815
usually I stop now and I go,

00:18:57.815 --> 00:19:00.737
"All right, thank you
very much, let's drink."

00:19:00.737 --> 00:19:01.806
On a more positive note, though,

00:19:01.806 --> 00:19:04.732
human beings, we have a good
track record historically

00:19:04.732 --> 00:19:06.757
of extricating ourselves

00:19:06.757 --> 00:19:09.074
from some very difficult circumstances

00:19:09.074 --> 00:19:12.324
once we understand what underlies them.

00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:16.498
In the Middle Ages, when
people were dropping like flies

00:19:16.498 --> 00:19:19.139
from the plague, when we
thought that it was caused

00:19:19.139 --> 00:19:22.007
by evil spirits, we really
didn't get anywhere.

00:19:22.007 --> 00:19:25.348
On the other hand, when we
realized that it was bacteria,

00:19:25.348 --> 00:19:28.441
then we were able to develop penicillin,

00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:31.513
and that led to modern medicine.

00:19:31.513 --> 00:19:33.818
Similarly, what I would like to think,

00:19:33.818 --> 00:19:36.067
even if this appears naively optimistic,

00:19:36.067 --> 00:19:40.455
is that if we could
collectively come to recognize

00:19:40.455 --> 00:19:42.544
the incredible problems

00:19:42.544 --> 00:19:46.513
that excessive death denial has produced,

00:19:46.513 --> 00:19:50.144
then maybe we can also collectively deploy

00:19:50.144 --> 00:19:53.875
our remarkable creativity and ingenuity

00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:58.128
in order to nudge our
species into a more benign

00:19:58.128 --> 00:20:00.615
or maybe even more benevolent direction.

00:20:00.615 --> 00:20:01.943
I like how Camus put it.

00:20:01.943 --> 00:20:03.674
"Come to terms with death.

00:20:03.674 --> 00:20:06.171
"Thereafter anything is possible."

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.993
Maybe an overstatement,
but no harm in using this

00:20:08.993 --> 00:20:10.941
as a standard to approximate.

00:20:10.941 --> 00:20:12.007
Thank you very much.

00:20:12.007 --> 00:20:15.520
(audience applauds)

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.103
(upbeat music)
