00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.210
 Stop the video for a bit and try to calculate 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.940
 how much is 27 plus 1, 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.980
 and then 27 plus 10. 

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:12.788
 Now let's think together. 

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:14.948
 This may have made it quite easy. 

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.782
 Perhaps you said, "If you add one, 

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.661
 the result will be the next highest number after 27. 

00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:22.048
 If I add 1, it will become 28. " 

00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:24.323
 We do this exercise, 

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:27.418
 to understand the meaning of the place or the position of the figure. 

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:29.468
 For example, for the number 27 

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:34.506
 we have 2 as tens, this is the place of the tenths, 

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:39.530
 and here we have 7 in place of the units. 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.297
 You can imagine the number 27 as two decades, 

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:45.363
 behold, I have 2 groups of tenes here, 

00:00:45.363 --> 00:00:48.521
 and then 7 units. Here, I have 7 units here. 

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.077
 And if I add 1, 

00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:52.236
 this is another separate unit. 

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:54.001
 What will be left to me at last? 

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.880
 Behold, I have 2 tens, 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.713
 2 tenths. 

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:02.104
 But the question is how many units do I have now? 

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:06.994
 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 units. 

00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:09.149
 So the number will be 28. 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.819
 This may not be a surprise to you, 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.002
 but it's really useful to think 

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.440
 in terms of the value of the place or position of the figure, 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.050
 because it will help you further in the study of mathematics. 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.443
 Now let's do the same with 27 plus 10. 

00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:25.947
 We have already said that 27 is 2 tens and 7 units, 

00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:29.407
 but adding 10, this 1 is not in place of the units 

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:30.800
 and does not represent 1. 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.742
 1 is now in place of the dozen. 

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:38.765
 That is, we have 1 tenth and 0 units. 

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.787
 So we have ... 

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.680
 The number 10 is just one tenth! 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.676
 And what happens when you sum up the two numbers? 

00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:49.320
 Now you have 1,2,3 tens, 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.921
 you got 3 in the place of the dozen, 

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:55.339
 and you still have 

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:59.095
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 units. 

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:01.472
 7 units. 

00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:02.261
 Now watch out. 

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.003
 Here, when you add 1, 

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.882
 increase units by one, instead of units. 

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:10.690
 And here, adding 10, which is actually a dozen, 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.571
 nothing increases in place of the units, 

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.212
 the increase is in the place of the tenths.
