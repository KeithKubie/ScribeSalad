Hey what's up guys? Today we are back with another dry ice experiment.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.840
Today we're testing out to see what happens with dry ice down a waterslide. [let's] go find out

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.640
Yeah

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.299
Dude, that was amazing it felt like floating on a cloud except these little chunks of dry ice [could] like [skim] [it] up my back

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.599
I think you got some down your shorts guys check this out. This is what happens when dry ice makes contact with your skin

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.209
It's almost like a burn like a freezer burn, but that's going to swell [up] and probably stand there for four or [five] days

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.029
But super awesome the water is amazingly warm today. We're having a great time and we're definitely doing that again right now

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.069
Look at that that. That is where I just got hit by a chunk of dry ice it's like in the hit by rocks

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.199
so needless to say this is [not] an experiment that should we try to home leave this to the trained experts and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.770
Professionals this right here is for demonstrational and educational purposes only anyway. We'll see you [guys] in the next video

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.979
 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.849
Never use these gopros before Ellen draw 800 bucks
