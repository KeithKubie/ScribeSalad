00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.161
So it seems like variables are being accessed correctly now in

00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:05.700
accordance with the rules of lexical scoping.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.450
But our program needs to actually call the new saga function in order for

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.560
it to do anything useful.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.790
So let's call that function twice so

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.540
that we can see two different sagas playing out.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.140
We also need to make sure that the inner function gets called.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.850
So let's do that twice as well.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.220
Meaning each saga will consist of two sentences.
