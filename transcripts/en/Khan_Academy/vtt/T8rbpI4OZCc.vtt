00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Voiceover] We're told that F of seven

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.165
is equal to 40 plus five,
E to the seventh power,

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.234
and F prime of X is equal to five,

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:09.263
E to the X.

00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:11.420
What is F of zero?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.810
So to evaluate F of zero,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.980
let's take the anti-derivative
of F prime of X,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.109
and then we're going to have a constant

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.293
of integration there,

00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:21.892
so we can use the information
that they gave us up here

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:23.974
that F of seven is equal to this.

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:25.661
This might look like an expression.

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:26.869
Well, it is an expression,

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.060
but it's really just a number.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.717
There's no variables in this,

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:31.171
and so we can use that to solve

00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:32.696
for our constant of integration,

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:34.085
and then we will have fully known

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:35.120
what F of X is,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.838
and we can use that to evaluate F of zero,

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:38.229
so let's just do it.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.856
So if F prime of X is
equal to five, E to the X,

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:43.893
then F of X is going to be equal

00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:46.520
to the anti-derivative of F prime of X,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.437
or the anti-derivative
of five, E to the X, DX,

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:53.517
and this is the thing
that I always find amazing

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:54.396
about exponentials,

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:55.540
and actually, let me just take a step.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.437
I'll take that five out of the integral

00:00:57.437 --> 00:00:59.844
so it becomes a little bit more obvious.

00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:01.489
And so the anti-derivative of E to the X,

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.056
well, that's just E to the X

00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:04.396
because the derivative of E to the X

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:05.229
is E to the X,

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.340
which I find amazing every time

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.318
I have to manipulate
or take the derivative

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.159
or anti-derivative of E to the X.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.909
So this is gonna be
five, E to the X, plus C,

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:16.139
and you can verify.

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:19.223
Take the derivative of
five, E to the X, plus C.

00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:21.031
The derivative of five, E to the X,

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.992
well, that's five, E to the X,

00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:24.299
so that works out.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.227
Well, and the derivative of C is zero,

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:27.950
so you wouldn't see it over here.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.783
So now, let's use this information

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:34.298
to figure out what C is

00:01:34.298 --> 00:01:36.361
so that we know exactly what F of X is,

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:38.319
and then we can evaluate F of zero.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.081
So we know that F of seven,

00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.057
so when X is equal to seven,

00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:46.197
this expression is going
to evaluate to this thing,

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:47.670
40 plus five, E to the seven.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.753
So, five times E to the seventh power

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:57.072
plus C is equal to 40, plus five,

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:04.059
E to the seventh power.

00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:06.232
And notice, all I did is say, okay,

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:07.175
F of seven.

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:09.484
Well, if this is F of X--

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:10.766
Let me write this down.

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.933
So, if this is F of seven,

00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:16.450
if this is F of X,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.346
I just replaced the X with a seven

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.786
to find F of seven,

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:21.356
and we know that F of seven is also going

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:22.418
to be equal to that.

00:02:22.418 --> 00:02:24.037
They gave us that information,

00:02:24.037 --> 00:02:26.617
but when you just look at this,

00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:28.866
it's pretty easy to figure
out what C is going to be.

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.418
You can subtract five, E to the seven

00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:32.130
from both sides,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.963
and you see that C is equal to 40.

00:02:35.963 --> 00:02:38.774
And so we can rewrite F of X.

00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:41.592
We can say that F of X is equal

00:02:41.592 --> 00:02:43.259
to five, E to the X,

00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:45.983
plus C, which is 40.

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:48.271
And so now, from that,

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:50.281
we can evaluate F of zero.

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:53.095
F of zero is going to be five times

00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:55.512
E to the zero power, plus 40.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:58.393
E to the zero is one,

00:02:58.393 --> 00:02:59.953
so it's gonna be five times one,

00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:02.042
which is just five, plus 40,

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:03.792
which is equal to 45,

00:03:04.977 --> 00:03:06.310
and we're done.
