Therapy stories:

Panic Attacks

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.560
Therapy is one of the most useful inventions of the last 100 years.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.040
Through conversations with a therapist, people have a chance to understand themselves better and to lead happier less anxious lives.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.440
Here is a true story from therapy.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.660
Out of the blue, in his 28th year, Zack began to develop panic attacks

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.760
at the most inconvenient moments: at an office presentation, or a business networking event

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.140
he'd feel extraordinarily anxious, get an urge to run away, and often need to find a bathroom very fast.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.620
It started to become hugely debilitating for Zack, who worked in a rather unforgiving, fast moving, tech company in San Fransisco.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.080
A friend recommended a therapist.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.320
It was pretty weird to find himself on a therapist's couch.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.420
He'd never had much time for the idea of therapy.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.340
The first thing the therapist told him was that here, in this room, he could panic just about as much as he liked

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.940
and it wasn't going to be a problem.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.280
He could run away, faint, be sick, as all fine by her.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.180
That helped immensely.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.440
They began talking about what some of these panic attacks might have in common.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.680
It was actually deeply refreshing to talk to someone who didn't keep interrupting or shifting the agenda,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.440
someone who just kept the focus on what he was feeling and try to decode it for him.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.540
Something struck Zack as he spoke:

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.260
the panic he felt had a habit of arising whenever there were expectations on him.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.100
Whenever people were waiting for him to be impressive, clever, or decisive in some way

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.640
and there was a chance to make himself look like a fool or a jerk.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.780
It was as though one part of him was deliberately undermining and sabotaging the other

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.940
whenever there was a opportunity to shine or triumph.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.620
"If it carries on like this, I'll have no option but to head back home a live with my parents."

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.520
remarked Zack, darkly one day towards the end of a session.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.560
That turned out to be the start of a very fruitful line of discussion.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.960
Zack had grown up in rural Minnesota.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.440
His father was a roofer.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.580
Neither of his parents had been to college.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.040
He'd been the bright one who'd flown the nest.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.980
The gap between Zack and his parents was now huge:

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.640
he might earn in 1 year what his father earned in 5.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.500
The more Zack told the therapist about his background,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.480
the more he realized what a burden of guilt he was carrying around with him.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.540
The guilt: that success was leading him to succeed his parents

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.660
in a way that was at once exciting and properly frightening.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.500
Zack wanted success but being successful was also threatening to separate him

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.240
from the 2 people who he felt the greatest debt to.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.440
The panic attacks seemed like a devilish way to stay faithful to his parents.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.740
It was like an act of self sabotage, calculated to protect the parents,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.560
and especially, the father, who had some competitive and envious sides to his otherwise warm nature;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.260
all this from the risks of humiliation.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.280
It was as though in one part of his mind,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.680
Zack didn't believe he could be both an impressive adult and a loyal son.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.820
Discovering this about himself helped Zack a lot.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.160
Gradually the symptoms lessened.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.580
He learnt how to understand himself for wanting not to have the life his parents had had,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.380
and to forgive himself for looking for something better.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.260
At the same time, he accepted that he could remain loving and admiring of many qualities his parents had,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.360
and that those around him in the tech scene often didn't.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.620
Zack continued in therapy for a year.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.280
The attacks stopped completely without any need for medication.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.760
It was as if part of his mind had been listened to and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.020
no longer felt the need to ruin Zack's life in order to be heard.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.200
Recently, Zack was invited to address a conference of 2,000 delegate.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.000
The speech went perfectly.
