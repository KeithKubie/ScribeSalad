00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.175
Voiceover:Tomas's favorite colors,

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:05.994
Tomas's favorite colors
are blue and green.

00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:08.189
He has one blue shirt, one green shirt,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.951
one blue hat, one green scarf,

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.800
one blue pair of pants,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.290
and one green pair of pants.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.753
Tomas selects one of
these garments at random.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:23.209
Let A be the event that
he selects a blue garment.

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:28.630
Let B be the event that
he chooses a shirt.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.338
Which of the following
statements are true?

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:31.373
And they all, let's see,

00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:32.173
and before I even read them,

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:35.371
they all deal with the
probability of event A

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.682
probability of event B,

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:37.908
probability of B given A,

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:39.261
probability of A given B,

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:41.182
probability of A and B.

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:44.319
So actually let's just calculate
these things ahead of time

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:46.959
before we even look at
these right over here.

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:49.562
So let's just think about,
let's just think about

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:52.264
probability of A.

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:54.462
The probability of A.

00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:57.610
That's the probability
that he picks a blue,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.740
he selects a blue garment.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.254
So how many equally
likely outcomes are there?

00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:06.133
Well, there's one, two,
three, four, five, six

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.471
equally likely outcomes.

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:10.748
And how many involve
selecting a blue garment?

00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:14.180
Well, there's one, two, three

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.302
of the equally likely outcomes

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:17.341
involve selecting a blue garment.

00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:20.471
So he has a 3/6 or 1/2 probability

00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:22.426
of selecting a blue garment.

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:24.376
So what's the probability of B?

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:27.117
What's the probability of B?

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:28.751
And I'll use neutral colors

00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:30.595
since we're just saying he's B

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.304
the event that he chooses a shirt.

00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:36.313
So once again, there's six possible items

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:38.395
equally likely outcomes here,

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:39.684
and which involve a shirt.

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:44.822
Well, there's one, there's two,

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:46.338
so it looks like two of the six

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.929
involve picking a shirt.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.340
Or we could say the probability
of B is equal to 1/3.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.739
Now what's the probability of A given B?

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:58.242
Let's write that down.

00:01:58.242 --> 00:02:00.458
What's the probability of

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:01.641
let's use a new color,

00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:08.453
What's the probability of A given B?

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:10.400
I'll do those in the colors.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.969
A given that B has happened.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.108
So this is saying

00:02:14.108 --> 00:02:19.569
what's the probability of A given B?

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.800
The probability of A given B

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.307
is the probability that
he picks a blue garment

00:02:23.307 --> 00:02:26.891
given that he has picked a shirt.

00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:31.940
So, this the given B that
restricts our outcomes

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.953
to these two.

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:35.980
So the probability that
he picks a blue item

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.225
well, that's one out of the
two equally likely ones.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.266
So that is a 1/2 probability

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:46.680
that he picks a blue garment

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.801
given that he's picked a shirt,

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.980
and that's because there is one blue shirt

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.613
and one green shirt.

00:02:50.613 --> 00:02:53.210
Let's look at the
probability of B given A.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.145
Probability of B given A.

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:03.338
B given, probability of B given A.

00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:06.952
So assuming we have picked a blue garment.

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:09.800
So assuming we've picked a blue garment.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.485
So it's either that one or that one.

00:03:13.624 --> 00:03:15.117
What's the probability that we have also,

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:19.581
What's the probability that
we have also chosen a shirt?

00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:23.232
Well, there's one, two,
three possibilities,

00:03:23.232 --> 00:03:24.628
equally likely possibilities

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:26.165
that we have a blue garment.

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:29.570
And only one of those involve a shirt.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.700
So the probability of B given A is 1/3.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.664
And then finally we can think about

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:36.473
probability of A and B.

00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:40.395
So the probability, probability,

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:47.842
of A and B, A and B.

00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:52.620
So this is the probability
of picking a blue shirt.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.752
So only one out of the six
equally likely outcomes

00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:57.376
is a blue shirt.

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:58.754
So this one right over here

00:03:58.754 --> 00:04:02.302
is going to be one, one over six.

00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:03.907
So now that we've figured out all of that

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:05.980
let's see if we can
answer these questions.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.524
The probability of A given B

00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:10.617
equals the probability of A.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.900
And that does work out.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.390
Probability of A given B is 1/2.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.840
And that's the same thing
as the probability of A.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.554
The probability that
Tomas likes a blue garment

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:21.353
given that he has chosen a shirt

00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:23.180
is equal to the probability

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.845
that Tomas likes a blue garment.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:25.717
Yep, that's exactly.

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:27.652
So I guess the words are just rephrasing

00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:30.222
what they wrote here in
a more mathy notation.

00:04:30.222 --> 00:04:32.593
So this is absolutely true.

00:04:32.593 --> 00:04:34.803
The probability of B given A

00:04:34.803 --> 00:04:36.393
is equal to the probability of B.

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:38.904
Yep, the probability of B given A is 1/3.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.540
The probability of B is 1/3.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.696
The probability that Tomas selects a shirt

00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:45.837
given that he has chosen a blue garment

00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:49.130
is equal to the probability
that Tomas selects a shirt.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.290
Yep, that's right.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.734
Events A and B are independent events.

00:04:56.734 --> 00:04:58.234
Independent events.

00:04:58.234 --> 00:05:01.608
So two events are independent

00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:05.542
if, well let me write it in math notation.

00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:07.408
These are independent if the probability

00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:11.795
of A given B is equal to

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:13.749
the probability of A.

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.968
Then we can say A and B are independent.

00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:17.876
Because the probability of A,

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:19.317
then if this is true then this means

00:05:19.317 --> 00:05:20.652
the probability of A given B

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:24.100
isn't dependent on
whether B happened or not.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.564
It's the same thing as
the probability of A.

00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:28.706
This would lead to these
events being indpendent.

00:05:28.706 --> 00:05:31.266
So if you had the probability of B given A

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:33.451
is equal to the probability of B.

00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:34.370
Same argument.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.590
That would mean they are independent.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.344
Or, if we said that the
probability of A and B

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:44.908
is equal to the probability of A

00:05:44.908 --> 00:05:46.693
times the probability of B

00:05:46.693 --> 00:05:48.775
then this also means they are independent.

00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:49.713
We know that this one is true.

00:05:49.713 --> 00:05:52.217
The probability of A and B is 1/6.

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:54.933
The probability of A
times the probability of B

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:57.371
is 1/2 times 1/3 which is 1/6.

00:05:57.371 --> 00:05:59.570
So all of these are clearly true.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.505
So we can say that A
and B are independent.

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:04.929
The probability of A is independent

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:06.625
of whether B has happened or not.

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:07.817
The probability of B happening

00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:10.465
is independent of whether
A has happened or not.

00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:13.377
The outcome of events A and B

00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:14.922
are dependent on each other.

00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:15.616
No.

00:06:15.616 --> 00:06:17.380
That's the opposite of
saying they are independent.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.439
So we can cross that out.

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:21.606
Probably of A and B is equal to

00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:23.483
the probability of A
times the probability of B

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.210
We already said that to be true.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.418
1/6 is 1/2 times 1/3.

00:06:27.418 --> 00:06:29.284
The probability that Tom selects

00:06:29.284 --> 00:06:30.492
a blue garment that is a shirt

00:06:30.492 --> 00:06:32.675
is equal to the probability that tom

00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:35.227
selects a blue garment
multiplied by the probability

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:36.478
that he selects a shirt.

00:06:36.478 --> 00:06:37.740
Yep.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.270
That is absolutely right.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.720
So actually this is, a lot
of these statements are true.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.336
The only one that is not

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.529
is that the outcome of events A and B

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.427
are dependent on each other.
