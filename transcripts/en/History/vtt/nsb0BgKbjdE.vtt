00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.240
NARRATOR: At the end
of January, 1968,

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.382
Saigon was alive
with a festive spirit

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:20.086
as everyone prepared for
the Tet Lunar New Year.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.189
[thrilling music]

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:28.694
It was to be the first spring of
the Second Republic of Vietnam.

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:32.298
The Tet truce proposed by the
communist North Vietnamese

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.667
seemed to promise the
people a safe holiday,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.770
free from the ever-present
anxiety of war.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:39.639
At the temple, the
people gathered to pay

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.808
respects to their ancestors.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:45.445
On the eve of the New Year,
thousands of Saigon families

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.181
prayed before altars
of their ancestors.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:52.285
They prayed that peace might
be restored to their homeland.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.187
This year, however, the
traditional firecrackers

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.458
of the Tet celebration
became the fireworks of war.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.461
The Viet Cong, taking advantage
of the noisy celebration,

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:05.565
launched a savage attack on
Saigon, violating the truce

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.401
they themselves had proposed.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.204
[guns fire]

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.173
Areas of the city became
a blazing inferno.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.711
[guns fire]

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:22.215
Columns of smoke rose
skywards as block after block

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.551
in the capital city burned
with the fires of Viet Cong

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.153
treachery.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.390
[guns fire]

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.460
As frightened people
fled, many fell

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:35.628
victim to the enemy gunfire.

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.906
This carefully planned attack
by the North Vietnamese

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.308
has been described as
their all-or-nothing

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.177
go for broke effort.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.714
It ended in 10 communists
dead for each allied soldier

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.883
lost, the tremendous
price they paid

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.284
for their desperate attempt.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.894
[guns fire]

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.932
When the fires
subsided, the residents

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.368
returned into the
ashes of their homes

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.236
and sadly shuffled
through the ruins

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.639
to salvage what they could.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.408
Many of these people had
been born in these houses

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.677
and had reared their
children in them.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.748
Now there was nothing left
but ashes and memories.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.717
[somber music]

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:37.724
