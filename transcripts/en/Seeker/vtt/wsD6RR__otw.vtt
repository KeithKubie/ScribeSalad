00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.220
The threat of rising temperatures due to global
warming will have serious effects on our tiny

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.280
blue planet.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.700
Warming oceans could kill coral reefs, there
might be less fresh water, more disease, less

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.720
polar bears, more bark beetles, the list goes
on.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.119
But here is one side effect you may not have
heard of...smaller horses.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.580
That’s right, warmer temperatures could
make some animals shrink.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.450
About 50 million years ago, after the dinosaurs
died off, the Earth went through a series

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.660
of warming events called hyperthermals, most
likely from an increase of carbon.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.121
Most notably was what scientists call the
Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), when

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:39.010
temperatures rose between 5 and 8 degrees
celsius, and stayed that way for almost 200,000

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.010
years.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.570
Now, scientists wanted to know how this global
warming event affected the creatures living

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.790
at the time, so they started studying ancient
horse teeth.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.309
And they found that, when global temperatures
rose, these horses shrank.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.579
During the PETM, one ancient horse species
called Sifrhippus (siff-RIP-us), shrunk by

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.579
30%.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.100
But as the Earth cooled back down, it got
76% bigger.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.859
During the less drastic Eocene Thermal Maximum
2, another ancient horse, the Arenahippus

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.409
shrank by 14%, going from about the size of
a dog to about the size of a cat.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.469
Yeah, ancient horses were smaller than you
might have thought.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:14.950
So, why the shrinkage?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.259
Well, one explanation might be Bergmann's
rule, which states when the climate gets warmer,

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.520
mammals get smaller so they can cool off more
efficiently.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.149
Rising temperatures also see an increase in
drought and a decrease in plant growth, which

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.659
basically mean less food and water for the
animals, which could result in smaller and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.119
smaller offspring.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.109
But this is more than a fun fact, because
global temperatures are on the rise again

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.639
and some shrinking has already been documented
in modern day animals, like sheep, goats and

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:41.639
reindeer.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.969
Now, there are other factors that could have
been in play and the same dwarfing may not

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.729
happen the same way it did over 50 million
years ago.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.020
But with some climate scientists predicting
the earth’s temperature increasing by up

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.969
to 6 degrees by the year 2100, there may be
a lot to learn from studying these shrinking

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:56.969
horses.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:08.129
And if history does indeed repeat itself,
more tiny horses could be on the horizon.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:19.260
If you’re tired of talking about the tiny,
why don’t you go watch this video on some

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.250
of the largest creatures to ever walk the
Earth, dinosaurs.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.290
Scientists have completely rewritten how they
are categorized and it’s kinda crazy.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.260
