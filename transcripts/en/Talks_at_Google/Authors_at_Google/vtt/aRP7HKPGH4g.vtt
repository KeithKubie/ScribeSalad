FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, welcome.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.220
I'm very, very happy to
introduce Yvette van Boven and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.302
her husband Oof Verschuren.

00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:15.900
Practiced that.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.050
She's going to talk about her
latest book, "Home Made

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.500
Summer," and this was a
collaborative effort.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.850
Oof did all the wonderful
photography in this book.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.930
They make their home between
Amsterdam and Paris, and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.270
Yvette's going to talk about how
she got here, what started

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.160
her on this journey becoming
a chef and author.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.870
So welcome.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.430
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Thank you.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.450
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Hi.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.350
So my name is Yvette
van Boven.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.560
I was born in Ireland,
actually, and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.550
I was raised there.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.170
And I moved to Holland when
I was 10 years old.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.960
So I'm a bit of everything, as
I believe that you are all a

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.300
bit of everything, coming from
all parts of the world.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.500
I would like to tell you a bit
about how I actually came here

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.950
to stand here in front of you,
because my life did not start

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.220
off that way.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.400
My dad was a landscape
architect, and he wanted to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.590
move from Holland.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.760
My parents were both Dutch.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.030
He wanted to move from Holland
to Ireland because it was a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.310
more freer spirit at the time.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.770
It was the late '60s, beginning
of the '70s.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.730
And so they started their
family there.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.280
They had me and my sister.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.690
And we were very much encouraged
to be artistic.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.720
So after spending 10 years
there, we moved back to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.765
Amsterdam, and I went to the
secondary school in Holland.

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.490
After staying there, I thought
I would like to be an artist.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.970
My parents had very much
told me to be artistic.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.820
They had given me all kinds of
paint and paper and all kinds

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.300
of things to encourage us--
me and my sister both.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.259
So I went to the School of the
Arts in Belgium, and when I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.710
was there, I realized, well, I
might not be a real artist.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.500
It was very hard for
me, actually.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.640
I could do the drawing part, but
I felt very strange being

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.960
in front of big white
screens of paper and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.720
thinking, oh my god.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.510
What should I paint on this?

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.235
So actually, I decided then to
move up to the Hague and go

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:37.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.230
be a interior architect.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.690
So I studied there for many
years in the Hague.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.450
Simultaneously, I always worked
in restaurants just to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.030
earn some extra money.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.940
I had been cooking everywhere.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.380
And because I have been studying
for a very long time,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.620
I've been cooking for a
very long time, too.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.590
I've actually started off
cooking when I was

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.000
only four years old.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.450
I would be standing beside my
mother, and she would cook in

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.120
her kitchen, and I would be just
beside her on a little

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.650
stool and drawing everything
she would be cooking.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.400
Because when I was four years
old, I was not able to write,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.940
so I made little drawings.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.830
And you will see them back in
the book, as I've never

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.390
changed that way of
drawing things.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.180
Sometimes I find that drawings
are quicker because if you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.850
need to put a sentence down like
"pour this into the pot,"

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.100
that would be just one
arrow to draw.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.150
So sometimes that was quicker.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.770
So you will find those things
back in my work, too.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.640
I was doing all these drawings
at the same time just for fun,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.540
and also for the restaurant
where I worked at.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.460
They enjoyed my drawings, too.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.530
So I was doing the menus there
and just doing these little

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.740
things on the side while I
was studying at school.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.400
And we were working in a very
small little breakfast and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.180
lunch joint, where we
would cater from at

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.130
that particular time.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.920
I was working in the kitchen
with a very good friend of

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.070
mine, and a lot of people came
up to our kitchen and asked

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.750
for recipes because I think our
cakes were really good.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.620
So they were all coming
up and asking for, can

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.570
we have your recipe?

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.209
And I would write them down
for everybody personally.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.210
So we were getting a little
bit fed up of this because

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.370
there were a lot of people
coming over.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.350
So we decided to make
our first book.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.600
So I talked to the owner of
the shop, and they decided

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.340
that would be a very
good idea.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.640
So I wrote the whole book by
hand at night after school

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.990
because I did not know how
to work a computer.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.760
I had never sat beside a
computer before, so I did

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.330
everything by hand, and then the
publisher would scan all

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.830
my drawings in.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.380
And when I finished the book,
we needed a cover.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.430
Because we didn't have any
photography in it, I made all

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.550
the drawings of the
dishes myself.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.020
So for my former work, where I
worked before, I had met this

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.380
nice guy who actually became
a very good friend of mine.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.010
So I said, I know
a very nice guy.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.920
He's a photographer.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.980
We can call him and ask him
if he can shoot our cover.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.230
So that was Oof.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.280
We went to his studio in
Amsterdam, and when we

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.300
finished the pictures, my two
friends who were with me from

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.480
the kitchen made a bet that we
would be together after that

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.630
because we were falling in
love over the camera.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.760
And we have stayed together
ever since.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.320
So that was a very nice start
of my career in cookbooks.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.590
But I did not know that at
that time, because I

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.700
was still in school.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.700
I needed to finish my school to

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.280
become an interior designer.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.290
And so I finished that,
and I opened up my

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.050
first design office.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.670
I did this with my sister
because my sister had done a

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.250
similar school of the arts in
Amsterdam, and she was a

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.510
graphic designer.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.510
So we were both doing jobs,
especially for hotels and

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.570
restaurants.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.620
We would do the menus, do
the interior, would

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.950
do all these things--

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.540
the signing and all these
outings that they would need.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.600
And we were working as designers
at that time, and I

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.270
was missing cooking terribly,
terribly, because I did not

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.480
work as a cook at that time.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.020
I would work as a designer.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.740
So often, Oof would ask
me, would you mind?

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.880
Just help me out.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.270
We have a picture coming in
tomorrow, and I need someone

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.650
to cook a dish because there
has to be some food in it.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.140
And at that time, I did
not know of the

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.760
job of a food stylist.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.480
I did not know that
this existed.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.290
It wasn't a real school for
it or anything, so I just

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.570
accidentally got into this job
as a sort of side job making

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.800
lovely plates.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.050
And actually, for me, that was
the same as working as an

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.710
artist because you had to
make a composition.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.360
You had to really think about
what you were putting on the

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.130
plate, trying to put the colors
and arranging them

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.080
differently, and also knowing
about cooking because you need

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.890
to know how to cook everything
properly to make it look good

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.250
on a picture.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.280
So this was a really,
really nice job.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.270
I really enjoyed it.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.830
And through Oof, and through his
network of people he knew

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.770
at magazines, I got more
little jobs like this.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.800
So I was doing this food styling
thing on the side, and

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.600
I got to do little drawings for
magazines, or I would be

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.490
writing recipes, or all kinds
of things like that.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.570
And this was all my side jobs
just beside my designing job.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:58.740
So after a couple of years,
I was working quite hard.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.310
And at night, I would say to
Oof, I would really, really

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.420
rather bake cakes.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.800
I think baking cakes is nicer
than walking around building

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.870
sites wearing a helmet, talking
to all these guys who

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.100
are doing their work or
jobs well or not.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.590
So I thought I might
go for it.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.020
So I talked to my sister about
it, and she was actually quite

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.540
happy, because she wanted
to be an artist.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.410
And she became one after,
so that's great.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.500
And so we closed down our design
shop, and I started off

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.940
with a catering business
from my home, which was

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.300
tough, but it worked.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.770
We rented fridges.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.310
We lived in Amsterdam at that
time, and we had a quite small

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.940
house, because in Amsterdam, the
houses are not very big.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.930
So we had a small house,
but a big kitchen.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.670
It was actually a big kitchen
and a bedroom,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.390
something like that.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.930
You should think
of it that way.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.480
And we would have all kinds of
fridges that I would rent down

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.120
our living room, and all rental
crates with cups and

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.480
saucers and everything that came
in for special occasions

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.610
and weddings, and we had
to carry them all out.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:20.450
And we had groceries down
the hallway piling up.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.990
So I did this for a couple
of years like that.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.910
And I was working as a food
stylist, recipe writer.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.180
I would do all these
kinds of jobs, too.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.940
So this was getting
a bit out of hand.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.380
The jobs were getting bigger.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.610
First, I was starting off
cooking for 30 people.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.130
I ended up cooking for 80, 90,
100 people at that time.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:47.450
So I had a lot of help
of my cousin, Joris.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.470
And he came in.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.340
And he was working in a hotel
at the time, and he came to

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:51.880
help me out.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.490
He would get people to serve,
and we were setting out all

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.440
the tables while I was
cooking at events.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.610
And he said, well, you
know, we need to

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.575
find a space together.

00:10:06.575 --> 00:10:09.760
We could collaborate
really well.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.240
So we need to find
a space together.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.530
So he was really excited.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.960
He's a lot younger than I am,
and he's very, very energetic

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.130
and funny and great.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.530
So he was running around
Amsterdam looking for a place.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:29.880
So he found this very tiny
little snack bar in the

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.880
eastern part of the center of
Amsterdam, which was by then--

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.780
I think it's seven
years ago, Oof?

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.510
Yeah.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.450
Was then a bit of
a run down area.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.240
So we could get the space
for quite cheap.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.040
And it had a great back space,
so we could put all our

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.520
fridges and all our dishes and
china and everything could be

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.250
stacked up there.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.900
So that was terrific.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.960
And we started at the snack bar
to clean it out, and we

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.390
thought we would be open in
about six weeks or something.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.960
That became six months.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.360
So we were doing the whole place
ourselves because we

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.990
wanted to save some money.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.070
So I think our restaurant was
really homemade, too.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.920
We had taken off every tile.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.345
We had put back every
piece of platter.

00:11:16.345 --> 00:11:18.980
We'd been painting everything.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.970
And then finally, we
opened our doors.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.035
And we started off as a
breakfast and lunch

00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:28.850
restaurant, and actually, we
just wanted to do catering

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.470
jobs, and we thought people can
come in if they wanted a

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.920
sandwich or anything.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.200
But it was becoming quite a
big business, and we were

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.775
having groups in--

00:11:38.775 --> 00:11:41.070
people renting the place
for special occasions

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.900
and things like that.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.490
It was a very small
restaurant.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.590
It's not huge.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:51.810
So we worked very hard at the
time, too, trying to get

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.360
everybody in, and also learning
how to build up a

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.470
restaurant, which is quite a
job if you have never done

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.250
that before.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.150
And then something a little
bit sad happened.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.040
I had a sort of medical horrible
thing with my back

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.890
because it's just a hard job.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.550
I mean, carrying things around
for catering for 20 years is

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.140
sort of being like a
mover or something.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.530
So I needed to stop for a
moment, and I needed to take

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.680
some time off.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.570
I was waiting for
an operation.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.290
Boring story.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.880
Anyway, I was at home,
so I needed to do

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.500
something with my time.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:36.620
And I thought, well, this is
the perfect moment to start

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.080
and write a book.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.620
So this is actually
my third book.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.370
But I had two of them
before this.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.560
And so I was at home.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.410
I was a very fond reader
of cookbooks.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.140
I could read cookbooks
as novels, actually.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.610
I would read them going to
bed or in the bathtub.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.890
Even in the toilet, we have
cookbooks everywhere piled up.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.490
So I was looking at books
how I like them.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.960
Some books I really enjoyed the
writing-- the stories that

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.250
the cookbook writers
would tell.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.640
Some books were really pretty.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.600
I loved the pictures in it,
or the way that they were

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.910
illustrated, or all these
kind of things.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.620
So I imagined my own book,
putting all these things I

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.430
loved so much from other books
together in my own head and

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:33.120
tried to express myself
in my special way.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:39.630
So I had never written a book
before, and I went up to my

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.950
publisher, who is my publisher
now in Holland, and I asked

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.000
him, could I show
you my proposal?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.140
I just made a couple of pages.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.940
I would like to see if
you're interested.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.240
So with trembling knees, I
went up to his office and

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.150
showed him my first example
of how my book would be.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.910
I had made a table
of contents.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.170
I had talked about it a bit.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.970
And I had also made some
drawings, and I also do the

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.210
whole design of the book.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.100
So I had done everything.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.590
I made the cover, I had done
some shots with Oof, and

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.240
showed it to him.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.400
And he said, yes,
you can do it.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.600
So I was thrilled to bits.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.710
I was actually so happy.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.940
I didn't imagine it
to be so easy.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.990
So I went home, and we started
off on this book.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.070
And it was quite a journey.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.550
It was called "Home Made."
It's my first book.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.460
And you will recognize
it because it has big

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.500
tomatoes on the front.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.690
It's blue and red.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.030
And it's a book about
everything homemade,

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:50.670
obviously, because I had been
writing for so many magazines

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.440
for so many years for so many
groups of people, like

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.930
housewives, or young girls.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.060
These magazines all have their
own groups that they are

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.630
writing for.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.840
So I had to write for all
these kinds of people.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:10.800
So I really found out that a
lot of people were actually

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.230
afraid of starting to cook.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:20.200
And also, they would not know
that things would be so easy.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.180
Like, I grew up, my mom would
teach me how to make cheese.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.840
This was a very easy thing.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.720
You would heat up milk, add some
acid to it, and then it

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.655
would curdle, and then you would
put it in a sieve, and

00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:35.920
we would hang it in our tree.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.360
We had a lilac tree in the
garden that had low branches,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.930
and we would hang it in the
tree and just wait to soak

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.090
out, or what do you call it?

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:49.090
And we would keep a little
cheese at the end.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.300
So that was really great.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.180
These things that I thought were
very normal to me were

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.630
not normal to all
these people.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.570
So I decided to put this
all in a book.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.410
So how to pickle things, or
how to make a smoker oven

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:08.030
without using difficult
appliances like smoker ovens

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.446
or ice makers.

00:16:11.446 --> 00:16:16.330
Just a knife or a cutting board
or a piece of tin foil.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.170
Just things that you would
have lying around.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.295
Making cheese without
using a rennet.

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:25.020
Things that are available
in the stores.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.960
Not very hard, and not too
difficult to find.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.930
But also, I wanted to make a
book that made you turn every

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.060
page-- that every picture
would be different.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.300
That I would make drawings just
to make it different,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.160
just to make you turn
the pages again.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.620
I would make cutouts out of
paper to design my chapters.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.450
I just made all these things to
tempt people just to turn

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.240
the next page and read again
about everything.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.880
And I tried to make a book that
was very personal to me

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.080
because it was my story.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.580
And that really worked out.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.010
We worked on the book for about,
I think, a year, a year

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.339
and a half.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.869
And then it came out, and we had
quite a success with it.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.420
I was so surprised because I
initially made the book just

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.140
for myself.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.470
I just wanted to have a book--
to hold it in my hands, and to

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.650
have something that
I actually made.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.069
And we won prizes with it, and
we got published in all

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.820
different countries.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.360
Not only here in America,
but all over the world.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.380
The book got translated in
German, and it got translated

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.990
into French.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.110
So that was really terrific, and
especially for just a girl

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.550
coming from Holland teaching
friends how to cook.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.790
That was really nice.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.810
So then my publisher asked me,
could you make another one?

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.750
Because this one is
doing so well.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.340
And we decided not to make
one but make two.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.800
One was called "Home Made
Winter," and the other one is

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.390
"Home Made Summer." It's the
book you are all holding in

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.040
your hands.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.540
It's the same principle I kept
of teaching people how to make

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.440
simple things like yogurt or
cheese or all kinds of things.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.610
Mustard or ketchup or all these
things yourself, but

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.770
keeping it very seasonal.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:22.420
So my winter book was more about
the winter, and long

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.810
nights, and-- well, you
don't have that here.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.504
I think the weather
is so beautiful.

00:18:27.504 --> 00:18:31.430
But in Europe, believe me,
trust me, it's terrible.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.280
We have awful winters, and
it's cold and snowing.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.640
So you would be in the house,
and you would have time.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.780
And you would make soups and
comforting things and stews

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.920
and everything nice.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.980
And in the summer--

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.600
well, when it's weather like
this, we all run out of our

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.740
houses, catching every beam
of sunlight we can get.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.280
But also, the produce is,
of course, great.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.110
So you would only want to mix
up things very quickly and

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.640
then run out of the
house again.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.350
You would not want to cook
for a very long time.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.470
So that is the summer book.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.130
It's all about quick and fast
and summery and fresh and

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.950
celebrating fruit and vegetables
and lovely things.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:19.420
So that book also got translated
in many languages,

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.690
and I was very happy.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.332
And the restaurant is still
doing very well.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:30.010
The girl that was working beside
me in my kitchen at the

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.540
time I was working there every
day, she took over the kitchen

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.440
when I was getting
my treatment.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.830
And I was writing the book and
doing the menus together.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.310
I was still very much involved
with the restaurant, which is

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.200
still open until this day.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.280
And I have taken on a lot
of jobs just to do

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.220
work out the side.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.120
So I'm working as
an illustrator.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.160
I work as a culinary
editor for a huge

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.410
woman's magazine in Holland.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:07.500
So I make about 5 to 10 pages
per week, and I write columns

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.070
about food, and for magazines
and newspapers, too.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.150
So it has been quite a journey,
I can tell you.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:19.825
And it brought me to here,
so that is really great.

00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:22.580
From starting off as an interior
architect, and now

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.480
writing cookbooks.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.520
And we are now very fortunate
to be working

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.580
on our fourth book.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.860
And we are trying to reinvent
ourselves, Oof and I, because

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.420
we have been working so closely
together for three

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.100
years on all these
three books.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.190
And we're now trying to do
something different, testing

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.900
out new ways of taking pictures
and new ways of

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.010
illustrating.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:54.280
And we've got a subject we're
going to work on.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.990
And it's going to be a big book,
and we're going to work

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.440
on this for another year,
year and a half again.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.240
So that's quite a nice job I'm
really looking forward to.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.990
So that is my story, a bit, from
the beginning to the end.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.740
Well, it's not the end.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.060
I hope it's not the end.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.390
I hope I'm in the
middle of it.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:13.710
But that's up to now.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.920
So that was what I wanted to
share with you guys, and I

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.450
hope you have some questions
for me now so I can answer.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
here and speaking.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.240
I was really curious because I
looked on your website and it

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.360
had the cantaloupe, goat
cheese, and basil soup.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.160
That really sparked my interest
because I wanted to

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.700
know how you look at different
ingredients and how you go

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.770
about, maybe like the flavor
profile or the texture and

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.980
say, I want to try this.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.030
Maybe this will work.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.480
Like, why go towards basil
versus tarragon?

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.150
Or how many iterations would
you do until you

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.340
go, that's the one?

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.620
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Well,

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.240
actually, it's a nice question.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.490
Thank you.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.830
Like I said earlier, I like to
make very simple recipes with

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.990
ingredients that are
very available.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.210
But I like to do little
surprises.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:16.120
So like you said, this was a
very strange combination.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.710
I actually write these
recipes in my head.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.750
So I would first think of them,
and then I'll try them.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.970
So I'll write them out.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.840
And because I have quite an
experience, I think, for

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.140
writing recipes, I can just
think about the amounts I

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.750
think I'm going to use.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.340
I'm actually always looking at
the very regular palates.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:45.350
Like, you would use sour to
balance out sweetness, or you

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.030
would use saltiness to balance
out sweetness.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.730
You always have these things
that always work.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.910
Like, a very traditional way
of eating cantaloupe in

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.640
France, for example, is wrapping
raw cured ham--

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.840
salty ham-- around it.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.110
So you know, salty flavors
work really well with the

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.270
sweetness of the cantaloupe.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.140
So if you think a little bit
further, you could say, well,

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.340
ham is salty, but cheese
could also be salty.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.960
So let's try that out.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.910
And then I would add
basil just to use

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.290
something really fragrant.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.550
But also, I was thinking of
the colors on your plate.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.910
You have an orange soup with
these white spots and the

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.400
green oil on it, and it
should be spectacular.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.020
And it worked.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.050
So that is how it happens.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.010
Yeah.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.790
It's funny, but it's always a
sort of mixture of visual and

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.360
tasting and then trying it out
at home, mixing in more

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.540
ginger, less ginger, more
white wine, less--

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.440
just trying it out, and then
you get it almost OK.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.080
And then you put
it in the book.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.490
AUDIENCE: What are your
favorite foods

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.680
to experiment with?

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.340
And you said your mom taught
you how to make cheese.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.820
Do you have any family recipes
that you've put a different

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.090
spin on or that you just love
to make as a traditional

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.110
recipe that you would include
in your book?

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.360
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Ah, yeah.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.680
I actually am very fond
of ginger, I must say.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.320
I have to withhold myself not
putting ginger in absolutely

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.410
everything because it's nice and
lemony, and it's peppery,

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.490
and it has such a distinct
flavor and it pulls out, I

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:33.780
think, a lot of taste,
a lot of--

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.520
so that is one of
my favorites.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.660
I'm very fond of melon,
actually.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.180
We were talking about
that earlier.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.420
I'm very fond of all
kinds of herbs.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.950
Actually, every single herb on
Earth, I would say, like

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.130
chervil or basil or cilantro or
all these kinds of things.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:53.400
And I love to mix them up and
even eat them as a salad.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.730
So that's something
I really enjoy.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:25:01.900
And to answer your next
question, yes, I do tweak

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.150
traditional recipes.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.960
We live in Amsterdam,
but we spend a lot

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.870
of our time in Paris.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.140
I think a quarter of
our time is there.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.820
And every summer, we go down
to the south of France.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.100
But also, I have a lot of
recipes from my time in

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.250
Ireland, especially for
cakes, and baking

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.030
is terrific in Ireland.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.500
So these are basics.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.020
Traditional recipes
are always basics.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:34.030
And sometimes I put them
straightaway in my book

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.940
because I find them really good,
and they're very good

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.590
examples, sometimes, of
a story, but sometimes

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.450
they're just good.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.780
But traditional recipes are
nice to change a bit.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:51.950
I think a lot of recipes
in general are very,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.330
what would you say?

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.760
They are like fashion.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.180
We would cook asparagus now
for only 10 minutes.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.010
But my mother used to cook
them for 25 minutes.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.240
My grandmother would cook
them almost like puree.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.870
So these are things
that are changing.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.580
So traditional recipes change
with the time, too.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:19.055
And you would tweak them to
a more modern version.

00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:21.155
Like now, we would eat much
more raw vegetables.

00:26:21.155 --> 00:26:24.510
We would eat much more
vegetables than I think our

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.690
parents did.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.510
So I would mix that in
much more, yeah.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.910
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if,
when you are experimenting

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.620
with something that's really
out there, is there a point

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.060
where you say, this sauce
or this attempt is not

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:41.750
going to make it?

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.710
Like, you start to tweak it and
add a little bit more--

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:45.250
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Oh yeah.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.820
AUDIENCE: --of one
thing or another?

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.860
How do you, with your
experience, know when to stop

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.390
dumping in new ingredients or
repurpose it, maybe, for

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.210
something else?

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:55.630
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Oh yeah.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.800
That happens, too.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.740
I couldn't tell you if
a recipe never works.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.040
I mean, it always works
at some point.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.270
I mean, if you've been working
as a cook for so long, you

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.370
don't make really big mistakes,
except for putting

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.680
too much salt in something.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:21.050
But I'm blank now because you
asked something else, and I

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.970
had an answer right away
when you asked it.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.820
What was the second part
of your question?

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.840
It was--

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.660
AUDIENCE: Repurpose it?

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.460
Yes.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.080
YVETTE VAN BOVEN:
Yes, thank you.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.710
The recipes in my books are
often smaller versions of how

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.280
we would do it in
the restaurant.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.890
So restaurant cooking
is very, very

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.080
different from home cooking.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.990
You always have a big pan
of broth lying around.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:52.400
You always have super
meats and things.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.030
So you always have to tone
it down a bit for

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.420
recipes in a book.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.420
So I would actually really
change things.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.580
If I would have a recipe in the
restaurant on pheasant,

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.880
and I would think, well, people
don't have pheasant

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.780
lying around, I could convert it
to chicken and see if that

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.200
would work, too.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:16.680
But also, writing recipes for
different magazines is also a

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.130
thing that you have
to think about.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.150
You have to think of
your audience.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.920
And if I'm writing a recipe for
people living in villages,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.890
I would never use ingredients
that you

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.180
can only buy in cities.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.270
So that is something
I really look at.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:37.400
And I could tweak existing
recipes just to make them more

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.080
popular for another audience.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.560
Yeah, I would do that.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.490
So I'm very good at looking
around in supermarkets, always

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.950
looking, what kind of
stuff do they have?

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.840
So I can put it back into
my recipes, yeah.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.330
AUDIENCE: So my wife
has probably

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.465
got 500 plus cookbooks.

00:28:54.465 --> 00:28:55.320
And she's like you.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.270
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Oh,
she's like me, yeah.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.520
AUDIENCE: She literally
reads them as novels.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.920
She doesn't buy so many anymore
because she just goes

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.230
to the library, and the
librarians are very,

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.960
very nice to her.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.850
They put brand new cookbooks
in the back for her, so she

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.800
checks them out.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.980
Always has piles of them
everywhere, and she's just

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.450
reading them all the time.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.840
I'm very excited about this one
to be able to give to her.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.390
It's really about the idea of
how you look for things that

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.760
were really important to
you and put them in.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.750
And so my question is, you
started off with one cookbook

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.790
and decided that you were going
to put some things that

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.330
were really valuable, what
you thought were very

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.430
important but easy.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.985
And then you ended up
going to three.

00:29:34.985 --> 00:29:36.520
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Yeah.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.140
AUDIENCE: What happened?

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.290
How did you decide what to put
in the first one, and then did

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.250
you run out of material and all
of a sudden realize you

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.070
were doing two more?

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.050
And then how did you go
through that process?

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.700
And do you have everything you
want in a cookbook from that

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.430
perspective now?

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.330
Are you done with that part?

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.810
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Well, I
actually had, I think, a

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.770
quadruple pile of
recipes that I--

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.410
you have to kill your darlings
when you're writing a book.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:09.190
So I would say the first book
I was really focused on all

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.970
these different kinds of curing,
or making cheese, or

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.630
making sweets, or making snacks,
or making all these.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.870
So I made a real strict
table of contents

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.730
to keep myself focused.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.020
Obviously, I had more recipes
laying around.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.050
I'm writing, I think, about
15 to 20 recipes a

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.720
week for all my work.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.480
So this is a constant flow of
stuff I have lying around.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.510
When I started off on the winter
and summer book, I

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.460
already had things divided.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.940
At the time when I was writing
my first book, I did not know

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.960
that I was going to
write two more.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:55.220
So I was actually happy that I
could, but I already had some

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.590
stuff lying around.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.670
I also wrote things specially
for the two other ones.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.850
Just when you start out, and
then you are looking at the

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.010
composition of your work, you
are looking at, do I have a

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:08.060
lot of red meat?

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.750
I've got too much
red meat things.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.090
I should balance it out and
write some more with fish.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.320
So you will have to balance
it out very well.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.130
So sometimes you don't have
them lying around.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.870
You're testing just to make a
nice composition of recipes in

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.460
your book to make
a whole story.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.770
Yeah.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.760
AUDIENCE: So if I were picking
this up, which I am, for the

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.310
first time, what are some of
your favorites that I should

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.930
try out first?

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:35.680
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: In the book?

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:35.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:36.560
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: This book?

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:36.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.840
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: Oh,
there are so many.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.690
AUDIENCE: What are
your favorites?

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.590
YVETTE VAN BOVEN: One
of my favorites is

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.880
actually not only--

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.600
we were talking about
soups earlier.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.900
One of my favorites is a white
gazpacho, which is actually

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.490
more adventurous, I think, than
the cantaloupe soup with

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:59.550
cheese, is a soup I tried out
because I'm very fond of cold

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.190
soups in the summer.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.430
I called it gazpacho not because
there are tomatoes in

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.210
it, but then you would
know it's a soup.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.500
It's a cold soup.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:15.170
I was looking at a balance
between sweet and savory, so I

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.860
made a soup with
smoked almonds.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.700
I was looking at
the ajoblancos.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.860
It's a Spanish soup made
from almonds and

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.550
white bread and garlic.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.920
So I was trying to make a
sort of retake on that.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.180
So I used smoked almonds,
green seedless grapes,

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.500
cucumber, and some vegetable
broth, and I mix it up.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:46.570
And then I added things like
vinegar-- just a little bit to

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.550
balance out the sweet
sour balance--

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.980
and white bread to make
it nice and soft.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.240
And if you put it in a blender
and blender it down, you will

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.680
get a sort of incredible
smoothie kind of soup.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.170
And then I would add a big lug
of olive oil at the end to

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.580
make it nice and soft
and creamy, and

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.210
serve it with avocado.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:11.410
And I think I could just say
for myself, which is really

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.190
funny, but it was
an amazing soup.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.350
I was very happy with that.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.830
And it's also nice because
it's a two-minute job.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.730
You just open up your blender,
put everything in, put it on,

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.490
and you're done.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.140
So I think that's one
of my favorites.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.062
There are many, but
that was one.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.900
Thank you.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.780
Thank you all for coming.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.187
[APPLAUSE]
