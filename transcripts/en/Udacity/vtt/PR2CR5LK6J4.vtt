Should you volunteer while searching for
a job? Let's find out

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.780
Welcome back to another edition of
Udacity career tips. My name is Martin

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.980
McGovern, and this week we have a bit of
advice from a graduate of our full-stack

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.039
Nanodegree program they say sometimes
when you least expect it, a job offer

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.199
comes along. I volunteered at a coding
initiative for refugees and turned this

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.149
experience into a permanent role. The
organization offered me a remote

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.340
position paying a competitive salary - and
at the same time I get to make a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.399
difference in people's lives. This grad
is sharing some great advice and is not

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.730
alone in their opinion that volunteering
is a great boost for your job search.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.699
According to a study from the
Corporation for National and Community

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.359
Service, that tracked more than 70,000
jobless people between 2002 and 2012,

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.390
they found that those who had
volunteered had a 27% better chance of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.729
finding a job than those who didn't. So,
if you're struggling in your search and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.890
not quite sure what to do, find an
organization in need and offer a helping

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.619
hand. You'll build your skills meet
valuable contacts and fill your resume

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.920
with relevant, charitable experience. But,
now I put the question back to you.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.950
Have you ever volunteered? And if so, have
you ever seen any career gains come from

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
your volunteer work, either intentional
or unintentional? Share your stories in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.340
the comments and help other job seekers
who are looking to volunteer come up

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.770
with some ideas to get out there and
help people

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.540
Thank you so much for watching. If you
know anyone who's searching for a job

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.790
right now
tag them and let them know you're

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.000
thinking about them. We look forward to
bringing you many more videos like this

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.660
in the future and wish you the best of
luck in your job search.
