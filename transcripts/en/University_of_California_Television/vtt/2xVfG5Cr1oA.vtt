still trying to understand ourselves.

the introduction, Anne, and to the

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:11.370
organizers for inviting me to participate
in this symposium today. And also to all

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.900
of you for coming back after the break.
So, it's nice to see everyone again. So

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.930
I'm really happy to have the opportunity
to tell you about some of our recent work

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.960
on mapping archaic hominin DNA in the
genomes of modern humans. And actually my

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.270
talk, you'll see is going to be pretty
similar to our first speaker, Sriram. And

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.400
in fact when he was talking, I was
thinking to myself how nice it was,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.120
actually, that some of the things he was
saying overlapped with what I was going to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.560
talk about because we were working on
these projects completely independently.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.220
We developed very different statistical
methods to answer the same questions and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.070
yet, by and large, we came to many of the
same conclusion. So I think it engenders

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.950
confidence in the things that we're
presenting today. And my graduate student,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.230
Benjamin Vernot and I, first became
interested in this question of archaic

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.830
admixture a few years ago. And I think
this is actually one of the most

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.840
fascinating topics in all of genetics and
genomics these days, is all of the things

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.530
that we've learned from ancient DNA
sequencing. And one of the more

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.840
contentious questions I think in human
evolution has been whether or not modern

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.190
humans mated or hybridized with archaic
humans like Neandertals and Denisovans.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.890
And for many decades, this was just sort
of an acrimonious debate and that was

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.440
largely because the data didn't exist to
answer the question. But with technologies

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.410
developed by Svante Pääbo and some of the
other speakers we've heard from this

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:54.390
morning, Matias and Kay, in the not too
many years ago, we were able to get high

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.690
quality genome sequences from the
Neandertal and Denisovan genomes. And this

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.650
provided sort of unambiguous evidence that
modern humans and these archaic humans did

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.700
in fact hybridize and exchanged genes. And
as Matias talked about this morning,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.640
though, studying ancient DNA from fossils
still remains really challenging because

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.520
you have to find an appropriate specimen,
first of all. And you have to hope that

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.630
the DNA has been preserved over hundreds
of thousands of years. So, my student and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.130
I thought, "Well, if there was gene flow
between modern humans and archaic humans,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.740
maybe we could excavate ancient DNA not
directly from fossils but indirectly from

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.380
the genomes of modern humans. And to give
you sort of a little bit of an intuition

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.020
of how this works, I'd like to argue that
a little bit of archaic introgression goes

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.060
a long way. And so, in this schematic, I'm
showing you a picture of 10 or so

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.310
individuals. These aren't random
individuals, these are my colleagues in

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.640
the Department of Genome Sciences, and
this is what happens when you put your

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:13.700
picture on the internet. So, each line
here, let's imagine, represents a stretch

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.050
of each person's genome and from previous
work, we knew that all non-Africans had

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.930
about 2% of their DNA inherited from
Neandertal ancestors. And that's what's

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.820
represented by these yellow chunks of
sequence. And so what we wanted to do was

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.000
developed a method where we could walk
along an individuals genome and pull out

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.810
the parts that were inherited from the
Neandertal ancestors. And the key here is

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.940
that the 2% of my genome that was
inherited from Neandertals might be a

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.140
little bit different than your 2%. So that
when we aggregate the data across many

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.060
individuals, we can actually recover a
substantial amount of the Neandertal

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.130
genome. And actually, what I find most
compelling about this approach is that as

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.670
opposed to sequencing ancient DNA from a
single fossil, by recovering these all

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.670
surviving archaic lineages, we're
potentially getting data that was...or

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.780
getting sequences that were inherited from
multiple archaic ancestors. So we're

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.840
getting population level data and that
will allow us to make inferences that are

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.850
difficult or impossible to do if you just
have genetic data from a single

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.400
individual. So, I'm not going to talk a
lot about the details of how we scan along

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.430
an individual's genome and look for
archaic sequence, but I did want to give

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.630
you a little bit of intuition. So what are
the characteristics of introgressed

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.570
archaic sequence that we look at? Well,
what I'm showing you here is a simple

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:47.760
schematic showing that Europeans diverged
from Africans about 80,000 years ago or

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.060
so. And what we want to find, or if we
look at lineages, super-imposed on this

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:01.030
tree, we can see that what we're actually
interested in finding are cases like this.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.750
So sequences that are found in
non-Africans that were inherited from a

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.810
Neandertal ancestor. So what are the
features that we expect for these types of

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.660
sequences? Well, the first is that in
contrast to two modern human sequences

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.340
that have a much more recent common
ancestor, mutation will have had a long

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.460
time to act and accumulate. We want to
find these sequences. So mutation will

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.400
have had a longer time to act and
accumulate on this lineage compared to two

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.040
modern human lineages. But the other key
feature is that admixture happened

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.130
relatively recently. So in the last 60 to
80,000 years or so, and therefore the

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:49.530
Neandertal haplotypes will still persist
over sizable genomic regions. So, it's

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.850
this combination of highly divergent
sequences that stretch over large genomic

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:00.190
distances that allow us to accurately and
robustly predict what are archaic

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.220
sequences versus what are modern human
sequences. And actually the approach we're

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.460
using is a modification of a statistic
called S* that was developed by Jeff Wall.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.990
And one of the nice things about this
approach is it doesn't explicitly use the

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:21.350
Neandertal or Denisovan genome when making
the initial inference. And the really

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.610
powerful thing about that is we can
potentially discover archaic lineages from

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.580
groups that we don't even know about yet,
and actually that's a major part of what

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.090
we're looking at now, but that will have
to be a story for a different day. So what

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:39.240
I'm going to tell you about, though, is
applying this method to 1,500

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:45.090
geographically diverse individuals. So
whole genome sequences from about 1,500

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.830
people all throughout the world. These are
largely sequences from the 1000 Genomes

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.450
project. So this is a publicly available
data set. But to supplement this, we also

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.850
sequenced, in collaboration with Svante
Pääbo's group, 35 individuals from

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:07.930
Melanesia. And the idea here was that we
knew from previous work that these

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.100
individuals should have substantial
amounts of both Neandertal and Denisovan

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:18.880
sequence. And if we look at the amount of
archaic ancestry that we find per

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.540
individual, that's what I'm showing on
this slide. So this shows the distribution

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:30.050
of the amount of archaic sequence per
individual in Melanesians, East Asians,

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.950
South Asians and Europeans. And you can
see that Melanesians have, on average,

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.410
much more archaic sequence per individual
compared to some of the other non-African

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:45.220
groups. And the reason is, as I just
mentioned, they have substantial amounts

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:53.160
of both Neandertal and Denisovan sequence.
And so each row here is an individual and

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.450
the bar plot corresponds to how much
Neandertal versus Denisovan sequence each

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.010
individual has. And if you look closely,
there's a small amount of sequence that we

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:09.410
label as ambiguous. This is sequence that
we are confident is archaic in origin, but

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.210
we can't distinguish, robustly at least,
whether or not it's Neandertal or

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:22.660
Denisovan, okay? So on average, Europeans
have about 50 to 55 megabases of archaic

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:28.050
sequence per individual and this is
largely Neandertal in origin. South Asians

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:33.140
have a little bit more, East Asians have a
little bit more. And Melanesians have

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:39.110
about, on average, 100 megabases of
archaic sequence per individual. So that's

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:45.030
100 million base pairs. So that's great,
we can identify archaic sequence. But I

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.630
think the really interesting thing is the
things that we can potentially learn from

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.550
it. So, what are the types of questions
that surviving archaic lineages allow us

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.610
to ask? So I'm going to tell you about
three things that we've been interested

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:04.090
in. So the first is, was hybridization
between archaic humans and modern humans

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.710
deleterious? That is, were there bad
consequences? Conversely, was

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:14.350
hybridization beneficial? Or, were there
some good consequences of hybridization?

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:20.200
And finally, what demographic model is
consistent with patterns of introgressed

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.530
archaic sequences? So let's start with the
first question. Were there deleterious

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:31.350
consequences to hybridization? And one of
the most striking things that we found

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.500
when first looking at patterns of
Neandertal sequence across the genome is

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.870
that it's very heterogeneously
distributed. So I'm showing you sequences

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:47.530
from chromosome seven, eight and nine. So
the blue ticks represent places where we

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.730
find Neandertal sequence in European
individuals. The red lines indicate places

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.980
where we find Neandertal sequence in East
Asian individuals. And the grey lines

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.660
represent parts of the genome that are too
repetitive for us to study and be

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.140
confident in the predictions from. And so,
if you squint long enough at this figure,

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:12.410
you can see that it doesn't appear, and
Sriram mentioned this earlier, that

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.730
patterns of surviving sequence are sort of
randomly distributed across the

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.530
chromosomes. But you find these regions
that have been called deserts or

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:27.360
depletions of archaic ancestry that extend
over really large genomic regions. And

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.370
this is consistent with there being
deleterious consequences to having

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:36.940
Neandertal sequence in these regions. And
in fact, when we do extensive simulations

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:44.520
and try to model this process, we see that
there is an excess in the observed data of

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.640
these depletions or archaic deserts
compared to simulated data under neutral

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.090
models of evolution. So what does that
mean? It just means basically that under

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.890
neutral evolution, so where there's no
fitness consequences to the Neandertal

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.580
sequence, we really wouldn't expect to see
deserts this large in the real data. So I

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.670
think this is pretty compelling evidence
that there was deleterious fitness

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:14.000
consequences to hybridization and what's
really kind of fascinating to me is that

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.040
if you also superimpose Denisovan
sequences on top of this data, you find

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:27.270
that there's a significant overlap between
Neandertal deserts and Denisovan deserts.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:32.660
So the same places in the human genome
that are depleted of Neandertal sequences

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.810
are also depleted of Denisovan sequences.
And again, this is very consistent with

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:44.060
the idea that these regions maybe are
harboring genetic changes that are very

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:49.880
important to modern human phenotypes. So
for example, the largest region, or the

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:57.360
largest depletion, is on chromosome seven.
It's about a 15 megabase desert. So

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.320
there's lots of genes. One of the
challenges in interpreting these regions

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.130
is that in a 15 megabase sequence, there's
about 100 genes or so. So you don't

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.720
actually know which one is driving the
signal that you're interested in. But one

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.800
thing that caught our eye, and as Sriram
mentioned this morning, is right in the

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:21.660
middle of this largest desert is a gene
called FOXP2. And FOXP2 has previously

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:27.210
been associated with being important in
speech and language. And in fact, work

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.650
from Svante's group has shown that there's
human-specific mutations in regulatory

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:39.070
regions of FOXP2. So again, I want to be
careful here and we haven't proven that

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:44.280
FOXP2 is driving this depletion of
Neandertal sequence in this region, but

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:51.220
it's really interesting and I think these
deserts of archaic ancestry can help us

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.690
pinpoint places in the human genome that
might be important in modern human

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:01.340
evolution. So the search space is much
narrower now compared to when we first did

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:07.480
these studies. Another question that we
were interested in asking is, well so it

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.910
seems like there were some deleterious
consequences to hybridization, was there

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:17.020
also evidence that maybe some of the
sequences we picked up from Neandertals or

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.280
Denisovans, was that beneficial? And
probably the simplest way to look at this

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:27.980
question is to look at the frequency of
Neandertal or Denisovan sequences in

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:33.470
modern populations. And that's what I'm
showing you here, so each dot represents a

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:40.360
frequency of either a Neandertal or a
Denisovan haplotype in East Asians,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.180
Europeans, Melanesians and South Asians.
And you can see that for the most part,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.260
the vast majority of archaic sequence that
persists in modern human populations is

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:56.740
pretty rare. So usually less than 10%
frequency. But there's a number of regions

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:02.720
that have risen to high frequency, to 60%
in some cases, and some cases even a

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.010
little bit higher. And we've done
extensive modeling, again, to try to

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:13.330
determine how likely it is to see these
high frequency haplotypes in the absence

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:19.850
of selection. And it turns out that above
50% or so, it's actually really unusual

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:26.100
for a haplotype to randomly drift up to
such high frequencies. So there's about

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:33.590
100 or so, I think, really high confident
targets of adaptive introgression. And you

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:39.880
might wonder, "So what phenotypes were
influenced by adaptive introgression?" And

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:47.840
so, we knew previously that a version of a
gene called EPAS1 in certain Tibetan

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.370
populations was inherited from Denisovans
and it's this gene that allows them to

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:59.190
live at high altitude. So there was
already some pretty good a priori evidence

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:07.110
that admixture with archaic humans was
beneficial for some genes. And when we

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:12.000
look carefully at these 100 high frequency
archaic haplotypes, we see that they are

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.410
largely comprised of genes that can be
categorized into two classes. One, the

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:24.640
immune system. So many genes that
influence immune phenotypes. And in

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.760
particular, innate immunity. So the part
of our immune system that deals with

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:36.240
viruses and bacteria. So that seems to be
a very enriched target or substrate of

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.500
adaptive introgression. And I think you
could have predicted this a priori so it's

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.760
known that the immune system is often a
target of selection. But the other

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.390
category of genes that actually I would
have never predicted a priori turns out to

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:57.280
be a number of genes that have important
functions in skin biology. So for example,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:05.030
one of these genes, as Sriram mentioned,
is BNC2. It's a gene called Basonuclin2

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:12.870
that has recently been shown to influence
skin pigmentation levels in Europeans. So

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.980
it's a very high frequency. Each row here
again is an individual and columns are

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:23.080
variant sites. And these individuals carry
the Neandertal haplotype. And you can see

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.820
that it's a very high frequency haplotype
in Europeans not found in East Asians. And

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:34.040
finally and real quickly, I'm just going
to give you a brief synopsis on the things

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.920
we can learn about demographic models. And
whenever I think of demographic models,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.600
this image from National Geographic comes
to mind. I think it's sort of a

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.140
fascinating picture actually. My kids
really like this, too, because they say I

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:58.780
look like him, but that's a different
story. And so, what are the things that we

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.450
can try to learn? Well, we want to know
things like when did hybridization happen?

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.340
How many times did it happen? Did
different populations have the same or

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.920
different admixture histories? Now I have
a post-doc, Joshua Schreiber, who

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:17.880
developed a really clever method of trying
to infer whether two populations had the

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.310
same admixture history or different
admixture histories. And so, when we apply

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:27.890
this method to pairs of populations that
we analyzed, the details here aren't

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:33.730
important, but we can infer sort of this
general picture of... So this is

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:39.470
Europeans, East Asians, Melanesians,
Africans, Neandertals and Denisovans. And

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.850
the main point I want to impress upon you
is that maybe even compared to as recently

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.900
as a few years ago, it seems like the
admixture history between modern and

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:53.500
archaic humans is much more complex. And
in fact, the data is consistent with

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.670
multiple pulses of admixture between
Neandertals and modern humans. And at

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:04.470
least one pulse of admixture with
Denisovans. So in conclusion, I've shown

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.660
you that substantial amounts of the
Neandertal and Denisovan genome remain

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.790
scattered in the DNA of modern humans,
that there were fitness consequences to

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.830
hybridization, both good and bad, and that
the history of contact was much more

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:25.380
complex than previously thought. And I
would like to thank people in my lab. So

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.890
this guy right here in the middle is
Benjamin Vernot. He was a graduate student

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:34.010
who is now a post-doc with Svante Pääbo,
but he by and large did most of the work

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.861
that I talked about today. So with that, I
will thank you and I guess answer

00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:41.679
questions after everyone's done.
