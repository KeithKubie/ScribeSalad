00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to Unit 2.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Today we talk about the most important aspect of any statistics person.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I want to quiz you what it is, knowing that you can't know it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But I want you to ask you first before I tell you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What is the most important thing a statistics person does?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Look at data? Program computers?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Run statistics of the type we'll discuss in the future obviously? Or eat tons of pizza?

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Just check one of those boxes.
