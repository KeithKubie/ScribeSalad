00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.860
in the United States we make just over

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870
in the United States we make just over
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.160
in the United States we make just over
half of our electricity from coal and in

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
half of our electricity from coal and in
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.610
half of our electricity from coal and in
most of the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620
most of the
 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.650
most of the
traction is at least that high in places

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660
traction is at least that high in places
 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.530
traction is at least that high in places
like China it's even higher and so it's

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540
like China it's even higher and so it's
 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.690
like China it's even higher and so it's
not realistic to think that over the

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700
not realistic to think that over the
 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.490
not realistic to think that over the
next few decades we're going to be able

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500
next few decades we're going to be able
 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.100
next few decades we're going to be able
to dramatically reduce our emissions of

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110
to dramatically reduce our emissions of
 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.830
to dramatically reduce our emissions of
carbon dioxide without continuing to use

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840
carbon dioxide without continuing to use
 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.220
carbon dioxide without continuing to use
make some use of coal in this department

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230
make some use of coal in this department
 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.790
make some use of coal in this department
a number of folks have been working over

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800
a number of folks have been working over
 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.290
a number of folks have been working over
the years on strategies to reduce and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300
the years on strategies to reduce and
 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.840
the years on strategies to reduce and
ultimately eliminate the emissions of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850
ultimately eliminate the emissions of
 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.930
ultimately eliminate the emissions of
carbon dioxide that come from burning

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940
carbon dioxide that come from burning
 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.119
carbon dioxide that come from burning
coal hopefully the work we're now doing

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129
coal hopefully the work we're now doing
 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.520
coal hopefully the work we're now doing
will point the way over the next decade

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530
will point the way over the next decade
 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.099
will point the way over the next decade
or two both in terms of technology but

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109
or two both in terms of technology but
 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.759
or two both in terms of technology but
also in terms of regulatory strategy to

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769
also in terms of regulatory strategy to
 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.430
also in terms of regulatory strategy to
figuring out how to begin to decarbonize

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440
figuring out how to begin to decarbonize
 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.750
figuring out how to begin to decarbonize
the electricity system and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
the electricity system and
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.970
