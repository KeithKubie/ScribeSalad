00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:01.457
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.457 --> 00:00:02.814
So today I'd like to talk to you

00:00:02.814 --> 00:00:06.467
about the idea of concrete
and abstract nouns,

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:07.408
and before we do that,

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:11.390
I'd like to get into some
word origins or etymology.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.873
So let's take each of these words in turn,

00:00:13.873 --> 00:00:17.427
because I think by digging
into what these words mean,

00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:19.227
literally what they mean
and where they come from,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.873
we'll get a better
understanding of this concept.

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:24.136
So both of these words
come to us from Latin.

00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:26.691
Concrete comes to us
from the Latin concretus,

00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:29.105
which means to grow together.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:33.302
So this part of it means grown.

00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:36.136
And this part means together.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.351
It refers to something that, you know,

00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.555
has grown together and become thick

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:43.456
and kind of hard to get
through and physical.

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:46.474
The connotation here is that
this is a physical thing.

00:00:46.474 --> 00:00:50.773
Something that is concrete is physical.

00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:55.773
Abstract, on the other hand,
means to draw something away.

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:05.112
So something that is abstract
is drawn away from the real,

00:01:05.112 --> 00:01:07.098
from the concrete, from the physical.

00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:09.498
So this is not physical.

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:15.773
And we make this distinction in English

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.846
when we're talking about nouns.

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:19.197
Is it something that is concrete,

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:21.449
is it something you can look at or pick up

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:24.793
or smell or sense or
something that is abstract,

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.569
something that isn't physical,

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.530
but can still be talked about.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.222
So for example, the word sadness...

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.577
Is a noun, right?

00:01:36.577 --> 00:01:37.557
This is definitely a noun.

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:40.333
It's got this noun-making ending,

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.934
this noun-forming suffix, ness.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.858
You know, we take the adjective sad

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:50.235
and we toss this ness part
onto it, we've got a noun.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.452
But can you see sadness?

00:01:52.452 --> 00:01:53.696
Is it something you can pick up?

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.574
Sure, you can tell by being, you know

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:59.581
observant and empathetic
that your friend is sad,

00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:02.554
but it's not something you can pick up.

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.858
You can't be like a
measurable degree of sad.

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:08.936
You couldn't take someone's sadness,

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:10.434
put it under a microscope and say

00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:14.370
"Oh, Roberta, you are
32 degrees microsad."

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.795
You know, it's not something physical.

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.653
Concrete things, on the other hand,

00:02:18.653 --> 00:02:22.751
are things that we can
see or count or measure.

00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:24.528
Just parts of the physical world.

00:02:24.528 --> 00:02:28.509
So anything you look at,
like a dog is concrete,

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:33.509
a ball is concrete, a cliff is concrete.

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:36.398
Happiness...

00:02:38.087 --> 00:02:39.045
Is abstract.

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:40.862
The idea of freedom...

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.210
Is abstract.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.134
Though the presence of
freedom in your life

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:49.888
may manifest in physical objects, like

00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:52.848
"Oh, my parents let me have
the freedom to eat ice cream."

00:02:52.848 --> 00:02:57.525
Ice cream is, you know, a concrete noun.

00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:59.894
But freedom, the thing
that allows you, you know,

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:03.004
the permission that you get from

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:07.400
your parents to have ice cream.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.178
That's not a physical object.

00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:11.699
So that's basically the difference.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.753
So a concrete noun is a physical object

00:03:14.753 --> 00:03:16.900
and an abstract noun is not.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.088
This is why I really wanted to hit

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:23.088
the idea that a noun can be a
person, place, thing or idea,

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:25.973
because nouns can be ideas,

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:28.316
and those ideas tend to be abstract.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:32.576
Sadness, happiness, freedom,
permission, liberty, injustice.

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:37.510
All of these are abstract ideas.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.995
That's the difference.

00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:40.516
You can learn anything.

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:41.777
David out.
