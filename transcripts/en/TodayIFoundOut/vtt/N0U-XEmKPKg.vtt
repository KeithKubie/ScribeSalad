00:00:08.219 --> 00:01:33.390
In 1793, noted French scientist Joseph Dombey
departed Le Havre, France bound for Philadelphia.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.270
His mission was to meet with Thomas Jefferson
and give him two of the rarest items on Earth.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.040
Unfortunately for Dombey, fate had other intentions
and storms pushed the ship he was aboard well

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
of course.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.860
And so it was that around the time he was
supposed to deliver his precious cargo to

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.240
Jefferson, he found himself instead at the
mercy of British pirates.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.990
Being French in this situation wasn’t exactly
ideal, so at first he attempted to pass himself

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.900
off as Spanish, but his accent gave him away.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.670
Dombey was eventually taken to the small Caribbean
island of Montserrat where he ultimately died

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.770
before he could be ransomed.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.819
So what was the precious cargo he was to have
delivered as a gift to the United States?

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.700
Two small copper items (of which only six
sets existed on Earth at the time)- standards

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.880
representing a meter and a grave, the latter
better known today as a kilogram.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.550
At the time, the United States, having already
become one of the first nations in the world

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.310
to adopt a decimal, base ten system for currency
was strongly considering doing the same with

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780
the system of weights and measures to get
rid of the hodgepodge of British weights and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.120
measures system mixed with others also commonly
used throughout the young nation.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.120
Thus, with the initial strong support of then
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, and thanks

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.310
to a desire to continue to strengthen ties
between France and the United States, adoption

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.730
of the new French metric system seemed close
at hand.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.510
Along with a trade agreement concerning grain
export to France, Dombey was to deliver the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.940
meter and grave standards and attempt to argue
the system’s merits to Congress who, at

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.650
the time, were quite open to adopting these
units of measure.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.050
Of course we all know how this turned out-
Dombey never got a chance to make his arguments

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.040
and thanks to concerns about whether the metric
system would even stick around at all in France,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.510
combined with the fact that trade between
Britain and the U.S. would be hindered by

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.349
such a change, the U.S. eventually decided
to abandon efforts to adopt the metric system

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.430
and mostly stuck with the British system,
though the U.S. Customary Units and what would

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.270
become the Imperial System would soon diverge
in the following decades.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.959
But as more and more nations came to adopt
this new system of weights and measures, the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.980
U.S. slowly began to follow suit.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.980
Fast-forwarding to 1866 and with the Metric
Act the U.S. officially sanctioned the use

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.690
of the metric system “in all contracts,
dealings or court proceedings” and provided

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.570
each state with standard metric weights and
measures.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.500
In 1875, the United States was one of just
17 nations to sign the “Treaty of the Metre”

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.019
establishing, among other things, the International
Bureau of Weights and Measure to govern this

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.019
system.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.989
Fast forward a little under a century later
and the full switch seemed inevitable in the

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.930
United States after the 1968 Metric Study
Act.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.600
This ended up being a three year study looking
at the feasibility of switching the United

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.030
States to the metric system.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.190
The result?

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.269
a report titled A Metric America: “A Decision
Whose Time Has Come” recommending the change

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.169
and that it could be reasonably done in as
little as 10 years.

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.250
Unfortunately, the public was largely either
apathetic or strongly opposed to making the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.250
switch.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.290
(According to a Gallup poll at the time, 45%
were against it.)

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.310
This was nothing new, however.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.150
A huge percentage of the time a given people
of a nation have been asked by their government

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.710
to switch to the International System of Units,
the general public of those nations were largely

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.800
against it, even France itself, who went back
and forth for decades on the issue, contributing

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.650
to the United States’ hesitation to adopt
it in the early going.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.830
Brazil actually experienced a genuine uprising
when the government forced the change in the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.930
late 19th century.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.419
Over a half century later, British citizens
still stubbornly cling to many of the old

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.280
measurements in their day to day lives, though
have otherwise adopted SI units.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.740
So why did all these governments frequently
go against the will of their people?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.470
Arguments for the economic benefits simply
won out- as in so many matters of government,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.419
what businesses want, businesses often get.

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.949
So the governments ignored the will of the
general public and did it anyway.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.150
But in the U.S. the situation was different.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.639
Not having the pressure from being bordered
and economically as bound to one’s neighbors

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.139
as in Europe, and being one of the world’s
foremost economic powerhouses itself, the

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.360
immediately economic benefit didn’t seem
so clear.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.960
For example, California alone- one of 50 states-
if it were its own nation would have the 5th

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.350
largest economy in the world.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.710
Texas and New York state aren’t far behind
when compared to nation’s of the worlds

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.009
economies at 10th and 13th respectively, let
alone the other 47 states.

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.259
Seeing lesser readily apparent economic benefit,
and not having the same geographic pressures

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:03.350
as in Europe, in the 1970s many big businesses
and unions were in strong opposition to the

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.860
change, citing the cost of making the switch
and, on the latter side, unions worried that

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.600
such a change would make it easier to move
jobs that formerly used customary units oversees,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.390
given that now such product could more easily
be purchased from abroad.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.389
Swayed, when the 1975 Metric Conversion Act
was signed by President Gerald Ford, it had

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.830
largely lost its teeth.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.410
While it did establish a board whose job it
was to facilitate the nation’s conversion

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.160
and put forth various recommendations, the
act did not have an official timeline and

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.590
made the switch voluntary.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.300
Nevertheless, contrary to popular belief,
in the decades since, the United States actually

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.410
has largely switched to the metric system,
just the general public (both domestic and

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.949
international) seem largely ignorant of this.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.270
The U.S. military almost exclusively uses
the metric system.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.320
Since the early 1990s, the Federal government
has largely been converted, and the majority

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.550
of big businesses have made the switch in
one form or another wherever possible.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.780
In fact, with the passage of the Metric Conversion
Act of 1988, the metric system became the

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.800
“preferred system of weights and measures
for United States trade and commerce”.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.380
In the medical field and pharmaceuticals.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.630
the metric system is also used almost exclusively.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.630
In fact, since the Mendenhall Order of 1893,
even the units of measure used by the layperson

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:18.360
in the U.S., the yard, foot, inch, and pound,
have all been officially defined by the meter

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.570
and kilogram.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.660
Speaking of the general public side, nobody
in the U.S. blinks an eye about food labels

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.910
containing both metric and customary units
(required thanks to the Fair Packaging and

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.990
Labeling Act, with the majority of states
since also allowing metric only).

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.449
The gram is commonly used to measure everything
from the amount of flour to add in a recipe

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:41.169
to how much marijuana one buys from a shop
or, where it’s still illegal, their local

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.169
dealer.

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:46.020
And if you were to ask someone to pick up
a two liter of Dr. Pepper or how a person

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.430
did running a 10K, most everyone in the United
States would know exactly what you are talking

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.430
about.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.870
Beyond this, you’d be hard pressed to find
a ruler in the United States that doesn’t

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.200
include both inches and centimeters and their
common divisors.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.300
Further, in school, both customary units and
the metric system are taught.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.639
Yes, while Americans may generally have little
practical need to learn a second language,

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:10.819
most are, at least for a time, reasonably
fluent in two very different systems of measurement.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:15.020
As with languages unpracticed, however, once
out of school, many lose their sense of the

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.830
latter from lack of use and concrete perspective.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.870
It’s one thing to know what 100 and 0 degrees
Celsius refers to with respect to water, it’s

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.090
a whole different matter to “get” what
temperature you might want to put on a jacket

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.090
for.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.030
However, students who go on to more advanced
science classes quickly pick up this perspective

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.000
as they become more familiar and, thus, the
scientists of America aren’t at the slightest

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
disadvantage here, also contrary to what is
often stated in arguments as to why the U.S.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
should make the switch a bit more official
than it already is.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.199
All students that go along that path become
just as familiar as their European brethren,

00:08:40.199 --> 00:08:41.809
if a little later in life.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.030
This all brings us around to why the United
States hasn’t made the switch to the metric

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.480
system more official than it already is.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.690
Primarily three reasons- cost, human psychology,
and, at least on the general public side,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.510
little readily apparent practical reason to
do so.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.470
As to cost, while there has never been a definitive
study showing how much it would cost the United

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.319
States to make the switch official and universal,
general estimates range even upwards of a

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:06.610
trillion dollars all things considered.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.720
Why so high?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.629
To begin with, we’ll discuss a relatively
small example in road signs.

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:16.920
Installing street signs is an incredibly expensive
affair in many places for a variety of reasons.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.129
For instance, in 2011 the Washington State
Department of Transportation claimed it costs

00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:29.750
anywhere from $30,000 to $75,000 PER SIGN,
though they later clarified those were worst

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:35.069
case and most expensive scenarios and sometimes
the signs and installation can ring in ONLY

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:36.820
around $10,000.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.459
Bronlea Mishler of the DOT explains,

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:42.959
Installing a sign along a highway isn’t
quite as simple as pounding some posts into

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:47.269
a ground and bolting on a sign — that’s
why the cost is so variable.

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:49.319
There are two ways to replace a sign.

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:53.649
One way allows us to install it under old
rules; the second way requires us to follow

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:55.019
new federal standards…

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:58.560
The old rules apply if we are just fixing
something, not building something new.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.810
Installing a sign alongside the road counts
as fixing something — basically, just giving

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.160
drivers more information.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.810
If we install a sign on the side of the road,
it would cost: $2,000 to make the sign, buy

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:12.059
the beams and rivets; $8,000 for two steel
posts and concrete; $5,000 to clear brush

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:16.540
and other landscape work before and after
installation; $15,000 for maintenance crews

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.779
to set up traffic cones, work vehicles, program
highway signs and spend the evening doing

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:21.779
the work.

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:23.129
Total: $30,000….

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:26.410
The new rules apply if we’re doing a new
construction project.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.279
Costs would be higher because we would have
to bring everything up to the current highway

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:31.279
code.

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:34.529
These often involve putting up a sign bridge,
a steel structure that spans the entire freeway

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:36.129
to hold up multiple signs.

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:40.470
Typical costs include: $2,600 to make the
sign, buy the beams and rivets because the

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.540
sign must be bigger; $75,000 for the sign
bridge.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.989
Total: $77,600.

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:52.079
WSDOT Deputy Regional Administrator Bill Vleck
also stated, beyond many of these signs needing

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:56.980
to be special ordered on a 1-off variety (think
a highway sign with city name and distance

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:02.069
marker) and often being much larger than most
sign makers make, drastically increasing cost,

00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:06.759
some of the seemingly exorbitant costs are
due to special features of the signs few know

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:07.759
about.

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:10.890
For instance, Vleck states, “If there’s
an auto accident, if a car hits that sign

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.910
post and there’s any kind of injury involved,
the state is going to be liable, so we’re

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.540
looking potentially at a multi-million dollar
settlement in those kind of situations…

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.680
[So] it would have to be a breakaway type
sign post, and it has to be specially fabricated

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.670
so that if a car hits that sign, it reacts
appropriately and doesn’t come down and

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.519
basically take out the occupants.”

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:34.470
For your reference here, in 1995, it was estimated
that approximately 6 million signs would need

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:35.920
changed on federal and state roads.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.990
On top of that, it was noted that approximately
just shy of 3 million of the nations about

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:47.119
4.2 million miles (6.8 million km) of public
roads are actual local, with an uncertain

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:50.600
number of signs in those regions that would
need changed.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.690
That said, the rather obscene costs quoted
by the aforementioned Washington State DOT

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.249
would likely be grossly overestimated on a
project such as this, with prices massively

00:11:59.249 --> 00:12:03.949
reduced if special laws were passed to remove
much of the red tape, and given the extreme

00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:07.879
bulk orders that would be called for here,
including for the signs themselves and contracts

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:10.910
to dedicated crews to make this happen as
fast as possible.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.589
For example, in 1995, Alabama estimated they
could swap out all the signs on federal highways

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:21.269
for a mere $70 per sign ($120 today) on average.

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:24.869
Perhaps a better rubric would be in looking
at Canada’s switch, swapping out around

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:30.589
a quarter of a million signs on their then
300,000 miles (482,000 km) or so of road.

00:12:30.589 --> 00:12:32.059
The total reported cost?

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:38.759
Only a little over $13 million (about $61
million today) or around $244 per sign in

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:39.889
today’s dollars.

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:44.920
Extrapolating that out to the minimum 6 million
signs would then run approximately $1.5 billion

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.610
+ whatever additional signs need swapped out
on the 3/4 of the rest of the roads not accounted

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.709
for in that 6 million sign estimate.

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:56.529
Not an insignificant sum, but also relatively
trivial for the U.S. taxpayer to cover at

00:12:56.529 --> 00:13:02.279
about $5 per person + some uncertain amount
for the local road signs that need changed.

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:06.040
Moving on to far greater expenses- industry
and wider infrastructure.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.489
While it’s impossible to accurately estimate
the cost of such a change to American businesses

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:14.690
as a whole, we do get a small glimpse of the
issue when looking at a NASA report studying

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.009
the feasibility of swapping the shuttle program
to full metric.

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:23.559
They determined the price tag would be a whopping
$370 million for that project alone at the

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:27.879
time, so decided it wasn’t worth the cost
for little practical benefit…

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:31.819
Now extrapolate that out to the approximately
28 million businesses in the United States,

00:13:31.819 --> 00:13:37.430
their software, their records, their labels,
machinery, employee training, etc. needing

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.889
switched like some sort of Y2K event on steroids.

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:44.809
Thus, while it’s impossible to know for
sure, many posit the cost could swell into

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:49.480
the hundreds of billions of dollars, if not
even creep into the trillion territory- in

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.480
theory at least.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.600
At this point, even the most ardent supporter
of the metric system in the United States

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.379
may be rethinking whether it would be worth
it to make the switch more official than it

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:58.379
already is.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.769
But don’t fret metric supporters the world
over!

00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:03.819
To begin with, the raw cost of making the
switch doesn’t actually tell the whole story

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:04.819
here.

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:07.959
In fact, it tells a false story- while the
gross total of making the change would be

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:12.252
astronomical, it turns out the net cost likely
wouldn’t be much, or anything at all.

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:16.160
You see, beyond it noted that, for example,
on average Australian businesses saw a 9-14%

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.689
boost directly attributed to the switch when
they made it, back in the United States when

00:14:20.689 --> 00:14:25.600
companies like IBM, GM, Ford and others spent
the money to make the change, they universally

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.050
found that they made a profit from doing this.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.829
This was largely from being able to reduce
warehouse space, equipment needs, streamline

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:35.970
production, lower necessary inventories, as
well as taking the opportunity to, at the

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.959
same time, remove inefficiencies that had
crept into their respective businesses with

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.369
regard to these systems.

00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:46.069
They were also able to more uniformly manage
their businesses abroad and domestic to the

00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:47.629
same standards and systems.

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:51.989
As a very small example, GM reported they
were able to reduce its number of fan belts

00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:57.399
they had to manufacture and stock from about
900 sizes to 100 thanks to everything that

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:58.459
went into the switch.

00:14:58.459 --> 00:15:02.490
In some cases the businesses also noted new
international markets opening up, both in

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:07.649
sales and ability to more easily, and often
more cheaply, acquire product abroad.

00:15:07.649 --> 00:15:11.480
All of this resulted in a net profit extremely
quickly from investing the money into making

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480
the switch.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.730
As you might expect from these types of benefits,
an estimated 30% of businesses in the United

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.389
States have largely already switched to metric.

00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:23.041
Granted, these are generally larger companies
and various small businesses dealing mostly

00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:25.189
locally might not see such a benefit.

00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:28.869
However, with the increasing globalization
of supply chains, many small businesses would

00:15:28.869 --> 00:15:30.939
likely still see some benefit.

00:15:30.939 --> 00:15:34.639
Unfortunately, particularly when it comes
to construction, that general industry has

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:38.720
lagged well behind others in switching, and,
as you might imagine, the existing infrastructure

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.839
of the nation from roads to bridges to homes
to drill bits to screws to the architectural

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:48.689
plans for all of it being based on customary
units would not be cheap to change and it

00:15:48.689 --> 00:15:50.809
isn’t clear here what the net cost would
be.

00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:54.959
However, as in all of this, the cost could
potentially be mitigated via a slow phaseout

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:59.000
approach with grandfathering allowed, similar
to what other nations did, though in most

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.009
cases on a vastly smaller scale than would
be seen in the United States.

00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:06.540
All this said, we here at TodayIFoundOut would
like to posit that what the international

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.350
community actually finds irksome about the
United States not using the metric system

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:16.079
is not United States businesses who deal abroad
or United States scientists or even the government-

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:20.040
all of which largely use the metric system
and all of which have little bearing on what

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.410
Pierre sitting in his mother’s basement
in France is doing at a given moment.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.730
No, what upsets Pierre is that the U.S. general
populace does not use the metric system in

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.160
their day to day lives.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.519
Why is this irksome?

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:34.439
Beyond just the human drive for uniformity
amongst one’s community, in this case of

00:16:34.439 --> 00:16:39.329
the global variety, because English websites
the world over, keen to get some of those

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:44.149
sweet, sweet U.S. advertising dollars, cater
to the U.S. audience and use the units that

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:49.339
said audience is more familiar with, those
not familiar are often left to Google a conversion

00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:51.100
to the units they are familiar with.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.619
The alternative is for said websites to include
both, but that often makes for a break in

00:16:55.619 --> 00:17:00.060
the flow of the content, something we here
at TodayIFoundOut regularly wrestle with finding

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.379
a proper balance with.

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:04.189
This brings us around to the human side of
the argument.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:07.990
To begin with, while the United States would
unequivocally see many benefits to joining

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:12.000
the rest of the world in some good old fashioned
metric lovin’, as you might expect given

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.500
the lack of immediately obvious benefit to
the layperson, few among the American public

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.709
see much point.

00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:21.850
After all, what does it really matter if a
road sign is in kilometers or miles, or if

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.919
one’s house is measured in square feet or
square meters?

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:29.550
While some cite the benefits of ease of conversion
to other units in a given system, in day to

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.240
day life, this is almost never a thing that’s
cumbersome in the slightest.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.260
If it was, Americans would be clamoring to
make the change.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.590
The argument that ease of conversion between
units should be a primary driver for the public

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:45.540
to want the change simply doesn’t hold water
in an era where, on the extremely rare occasion

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.010
people actually need to make such a precise
conversion in day to day life, they have little

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.410
more than to say “Hey Google”.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:57.110
And in most cases, even that isn’t necessary
when you’re reasonably familiar with a given

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.110
system.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.260
Perhaps a poignant example of how, when you’re
familiar, a non base 10 system of measure

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.260
really isn’t that complicated to deal with
in day to day matters, consider that the world

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.320
still uses 1000 milliseconds in a second,
60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.820
and 24 hours in a day.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.169
What few realize about this is that the original
metric system actually attempted to simplify

00:18:16.169 --> 00:18:20.639
this as well, dividing the day into 10 hours,
with 100 minutes in each hour, etc.

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:23.850
Unfortunately, most people didn’t see the
benefit in switching when also factoring in

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.460
having to swap out their existing clocks.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.850
Nobody has much seen a need to fix the issue
since, not even the most ardent champion of

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:35.169
the metric system for its ease of conversions
compared with imperial or customary units.

00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:38.889
And while you might still be lamenting the
stubbornness of Americans for not seeing the

00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:42.720
genuine benefits to themselves that would
likely be realized here, we should point out

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.210
that virtually every nation in the world that
uses the metric system has holdover units

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:52.110
still relatively commonly used among laypeople
that aren’t metric, for simple reasons of

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.900
not seeing a reason to stop, from calories
to horsepower to knots to lightyears and many

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.900
more.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.190
Or how about, have you ever flown on a plane
almost anywhere in the world?

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:04.179
Congratulations, you’ve in all liklehood
unwittingly been supporting the use of something

00:19:04.179 --> 00:19:05.179
other than the metric system.

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:09.919
You see, the pilots aboard, from French to
American, use a feet based, Flight Level,

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:12.790
system for their altitude, and knots to measure
their speed.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.200
Just two standards that, much like the American
public and their road signs, nobody has seen

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.039
much practical reason to change.

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:22.440
Now to more concrete human psychology for
not making the switch, which has gradually

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.490
been converting more and more Americans from
general apathy to the anti-switch crowd as

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.000
the decades pass- when one group of humans
tells another group what to do, occasionally

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.690
using terms like “idiot units” and starting
flame wars in comments of every website or

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.440
video posted on the web that uses or discusses
said units- you will universally get resistance

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.929
if not outright hostility in response.

00:19:41.929 --> 00:19:46.559
This is not an American thing, as so often
is purported- this is a human thing.

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:50.450
Try forcing the French government to mandate
by law that French is dead and English is

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.240
now to be universal spoken for the sake of
better international trade, economics, and

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240
relations.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.650
You might argue that in a not insignificant
percentage of the world English is already

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:06.389
the standard in such international business
dealings, but that is really little different

00:20:06.389 --> 00:20:10.150
than the current situation in business in
the U.S. concerning the metric system.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.840
What we’re talking about is how the general
populace of France would react if the government

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.029
mandated such a change, and even more so if
outside nations were pressuring it.

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:20.559
Again, it’s not an American thing- it’s
a human thing.

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:25.380
Beyond that, as anyone whose ever done anything
online is well aware of- humans hate change.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.940
Loathe it.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.769
Make any change to, say, a format or style
of video, no matter how small, and rest assured

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:37.120
no matter if the change is unequivocally vastly
superior and the audience universally comes

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.779
to agree with that, a not insignificant number
of one’s audience will complain, sometimes

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:42.809
vehemently, at first.

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:46.519
More directly we see this again and again
throughout the history of various nations

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:48.360
making the change to SI.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.559
Again, resistance of change is not an American
thing- it’s a human thing.

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.669
But fret not world.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:57.440
You see, slowly but surely the United States
has been converting to metric and, for most

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.320
practical purposes for those outside of the
United States, other than having to see it

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.279
on websites (which, again, we posit is the
real driver of people’s ire the world over),

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:07.909
the switch has already been made.

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:12.100
So much so that at this stage while the cars
made in America may say miles per hour on

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.340
the speedometer, the makers of those cars
are using metric to measure and build the

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.340
things.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.399
The very military that defends American’s
right to use “Freedom Units” has long

00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:23.799
since largely converted to the un-free variety.

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:27.799
In the end, money talks, and, for much the
same reason other big holdouts like the UK

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:32.309
ultimately gave in, as American businesses
who have interest in dealing internationally

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:36.250
continue to make the switch, they are seeing
to it that the metric system more and more

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.710
creeps into the daily lives of Americans.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.390
This will only continue until the inevitable
complete adoption.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:47.169
Slowly but surely America is inching towards
metric, largely without anyone domestic or

00:21:47.169 --> 00:21:48.169
abroad noticing.

00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:50.100
Want to make the switch take longer?

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.820
Continue calling them “idiot units”, a
mildly humorous statement from a certain point

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.950
of view given that it takes more brainpower
to use customary units than metric, making

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.080
the latter far more tailored to idiots.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.169
And continue to start flame wars in comments
comprising mostly of personal attacks rather

00:22:04.169 --> 00:22:08.300
than using the many and very legitimate and
rational arguments that exist as to why it

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.850
would be of benefit for the people of the
United States to make the switch.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.240
In the end, we all know there is no better
way to convince someone to do something than

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:28.669
making the whole thing a religious war, with
you on one side and they on the other…
