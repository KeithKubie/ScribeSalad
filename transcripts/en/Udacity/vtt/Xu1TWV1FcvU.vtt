Congratulations, you made your
first step towards a path

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.820
in front end programming.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.650
Front end developers use
the Javascript programming language

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.380
to create interactive
experiences on the web.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.280
In this course,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.410
you will learn the basics of Javascript
by creating an interactive resume.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.620
As you dive into the new
programming language,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.160
there may be times you
reach your strain zone.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.690
I encourage you to use
the Udacity forums for support.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.270
By the end of this course you
should have a better idea

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.560
of whether front end programming
is a right fit for you.
