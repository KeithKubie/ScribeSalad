00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.970
The third category of mistakes that I want to

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.970
mention is product-related mistakes. A

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.360
typical example of product-related mistake

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.010
is gold plating of requirements. And what that means is

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.710
basically is that it's very common for projects to have

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.230
more requirements than they actually need. For example, marketing might

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.090
want to add more features than the ones that are

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.460
actually needed by the users. And of course having more

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
requirements lengthens the project's schedule in a totally unnecessary way.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.250
Feature creep is another common mistake and consists in

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.140
adding more and more features to a product that were

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.650
not initially planned and are not really needed in most

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.360
cases. And here there is evidence that the average project

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.180
experiences about a 25% growth in the number of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.330
features over its lifetime which can clearly highly effect The

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.580
project schedule. Finally, if you're working on a project that

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.760
strains the limits of computer science. For example, because you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.350
need to develop new algorithms for the project, or you have

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.670
to use new techniques. Then that project might be more research than

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.450
actual development. And therefore, it

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.600
should be managed accordingly. For example,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.910
by taking into account that you will have a highly unpredictable schedule.
