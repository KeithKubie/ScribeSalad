00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.970
Yeah he’s sort of viewed as the founding
father of

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.029
physics basically, you can’t really get
a much bigger

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.919
deal than that for a physicist or an astronomer,
he really

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.550
was the man who invented the whole subject.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.600
He’s a big deal because he’s the first
person to actually

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.090
use mathematics and develop mathematics so
that you

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.380
could create a theory, work out the consequences
and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.349
compare with the experiment. So, for example,
his three

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.119
laws can be expressed mathematically, turned
into

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.509
equations and then you find out that the planets
go

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.569
round in ellipses with the sun at, one of
the focuses, foci

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:32.569
of the ellipse.

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:35.890
Sir Isaac Newton is thought to be one of the
greatest

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.420
scientists of all time, has contributed a
lot to the field.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.830
He developed calculus; he invented a reflecting
telescope that was made from a mirror instead

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.100
of a lens.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.360
He’s sometimes credited with having invented
the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.740
reflecting telescope, which isn’t true.
In fact, lots of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.740
people had sort of played around with them,
even

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.750
Galileo the first person to use one astronomically,
had

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.931
actually played around trying to make telescopes
out of

00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:01.140
mirrors. But Newton’s great genius is that
he actually

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.140
built a practical one, one that actually worked.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.540
What Newton did was incredible, and a lot
of the things

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.180
that he came up with are the basis of understanding.
For

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.960
example, when he was a student, there were
light

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.320
beams going through the shutters of his window
and he

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.080
put it into a prism and showed that light
split into a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.070
spectrum and as a result of that he could
explain why

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.790
rainbows came about. He was able to turn the
mathematics and do the experiments so as to

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.560
analyse
the natural world in a way nobody had done

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560
before.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.780
But he was a bit of a strange character; he
wasn’t an

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.840
extrovert; he didn’t really get along with
people very

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.840
well.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.260
I’ve read that he had a couple of nervous
breakdowns;

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.080
he was a very, very sensitive person. So when
the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.240
calculus, his mathematics came up, he and
Leibniz both

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.610
invented complementary aspects to it. And
they didn’t,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.910
he couldn’t see that Leibniz works on the
integral

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.460
calculus was complimentary to his work on
the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.490
differential calculus. He just wanted to rubbish
Leibniz

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.951
all his life and so it was as competition
and he was very

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.830
arrogant and aggressive about things like
that.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.700
Also with Robert Hook, who was a wonderful
experimentalist, and wrote the standard treatise

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.231
on
optics, he was an enemy as far as Newton was

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:18.140
concerned and he would try to do anything
to damage

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.750
Hook’s reputation. So he wouldn’t have
been a nice

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.800
colleague to have.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.620
One of the things that Newton is most famous
for is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.620
saying that, you know, if he’s seen further
than anyone

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.510
else it was only because he was ‘standing
on the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.030
shoulders of giants’ and this was always
viewed as a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.160
self-deprecating remark that he was showing
respect to

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.970
those who had come before him. More recently,
it has

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.430
been suggested, that he was actually just
having a go at

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.880
Hook who was famously very short. And so there
are

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.790
aspects of him that he was a little bit strange,
he was

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.210
not necessarily a particularly nice man, he
was

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.090
incredibly secretive, he would keep stuff
hidden away for

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.849
years and years just because he was afraid
that other

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:51.980
people were going to steal his ideas.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.760
But he was a scientist through and through
and he used

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.000
himself to experiment with a lot of different
projects, so

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.160
when he was working with lenses and mirrors
and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.080
optics, he actually wondered why our eyes
are such

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.569
sophisticated lenses and so he actually took
an ice pick

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.349
and kind of probed behind his eye to figure
out how it

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.260
worked so well. Kind of gross, I hate that
story.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.569
Isaac Newton’s a fascinating character because
he’s

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.040
famous for writing the Principia Mathematica,
which

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.280
certainly changed the face of physics. But
Newton wrote

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.819
more about theology and prophecy and alchemy
than he

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.709
ever did about science and mathematics. And
that’s the

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:37.709
extraordinary thing, and Newton had very,
very

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.069
eccentric theological views, views about Christianity.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.271
Isaac Newton also liked to look at the sun
to see how

00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:50.510
that affected your eyes. Of course as children
we all

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.349
hear ‘don’t look at the sun too long because
you’ll go

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.110
blind.’ Well he did actually look at the
sun for quite a

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.890
long time and then he remarked in his journal
that he

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.560
saw the image of the sun in his eye while
he was

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.860
sleeping, or while he was going to sleep even,
for about

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.840
three days. So it definitely does damage to
your eye,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
believe it.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.280
But Newton also rejected the traditional Christian
view

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.420
that God is not just an individual, that God
is a

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.239
community of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
and we call

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.979
that the Trinity: three persons in one God.
And Newton

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.229
rejected the view of the church that God is
Trinity. It’s

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.500
ironic because Newton was a fellow of Trinity
College,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.880
Cambridge, so in his very working environment
the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.490
institution that he worked for was dedicated
to a

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.150
doctrine, a teaching, in which he himself
did not believe.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.770
Well when I first came to Nottingham, I lived
way out in

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.110
Lincolnshire and somebody told us that his
house was at

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.160
Woolsthorpe, near Colsterworth, and we drove
out there

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.810
and I got the wrong Woolsthorpe, there are
two out

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.990
there. Eventually we found the right one and
in those

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.931
days, this is over thirty years ago, the house
was owned

00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:06.931
by somebody and you had to go at a certain
time and

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.199
she would open the door for you and you could
go round

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.220
and see all the traces he’d left behind
because he got

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.620
his compasses and he’d scratched pictures
of the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.360
Cathedral in Grantham on the wall. So I remember
that

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360
vividly.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.810
Gradually this aura came to settle around
Newton that

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.960
he was the holder of secrets and the Principia
was, as it

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.050
were, this was Newton’s scripture. And Newton
himself

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.851
fostered this, this reputation for being some
sort of

00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:51.790
prophet of God and he did write under some
pseudonyms, one of which was the pseudonym

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.300
IEHOUAS
SANCTUS UNUS, Jehovah the name of God, the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.850
Holy
One, which he believed was an anagram of the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.229
Latin
version of his own name, ISSAACHUS NEUUTONUS

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.150
 -
IEHOUAS SANCTUS UNUS.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.889
I thought a manor house would be a big Elizabethan
manor, but it’s actually a small pokey little

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.820
place, it’s not
much bigger than an ordinary semi. Only on

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.169
one floor,
or maybe two floors, it wasn’t that grand.

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.830
I mean think of the Da Vinci Code today and
Dan Brown,

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.350
I mean there is nothing new in all that, is
there

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.690
something we are not being told? It’s a
bit like a

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.350
conspiracy theory, and can we get underneath
it all? And

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.660
just as Newton thought he was trying to decode
the

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.130
Universe, the mind of God, by this mathematics,
so he

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.289
thought there were all other codes all over
the place,

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.180
including his own name and anagrams that needed
decoding to see what they revealed. So knowledge

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.250
had
to be prized, prized open to get the secrets

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.520
and only the
very clever, only the wise, could really find

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.690
out exactly
what was going on in the mind of God.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.419
He was, you know, he had all the trappings
of a genius

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.400
in the sense that as well as being incredibly
smart and

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.400
coming up with incredibly innovative ideas,
he also

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.300
clearly had his eccentricities as well.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.400
Would you give him a job here?

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.510
I think, hmm, that’s a good question, I
wonder how he

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.030
would succeed in, in academia today? I don’t
know is

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.130
the short answer. A lot of the things that
these

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.170
eccentricities the way he tended to rub people
up the

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.889
wrong way, the fact that he didn’t publish
things, he hid

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.330
them away for years at a time, you know in
academia

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.280
today, the way you succeed is by getting your
ideas out

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.210
there and by publishing things and showing,
you know,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.060
showing your, your peers your fellow scientists,
what

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.630
you are doing. And his approach to science
and keeping

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.820
stuff very much to himself and not wanting
to share with

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.259
people really wouldn’t work terribly well
in the way that

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:50.259
science works today.

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:52.940
He was really quite phenomenal in his prime
and later

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.750
on he dabbled in alchemy and all sorts of
things and got

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:03.080
into religious arguments. He was a very strange
and

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.080
complicated person. Not the sort that you
want to go

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080
down the pub with.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080
I’d go to the pub with him!

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.080
And then you’d start arguing in your Australian
way to

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.639
wind him up and see what you could get out
of him for a

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.639
video for Sixty Symbols.

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.669
If I could make a video of Isaac Newton, Roger,
I

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:17.540
wouldn’t be sitting here with you.
LAUGHS

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.410
Quite, quite!
