00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.181
To in contrast, switches perform some amount

00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:05.788
of traffic isolation so that the entire

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:09.069
LAN doesn't become one broadcast medium. But

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.882
instead, we can partition the LAN into separate

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:16.720
broadcast domains or collision domains. Now a

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.330
switch might break the subnet into multiple LAN

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.680
segments. Typically a frame that is bound for a host in the same part or

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.820
segment of the LAN is not forwarded to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.650
other segments. So, for example if we had a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.170
network with three hubs, all connected by a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.800
switch, then each of these would be its own

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.480
broadcast domain. And if a host here wanted

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.500
to send a frame to another destination in the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.320
same segment, well that frame would be broadcast within

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.050
that domain. But the switch would recognize that the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.290
destination was in the same segment. And would not for the packet

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.280
on output ports, destined for other LAN segments where the destination was not.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.690
Now enforcing this kind of isolation,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560
requires constructing some kind of switch table,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.490
or state at the switch, which maps destination MAC addresses to output ports.
