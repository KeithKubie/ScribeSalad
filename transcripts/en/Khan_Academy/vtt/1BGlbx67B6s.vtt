00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.550
Problem number six.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.850
Let f of x is equal to sine
of x squared plus cosine of x.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.010
The graph of y is equal
to the absolute value

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.479
of the fifth derivative
of f at x is shown above.

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.770
And I haven't shown it here
just so we have some space.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.311
I'll show it when
we need to show it.

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:16.920
I think we have to
show it in part D.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.440
So first, let's do
part A right over here.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.130
Write the first non-zero
terms for the Taylor series

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.000
for sine of x about
x is equal to 0.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.070
And write the first for non-zero
terms of the Taylor series

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.270
for sine of x squared
about x equals 0.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.740
So let's do this first part.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.460
And just a reminder,
a Taylor Series

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.840
is a polynomial
approximation of a function.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.560
So just to give us
a quick reminder.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.380
We go into much
more detail in this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.530
on the videos about
Taylor series.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.887
But if you have a function
that looks like this,

00:00:46.887 --> 00:00:49.220
and if you wanted to approximate
it with a Taylor series

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.480
around 0, if you only have one
term in your Taylor series,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.330
you would just
literally have it--

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.450
it would just be a
constant, just like that.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.520
If you have two terms
in your Taylor series

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.660
it would be a line
that looks like that.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.660
If you have three terms
in your Taylor series,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.140
you'd get to a
second degree term.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.580
And you'd start approximating
it something like that.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.555
If you get to the
third degree term

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:11.930
it might start
looking like that.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.388
And as you add more
and more terms,

00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:15.740
you get a better, better
approximation of your function.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.156
And if you add an
infinite number,

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:19.080
it might actually
converge to your function.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.920
So let's just remind
ourselves, if I

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.700
have a function-- if I have f
of x, this Taylor series-- I can

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.410
approximate it with
this Taylor series.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.600
And if we want to center
that approximation around 0,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.440
it'll be equal to f of
0 plus f prime of 0.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.145
The derivative at 0 times x
plus the second derivative

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:42.289
at 0 times x squared
over 2 factorial.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.080
You could have divided
this term right here

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.700
by one factorial,
which is just 1.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.580
Two factorials is just 2.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.673
And then plus the third
derivative of f at 0

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:55.290
times x to the third
over 3 factorial.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.480
Plus the fourth derivative-- I
think you get the idea here--

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.720
at the fourth
derivative at 0 times

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.890
x to the fourth
divided by 4 factorial,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.900
and so on and so forth.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.060
So what they want us to
do is find the first four

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.524
non-zero terms of the
Taylor series for sine of x.

00:02:11.524 --> 00:02:13.190
And some of you might
already know this.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.970
We actually cover
this in the video

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.600
where we show Euler's identity.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.030
But we'll do it again
right over here.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.400
So if we just
take-- I'll call it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.270
g of x, because they already
defined f of x up here.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.990
So let's say that g of x--
let me do this in a new color

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.020
just to ease the monotony.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.400
Let's say that g of x
is equal to sine of x.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.010
Then we know that g of 0
is going to be equal to 0.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.020
And then if we take
the derivative, g

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.200
prime of x is going to be
equal to negative-- no, it's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.570
going to be positive
cosine of x.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.350
g prime of 0 is now
going to be equal to 1.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.230
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.520
Then if you take the
second derivative,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.700
the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.250
Negative sine of x and
the second derivative at 0

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.600
once again is going to
equal zero, sine of 0, 0.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.920
And now let's take
the third derivative.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.350
Third derivative of
our function of g.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.950
The derivative of negative sine
of x is negative cosine of x.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.840
And the third
derivative at 0 is now

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.260
going to be equal to negative 1.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.720
And we could keep going.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.330
You can already guess
where this might lead to,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.720
but I'll just keep
going just in case.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.720
The fourth derivative
is once again

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.970
going to be equal to sine of x.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.040
It is now going to be
equal to sine of x.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.550
And then the fourth
derivative at 0,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.710
because it's the same
thing as the function,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.820
is now going to be 0 as well.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.522
So this is going to be equal
to g to the fourth at 0.

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:52.730
And then we could keep going.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.230
This is going to be the same
thing as g to the fifth,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.100
because we start cycling as we
take more and more derivatives.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.641
So this is going to
be the same thing

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:01.194
as the fifth derivative at 0.

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:02.610
This is going to
be the same thing

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.700
as the sixth derivative at 0.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.020
And this is going
to be the same.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.887
This is an equal sign
right here, equals 1.

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:14.470
And this is going
to be the same thing

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.630
as the seventh derivative at 0.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.416
So if you want the first
four non-zero terms,

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:22.540
let's just work through it.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.740
So first of all, f of 0--
I'll do this in a new color.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.510
If we want to
approximate g of x,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.640
if we want to
approximate sine of x.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.380
So we'll say sine of x is going
to be approximately equal to.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.320
So this first term right
over here, that is sine of 0.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.220
That's g of 0.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.620
That's going to be 0, so we
don't even have to write it.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.650
Then we go to this
term right over here.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.730
Well, the first derivative, f
prime of 0-- or in this case,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.320
g prime of 0-- is
going to be equal to 1.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.660
So it's going to be 1 times x.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.510
So you're going to
have an x there.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.900
Then the next term
is going to be 0.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.490
We see that right over there.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.620
Because the second derivative
of our function evaluated at 0

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.920
is 0.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.580
Our third derivative of our
function evaluated at 0 is 1.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.030
So that term is going
to show up again.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.875
Actually, that
term is negative 1.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.570
I don't want to
make a mistake here.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.710
That is negative 1, negative 1.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.120
It was negative cosine of x.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.320
You evaluate negative cosine
of x and 0, you get negative 1

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.620
right over here.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.800
So the third derivative,
this thing right over here,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.250
is negative 1.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.050
So then we have minus x to
the third over 3 factorial.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.660
The fourth derivative,
once again, is 0.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.410
The fifth derivative
evaluated at 0 is 1.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.330
So then you're going
to have plus 1 times x

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.940
to the fifth over 5 factorial.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.522
Then the six derivative is 0.

00:05:42.522 --> 00:05:43.980
So that term is
going to disappear.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.420
I didn't even write it up here.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.425
And then the seventh term,
the coefficient is negative 1.

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:51.590
Or the seventh derivative
evaluated at 0 is negative 1.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.880
So you have negative 1 times
x to the seventh over 7

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.030
factorial.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.990
And we have to go all the
way to the seven degree term

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.550
to find the first four non-zero
terms for our Taylor Series.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.120
And so we're done with
at least the first part.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.650
We found the first four
non-zero terms of sine of x Now,

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.216
what about sine of x squared?

00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:17.340
We have to be careful here.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.750
Because you might just say, OK,
let me just apply this formula.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.940
And what you're going
to find very quickly

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.410
is when you start taking the
second and third derivatives

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.170
of this thing right over here,
it's going to get really messy.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.570
But what you can say
is, look, sine of x

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.610
is approximately this
thing right over here.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.195
What happens if I just replace
the x with the x squared?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.740
Then I get sine of x
squared is approximately

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.700
equal to-- instead of an x here,
I'm going to put an x squared.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.570
Instead of an x
to the third here,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.120
I'm going to put an x
squared to the third

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.380
over here, over 3 factorial.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.690
Instead of an x to the fifth.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.204
I can put an x squared to the
fifth power over 5 factorial.

00:06:54.204 --> 00:06:55.620
And instead of an
x to the seventh

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.880
I could write x squared to the
seventh power over 7 factorial.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.770
So this is a very
important thing to realize.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.210
Because if you had
started directly

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.309
take the Taylor Series around
0 of this thing right here,

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:09.850
you would have taken
up all your time

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.110
trying to take the derivatives.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.600
And you probably wouldn't have
been able to do it anyway,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.350
because it would have
gotten really messy.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.660
And the key here is just to
realize that you substitute

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.420
x squared for x,
you're then going

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.550
to get the approximation
for sine of x squared.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.105
We could simplify
this a little bit.

00:07:25.105 --> 00:07:26.480
This is going to
be approximately

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.510
equal to x squared minus
x to the sixth over 3

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.640
factorial plus x
to the 10th over 5

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.030
factorial minus x to the
14th over 7 factorial.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.030
So that's our second
part of the problem.
