00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.968
Numbers are tricky.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.936
And they're even trickier
in politics.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.472
Some numbers are valid
and support my argument,

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.241
while others are
backstabbing fakes

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.076
that go against my argument.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.812
Those numbers are called lies.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.213
Now, this is complicated.

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.349
Even the same numbers
can change allegiance,

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:18.451
like the unemployment numbers
earlier this year.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.453
You remember
when they were fake,

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.623
and then they became real
when Trump took over?

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.391 line:0%
REPORTER: In the past,
the president has referred

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:28.528 line:0%
to particular jobs reports
as phony or totally fiction.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.830 line:0%
Does the president believe
that this jobs report

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:33.199 line:0%
was accurate and a fair way
to measure the economy?

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:35.234 line:0%
Yeah, I-I talked to the
president prior to this,

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.370 line:0%
uh, and he said to quote him
very clearly.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.739 line:0%
"They may have been phony in the
past, but it's very real now."

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.708
(laughter)

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.746
They're laughing at how
ridiculous they sound

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.348
asking that question
in the first place.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.384
So let's find out
if this week's numbers

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.286
-are good guys
-(angelic music plays)

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.121
-or bad guys.
-(buzzer)

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:58.691
First up: Trump's latest
approval numbers.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.494 line:0%
The numbers are looking a bit
better for President Trump.

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:02.995 line:0%
He's at 43% in our new

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.564 line:0%
<i> NBC News/Wall Street Journal</i>
 poll.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:07.133 line:0%
That's a three-point uptick
since August.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.969 line:0%
He's also up in Gallup,
so this is across the board.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.305
Okay, 43.
You seem innocent enough,

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.207
but, uh, what do we know?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.109
It's a terrible grade
on a spelling test,

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.678
but a fantastic score

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:21.080
on the pommel horse.

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:24.317
But can we trust 43
as an approval rating?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.219
Trump said in February

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.522
that any "negative polls
are fake news.”

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:32.225
But is 43 negative?

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.527
Well, I'm told it's
less than half,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.163
but what I'm really
interested in is trends,

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.665
and this number is technically
on the uptick.

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:43.236
Who knows what it will be
next week-- 45? 95?

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.671
It's a grower, not a shower.

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:48.541
And that's an argument
I am familiar with.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:51.911
-So, 43: a good guy.
-(angelic music plays)

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:54.547
But where else is numbers?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.483
My big-suited friends say
the stock market.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.786 line:0%
The stock market is at an
all-time high.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.589 line:0%
So I'm really proud,
'cause a record

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:05.591 line:0%
in the history of our
country's stock market.

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:07.293 line:0%
Tremendous gains.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.495 line:0%
People that truly dislike
your president,

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.597 line:0%
the heads of these companies
are coming up

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.499 line:0%
and hugging me and kissing me.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:17.203
Oh, when you're a star,
they let you do it.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.005
The stock market is up.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.775
In fact, the Dow recently set
a new record when it hit 22,000.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:24.777
But is that a number
we can trust?

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.913
Now, some whiny liberal
economists may tell you

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.448
that this economic boom
is actually holdover growth

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.817
from Obama's policies,
like Dodd-Frank

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.786
and the 2009 stimulus package.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.721
They might even
point at census data

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.191
that says real
median household income grew

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.559
over the last two years.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.827
But I don't trust this.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.563
Who doesn't lie to the census?

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.865
Why should the government
know how many kids I have

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.301
and how many
refrigerators I own?

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.070
And it's a lot, by the way,
to both questions.

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:52.572
So stop asking.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.641
I like cold things
and little people. Simple.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:59.245
The point is 22,000
is a good number...

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:02.515
for 45, not for 44.

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:05.451
Now, you can't
hide from me, numbers.

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:07.320
So let's put a fresh one
in the feed.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.121
Challenge me.
Just give me something.

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:11.324 line:0%
REPORTER:<i> Health and Human
 Services Secretary Tom Price</i>

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.526 line:0%
<i> is in hot water over taking
 dozens of charter flights</i>

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.094 line:0%
<i> on private jets.</i>

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:18.097 line:0%
REPORTER 2:
<i> At a cost of over $400,000</i>

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.699 line:0%
<i> to the taxpayers.</i>

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.801
(whoops)
Okay. Hoo boy.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.170
I can do this.
Now, o-on the surface,

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.205
it seems like Tom Price,
a multi-millionaire

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:29.041
spending $400,000
in taxpayer's money

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:30.676
on personal travel--

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.746
I mean, that number--
sounds kind of like a-a bad guy.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.183
But, uh... I got this.
Follow me, here.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.152
400,000.
Four.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:44.056
Four is the number of legs
on a horse.

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:47.793
And horses were popular
in the 1830s.

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:50.296
1830 is military time

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.465
for 6:30.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:56.302
And 6:30 is when
the sun goes down.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:59.138
And son is also a male child,

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.807
which is who Tom Price
was visiting.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.277
And visiting has eight letters.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.545
And a son is half a father.

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:09.215
Eight divided in half is four.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:11.183
And what has four letters?

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:14.420
"Good." So...

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:16.656
Simple.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.259
So, Tom Price spending $400,000

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.561
of taxpayers' money
on private transportation

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:25.531
is a good number.
Close one.

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:28.701
Now, finally,<i> The Opposition</i>
 premiered on Monday,

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:30.469
and I had no doubt in my mind

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:33.939
we were the most-watched show
of all time.

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:36.942
But, according to big Nielsen,
we were eclipsed

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:40.112
by<i> Young Sheldon,</i>

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:43.382
 whose numbers were apparently
larger than ours.

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:45.051
Let me be clear.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:47.653
I don't get beaten
by nine-year-old nerds.

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:49.722
I haven't gotten beaten up
by a nine-year-old

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.857
since I was 15.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.793
Then once more when I was 21,

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:56.228
but there were two of them,
so technically,

00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.164
I got beat up by an 18-year-old.

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.666
And that hasn't happened
since Tuesday.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.469
So, now, who's
the mathmologist, Sheldon?
