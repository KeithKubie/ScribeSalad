00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.960
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.080
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.800
May 22nd, 2016 was

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.920
<v 1>going on our wow. Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.150
<v 0>Um, once again,</v>

6
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.550
I got a computer issues here that I gotta get fixed when I get back to Los

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.270
[inaudible]. I am in, um, to Seattle, Seattle,

8
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:26.810
Washington right now, which I gotta tell you, man, if you come to Seattle in,

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.320
in May or June when the sun is out,

10
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.650
it's like you want to live here.

11
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.630
It really is one of the most beautiful cities in the United States.

12
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.660
If you can just deal with overcast skies from like October through April and um,

13
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.840
these people pay the price, but when the sun comes out,

14
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:49.930
it's fucking unbelievable. So I'm here with Nate Craig,

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.660
who's been crushing it this whole fucking tour. And um,

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.950
we just went out to get some AIDS, like a couple of tourists. We go,

17
00:00:56.951 --> 00:00:59.500
you want to go down to the fishermen place where they're throwing the fish and

18
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:00.660
everything. So we're like, yeah.

19
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:05.080
So we start walking down there and of course it's mobbed. And I say to them,

20
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:09.280
I go, you realize that nobody from Seattle fucking goes down here, you know,

21
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:12.190
unless they're on like a first date or you know,

22
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:14.800
your dad and mom had taken you down there to go see it,

23
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:16.270
but I would think that you would avoid it.

24
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:20.130
So we didn't go all the way down and we just Kinda kept walking.

25
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.003
We got a little bit.

26
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.473
<v 2>Um,</v>

27
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.590
<v 0>yeah, we walked along that main drag and we just got a little bit away from it.</v>

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.730
And,

29
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.563
<v 2>and um,</v>

30
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.710
<v 0>after waiting into that sea of fucking humanity, I was literally like, dude,</v>

31
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.400
I will eat mediocre food if I don't have to stand in a line that can actually

32
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.800
sit down like a human being.

33
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.933
<v 2>Um,</v>

34
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.610
<v 1>I know the food is good, but I don't,</v>

35
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.240
I just don't understand just standing there like a fucking bread line.

36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.150
Like it's the middle of a war or some shit. All right.

37
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:48.830
You live in the United States of America.

38
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:51.740
We don't stand in fucking line for food.

39
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.560
We want to lower fat asses up.

40
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.930
You just handed to me so I'm not going to name the place,

41
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.700
but I went to this place. It was, it was happening.

42
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.150
<v 0>Break the bread fucking stunk. You know what I mean?</v>

43
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.070
How do you make fucking king crab only taste. Okay.

44
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:13.280
You know how you have shitty bread. Other than that, it was a,

45
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.220
it was definitely a good time. And um,

46
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.180
<v 2>okay,</v>

47
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.240
<v 1>such a beautiful city. Despite all the dirty white people up here,</v>

48
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.400
there's a major fucking, you know,

49
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.140
I want to avoid using the word grunge.

50
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.170
I think that was just a nice way that did just stick fucking,

51
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.650
there is some dirty fucking white people up here. I don't,

52
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:36.940
I don't understand it. Just there in Denver. Those are the two,

53
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.110
the two filthiest white people that actually have money. Like your,

54
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.660
you have too much money to be that filthy. Like when you go to Denver, Eh,

55
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.750
those fucking dreadlocked like man Sandal wearing like always looking like you

56
00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:57.100
just got off a fucking one of those blow up tubes, you know,

57
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.540
smoking, you fucking whatever the whatever that doing out there, you know,

58
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.770
carry on print type of shit worse than San Francisco.

59
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.670
I don't mind any of those styles. If you, if he obeyed me, it's 2016.

60
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.790
Jesus Christ, I'm up here. It's not like they're like, uh,

61
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.190
it's probably just me being an old man.

62
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.940
I can't honestly say none of them smelled, but they just, they look like a,

63
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.830
you know, you wouldn't want to borrow anything that they used.

64
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.920
Why am I starting off this? Me, I started off so nice.

65
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.470
<v 0>I was saying how beautiful it is. It's such a,</v>

66
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.210
the layout of the city is fucking perfect. And, um,

67
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.930
they, even within new stadiums that they made,

68
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.250
like I actually am old school as far as I loved it back when they just had the

69
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.340
kingdom, you know, and they had that great like, uh,

70
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.730
Seattle Supersonics had like, you know, the, the skyline,

71
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.210
I know that they had the space needle and I believe they had the kingdom there

72
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.060
unless it was supposed to be key arena. I have no idea. But those two, um,

73
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.690
arenas, um,

74
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.750
were and are two of the coolest places ever.

75
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.720
I saw at Seattle Supersonics game there, uh,

76
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.750
the last year they were there and it was Kevin Durant's first year somewhere.

77
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.040
I Dunno, I have a picture of him in the Seattle Seahawks, a CLC of Seattle,

78
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.850
Super Seattle Sonics, I should say. Um, uniform.

79
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.510
And then back in the day when I was just doing college gigs,

80
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.810
traveling the road by myself, um,

81
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.520
driving a Chrysler Chrysler cake, um,

82
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.070
I went to a game, uh,

83
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.130
Seattle Mariners game at the Kingdom and Ken Griffey Jr was still on the team.

84
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.600
So how long ago was this? Was like the late nineties,

85
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.340
possibly early two thousands. I forget when he went to the reds. But, um,

86
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.271
I deliberately,

87
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:56.271
I bought us one single center field seat and I got almost like the front row.

88
00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:59.100
I think I was the second row.

89
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.670
And this is some sports fan geek shit.

90
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.970
I sat there cause not only do I want to watch Griffey play,

91
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.420
but I also wanted to like every night on sports center,

92
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:13.260
whenever they showed a game at the kingdom and somebody hit a home run,

93
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.320
there was like this weird little runway. Like I'll wait,

94
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.140
<v 1>you'd see people chasing after the ball. And I wanted the opportunity to, uh,</v>

95
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:24.880
to do that, which I did all by myself. I didn't get the fucking ball. And,

96
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.740
um,

97
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.120
<v 0>so whatever. Um,</v>

98
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.260
<v 1>but having said all that,</v>

99
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:33.790
if you ever visit Seattle in May or June and it's all sunny and you're like,

100
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.380
oh my God, I could live here,

101
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.240
make sure you come back in like January or December as some one of those

102
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:43.900
fucking, you know, I understand Kurt Cobain now

103
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.290
<v 0>one of those months. But anyways, we're uh, we're performing there tonight. Uh,</v>

104
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:53.940
I'm recording this podcast Sunday afternoon cause, uh, I gotta get back.

105
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.613
<v 3>Okay.</v>

106
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.240
<v 0>And Go back to the writer's room working on episode five,</v>

107
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.410
everybody five on a number 10 and a, once we get this one done,

108
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.110
it's all downhill from there. Uh,

109
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.180
really excited about this episode and I don't know,

110
00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:15.130
I'm hoping you guys are gonna like it. But anyways, um, so big,

111
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.930
uh, thank you to everybody who came out into Edmonton last night and went out to

112
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:21.940
Calgary. Uh, Calgary

113
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.970
might've been the best sound I've, I've ever heard at a show.

114
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.890
I was standing backstage and Nate Craig was onstage.

115
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.580
I mean the backstage here.

116
00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:38.410
And usually in most venues when you're standing to the side of the stage,

117
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:41.980
you can barely understand the person, just the way the sound is bouncing around.

118
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.270
I'm sure it's fine in the house, but like, um, you know,

119
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.760
so many times I'll be with Bart,

120
00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:50.230
nick or Versace or something and literally just be like, dude, Ga,

121
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:53.380
that new bit bit I did about blah, blah, blah. And I was like, you know,

122
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:57.400
I was trying to, but I couldn't quite hear it because of the sound. Um,

123
00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.330
<v 2>okay.</v>

124
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.130
<v 0>I was standing almost like directly behind.</v>

125
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.990
We're behind and behind the curtain when Nate was on stage and I could hear the

126
00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:07.140
guy absolutely perfectly. And

127
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.653
<v 2>um,</v>

128
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.980
<v 0>it was just fun. It was fucking awesome. It was just a great Gig,</v>

129
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:12.940
both of the gigs.

130
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.883
<v 2>Um,</v>

131
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.230
<v 0>and then the next day, you know, we got up, we drove up to Edmonton,</v>

132
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.000
which believe it or not, I've done that drive like three times. And um,

133
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.620
just beautiful, beautiful fucking country up in Canada. Absolutely gorgeous.

134
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:31.880
I would go out of my fucking mind. I think if I did the road enough though,

135
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.330
if I just flew to other places and then I could come back,

136
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.490
that's how I really did view all these places, you know,

137
00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:39.990
that are considered the middle of nowhere.

138
00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:44.991
They're like these paradises but I think I would lose my mind if all I did was

139
00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:47.580
live out there. Like I understand that people, when they come up to you,

140
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.790
they're like, oh my God, I want to get outta here. You know,

141
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.640
this is the middle of fucking nowhere. And I'm always, you know,

142
00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:57.060
coming from la where everybody's living on top of each other and we have no

143
00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:00.690
water and shit. I'm like, dude, you are living in the garden of Eden. Okay.

144
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:04.020
This is as good as it gets as far as, um,

145
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.800
natural resources for seasons and that type of shit.

146
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.670
Although what's cold as fuck when we were up there, it's for May anyways.

147
00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:16.470
I mean, the last night in Edmonton was actually sleeting fucking crazy.

148
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.873
But, um,

149
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.500
we ended up driving obviously up to Edmonton and that night at the Gig,

150
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.320
this might've been the weirdest fucking venue I've played in a long time.

151
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.350
It was essentially, I took a picture of it.

152
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:34.351
It was essentially a giant tent that had a little bit of an upper deck in the

153
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:39.660
back. And um, there was no carpeting.

154
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:40.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.590
<v 0>Like behind me, they didn't, yeah,</v>

156
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.140
he had all this fucking equipment for the lights and everything and they

157
00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:47.790
usually, they, they dress it up,

158
00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:50.960
they put a curtain there so people don't have to look at it. But they did.

159
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:54.780
And it was like this giant eyesore behind me and I was standing on like this

160
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.010
concrete slab that had no, no carpeting,

161
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:03.090
no nothing. The floor was all concrete. They just had chairs,

162
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.550
the sides of the walls. I didn't know what they were made up.

163
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:07.560
All I know was I was on stage.

164
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.970
I felt like I was like screaming in a giant garage.

165
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:16.470
Like I, it seemed loud to me, but I couldn't tell if it was loud.

166
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.650
I didn't see anybody complaining where like my ears are kind of ringing today

167
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.340
and I've got a couple of tweets. People was saying like, like, dude,

168
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:26.670
you sounded like you were yelling into a megaphone, into a microphone.

169
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.870
So my apologies. I wish somebody had mentioned something on one of the shows.

170
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:32.580
I would have toned it down. But sometimes when you're up there,

171
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.220
you can't hear yourself. But I ended up, um,

172
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.590
I sent a picture to Nia and now I can, should've had the tweet,

173
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.510
other t a the message she sent me,

174
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:48.180
the text that she sent me, she said that looks like a venue where one of those,

175
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.120
those fake televangelist, you know,

176
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.820
have plants in the crowd and they go to like cure them and shit. And um,

177
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.880
I'll post a picture of it. And as always, I always say, I'll fucking do it then.

178
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:03.750
I never do, but I'll, I'll try to do it this time. You know what, whatever,

179
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:07.860
if you follow the MMP on fucking a on Twitter, maybe it'll be up there.

180
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:10.760
I have no idea. But I'm, before I go any further,

181
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.260
I forgot to mention, um, the all things comedy network is really a doing well.

182
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.670
I, cause I'm a terrible businessman. I never bring it up, but um,

183
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.650
we got some people to invest in it.

184
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.040
We're going to start creating some more content, uh,

185
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.590
content and that type of stuff. And um, you know,

186
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:33.280
really tried to join forces with other comics and hopefully, uh,

187
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.040
make some comics some money off of that thing.

188
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:37.590
And get you guys some good comedy. Everybody works.

189
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.790
We keep the big Fuckos out of the wake, you know, are very, at least, you know,

190
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.810
keep them from taking the rights of everybody's fucking shows. You know,

191
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.310
that always seems to be like the business plan. Like, okay, yeah, we'll invest.

192
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:53.550
All right, we own everything. You work for us. You go fuck yourself.

193
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:57.060
We'll sleep in bed and make mailbox money and you'll be on the road when you're

194
00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:01.110
90. Sound good. No, it doesn't. Well, it's going to be good exposure.

195
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.010
It's what they always say. Funny young comics out there.

196
00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:07.170
Anytime anybody tries to pay you when exposure,

197
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:10.020
anytime they say it's good exposure, that means you're getting fucked

198
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.220
up. All right. Also, this Thursday I'm doing a, a charity show.

199
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.810
Um, this Thursday, 8:00 PM at the comedy store,

200
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.460
100% of the money goes towards helping children who are fighting cancer,

201
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.590
um, to have as normal of childhood as possible while they're going through the

202
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:35.130
treatment and all that. Uh, the tickets are available at the comedy store.

203
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.810
After the show, we'll uh,

204
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:40.710
we'll put up a link for anyone who can't make it if they want to donate. Um,

205
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:43.800
Steve Simone puts the thing together and um, he's been doing great things.

206
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:46.390
He's been having comics go to hospitals and stuff like that. This,

207
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.390
this is a charity that I can get behind,

208
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.950
which brings me back to the mysterious red nose campaign.

209
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.360
<v 1>So, um, a bunch of people were looking into that,</v>

210
00:11:57.361 --> 00:12:01.560
found it very vague and now I guess it helps out poor children.

211
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.570
That's why you have the clown noses,

212
00:12:03.571 --> 00:12:07.410
which is hilarious to me cause I think it's pretty much mainstream knowledge

213
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.940
that clowns kind of scare the shit out of most children and a lot of adults.

214
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.150
I just don't understand why you got to have this stupid clown nose.

215
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.380
What are you going to do with that fucking thing other than just throw it out

216
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.670
and then it's going to be, you know,

217
00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:25.510
it's going to end up in the fucking ocean and then back in the fish that you

218
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:27.890
eat. It's so fucking dumb.

219
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:29.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

220
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.750
<v 1>Like it's not enough to just say, listen, we are helping out poor children.</v>

221
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.760
Do people still say, Nah, I don't want to do that. And you gotta be like, well,

222
00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:41.570
what if we give you a little red nosy nose? And you're like, okay,

223
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.340
that sounds like a good idea.

224
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.960
<v 0>That's such like a fucking, I don't know.</v>

225
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.070
I think it's like a hacky charity thing. It all started with the, uh,

226
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.860
I think it was the aids ribbon was the first thing,

227
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.960
or was it the quilt and then came the Lance Armstrong live strong things.

228
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.870
Right. And I don't know, somewhere in there was the super finger.

229
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.080
I have no fucking, I don't, I don't, I don't pretend to know these things

230
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.590
anyways. What am I, what the hell am I on my own?

231
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.560
So this fucking new thing is driving me nuts.

232
00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.510
I'm so used to not having to look at these fucking

233
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.420
is garageband shit. Um, Oh, here's a nice, creepy thing.

234
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.080
It's really not a nice, creepy thing. It's just sort of a fucking creepy thing.

235
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.490
So we rented this car when we drove up from Calgary to drove up to Edmonton from

236
00:13:31.491 --> 00:13:36.440
Calgary and we had the thing actually picked it up at the airport.

237
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.680
And, um, yeah,

238
00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:43.860
we were driving over to the casino. That's what it was, driving over the casino.

239
00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:46.620
And I find, I just look on the dashboard. I'm like, what the fuck is that?

240
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.740
What does that on the down? I'm like, is that a camera?

241
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.200
I think it was a camera and I think it was pointed at us cause there was nothing

242
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:59.040
in the front. I don't know if it was the gps antenna.

243
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.040
I Dunno what the fuck it was. But it was really creepy.

244
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.970
So I of course through a fucking newspaper over the goddamn thing.

245
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.680
And um, when I got back to the hotel,

246
00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:14.850
I looked up about cars and cameras and I found this article here, it says,

247
00:14:14.851 --> 00:14:18.420
is your rental car company spying on you and you're driving,

248
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.230
here's how they do it. All right. Rental car,

249
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:26.040
giant Hertz has admitted it is,

250
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.160
it has cameras installed in about one in eight of its cars in the United States.

251
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.860
But those cameras built into Hertz is never lost.

252
00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:39.861
Dashboard assistant that offers routing help and local city guides have never

253
00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:42.360
been turned on. Give me a fuck. It really,

254
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:44.130
you spent all that money and he never turned them on.

255
00:14:44.131 --> 00:14:47.460
Your Lion Con's Hertz is said loudly and repeatedly.

256
00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:48.480
They've never turned them on.

257
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.580
Understand that never lost six was launched by Hertz in early 2014.

258
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.510
The product has been out there for over a year and only now is it causing flat?

259
00:14:56.511 --> 00:15:00.110
Probably because most renters began noticing a creepy camera pointed at them.

260
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.851
I'm understand too.

261
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.480
There are excellent reasons to worry about car rental companies sparked, uh,

262
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:10.550
companies spying on drivers. Um, but very probably never lost.

263
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:14.090
Six is not one of them. Hurts. Said his last. It has,

264
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.870
it lacked the bandwidth to use the cameras anyway,

265
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.640
but it has been so scorched.

266
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.280
But in sports so severely in the media flap of the past week,

267
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.410
said industry experts indicated that hurts now would be just about the last

268
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:29.000
company to spy on its customers.

269
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.200
Does any of that make any sense that you'd put a camera in there and then you

270
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:35.660
wouldn't use it? You'd install a camera and all?

271
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.350
We're just a little mom and pop place. We don't have the fucking bandwidth.

272
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:41.750
Ford, some of this shit's funny.

273
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.830
<v 1>They actually find some people like hundreds,</v>

274
00:15:44.831 --> 00:15:47.920
sometimes thousands of dollars using this shit and basically,

275
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:50.350
you know when you rent a car and they go, okay,

276
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:54.760
you've got to stay in the tristate area or you're not leaving California. Right.

277
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.360
Some fucking guy. He ended up, he left California,

278
00:15:58.361 --> 00:16:01.870
went to Nevada and then Arizona and then they gave him a a,

279
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.870
<v 4>I dunno where the fuck it was.</v>

280
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.560
<v 1>He was slapped with a bill of $3,405 and 5 cents by adding $1 per mile to each</v>

281
00:16:12.311 --> 00:16:13.900
of the 28 74 miles.

282
00:16:13.901 --> 00:16:17.920
He had driven because he had crack cross the California state line into Nevada.

283
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.760
To me that's funny. Okay. Because that guy's a piece of shit.

284
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:25.220
He lied to the car company. All right.

285
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.040
I'm not just saying hertz is a piece of shit.

286
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.490
People who buy rental cars and they treat them like shit are also pieces of

287
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:32.301
shit, but I don't, I don't,

288
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:35.750
but to sit there and film people and then you know they're going to start

289
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.960
recording conversations. Do you want to stand like in the future?

290
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.860
Okay. You go to run for president? Like what could like

291
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.970
bring you down is some fucked up thing.

292
00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:51.330
You said some argument you had in the car with some girlfriend you're not even

293
00:16:51.331 --> 00:16:55.710
with 20 years earlier and they just bring that up in the middle of the debate.

294
00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.000
Like I think in the future like they lit it like once you become a public figure

295
00:17:00.001 --> 00:17:04.290
they will just have on a disc, you know it's all going to be logged.

296
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.350
<v 4>Anything you ever fucking did like questionable shit.</v>

297
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.650
Good Shit that you did all the balance. You know,

298
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.600
they'll probably just have like a pie chart. Okay. His, his life disk, you know,

299
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.700
and the good stuff is in whatever green or yellow man, right.

300
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:26.510
All the nice friendly fucking colors and then the bad shit will be all in like

301
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:27.344
red.

302
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.833
<v 5>Um,</v>

303
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.360
<v 4>I don't know. If you're prone to depression,</v>

304
00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:35.290
there'll be like some blue in there and they'll just look at the big pie chart

305
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.470
and try to judge it. Then overall what kind of a fucking person you are?

306
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.780
It's just, it's, I dunno, it's really creepy.

307
00:17:40.781 --> 00:17:45.040
This is another one that was funny to me. It says in, in Florida,

308
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:50.430
rental car companies are notorious for literally shutting off engines of cars

309
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.710
<v 0>that crossed straight state lines.</v>

310
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.300
The cars may be restart started upon agreement to pay the new fees.

311
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.463
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

312
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.460
<v 0>that's fucking hilarious. And here's my question.</v>

313
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.270
How do you know they're not in the left lane doing 90 miles an hour with

314
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:08.970
somebody on that bumper? You just going to shut off the car,

315
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.720
but you have to wait until the car stops. I would like to think that,

316
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.200
<v 2>but, um,</v>

317
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.640
<v 0>I dunno. Pardon me.</v>

318
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.420
I don't mind if they track you with the gps as far as that.

319
00:18:23.421 --> 00:18:25.910
And if you leave the state lines, I mean that's only fair.

320
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.430
You fucking lying to them and the technology exists,

321
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.780
but that's shit to start recording conversations and uh,

322
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.560
videotaping you is like, I dunno man,

323
00:18:36.561 --> 00:18:38.180
that really crosses a line.

324
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.613
<v 2>Um,</v>

325
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.840
<v 0>I dunno. Some people say, well,</v>

326
00:18:41.841 --> 00:18:46.180
what about all these assholes texting and driving. They're there. You know,

327
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.970
they're killing people in that type of shit that there has to be a better way.

328
00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:53.180
What do you guys think this gotta be a better way to keep, I mean,

329
00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:55.280
I don't know how safe you have to make the world. I mean,

330
00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:57.920
there's too many fucking people. Can you let some people die? I mean,

331
00:18:57.921 --> 00:19:01.980
I know that's really morbid to say that shit, but, um, I dunno.

332
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.700
I'm kind of a fucked up person. So why, why, why would you listen to me?

333
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.710
Why would you listen to this podcast? Oh, I know why you're on your way to work.

334
00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:13.700
You're at the gym, you whatever the fuck you doing. So let's, uh,

335
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.000
should we do, oh man, I had a really bad,

336
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.200
<v 2>yeah,</v>

337
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.910
<v 0>a bad little social, full par. I have after the Calgary thing,</v>

338
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.970
I was walking over to the hotel and um,

339
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.610
I was trying to get into the elevator cause the ones in the lobby,

340
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.620
sometimes you go through the lobby, you know,

341
00:19:30.621 --> 00:19:33.290
people want pictures and shit like that, which is cool.

342
00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:34.550
But daddy wants to drink.

343
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.823
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

344
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.430
<v 0>So I was trying to get through there as fast as I could. And one of the guys,</v>

345
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.160
you know, was that the, you know, one of the, um,

346
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.890
the guys who worked there Sorta, you know,

347
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:48.780
this elevator door opened and I fucking,

348
00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:51.660
he just sorta told me to come in and I just stepped in from these people and

349
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:55.980
walked on me and Nate in the promoter and the doors closed as we were going up.

350
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.690
Nate goes, um,

351
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.590
did we just step in front of a woman in a wheelchair waiting for an elevator?

352
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.140
And then it dawned on me, cause I did see her,

353
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:07.000
but I was in such a selfish moment of I don't want to take any, you know,

354
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.530
pictures or anything. I just want to get back down because the bar was closed.

355
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.270
That's right. And you know,

356
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:14.640
we had a great night and there's nothing better after a show.

357
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.200
You're all fucking amped up from the excitement of doing it in a went well that

358
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:21.240
you can't just go back to your hotel room, go to sleep,

359
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.600
you want to sit down and shoot the shit or whatever. So we will, that's right.

360
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.170
We will make it a mad dash to get down to the bar. The foreclose.

361
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.210
Now that's a lie. They were actually keeping an open for us.

362
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.880
There was really no reason for me to do it other than my own selfish things.

363
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:36.570
I didn't feel like taking a picture. So I ran in there and, um,

364
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.620
that has been bugging me for the last 48 fucking hours.

365
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.880
Nate heard her say something sad, have like said something. Well,

366
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:48.040
I guess we're not getting on this one, you know, classic,

367
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.950
<v 1>polite Canadian. So I dunno if whatever fucking reason,</v>

368
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:55.390
if you're the person pushing the person that wheelchair, my apologies. Oh,

369
00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:57.130
freckles was a selfish cunt there.

370
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.480
I'm literally getting embarrassed telling the story right now, but that,

371
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:04.090
that legitimately happened and it was me.

372
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.740
I Dunno if my rental car company has video or audio of it, you know,

373
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.830
I'm getting out in front of the stories what I'm doing. All right,

374
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:13.280
enough of that big brother's shit. Let's, uh,

<v 1>when you're in your early twenties and thirties, money can be tight.</v>

378
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.010
If you're not careful, dressing well concurrently. Drain your bank account.

379
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.760
Like spending 400 to $500 on a department store. Watch.

380
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.740
There's some brand names out there that are charging insane prices for watches

381
00:21:34.741 --> 00:21:36.660
that aren't even remotely worth it. Well,

382

<v 1>all right. Ah, doc dollar shave club. Everybody. I love upset somebody.</v>

399
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.880
You truly are that. It's actually Dr Carver's shave butter.

400
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.110
It was easy shave butter, but it's now it's not easy anymore,

401
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.860
but it was always Dr Carver's. I just, you know, I have some sort of

402
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:51.070
<v 2>um,</v>

403
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.080
<v 1>oh, I was kidding. I'm stupid.</v>

404
00:22:52.081 --> 00:22:54.870
You know I was going to say some sort of reading disability. That's a cop out.

405
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.170
No Bill, you're fucking dope. Dollar Shave Club. Everybody.

408
00:23:07.081 --> 00:23:11.460
shave butter. I hate it. I don't like it. Doctor Cabbie's easy shape.

409
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.850
This is the first time they've ever done something

410

412
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.510
One reason is because they deliver amazing razors right to your door for a third

413
00:23:24.511 --> 00:23:27.210
of the price of what the greedy razor corporations charge.

414
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.460
That means when you joined dollar Shave Club,

415

00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:37.000

You'll get a first-class shave when you use the executive blade without hurting

418
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:46.010
your wallet. Another reason is the a doctor Q Hobbes ego using

419
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.790
<v 4>it with the executive razor makes the blade glide gently to this for the</v>

420
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:54.560
smoothest shave ever. Dr Carver's shave butter isn't your average shave cream.

447
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:39.260
Let me get rid of all of this fucking copy here so I can get onto the questions

448
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.970
and all of that shit. By the way,

449
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:45.630
did anybody watch games for war of the uh, st? Yeah,

450
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:50.270
<v 1>Louie. Louie, me the fair. They gave the fucking shacks.</v>

451
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:51.530
Y'All right there. Fred,

452
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.460
<v 4>I'm not going to lie to you as a complete bandwagon fan.</v>

453
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.220
This is one of the biggest examples of bandwagon fan shit you'll ever see is me

454
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:05.990
becoming a blues fan. You know, just picking a team, right? And uh,

455
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.820
I, after they lost game two and game three and how great the sharps look,

456
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.880
I was just like, I was talking to my buddy going like,

457
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.590
these guys look like they're dialed in.

458
00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:19.960
I think the shocks are going to win the whole fucking thing. And I'm,

459
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.840
this is just been such a weird series. Yeah.

460
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.120
<v 1>Like game two, three and four. You know,</v>

461
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.680
it's like sharks dominated two and three and then it's like they didn't even

462
00:26:30.681 --> 00:26:33.860
fucking show and don't like the blues didn't even show up games two and three.

463
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.680
And I'm thinking like, God, the sharks got him figured out.

464
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.720
They're going to make quick work of them. And then the blues show up last night,

465
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:44.160
it was like fucking game two or three never happened.

466
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.930
<v 0>So I can't figure it out.</v>

467
00:26:45.931 --> 00:26:49.530
Somebody on Twitter sent me something saying these games have suck because

468
00:26:49.531 --> 00:26:53.760
they'd been so one sided. Um, and I wouldn't argue,

469
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.060
I will argue that they haven't been actually the most compelling games.

470
00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.440
They just been like three out of four games has just been that little fucking

471
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:06.250
kick to the bullets there. So, so we'll see. We'll see. Um,

472
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.220
Isa, I have no fucking clue anymore. I thought I have to two and three.

473
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:13.770
I was like, not only have the sharks going to beat the blues,

474
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:17.910
they're going to win the whole fucking thing because I'm not impressed with the,

475
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.990
I mean, I liked the lightning,

476
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:21.690
but they lost that fucking goaltender and I thought that they were done.

477
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.810
I thought they were fucking done. And now all of a sudden, you know,

478
00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:28.500
the fucking penguins won two in a row and then fucking Tampa cans bough Jesus.

479
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.060
<v 1>It about two to two. I swear to God, if I didn't know better,</v>

480
00:27:32.061 --> 00:27:35.630
that fucking piece of shit. David Stern is one of the Goddamn NHL right now.

481
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.660
It seems like he wants both of the series to go seven games.

482
00:27:38.661 --> 00:27:40.760
Everybody makes their fucking money, right?

483
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.360
They would never do something like that. What are they? The NFL.

484
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.270
Um, oh Jesus. I'm being a cop being such a, such a Goddamn con. Um,

485
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.480
and I'm sort of paid attention to the basketball. I just don't have time.

486
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.040
And I was really hoping

487
00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:02.610
that the Cleveland Cavaliers were gonna go 16 and o and win a title on two

488
00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:07.720
different levels. One, Cleveland would win a title and all those sad,

489
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.530
sad Cleveland fans could quit with this stupid basset hound faces.

490
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.023
You know what I mean?

491
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.800
Cleveland fans are so fucking sad and so many people just don't even give a

492
00:28:17.801 --> 00:28:20.860
shit. I mean, they just have the loneliest look on their face.

493
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.830
And at least when Boston couldn't win a world series,

494
00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.280
New York had the decency to give a fuck enough to trash us,

495
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.100
which was always funny to me. When you really thought about it. It's like,

496
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.160
why are you wasting your time? They were like, Walmart,

497
00:28:33.161 --> 00:28:36.220
get mad at the one mom and pop store up the fucking street,

498
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.270
because we were also trying to sell rakes. Right? Like why do you give a shit?

499
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.370
Um, but no one cares about. I Dunno, Ohio. It's amazing.

500
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.380
The amount of, of musicians, fighters, football coaches,

501
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.000
entertainers,

502
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.450
the list of famous people from Ohio might be the most impressive have out of all

503
00:28:58.451 --> 00:29:01.440
the 50 states. And uh,

504
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:06.100
they don't get any respect and, but she'd go out there. It's just, yeah, I know.

505
00:29:06.101 --> 00:29:10.960
It's just kind of boring, boring ass state to fucking drive through.

506
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:15.130
I Dunno, but they're nice people, but I don't really,

507
00:29:15.131 --> 00:29:18.580
I don't know if I have sympathy for Cleveland fans as much as they love

508
00:29:18.581 --> 00:29:22.690
Cleveland. It's like, yeah, well, why don't you live there? Nobody lives there.

509
00:29:22.691 --> 00:29:26.770
It's like a fucking ghost town, I guess. Gradually it's coming back. You know,

510
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.140
who gives a fuck? I just like shitting on people anyway,

511
00:29:29.141 --> 00:29:32.860
so I wanted to see them go 16 and older because it would be great to see Lebron

512
00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.070
come back. You know, after all the Cleveland fans who are burning,

513
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.170
burning his jersey when he left, you know, I always thought,

514
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.960
is this the fucking thing ever just to go out and burn somebody?

515
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:47.740
Jersey is the newest cameras are filming you. It's like,

516
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:49.090
how fucking old are you?

517
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.720
Are you really this emotionally invested in your fucking team? I mean,

518
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:56.590
I love sports as much as anybody. I remember when,

519
00:29:56.591 --> 00:29:57.760
what's his face left?

520
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.660
Ray Allen went to the heat and all these Celtics fans were mad. It's like, dude,

521
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:02.650
that's how we got them.

522
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.340
<v 4>You know, he started with the bucks and then he fought. He one once.</v>

523
00:30:07.341 --> 00:30:09.410
There's somebody, a players, a free agent,

524
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.780
don't ever give you a heart to the person. I'm telling you,

525
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.380
you can't go 100% in because they re, you know, they got that fucking a,

526
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.120
they got that wonder and I sometimes they stay like big poppy,

527
00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:22.370
but most of the times, you know, they come, they come through town,

528
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.730
they pile on the team, they win a championship,

529
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.510
they start acting like they're fucking magic Johnson and the Lakers or some

530
00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:32.990
shit. Larry Bird, you know, when they're really just, you know,

531
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:38.000
they're window shopping throughout the fucking league. Um, but anyways,

532
00:30:38.001 --> 00:30:40.310
one of the cool things, if they actually went 16 and oh,

533
00:30:40.311 --> 00:30:41.780
it would be so fucked up

534
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.520
<v 6>that</v>

535
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.260
<v 4>the Golden State Warriors, right.</v>

536
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:50.350
I'm assuming they make it to the finals would go 73 and nine beating the 96

537
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:55.990
bowls and having the greatest regular season of all time and then losing the

538
00:30:56.001 --> 00:30:59.240
championship game to me would have been, you know,

539
00:30:59.241 --> 00:31:01.370
it's like the fucking 2008 patriots.

540
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.840
It's like they went 16 and oh and like I don't, nobody gives a fuck.

541
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.200
<v 1>Nobody's ever going to give a fuck about that. Cause I'll 16 and oh does is,</v>

542
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.100
well they went sick. Did they want this? Next thing is did they wait, go,

543
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.300
did they run the table now and then they lost the last one.

544
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.620
You know, something that actually having lived through that,

545
00:31:22.621 --> 00:31:24.690
why would I root that for that? For Golden State.

546
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.853
<v 4>I Dunno.</v>

547
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.950
You noticed there's something about Lebron that I actually feel bad about the

548
00:31:28.951 --> 00:31:32.760
guy. I feel bad for the guy. I don't know what his, you know,

549
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.430
he never seems to be on strong footing with the crowd.

550
00:31:35.431 --> 00:31:40.431
They always seem to somehow not like the guy and he's out there like superman

551
00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:41.580
every night. Um,

552
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:43.090
<v 6>okay.</v>

553
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.400
<v 4>Who's getting well? We brought it on them. His agent brought it on him.</v>

554
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:47.440
But that stupid fucking press conference,

555
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.043
<v 6>you know,</v>

556
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.760
<v 4>doing his whole fucking life story.</v>

557
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.050
And then you just got to decided to take my talents to south.

558
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.860
<v 1>She didn't even say he don't even say Miami.</v>

559
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.340
That was one of the worst worded fucking statements ever.

560
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.040
I've decided to take my talents to south beach.

561
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.330
It's like you're going to leave these pound puppy look and sad sacks and

562
00:32:09.331 --> 00:32:11.970
Cleveland freezing their fucking balls off.

563
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.190
You're going to talk about your talent and then you tell them them that you'd go

564
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.163
into the beach.

565
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.890
<v 4>You know what? I don't feel bad for him. Um,</v>

566
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:24.960
<v 1>I don't know. I really like Lebron, so I would like to see Lebron</v>

567
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:31.200
when one in Cleveland. It's great. He gets it for the city. But uh,

568
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.970
when he does, when it, if he does, I will.

569
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.780
I will really miss seeing those sets at Cleveland fence. That just funny to me.

570
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.190
I don't what it is about him. I don't feel bad from, and when they complain,

571
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:43.180
I just laugh.

572
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.450
<v 0>I usually have empathy. That's just something about him like, yeah,</v>

573
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.740
<v 1>no, it's like cubs, cubs fans. Some of them aren't.</v>

574
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.530
They're still mad at me for that time when I said White,

575
00:32:55.531 --> 00:32:59.640
the white sox fans were real fans and I was just taking a stab in the dark.

576
00:32:59.641 --> 00:33:04.200
I was just fucking around because this guy was talking about when the bears beat

577
00:33:04.201 --> 00:33:06.450
the fuck out of the Patriots in the Superbowl.

578
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.250
So I just did the oldest trick in the book. I just went divide and conquer.

579
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.690
And I just said that white sox fans were better than cubs fans and it worked.

580
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.030
You know what I mean? Years later somebody

581
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.470
<v 4>look, you know, they're their first place.</v>

582
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.550
What do you have to fucking one of the worst tendencies in the league.

583
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.163
<v 1>It's like, oh, whatever.</v>

584
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.740
Just go to your stupid game and take your fucking shirt off and act like you're

585
00:33:28.741 --> 00:33:29.640
in the big chill.

586
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.633
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

587
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:40.270
<v 1>Um, anyways, the cubs actually, it, that's,</v>

588
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:44.020
that's, that's the Theo Epstein fucking saga. You know what I mean?

589
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:49.090
Like what happened in the red sox after 2004 was then all of a sudden it was

590
00:33:49.091 --> 00:33:52.150
like, you know, when your favorite band is just, you know,

591
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.400
moving up the ladder right there, there.

592
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:55.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

593
00:33:55.870 --> 00:34:00.300
<v 0>I feel like gradually, you know, you know, they're playing clubs, local areas,</v>

594
00:34:00.301 --> 00:34:02.460
and they start going a little national, then they play big,

595
00:34:02.461 --> 00:34:06.540
and then they get all the way up to their best sell selling album ever.

596
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:10.950
And what always happens when a band that's been together for fucking 10 years,

597
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:14.970
they make it to the mountain top. What happens? The whole thing implodes.

598
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.940
Everybody goes their separate ways. Next thing you know,

599
00:34:17.941 --> 00:34:22.440
fucking David Lee Roth is singing just a Gigolo, right?

600
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.140
And Van Halen is singing about dreams with the fucking blue angels.

601
00:34:28.141 --> 00:34:31.770
Whatever happened, I don't remember. I tried to block it out. I was,

602
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.790
that fucking crushed me when they, when they broke up, um,

603
00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.640
it was the perfect front man for that fucking band.

604
00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:43.620
I Love Sammy Hagar on everything would come up. Um, anyways,

605
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.203
uh,

606
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:49.210
<v 1>you guys are gonna kill me. But I completely forget when I was fucking taught.</v>

607
00:34:49.211 --> 00:34:50.290
What the fuck was my point.

608
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.750
<v 0>I literally have to sway me. Scroll back up.</v>

609
00:34:53.751 --> 00:34:58.520
What the fuck was I just talking about? Oh, Theo Epstein. Jesus Christ. Um,

610
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.390
<v 4>Theo Epstein after like 2004, I think everybody wanted the credit.</v>

611
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.470
I think the fucking ownership was like no where the reason the 86 years curse

612
00:35:07.471 --> 00:35:09.810
ended. And Theo's like, well, what about me?

613
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:11.880
And then there was that weird thing where he kind of went,

614
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:16.950
he like left for like a week. And I remember thinking like, fuck

615
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.030
<v 3>yeah,</v>

616
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.610
<v 4>why couldn't they just get along? You know where we go again?</v>

617
00:35:20.611 --> 00:35:22.770
And then he came back and then,

618
00:35:22.771 --> 00:35:25.680
I dunno when everything imploded when the fuck it did. He ends up leaving.

619
00:35:25.681 --> 00:35:26.730
He goes to the cubs.

620
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.490
<v 0>I thought he left then decided to stay for a couple of years. I might be wrong,</v>

621
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.480
but he went with the cubs and I think that that was his ego thing.

622
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:38.610
And then the red sox won it. No, seven and, uh, 2013

623
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.690
<v 4>I believe. And that was our fuck you feel we can do it without you.</v>

624
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:44.910
So now I think for his ego,

625
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.480
he's trying to become the guy who ended the curse of the babe and the curse of

626
00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.800
the goat. And if he does that,

627
00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:54.110
I mean you'd have to say he's one of the greatest,

628
00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.400
whatever the fuck his position is. He's a GM. I don't know what it is. Um,

629
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.700
curse of the gold is so fucking stupid, you know what I mean?

630
00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:03.980
Get your livestock off of the fucking field.

631
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.023
<v 2>You know,</v>

632
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.480
<v 4>Chris is the babe was dumb enough. It's just like, no,</v>

633
00:36:10.481 --> 00:36:13.060
we made a bad fucking move. We're not a good franchise.

634
00:36:13.061 --> 00:36:16.720
And we weren't a good franchise. We did make good decisions with the Yankees.

635
00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.960
God bless them, did not make good decisions.

636
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.850
That guy was a major fucking racist and just refused until the last,

637
00:36:24.851 --> 00:36:29.260
either way though, we were the last team to, to finally admit,

638
00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:33.790
you know, I guess people from other races are worthy of looking at.

639
00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:37.150
And by then we, even then,

640
00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:39.550
I mean we suck when it was just all white people. I mean, I don't know.

641
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.600
What are you gonna do? Um, so anyways, uh, let,

642
00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:46.150
let's read some of the other questions here. I know I'm babbling this week.

643
00:36:46.151 --> 00:36:46.711
This is a,

644
00:36:46.711 --> 00:36:49.300
I'm a little outside my comfort zone without the microphone in the fucking

645
00:36:49.301 --> 00:36:53.830
headset. So, uh, the will all be fixed by a Thursday.

646
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.380
Okay. Vinyl. Hey Billy.

647
00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:00.520
I was at Madison Square Garden show and I seem to remember you mentioning

648
00:37:00.521 --> 00:37:04.990
releasing it, releasing it on vinyl. Is that still happening? Um, interesting.

649
00:37:04.991 --> 00:37:09.280
You should say that. I have the audio and I'm going through pictures right now.

650
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:12.670
And um, I am telling you right now,

651
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.430
I am going for big air on this one.

652
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.290
I am releasing the entire fucking show. I'm not editing anything out.

653
00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.650
I was happy from the second I got onto the second I left.

654
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.380
It was one of the greatest nights of my standup life.

655
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.320
I'm so happy that I have an audio recording of it.

656
00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.593
<v 2>Um,</v>

657
00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.780
<v 4>Cory Angelo, one of the greatest photographers I've met in this business,</v>

658
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.850
the greatest I should say, he took all the pictures and,

659
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.393
<v 2>um,</v>

660
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:44.530
<v 4>I, if I, if I do this right,</v>

661
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:49.820
it's going to be a sick ass fucking record. And, uh, I'm very, uh,

662
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.710
very excited to do it. I just have to do it the right way. Um,

663
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:59.480
what happens is if you want to get into the bullshit of the business is this

664
00:37:59.481 --> 00:38:03.320
happened with the one that I did at Carnegie Hall. What happens is,

665
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:08.380
is when you put out a standup special you get in business with somebody like

666
00:38:08.391 --> 00:38:11.960
comedy central or Netflix or HBO or whatever, you know,

667
00:38:11.961 --> 00:38:16.961
usually built into the contract is that you won't release any similar material.

668
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:22.820
Um, that's on the special for a specific period of time. And, um,

669
00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:23.600
<v 2>okay.</v>

670
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.530
<v 4>You know, I'm probably gonna do another special in November, which,</v>

671
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.080
you know, I did Madison Square Garden November of last year,

672
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:33.960
so there's gonna be enough overlap where I'm going to have to wait.

673
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.330
I believe I'll have wait a little bit. Um,

674
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.620
<v 0>I'll try to get around that because I haven't negotiated yet.</v>

675
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.930
It'd be nice if I could get around and be like, look, it's vinyl.

676
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.830
It's for fucking total comedy nerds. This isn't gonna Really. Um,

677
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.900
but then of course you can send up uploading and everywhere cause everything has

678
00:38:51.901 --> 00:38:54.090
to be fucking uploaded. And then the free,

679
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.530
I'm going to lose my fucking shirt on this, but I don't give a shit. Um,

680
00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.050
because I know there's people out there that appreciate the vinyl and that type

681
00:39:01.051 --> 00:39:02.510
of stuff and it's a really cool fucking, yeah.

682
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.520
<v 4>The thing to have. And, um, Oh man,</v>

683
00:39:06.521 --> 00:39:07.900
I'm going to spend some money on this.

684
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.000
I'm really gonna spend some money on this.

685
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:14.650
I really want to do this as first fucking class as I can.

686
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.860
And I was actually talking to somebody about it the other night.

687
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.330
I'm somebody who makes records and he was showing me some of the shit that he's

688
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:25.600
done and I was really impressed. So, um,

689
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.400
<v 0>I'm literally getting excited talking about it. So, uh,</v>

690
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:33.870
that's definitely happening when I can actually release the fucking thing is a

691
00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:38.850
completely different story. So, all right. Basic training.

692
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:41.380
<v 4>Uh, Billy bloom.</v>

693
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.210
<v 0>Uh,</v>

694
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.770
you mentioned in a throwback clip that you would only perform for the troops in

695
00:39:46.771 --> 00:39:50.700
the Middle East if you went through basic training and was taught how to kill a

696
00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:52.500
man. Well, at least how to shoot a fucking right

697
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.700
<v 1>gun. That's like my sphere.</v>

698
00:39:55.701 --> 00:40:00.701
I'm going into a fucking war zone and God forbid it gets overrun by a bunch of

699
00:40:01.971 --> 00:40:04.550
lunatics and my body,

700
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:09.110
God takes one for me and he's laying on the ground and there's his weapon.

701
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.600
And I'm like, I don't know how to work this

702
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:18.590
standing there like Bob hope with a fucking potter. You know, I just, you know,

703
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.630
I know the, and they always say this shit too.

704
00:40:20.631 --> 00:40:23.450
We've never lost anyone in all the wars that we've fought.

705
00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:27.020
We've never lost anyone. It's just like, dude, that's just like saying my,

706
00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:31.760
you know what? My car is running great. You don't say shit like that. Anyways,

707
00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:34.010
he said it was wondering if,

708
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.180
if that's as true as it was when you said it in 2008,

709
00:40:38.181 --> 00:40:42.650
I believe you're in better shape these days and perhaps so is the Middle East.

710
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:48.020
Uh, love you. Love Nia. Um, Nah. Yeah, I think at this point, you know,

711
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.090
look dude, when I saw over there,

712
00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:55.010
like when I was first thinking that that was back when shit was really bad and

713
00:40:55.011 --> 00:40:57.440
like contractors, you know,

714
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.160
wood had a rock in their shoe when they would stop for half a second to get it

715
00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:03.770
out and then they just disappeared. And then the next thing you know,

716
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.990
they're getting their heads sot off.

717
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.280
<v 0>I mean, one a fucking way to go. I mean, Jesus Christ,</v>

718
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.070
you know what I mean? And I both, so once, one thing I,

719
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.950
one of the reasons why I've been any success that I've had in life is I've

720
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.100
always understood what I suck at. Okay.

721
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:27.450
And I know I am not a marine. You can give me the camouflage shit. You know,

722
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.840
that dumb shit when people go out and go fucking, uh,

723
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.070
do shows for the troops and they take of

724
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.550
<v 1>you sitting in a jet or like in a fucking tank and you're wearing a helmet,</v>

725
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:40.610
you know, and for half a second you egos, I could do this. No,

726
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.490
you can't do that. It takes a special person to be able to do that.

727
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.470
And I know that's not me.

728
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.500
<v 5>Um, [inaudible]</v>

729
00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.210
<v 4>through Ashley, to really be honest with you.</v>

730
00:41:49.211 --> 00:41:52.540
I wouldn't want to go through basic training because I am a fucking lunatic to

731
00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:53.081
begin with.

732
00:41:53.081 --> 00:41:57.490
And the last thing I need to do is de-humanize any more people in my fucked up.

733
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.633
<v 1>Right.</v>

734
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.383
<v 5>Um,</v>

735
00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.210
<v 4>yes I am afraid of, of, you know, to,</v>

736
00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.050
to go down that rabbit hole of how fucking, how nuts am I. Okay.

737
00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.250
I like to feel that I'm a mainstream psycho, you know,

738
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.040
it's kind of like my drinking. Like I know I drank way too much,

739
00:42:18.041 --> 00:42:22.990
but I have it under control, but I know a couple of circumstance.

740
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.990
Well I'm too, I'm too vain to drink myself to death, but I could,

741
00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.460
I could definitely, uh, you know, I,

742
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.490
I know enough not, I knew enough not to fuck with hard drugs.

743
00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:39.190
Um, cause uh, I saw what they did to, you know,

744
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.451
like everybody,

745
00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:45.040
I think everybody in my country at this point at and t for,

746
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.850
I hate to say it at this point, you've, you've lost somebody to that.

747
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:53.950
And I've lost, uh, two people, two friends of mine outside of comedy,

748
00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:58.090
and then, uh, obviously a number of Comedians to that type of shit.

749
00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:03.180
And I'm both friends of mine and then comics that I was fans of in that type of

750
00:43:03.761 --> 00:43:05.740
shit. So I always knew not to fuck with that stuff,

751
00:43:05.741 --> 00:43:08.710
but as far as going over there, yeah, I would definitely do that.

752
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.790
I would definitely, um, do something like that, but, you know,

753
00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:15.640
when it was really fucking crazy over there and leave your comments or telling

754
00:43:15.641 --> 00:43:16.810
me the way they did,

755
00:43:16.811 --> 00:43:20.680
do those military landings where you like at 38,000 feet and a minute later

756
00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.660
you're on the ground. You know, I mean, it's,

757
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:25.960
it's scary enough landing in San Diego.

758
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.790
<v 1>I don't need somebody possibly shooting at me.</v>

759
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.093
<v 5>Um,</v>

760
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.060
<v 4>yeah. And I'm just being fucking honest. Do you know what I mean? So, uh,</v>

761
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:38.870
but at this point, yeah, no, I, I will, no problem. You know, Jesus,

762
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.050
if I ever fucking go over there and something happens to me and they play this

763
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:46.250
fucking audio, you know, they're gonna do it and all those fucking things. Um,

764
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:50.750
yeah. You know, going to war is, is it's not, that's the real deal.

765
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.370
And I know I don't have that in me fucking go over there with a Hawaiian shirt,

766
00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.050
but I am that son going over there with whoever the Marilyn Monroe is there

767
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.820
<v 1>and she's got this thing and you know,</v>

768
00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.800
happy birthday Mr General or whatever the fuck goes.

769
00:44:07.801 --> 00:44:10.800
I have no idea what happens on those shows. But um,

770
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:12.320
<v 5>okay.</v>

771
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:12.860
<v 1>I know like,</v>

772
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.860
like fucking rd Lange went to like already laying went into this shit in like

773
00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:20.940
Afghanistan, like fucking like crazy.

774
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:25.590
You would never catch me doing that. That guy's got more balls than,

775
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.430
than I would ever have. No. Um, but yeah,

776
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.950
I'll go to the big base that already has a best buy on it. I'll go to that one.

777
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.870
Whatever military base over there that already has a monorail, I'll,

778
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.900
I'll go to that one. Maybe like an Orange Julius. I'll check that one out.

779
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.740
But I, I would definitely do it without a doubt. All right, a name dropping.

780
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.603
Hey Bill.

781
00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.400
<v 4>Um,</v>

782
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.120
<v 1>I listened to the podcast every week, which means my wife does as well.</v>

783
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.450
<v 0>Oh Geez. Not another one of these. I know women hate me. Okay.</v>

784
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:56.340
I walked in the hotel today and this guy goes,

785
00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:58.150
I didn't know you weren't in town. I said, yeah, you know,

786
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.080
play of theater down the street. And he goes, uh, he goes, oh. He goes, yeah,

787
00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.180
I'm definitely going to go. He goes, you know, I'm going to go,

788
00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:07.650
I guess my girlfriend hate shit, but I'm going to go. It's just like, I get it.

789
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.490
I get it. I get it. I'm not going to change what the fuck I do though.

790
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.570
But I understand it. Here we go. Alright, so, okay, here. Here it comes.

791
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.250
How long before I get how,

792
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.210
<v 1>how much do I have to read before I find out that she hates me? All right,</v>

793
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.550
last week you said you didn't want to write.

794
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.580
You didn't want to name drop your friends name in a band. Um,

795
00:45:28.581 --> 00:45:33.020
this started my wife down a path of questioning and thought,

796
00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.900
I'll quote her. Who is bill scared of?

797
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.160
You would think he's still on a playground in waiting to get beat up at the x

798
00:45:40.161 --> 00:45:44.330
out of order. He's Bill Burke. Who's going to give them shit.

799
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.040
Um, she has a good point. I totally understand why you do that,

800
00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.820
but you'd have to drop a dozen big names that didn't even matter,

801
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.520
<v 4>but what,</v>

802
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.350
<v 1>but you have to drop a dozen big names that didn't even matter into a story</v>

803
00:45:57.351 --> 00:45:59.720
every week for a year. For anyone to think of you

804
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.590
<v 4>as a name dropper.</v>

805
00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.560
<v 1>Uh, you're the best. Come back to Rhode Island. Um,</v>

806
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.240
you know why you don't do it? Because

807
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:13.140
<v 4>people who are in the public eye, there's like this sort of like, there's a, a,</v>

808
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:17.150
there's an unwritten fucking rule that when you're hanging out with them,

809
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:20.510
you're hanging out with them and then it doesn't become a fucking podcast story.

810
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.920
You don't fucking tweet about it. You know, you know,

811
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:28.730
and you don't ask for a picture because that's what their life is.

812
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:34.250
And I know people that have fucked that up. I've got a buddy of mine,

813
00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:39.830
all right, he was golfing and

814
00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.400
<v 0>ah, he got put in this for some, with one of his favorite actors.</v>

815
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:47.450
And it turned out the actor was a fan of his and they were having a great

816
00:46:47.451 --> 00:46:51.140
fucking time. All right. Just shooting the shit being normal.

817
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:52.010
<v 4>And in the end</v>

818
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.720
<v 0>the guy goes, yeah, that's great man. I'd love to come out to a show.</v>

819
00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.140
<v 4>And</v>

820
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.660
<v 0>instead of saying, all right, give me a number. Uh,</v>

821
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:04.640
I'll text you next time I'm in town. He goes, great. He goes, is it hey, is it,

822
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:08.930
is it cool if I get a photo? And he said, the guy's face just fucking dropped.

823
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:12.990
And was just like, yeah, man. Yeah, okay. Yeah, let's do,

824
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.870
I don't want to do that. You book

825
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.330
<v 1>like, I don't mind, you know,</v>

826
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.180
unless I'm trying to get to a bar before it closes.

827
00:47:22.181 --> 00:47:23.900
Those are only the Times that I bug it. Yeah.

828
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:25.700
<v 4>You know, bothers me that somebody wants,</v>

829
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.980
<v 0>it's, it's way better. Somebody wants a picture than nobody gives</v>

830
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.030
<v 4>a fuck. But I'm also at a cool level of just being known.</v>

831
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.430
I'm known enough that I can sell tickets on the road,

832
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.340
but like I can walk down the street, nobody fucks with me. Right.

833
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.960
But those people that are at that other level, you know what I mean,

834
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:46.930
where they can't leave the fucking house, you know,

835
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.320
if you're hanging out with them, you don't go blabbing about it on a podcast.

836
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:53.970
It's a, it's to put it bluntly,

837
00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:56.490
it's really fucking tacky and it's not professional.

838
00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:01.410
And not to mention you come off like a namedropping cunt, you know,

839
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.690
I actually had somebody do that to me one time.

840
00:48:03.691 --> 00:48:07.500
I fucking had no this shit on me. You know, somebody, uh,

841
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.860
I was having this debate with somebody and then ended up fucking writing

842
00:48:10.861 --> 00:48:12.840
something about it afterwards. It was just like, oh, you know,

843
00:48:12.841 --> 00:48:16.110
I thought we were just a couple of comics hanging out. You know,

844
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.800
I was just like, and just, I dunno,

845
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:25.010
I just gross is all I thought like that was fucking gross.

846
00:48:25.381 --> 00:48:26.460
Cause now I thought that, you know,

847
00:48:26.461 --> 00:48:29.400
we actually would talk and human being to human being and now you're trying to

848
00:48:29.401 --> 00:48:33.630
get turning into something, you know? I don't know.

849
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.550
It's gross. That's why I don't do it. All right. Um, alright.

850
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.450
Wedding song. Dear Billy Cock ring bearer.

851
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:49.240
<v 1>Oh Jesus. He's a, I'm getting married this year.</v>

<v 1>And my fiance and I are trying to figure out songs for the wedding.</v>

854
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.680

857
00:49:05.741 --> 00:49:07.300
We appreciate your insight.

858
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:08.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

859
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.450
<v 4>Oh my God, I can't write,</v>

860
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:15.070
but the person just wrote Jesus Christ easy with the homophobia.

861
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:17.470
There said go fuck yourself. Um,

862
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.360
I, I don't fuck dude, I listen to hair metal man.

863
00:49:23.361 --> 00:49:26.300
You don't have to listen to me. I don't know. Something from great white

864
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:32.840
about White Lion. I'm one of those white bands was,

865
00:49:32.841 --> 00:49:36.170
it was white snake, white lion and great white.

866
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.420
Uh, that's like when they had all the number of bands right. Mary?

867
00:49:41.421 --> 00:49:44.960
Three and four, three 11, some 41.

868
00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.910
Uh, that off the fuck they all right. What songs should you come?

869
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.290
I would think the song that both of you guys like, I have no idea.

870
00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:00.620
Uh, your wedding starts. All right.

871
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.633
You coming in.

872
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

873
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:07.070
<v 4>I Dunno. I'd say some from Lou Rawls, lady love,</v>

874
00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:08.761
you know,

875
00:50:08.761 --> 00:50:11.700
although he's kind of suggesting an open relationship a little bit if you really

876
00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:16.120
listen to it. Um, anyways, I don't fucking know. That's a weird one.

877
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.480
I have no idea. I don't know what kind of music you're into.

878
00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.450
How about something from Cinderella? Speaking of which, um, from my generation,

879
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.120
<v 0>um, I just found out the drummer from mega death</v>

880
00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.670
<v 2>died last night. Um,</v>

881
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:38.880
was it Nick Menza that his name? Yeah,

882
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.350
<v 0>ex Megadeath drummer.</v>

883
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:45.690
Nick Menzie collapses and dies on stage 51 fucking years old.

884
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.553
That's it.

885
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.973
<v 2>Um,</v>

886
00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.450
<v 0>was like three songs and he was at that place, the baked potato,</v>

887
00:50:52.451 --> 00:50:56.200
which I have never been to. It's a legendary music venue.

888
00:50:56.201 --> 00:50:59.470
Like if you ever come out to La and you want to go to a cool music venue and

889
00:50:59.471 --> 00:51:01.990
possibly see some huge fucking musician,

890
00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.610
just basically jamming with a bunch of people from other bands or studio

891
00:51:06.611 --> 00:51:10.750
musicians, that's the place to go to. I've never been, I don't know why.

892
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:15.190
I just always end up being busy having to do a standup show. But, um,

893
00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.140
fortunately he, uh, he died, uh, 51, you're going to be 52 years old,

894
00:51:20.141 --> 00:51:23.780
which is a, it is way too young in general,

895
00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:27.110
but when you're going to be 48, next month is pretty fucking scary.

896
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:33.000
Way off the fucking chicken case of S. Um, all right, here we go.

897
00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:37.410
French music recommendation. Hey Gian lay rouge. Uh,

898
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.280
I know you're working on your French skills and you're always looking for music.

899
00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:45.750
So I thought I'd give you a two, a twofer. Check out an artist's name.

900
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:50.650
Strong mayor. That's how you say it. Strong mayor.

901
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.350
<v 1>Nope. Like God, I'm an idiot. Oh my God.</v>

902
00:51:57.351 --> 00:52:01.040
I'm a fucking idiot. It's Straw Mae and then it was dash.

903
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.140
<v 0>You're welcome. I thought that your was part of it.</v>

904
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:08.640
I though it was strong mayor, but it's Romae. You're welcome.

905
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:12.360
<v 1>Oh my God. What a fucking dope. Uh,</v>

906
00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.980
every time I think I find the bottom of my stupidity,

907
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.590
then there's a whole nother floor. Um, anyways,

908
00:52:18.591 --> 00:52:22.550
he's from Belgium and his stuff has a really diverse set of influence,

909
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.550
influences. But besides that, the music is amazing.

910
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:27.860
Even if you have no idea what the fuck he's saying.

911
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:31.310
I'm not a native French speaker. Wait, he's from Belgium,

912
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:33.840
but he sings in French. Anyways, he goes, well,

913
00:52:33.841 --> 00:52:36.630
my family spent some time in Belgium when I was a kid.

914
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.630
I've forgotten a lot of my French over the years and listening to this as

915
00:52:39.631 --> 00:52:40.800
bringing all back to me.

916
00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.673
<v 2>Uh,</v>

917
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:49.420
<v 0>it says bone bone shanks, Canard. It's double.</v>

918
00:52:49.421 --> 00:52:53.260
And I know Bernard has duck. So c. O, n. N. A. R. D. I don't know what that is.

919
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.273
<v 2>Is it?</v>

920
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.740
<v 1>Probably, if it says good luck, fuck face, I have no dick or something.</v>

921
00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.760
I don't know. Come back to New York City soon. That makes no sense to me that,

922
00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:03.000
yeah,

923
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.500
<v 0>we're in Belgium and you learned how to feed, speak French.</v>

924
00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:10.570
I thought you'd be able to talk to a young club on down the muscles from

925
00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:14.950
Brussels. Right. All right girl. Wow. This guy tried to ride.

926
00:53:14.951 --> 00:53:17.980
Girl is fucking with my head and she's so fucking with his head.

927
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:21.550
He wrote girl girls if fucking with my head,

928
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:26.700
a dear Billy bats. Um, a few months ago,

929
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:31.730
<v 1>my waitress at a Mexican restaurant caught my eye with her cute smile and warm</v>

930
00:53:32.711 --> 00:53:33.544
personality.

931
00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:37.930
I asked her out and things are going great after two dates we were having sex

932
00:53:37.931 --> 00:53:40.600
and I love spending time with her and making her laugh.

933
00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:45.130
She's also joining the air force and she used to ask me advice because I'm in

934
00:53:45.131 --> 00:53:46.150
the marine reserves.

935
00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:50.620
I didn't see her during her final week and late on Saturday during my drill

936
00:53:50.621 --> 00:53:51.071
weekend,

937
00:53:51.071 --> 00:53:55.690
she was texting that she was a terrible person and she was never going to amount

938
00:53:55.691 --> 00:54:00.010
to anything. Sounds like she fucked around with Anya. I'm sorry.

939
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.630
That's just my paradigm.

940
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:06.190
I consoled her and she sent a two page text while I was asleep

941
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:12.030
at 6:00 AM the next morning I woke up to the text that read this has been eating

942
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:16.440
away at me and I had a few glasses of wine and can't hold it in. Uh,

943
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.670
Eric comes on Wednesday.

944
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:22.671
I had lunch with my old friend with benefits and I ended up blowing him.

945
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:28.300
I'm so sorry. I like you so much and I feel horrible the next day.

946
00:54:28.301 --> 00:54:31.630
I asked a few details about the incidents.

947
00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:33.603
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

948
00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.870
<v 1>we are using your hand to crank in the chef. Um,</v>

949
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.880
I asked a few questions about the incident and said she had a strange way of

950
00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:46.760
showing affection towards me.

951
00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:51.410
I told her I didn't want to see her anymore and deleted all of her contact into

952
00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:53.720
my info from my phone and blocked her number.

953
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.013
<v 6>Perfect.</v>

954
00:54:55.830 --> 00:55:00.450
<v 1>Am I being too hard? Is it really so hard to not suck a dick?</v>

955
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.770
I've never had the urge.

956
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.800
She even told me not to cheat on her and then does this.

957
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.160
I probably should've seen it coming because apparently cheat also had a

958
00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:13.460
threesome with two guys. She seemed so nice though.

959
00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.570
This is the first time I'd been cheated on in this fucking with my head. I'm 23.

960
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.790
This shouldn't be that big of a deal,

961
00:55:19.791 --> 00:55:23.140
but my confidence took a serious blow here. No Pun intended. Um,

962
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.850
<v 4>hey dude, you know</v>

963
00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.970
<v 1>that that happened to me at least three times in my life that I'm aware of women</v>

964
00:55:31.971 --> 00:55:36.470
fucking sheet too. All right. I mean, everybody knows that guys are dogs,

965
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:41.010
<v 4>but women do it. Fuck it too. All right. And um, how many,</v>

966
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:42.810
fuck I didn't want to get it. It's just,

967
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.753
<v 6>no,</v>

968
00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.950
<v 4>the only reason right now where you're questioning it might being so hard on it.</v>

969
00:55:47.951 --> 00:55:50.560
That's just your feelings talking because you miss her. But Dude,

970
00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.440
you did the right thing. It deleted her shit. It told the fuck off.

971
00:55:53.441 --> 00:55:56.890
That's a big time. Self esteem move and uh,

972
00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:01.420
you're only 23 years old. You've got a bunch of great women in your future.

973
00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:05.740
Um, I'm not saying fuck her as far as her as a person,

974
00:56:05.741 --> 00:56:09.100
but just forget her as far as like someone that you can have a relationship

975
00:56:09.101 --> 00:56:11.710
with, but you know, she's obviously working out some stuff

976
00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:17.320
<v 1>and uh, you know, she, you know,</v>

977
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.700
she's on her path. Your on your path and a,

978
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.870
you're not looking for that sounds like

979
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:28.700
<v 4>and uh, yeah, just, just move on. You did the right fucking thing. You know,</v>

980
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:33.860
allow yourself to be sad and go through the shit and all that, you know,

981
00:56:33.861 --> 00:56:36.920
don't do the dumb guy thing where you just try to shut off your feelings,

982
00:56:36.921 --> 00:56:40.580
go through the failings, fucking cry it out of you when no one's around.

983
00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:44.270
They'll make it awkward for other fucking people. And then, uh,

984
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:49.250
you know, just don't fuck with anybody for awhile, you know,

985
00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:53.560
figure out what the fuck you want to do next. But don't go back Dora.

986
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:58.430
You can't go back to her. Um, yeah, I wouldn't do that.

987
00:56:58.431 --> 00:57:00.080
Plus, you know, she's joining the fucking air force.

988
00:57:00.081 --> 00:57:02.680
You're going the marines anyways. You know,

989
00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:06.420
you can't tell me this. You can go,

990
00:57:06.421 --> 00:57:07.980
you're going to probably go around the fucking world.

991
00:57:07.981 --> 00:57:10.530
You're going to meet all kinds of beautiful women. She actually made a long way.

992
00:57:10.531 --> 00:57:14.310
She probably did you a favor and I'll tell you right now that is as positive as

993
00:57:14.311 --> 00:57:18.600
I can spin that. Cause I know it sucks. It sucks. You know,

994
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.360
what are you going to do? All right. Um,

995
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:28.130
sometimes I want it where the hell wasn't as before I wrap this up here. Uh,

996
00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:31.970
people keep asking me about the, uh, the European tour. And here's the thing,

997
00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:37.100
I am not allowed to say what the dates are. It's definitely happening,

998
00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.100
but I can be vague about it at this point.

999
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:43.610
I heard a rumor that it might start

1000
00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.010
the end of July, like the very end of July,

1001
00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.290
like maybe the last day of July.

1002
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.930
And I heard that it might go through, I don't know,

1003
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:58.280
mid August

1004
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.990
like Mo actually August 8th, maybe to the 10th.

1005
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.020
It all fucking depends. All right.

1006
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.350
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1007
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:13.350
<v 4>And the rumor is that it might start in a city that in country that rhymes with</v>

1008
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:20.570
Mumblin fire island and then it might go to a city

1009
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:25.750
that rhymes with a healthcast.

1010
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:32.260
Oh. And then there's another one, a hallway,

1011
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.690
Maryland. I'm not allowed to release any of this information.

1012
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.640
Then I might go to pistol. Uh, Finland

1013
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:47.170
can fester England,

1014
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:53.070
Munden England Hash Hamster Cam.

1015
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:53.903
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1016
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:57.510
<v 4>Federal lands. It, uh,</v>

1017
00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:02.400
what the fuck can a routing is that then I go up to f fed borough.

1018
00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.140
Uh, Hartland possibly.

1019
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.620
That might, that might be it. I'm not allowed to say, but, uh,

1020
00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.330
I don't know when we're going to do this thing,

1021
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:19.110
but I will tell you that I thought I was going to Belgium and as of right now,

1022
00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.280
if that's not on the list,

1023
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:23.210
which is really bugging me because I really wanted to go there.

1024
00:59:23.211 --> 00:59:25.820
So I'm hoping that maybe I can, uh,

1025
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.070
<v 0>we'll see. I mean the amount of cities that we got offers,</v>

1026
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.720
<v 4>um, if I'm still gonna remain married, uh, I have to break it up into three,</v>

1027
00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.450
three tours. So I think I'm going to do

1028
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:46.510
this one and then maybe I'll do the Scandinavian one with Belgium on that one

1029
00:59:46.511 --> 00:59:48.010
and then an eastern European one.

1030
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.170
I don't know how long it's going to take me to do all of those,

1031
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:55.470
but I definitely plan on doing them and I'm extremely excited about getting over

1032
00:59:55.631 --> 01:00:00.100
there. There's a lot of cities there that I've never played to and um,

1033
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.250
<v 0>I dunno, like I can't wait to get over that. Plus, you know,</v>

1034
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:05.450
it's going to be great for me.

1035
01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:08.660
It's gonna feel like a summer vacation because we'll be done writing all 10

1036
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.800
episodes ofF is for family. So anyways, that's, um,

1037
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.370
that is the podcast for this week. Uh, once again, thank you.

1038
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:18.920
Everybody came out in Calgary, Edmonton and Seattle tonight.

1039
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:23.140
This has been a great three day run. And, um, the arguing,

1040
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.900
I gotta tell you Seattle Zoo in all these areas up here,

1041
01:00:26.901 --> 01:00:28.970
once you live out in a fucking desert, man, it's just,

1042
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.610
I always look down as the planes landing going,

1043
01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:33.950
what if I live in that house right fucking there.

1044
01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.393
<v 5>You know,</v>

1045
01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.150
<v 4>somehow I was able to fucking exist in show business and not live out in la,</v>

1046
01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.940
which I eventually, maybe we'll be able to do. But then what am I going to do?

1047
01:00:42.941 --> 01:00:43.870
I gotta be in the Writers Room.

1048
01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.180
<v 5>Um,</v>

1049
01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.520
<v 4>eventually I'll be that guy. I'm going to be that guy. Eventually.</v>

1050
01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:51.430
I'm going to be living next to a fucking lake in the middle of nowhere

1051
01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.213
<v 5>and, uh,</v>

1052
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.110
<v 0>staring at a wall, drinking myself to death. All right, that's it everybody.</v>

1053
01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:01.160
That's the podcast. I'm going to watch the, uh, the booze game. Um,

1054
01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.310
we'll see what happens here and, uh,

1055
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.900
go fuck yourselves and I will check in on you on a Thursday. All right.

1056
01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:09.380
See you.
