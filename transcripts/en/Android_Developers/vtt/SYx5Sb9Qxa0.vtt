00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.402
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:07.610
AVI MUCHNIK: I'm Avi Muchnik.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm one of the
co-founders of Aviary.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.610
There are thousands of photo
editing apps out there.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.309
What we've always looked to
do is simplify the experience

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.420
for the end user.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.820
We want something
that, no matter

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.860
what your background in tech is,
you could just literally pick

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.320
it up and in less
than six seconds

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.076
understand how to use it and
make your photos look great.

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:27.450
One of the most amazing things
about the Android platform

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.180
is our communication
with our users.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.049
It's not really us responding
to bug reports that we see.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.250
It's really this
ongoing two-way dialogue

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.370
we have with people,
both through beta tests

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.040
and also through
ratings and reviews.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.210
We can see things as they're
happening in real time.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.660
We can talk with our
community to find out

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.940
what features they like
and what they don't like,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.240
and what things they would
love to see in the app

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.115
that we haven't even
thought of and implement

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:47.910
that in real time.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.076
OLIVIA SCHAFER: Working
with the Android Dev Console

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:52.440
has been amazing compared
to other platforms.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.600
In particular,
with Android we are

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.334
able to see metrics about them.

00:00:56.334 --> 00:00:57.750
We're able to
search through them.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.950
We're able to actually
respond to users.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.270
With the new tools, I
would say that we're

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.650
able to identify
issues twice as fast.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.060
It makes it easy
for us to search

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.950
through the reviews,
contact users when

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.800
we need to get more information
from them, and just in general,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.930
it has saved me a
tremendous amount of time,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.505
anywhere between 5
to 10 hours a week.

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:17.880
BLAKE DARLING:
Android in general

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.040
is usually impactful
to the Aviary team.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.930
It's over 2/3 of our user base.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.400
We use Search Within
Reviews every day.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.420
We use it to validate
new features.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.310
For example, we recently
released a new Discover

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.840
feature.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.950
We'll search Discover to
see what users are saying

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.740
about that and let us
know if they like it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.114
or if there are
problems with it,

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:38.150
and that helps us make
product decisions.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.390
The Ratings and Reviews feature
has been immensely impactful,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.880
having the ability to quickly
drill into issues by device,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.070
by app version, by Android
version, and then also

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.770
anecdotally, sift through
what users are saying

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.580
and the actual
words they're using

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.110
is pretty unique
to the platform.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.521
And it helps us develop
much more quickly.

00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.770
OLIVIA SCHAFER: Responding
to users in the Dev Console

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.180
has been immensely
impactful for us.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.620
For instance, recently
we released a version

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.810
that resolved a pretty
major bug that was

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.360
affecting many of our users.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.155
I went into the Dev
Console, responded

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:14.280
to all of the people who
were experiencing the bug,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.255
and about 50% of them actually
went back in and ended up

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:18.214
updating the interview.

00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:19.588
AVI MUCHNIK: One
of things I love

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:22.060
about building for the Android
platform is how quickly we

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.650
can test and deploy on it.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.210
We have this fantastic
beta community on Android

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.870
that can test out new features.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.080
BLAKE DARLING: And
that helps us identify

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.640
bugs or what features they
like or don't like much more

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.230
quickly.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.320
Being able to do that allows us
to iterate two to three times

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.690
faster on Android compared
to other platforms, which is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.260
usually impactful for our app.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.430
Photo Editor by
Aviary is meant to be

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.070
a dead simple but powerful
photo editing tool.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.974
Having that dialogue
with our users

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:53.390
through the tools the Developer
Console and the Play Store

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.030
gives us, we're able
to iterate much faster

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.100
and deliver on an easy,
simple interface, which

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.820
is really powerful for us.
