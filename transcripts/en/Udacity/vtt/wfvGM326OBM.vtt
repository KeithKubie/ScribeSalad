00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:06.150
Around 80% of all Asians have an allele of ADH that increases the activity 40

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.572
to a 100 times that above normal. And about 50% of all Asians have an allele of

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:16.040
ALDH2 that slows its activity significantly. And this

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.470
all results in an accumulation of the toxic

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.880
product, acetaldehyde and prevalence of the alcohol flush

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.590
reaction in Asian populations. The increase in acetaldehyde

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.870
base side effects is so prevalent that it makes

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.620
the drinking of alcohol far less enjoyable than many

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.280
other populations find it to be. As a result

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.080
alcoholism rates are actually much lower in Asian populations

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.200
where we have a high prevalence of the alcohol

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.210
flush reactions. Based on this mechanism of action, a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.080
drug's been developed called Disulfiram. That is used to

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.075
treat alcoholism, by inducing the negative side effects of drinking.

00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:55.040
Namely, the sickness reaction that happens in alcohol flush. So

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.830
if Disulfiram inhibits one of these proteins. Do you think it's

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.440
most like to inhibit ADH or ALDH2? Pick one of

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.660
those answers and tell me why in the text box here.
