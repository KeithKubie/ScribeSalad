00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.520
Guys… are you staying that far back because
I smell?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.630
It’s only been three days!

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.779
And I dry shampooed!

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:17.150
Hey guys, a non-smelly Amy with you on DNews
today taking on a topic we’ve all dealt

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.460
with one way or another: gross stinky body
odor.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.220
Let’s start with the basic fact.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.220
We all smell.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.220
And it’s because of skin.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.300
Our skin is our largest body organ, varying
from person to person but on average it’s

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.430
about 21 square feet of surface area.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.050
It’s layered to protect our delicate organs
from dangerous germs and bacteria while also

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.550
keeping in moisture, basically making it an
excellent barrier between our internal selves

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.800
and the outside world.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.820
And that barrier varies in its topography
and texture.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.579
There are folds, valleys, little niches, and
it’s all home to a thriving ecosystem of

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.690
bacteria.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.200
Some of the bacteria on your skin can cause
nasty infections, but other bacteria actually

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.240
fights off the bad microbes, keeping you healthy.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.879
And that in itself is a finely tuned system;
any disruption can cause skin disorders or

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.070
infections.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.939
Skin also has loads and loads of sweat glands.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.850
One kind are called eccrine glands and they're
everywhere.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.109
These are the ones that continually bathe
our skin in a salty-watery secretion, known

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.829
as sweat, to cool us off.

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.950
They can also release fluid that acidifies
the skin, keeping the growth of microorganisms

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.950
in check.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.530
Another kind of sweat glands are the apocrine
glands.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.679
These are found mainly in notoriously sweaty
and odorous areas like armpits and groins.

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.200
They respond to adrenaline and emotional stress,
secreting a milky fluid that’s also thought

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
to contain pheromones.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.159
So there’s a lot of fluid going on with
skin, but that’s not the culprit of stink;

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.140
sweat itself is actually odourless.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.689
The smell factors comes in because as we sweat,
the moisture gets into all those skin folds

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.829
and nooks and crannies where there’s also
plenty of bacteria.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.380
And a moist, closed environment is bacteria’s
happy place.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.029
They thrive in spots like armpits, eat compounds
found in sweat, and produce molecules that

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:58.959
we smell and know as body odor.

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.560
And there’s more to it.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.929
Diet can affect your unique odor.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.990
Foods high in sulphur like broccoli and cauliflower
release compounds secreted in sweat that can

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.350
make you smell worse, sort of like rancid
butter.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.190
Meat also changes body odor.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.330
One study actually found that vegetarian men’s
sweat smells more appealing to women than

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.090
their meat-eating brethren’s.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.420
Alcohol can seep out through your pores if
you over imbibe, making you smell, well, like

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.420
a drunk.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.360
But let’s say you have an average diet,
don’t drink too much, and lead a pretty

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.000
standard lifestyle without engaging in especially
sweaty activities.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.620
How long until you really start to noticeably
stink?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.430
Well, it varies from person to person because
no two people are the same.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.490
But a few days without showering, deodorant,
or basic washing will probably start to get

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.280
unpleasant for people around you.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.460
But it's possible to push through the smell
phase and get to a no-smell phase.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.820
Eventually your body will settle into a happy
arrangement of bacteria that keeps itself,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.120
and your smell, in check.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.230
Because, really, we didn't adapt to need perfumes
and deodorants and body lotions…

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.290
It’s social convention that tells us to
manage our natural human smell.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.470
You know who doesn’t stink?

And speaking of smelly, I’ve heard it smelled
pretty bad on board the Apollo spacecraft

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.030
during missions to the Moon, not surprising
when you realize they were pooping and eating

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.360
smelly things like tuna in that thing!

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.750
