00:00:06.096 --> 00:00:08.856
&gt;&gt;Anna: The first talking point
we're going to use is this one.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.476
Boys shouldn't wear pink
or play with dolls.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:12.556
Off you go.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:21.736
&gt;&gt;Student: I disagree, boys can wear
pink and boys can play with dollies.

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:22.256
It's their choice, if they--

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:25.316
&gt;&gt;Lucy: The wellbeing
curriculum has a big impact

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:26.766
on their social skills
and their behavior.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.516
It gives them a language to
resolve problems or explain emotions

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:31.106
that are very complex, and that
then does facilitate learning

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:31.976
in the classroom, which is really key.

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:35.276
&gt;&gt;Student: What's the difference?

00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:35.956
We're all human.

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:45.156
&gt;&gt;Peter: Wellbeing is incredibly
important to this school,

00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:46.796
and I think the center of what we do.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:50.926
Students are exploring in a really
sophisticated way their emotions,

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:55.316
their qualities, what's getting in the
way of their learning and getting on.

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:57.456
So it's building up their confidence.

00:00:57.746 --> 00:01:01.556
&gt;&gt;Lucy: Wellbeing is really
a focus on the emotional,

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.186
social and behavior of children.

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:08.776
We have a curriculum, it's around areas
like identity, growth, confidence,

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:11.166
kindness, and we have these big themes.

00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:14.786
&gt;&gt;Aaishah: I think wellbeing is
not judging people by the outside,

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:17.096
but judging them from
the inside instead.

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:21.806
It teaches you loads of things and
it's about being respectful to others.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.916
&gt;&gt;Lucy: We focus on how we can help
children understand the things they

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:30.036
feel, the things that happen around
them, and give a voice to it.

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:31.516
&gt;&gt;Student: If I say that, "Oh,

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:35.946
I don't like your skin
color," you can't say that.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.496
&gt;&gt;Anna: Does skin color tell you
much about a person on the inside?

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:39.816
&gt;&gt;Students: No.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:46.036
&gt;&gt;Student: If someone was rude to
somebody, and that rude person judged

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:51.446
that person, it won't be nice,
so it has to be a fair world.

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:54.376
&gt;&gt;Lucy: We primarily
deliver our wellbeing

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:55.836
through our assembly structure.

00:01:56.806 --> 00:02:00.226
&gt;&gt;Amy: Each week, we'll begin
with a kind of larger assembly,

00:02:00.296 --> 00:02:03.006
and we'll introduce the
wellbeing topic for the week.

00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:06.806
This term, we're thinking
about diversity.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:11.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We investigated how we were
each unique, and how that wonderful mix

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:15.486
of people made up this
diversity in our society.

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:21.966
And today, we're going to look at
another piece of that, culture.

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:25.356
&gt;&gt;Alexia: So sometimes in assembly, we
talk about our culture, like how we are

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:27.926
from different countries,
how we eat and celebrations.

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:32.536
&gt;&gt;Student: You can see culture
by the way people dress.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:35.996
&gt;&gt;Student: Some Muslim people, they have

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:39.416
to wear certain clothes
for their culture.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:43.076
&gt;&gt;Amy: In class that week, children
continue discussing that theme

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:45.546
to get a little bit deeper
into that topic.

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:50.536
&gt;&gt;Lucy: We are very responsive and very
fluid to the needs of our children.

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:54.416
So for example, issues that come up
in the playground, or in their lives

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:56.676
that we want to tackle
and give them a voice for.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:59.686
&gt;&gt;Anna: I had some occasions in my class

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.796
where there were some real
misconceptions with race.

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:04.386
And so we're talking
about culture this week,

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:07.006
but let's talk about the
judgements that people make,

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.926
and how that can be a positive thing,
how that could be very damaging.

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:12.626
We would start with a
stimulus, pictures,

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:14.306
or a short film, or a piece of music.

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:16.596
&gt;&gt;I'm going to show you
a picture of a man,

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:20.206
and I want you to think what
word pops into your head

00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:22.346
when you look at that photo, ready?

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:23.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Bad.

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:23.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Bad.

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:24.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Tough.

00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:25.856
&gt;&gt;Student: Robber.

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:26.176
&gt;&gt;Student: Rude.

00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:27.236
&gt;&gt;Student: Cruel.

00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:31.216
&gt;&gt;I'm going to show a picture of another
man, ad I want you to do the same thing.

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:31.886
Off you go.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:32.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Life saving.

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:33.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Gentle.

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:34.616
&gt;&gt;Student: Peaceful.

00:03:34.896 --> 00:03:35.676
&gt;&gt;Student: Smart.

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:36.296
&gt;&gt;Student: Helpful.

00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:37.216
&gt;&gt;Student: Kind.

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:39.446
&gt;&gt;Anna: They are the same person.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:40.856
&gt;&gt;Student: I thought so.

00:03:40.856 --> 00:03:41.866
&gt;&gt;Student: I knew it.

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:43.856
&gt;&gt;Anna: So this is our topic for today.

00:03:44.436 --> 00:03:47.126
You can't judge a book by its cover.

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:50.606
&gt;&gt;Lucy: So the teacher might
start with an image or a poem,

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:54.136
and then she will ask the children,
what questions come out from this?

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:56.596
And they have to be really
big philosophical questions.

00:03:56.596 --> 00:03:58.816
It's like, is it okay
to leave someone out?

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:01.766
What would happen if everyone
in the world was the same?

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:04.126
We then write them down
and then the children vote

00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:05.326
on which one they'd like to discuss.

00:04:05.706 --> 00:04:07.376
&gt;&gt;Anna: We're going to
vote with our feet.

00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:12.496
It looks like this one has the majority,

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:14.696
so everybody could take
their seat again, please.

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:17.456
&gt;&gt;Lucy: Sometimes there's a question
that really grabs their imagination.

00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:20.546
They start to discuss it,
build on each other's ideas.

00:04:20.546 --> 00:04:23.806
&gt;&gt;Student: Sometimes when you judge
someone, it could make them sad.

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:28.116
For example, if I said to
someone, "Look at that person.

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:33.256
They have weird tattoos and all of
that, so maybe I should run away,"

00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:36.116
it could maybe hurt their
feelings inside.

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:37.236
You never know.

00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:38.816
&gt;&gt;Anna: True, okay, yes, Kaden.

00:04:38.906 --> 00:04:42.786
&gt;&gt;Student: If no one was judging
people, no problems would happen,

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:46.906
but I also think that everyone
has a little bit of judge in them.

00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:48.686
&gt;&gt;Anna: Interesting, mm.

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.536
&gt;&gt;Amy: Through the different
wellbeing topics that we cover

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:54.076
and having the opportunity
to discuss those ideas,

00:04:54.396 --> 00:04:57.276
they're able to understand
other people's viewpoints,

00:04:57.276 --> 00:04:59.936
and that's what helps you form
your own ideas about the world.

00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:02.866
&gt;&gt;Student: It doesn't mean
because peoples have a skin color,

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:05.406
it doesn't mean that
you're not the same.

00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:08.066
Everybody's people, because--

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:11.096
&gt;&gt;Anna: It's developing their grit
and their ability to persevere

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:12.216
when something's challenging.

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:15.556
The progress that the children
I'm teaching now is phenomenal,

00:05:15.856 --> 00:05:17.316
but it's not just about that.

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:20.576
It's about how best you can equip
them to deal with the world.
