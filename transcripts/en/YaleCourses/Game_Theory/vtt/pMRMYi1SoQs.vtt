1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.820
All right.
So last time

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.550
we started to study in perfect competition,

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.810
we looked at the Cornell model,
but the bigger theme,

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.733
<v 1>yeah.</v>

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.760
<v 0>The bigger theme is the study of how firms compete outside of this.</v>

6
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:28.660
Not An easy cases that you study in one 15 to outside of the example of

7
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.990
monopoly,
whether it's anyone from until there's not much competition.

8
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.070
And I decided the case of perfect competition where there are so many firms,

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.850
it's as if each firm is a price taker.
All right,
I'm going to go,

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.090
we're going to continue with that today and in fact you're going to continue

11
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:47.900
with it on into the homework.
So last time we looked at Corno,

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.840
that was the model we started with.

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.690
<v 0>Two firms competing in quantities and just to review in a bit what we did last</v>

15
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.530
time,
uh,
the kind of exercise that,
so I think is this right?

16
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:03.680
I think I probably went a little fast last time I was kicking myself afterwards.

17
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260
How did I get,
people can nod or shake their heads with it.

18
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.740
I think I went a bit fast so I'm so,
I'm sorry if that,

19
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.390
but if though if there was a time to go too fast,

20
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:14.300
it was probably last time because it turns out this is something that's covered

21
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:17.690
very well in the textbook so it's covered in chapter six of the textbook,

22
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.550
but the kind of exercise we did last time is a useful exercise.

23
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:24.080
But those of you who are econ majors,

24
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.640
the way we sold that Cornell model was we did three kinds of things.

25
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.380
We did something very nerdy,
namely we just play with calculus and Algebra.

26
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.390
All right?
That was one mathy.
We did something a little bit less nerdy.
That is,

27
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:42.500
we drew some pictures that represented what we'd found and we did a third thing

28
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:46.550
which was we tried to match this up to the economic intuition about monopoly and

29
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010
ah,
perfect competition and demand curves and so on.

30
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.610
And this exercise of being able to work in these three different modes,

31
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.930
economic intuition,

32
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.730
graphs and kind of nerdy high school math is a lot of what we want to get you

33
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:02.750
used to as economic majors.
It's just got a trunk.
Say easily between those.

34
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.280
We're going to Apollo's.
We're going too fast,

35
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.330
but it's still a useful exercise I think so.

36
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.710
I have looked at it in the book now back to the lessons in a way from the

37
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:10.610
nerdiness or second,

38
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.990
what are we learn what at the end of the day we learned that in the corner of

39
00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:19.940
equilibrium things where as we perhaps we might have anticipated things.

40
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.780
W W sat naturally between the extreme cases,

41
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.460
so the amount of output produced by the industry was somewhere between the case

42
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.920
that would be on the monopoly and on a perfect competition.

43
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:32.420
It was more than under monopoly,

44
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.510
less than perfect competition prices in the industry.

45
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.640
If we'd gone back and checked which set between,

46
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.740
they would be lower than the monopoly prices,

47
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.690
but higher than the perfect competitive prices.

48
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.450
Industry profits would be inbetween.
Interesting.

49
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.710
Rockets would be less than monopoly.

50
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:47.870
They must've just been monopolies and so that's the highest they could ever be

51
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.730
and the higher than perfect competition,

52
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:53.930
which of course has zero profits in this case.
All right,
and consumer surplus,

53
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:57.140
the benefits flowing into consumers.
My in between.
So in fact,

54
00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:59.860
the model in addition to this or notice of the model,

55
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.490
it ended up with a result we kind of believe in.
You have imperfect competition.

56
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.970
It's somewhere between perfect competition and no competition.

57
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.960
If Fox,
what's the bus?

58
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.200
The buses that there are other ways we could model imperfect competition.

59
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.190
And as we're going to see today,
they yield different offices.

60
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.580
So the first thing we're going to do today is look at a different form of

61
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:25.630
competition,
which is called Bertrand Competition.

62
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.710
It's a corner one is competing in quantities.

63
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.240
<v 0>And Bertrams is competing</v>

65
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.570
in prices.

66
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.790
All right.
And just a quick check.
And this is not for the camera.

67
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.060
How many of you have seen better on competition before?
So good.
Many of you.

68
00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:55.610
So there's gonna be reviews still.
Again,
for those of you who it isn't for whom,

69
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.360
which isn't review.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
We'll do this Rosalie quickly.

70
00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:02.360
But I hope I won't rush it like I did last time.

71
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.270
There's any consolation I get when I feel I've rushed Alexia.

72
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.250
I have a sleepless night.

73
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:09.720
So if you had to sleep at night because you're worried about it.

74
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.950
I think I'm having a sleepless night too about that.
Alright,

75
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.270
so there's two firms just as there was before and just as there was before,

76
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:24.990
the flux of the players are those two firms and just as there was last time,

77
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.270
they're producing an identical products.

78
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.310
<v 0>All right,
so the products we mentioned last time,
what coke and Pepsi,</v>

80
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.670
how about you could think of other products that are pretty much identical.

81
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.370
All right,
and just as last time,

82
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.580
we're going to assume that costs a constant marginal costs.

83
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.260
Well,
as soon as that comes at marginal cost,

84
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:59.320
I said it was last time because he put a c just to remind those people who are

85
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:03.240
not economics majors,
what that means.
It means if I produce one unit,

86
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.770
then it costs me see to produce a re tune it.
It cost me to see a hundred units,

87
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:10.490
100 seniors.
So all right.

88
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.820
Now what's different here from from last time,
and I've already told you,

89
00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:16.280
but I'll repeat it this time.
However,

90
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.210
instead of sitting quantities instead of just deciding how much coke and Pepsi

91
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:23.900
to produce and spewing it out from the market and getting prices take care of

92
00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:25.670
themselves this time,

93
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.560
the firms are going to set prices and let quantities take care of themselves.

94
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.030
All right,
so the,
the the strategy set this time up prices

95
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.750
and again,
so don't get confused.

96
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.250
Now normally we use [inaudible] for strategy but let's use p since that prices.

97
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:51.251
So they're going to be p one will be the price of good one of m one and p two

98
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.480
will be the price of fun too.
And the strategy set formerly,

99
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.100
let's just simplify here.

100
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.220
Let's assume that for each firm I they can set their price,

101
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:08.231
anything bigger than zero and anything less than one just to keep life simple.

102
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.500
All right,
so this is a little bit more realistic,

103
00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:18.300
perhaps perhaps more or less stick to think of firms actually thinking about

104
00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:23.160
what prices to set and then adjusting the quantities they actually ship based on

105
00:06:23.161 --> 00:06:25.210
demand.
All right.
It depends on,

106
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.230
I don't mean to radars about that cause that you could imagine the other way

107
00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:32.970
round.
But this,
you know,
you talk to managers,
it sounds more realistic at least.

108
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.180
But retail goods like coke and Pepsi,
all right?

109
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.270
So we know how prices are set.
They're set by the firms.
So the next question is,

110
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.350
where do the quantities come from?
All right,
so how did,

111
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.760
where did the corners these come from?
And they're going to come from demand.

112
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.210
And let me use a big queue of p,

113
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.460
a big queue of p two B.

114
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.490
The total quantity produced the total quantity demanded in the market.

115
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.380
So this will be the total quantity of,
uh,

116
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.130
of goods produced by good goods produced by foam one and goods produced by,

117
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:07.650
from too,
that are consumed.
All right?

118
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.670
This is the total quantity of coke plus Pepsi.
All right?
And we're going to,

119
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.150
and I noticed there's no subscript on this p and you'll see why in a second.

120
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.660
So we'll assume is to make life simple that the total quantity produced is one

121
00:07:20.911 --> 00:07:24.540
minus p.
And I'll say this and then write it more carefully,

122
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.100
where p is the lower of the two prices.
All right?

123
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.510
So the total quantity demanded is one minus p what p is the lower of the two

124
00:07:33.511 --> 00:07:37.740
prices.
All right?
Now to make that lower,

125
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.080
the two prices comment a little bit more rigorous.

126
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.270
Let's figure out what the demand actually is for these firms to what's going on

127
00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:46.104
here.

128
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.890
So let's look at the demand for from one.

129
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.980
All right,
we're just going to end up being the quantity that they sell.

130
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.880
So that's going to be Q one and watch that going to be,

131
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.940
well,
it's going to be one minus p one if they're the low price firm.

132
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.990
So if p one is less than PC,
right?

133
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.280
So if they're the low price from if coke is the low price from only coke sells

134
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:18.230
in the market,
there's no Pepsi in the market,
uh,

135
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.770
and one minus p one quantity of coke is sold,

136
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.960
it's going to be a zero.

137
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.620
If p one is bigger than pizza,
all right?

138
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:33.400
So of Pepsi as though is the low price a drink in the market,

139
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:38.401
then no coke is sold at all and it's going to be one minus p one over to in the

140
00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:45.940
case.
Well,
coke and Pepsi cost exactly the same.

141
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.500
All right?
You should be ready to be realizing this is not exactly a realistic,

142
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.350
right?
We're making a lot of very strong assumptions here,
but nevertheless,

143
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.580
it's going to be instructive to look at this model.
All right?

144
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:59.670
So I've got the firms,
they the players,
I don't what their strategies are.

145
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.950
I know a little about the structure of the market.

146
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.960
I still need to tell you what payoffs are

147
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.110
and just as last time,
the firms are going to try and maximize profits.
All right?

148
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.960
So what's the profit for from one going to be,

149
00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:16.500
and I write it separately for firms to,
it's going to be the quantity itselves

150
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.320
times the price.

151
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.860
It gets for that quantity minus that quantity at sales times the cost it costs

152
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.750
incurred in producing that quantity.
So again,
it's for from one,

153
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.380
it's the quantity itselves times the price.
This is it's revenue.

154
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.533
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

155
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.310
<v 0>minus the quantity itselves times.
See the cost.
This is cost.</v>

156
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.210
All right?

157
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.220
I can rewrite that a little bit more simply as Q one brackets,

158
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.780
p one minus C.
Alright.

159
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.780
Y Q one where this Q1 let's,
but let's keep it in square brackets.

160
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.030
This Q one is this object here?

161
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.980
Why does everyone understand what's going on?
I mean,

162
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.900
the Algebra doesn't really help the intuition here.

163
00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:12.220
The attrition is pretty straightforward.
Coke and Pepsi are producing this stuff.

164
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.910
They're setting prices.
If Pepsi is the low price than coke sells nothing.

165
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.180
If,
if coke is the low price it sells.

166
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:23.510
This amount at its profits are basically given by this equation.

167
00:10:23.511 --> 00:10:28.320
It's basically just revenues minus costs.
All right,
so we have,

168
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:32.540
what we want to do is we want to figure out what the Nash Equilibrium looks like

169
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.930
in this market and just just before we go any further,
no,

170
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.920
just that really this is the same basic market we looked at before,
right?

171
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.480
Both caught times has a demand curve out there in one model with thought of the

172
00:10:44.481 --> 00:10:47.570
firms that in quantities and the market determining prices,

173
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.650
and here we have the firms in prices in the market to sell in quantities,

174
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.010
but the basic underlying economic structure of this is very,
very similar.

175
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.290
<v 1>All right?</v>

176
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.620
<v 0>All right,
so you find the Nash Equilibrium.</v>

177
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.620
We're going to have to find best responses.
All right?

178
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.490
It's what we're gonna do together,
uh,

179
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:09.540
is to figure out what these best responses look like.
And uh,

180
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.710
let's try and do that.

181
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.120
I want to figure out the best response or from one

182
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.130
as a function of the price chosen by,

183
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.930
from to the best price for from one to choose.

184
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.020
Given that from two is choosing P two.

185
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.680
And I want to do this carefully and slowly.
And before I even start,

186
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.880
let me point out in passing that calculus is not going to help us here.

187
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.021
All right?

188
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:36.630
So for those of you who are nerdy enough to understand the next sentence,

189
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:40.850
let me just say it.
This is a discontinuous,
this is a discontinuous,

190
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.670
a payoff function.
So differentiating isn't going to get you very far,
right?

191
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.040
For this before people whom that didn't mean anything.
It doesn't matter.

192
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:51.570
We're not going to use calendars today.
All right?
Okay.

193
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.500
So there are different cases to about.

194
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.820
So one case to think about is what if the other from your coke,

195
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.660
what if Pepsi is pricing below cost?

196
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.950
What if Pepsi is pricing below cost?
And your coke,

197
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.670
what should you price as if you're trying to maximize your profits?

198
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.200
Let me try and wave their hands on the APP and know the answer perhaps is

199
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:19.120
pricing below costs?
What's your best response?
Yeah,
there's a guy on there.

200
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:20.950
Do you want to shout out?

201
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.070
Just get out of the market because it's not worth it for you to sell anything,

202
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.040
right?
So the so,
so I've forgotten your name.
I should know it by now.
Your,

203
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.540
your name is Sudipta to dip to says get out of the markets,
right?
If the,

204
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:34.600
if the other guy is pricing below costs,
you didn't want to start on a thing.

205
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:38.170
That's the right intuition.
How in this game do I quote,

206
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.500
get out of the market and you have to write and I asked you right,
I don't,

207
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.760
I don't want to be involved in this market.

208
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:45.100
If the other guy is selling below cost,
how do I,

209
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.410
how do I operationalize that in this game?
How do I actually,

210
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.310
how do I actually manage hourly?
There's somebody here,
just,

211
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.290
just wait for the mic a second and I'll shout it out.

212
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.420
You did set your price above his price,

213
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.570
the answer was set your price above his price.

214
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.880
So the other guy is pricing below cost.

215
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.120
The way which I avoid making losses is to set my price above his price.

216
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.460
Ryan Assistant,
make sure we understand this.

217
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.100
If the other guy is selling below cost,

218
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:17.340
the only way I can make any sales is the price below his price.

219
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.550
I will then make sales.
But each of those sales I'm making a loss on.

220
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.330
I don't want to make losses.
So I just quote,
get out of the market.

221
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:28.270
And the way I quote get out of the market is by pricing above the other guy.

222
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.980
I don't ever understand that.
All right.
Okay,

223
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.130
so now more interestingly,

224
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.620
we leave a little gap here.

225
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.050
What if the other guy is pricing above costs?

226
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.020
What do I want to do with the other guys?
Pricing above costs.

227
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.560
Taking it that guy with the beard here,
shout it out.
Cause we have that.

228
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:54.910
Mike has new,
you set a price below his butt above,

229
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.610
above or equal to cost.
All right,
so,

230
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.430
so if the other guy is pricing above costs,

231
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.220
I want to set prices below his to the ice,

232
00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:07.720
steal the whole of the markets and make profits on those sales.

233
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.130
So where is to suppose his pricing it and we set the prices of Windsor in one.

234
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.520
Suppose he's pricing at a at a point.

235
00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:20.470
Aids all be a good price for me to set
same same Gaia

236
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.700
as a small amount below his prices.

237
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:29.701
You can do a small amount as a small amount below his price as I can.

238
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:31.930
It's more of a blow his price as I can.

239
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.850
So basically I'm going to do here is I'm going to set my price to equal his

240
00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:40.900
price minus a little bit and I'll use the level epsilon to mean just a little

241
00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:45.010
bit.
I'll just undercut him a little bit by just undercutting the middle bits.

242
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.060
I'm going to get the whole of the markets and I'll make as much money as I can

243
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:52.250
on those sales.
Now that's almost right.

244
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.450
That's almost right.
That's kind of 90% of rights,

245
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.040
but it's not quite right.
I need to be a little bit careful.
Now,

246
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:03.770
why do I need to be a little careful here?
So this is almost right,

247
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:05.150
but it's not quite right.
You have the same same guy

248
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.300
you want your price to be at or above cost.
Oh,
that's okay.

249
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:14.960
That's certainly true.
Okay,
so that's true.
So I said fair enough.
So I want to,

250
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.050
I want to make sure this epsilon is not so big as it pushes me below cost.

251
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.840
That's certainly true that that's,
that's correct.

252
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.850
There's another little issue here.

253
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.660
So here's the other issue.

254
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.990
There's a price in this market we might want to think of as the kind of focal

255
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:30.291
price.

256
00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:34.490
There's an interesting price and that's the price at which the price I would

257
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:36.950
choose.
We're either monopolist,

258
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.970
I suppose the other guy didn't exist who's Pepsi didn't exist.

259
00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:45.500
The coke has the whole market.
Right?
Then we sold out this problem.

260
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:48.380
We would solve out what the monopoly prices.
That's an exercise you didn't want.

261
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.840
15 all right.

262
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.440
And notice that if Pepsi has priced above the monopoly price,

263
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.750
I suppose suppose Pepsi is priced this good so high that it's above the monopoly

264
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:05.720
price.
Then as the gentleman said,

265
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.250
I can capture the whole locket by pricing just below Pepsi.

266
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.750
However,
however,
then I then I have the whole market.

267
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:18.440
I just didn't find the monopolists but suddenly I'm pricing above them and

268
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:21.480
operate price might can't be right.
Right.

269
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.110
I never want to price above the monopoly price cause I know that the monopoly

270
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:26.660
price where I'm the monopolist is the most profit I could ever make.

271
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.290
Is that right?
All right.
Do you need to be a little bit careful?

272
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.240
This also that says I just undercut Pepsi.
That's true.

273
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.570
Provided provided that Pepsi hasn't gone above the monopoly price.

274
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.760
Right.
If he's going above it,
if he's got above the monopoly price,

275
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:48.320
we need to be a little bit more careful.

276
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.640
If pizza is actually above the monopoly price,

277
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.680
then what's my best response in that case?
I'll do my best homes in that case.

278
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.550
Yeah.
Can we get Katie who's in green there

279
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.580
pricing at the monopoly pricing of the monopoly price.

280
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.570
So if Pepsi is dumb enough to price above monopoly,

281
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.700
sure I will undercut Pepsi,

282
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.580
but I won't upset undercoat Pepsi by a penny all on the cup.

283
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:21.490
Pepsi all the way down to the monopoly price and make monopoly profits.

284
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.640
I'll be very happy.
I'd be wondering what on earth is perhaps the up to,

285
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.320
but that's fine.
All right,

286
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:30.850
so here my best response is to price at the monopoly price.

287
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.090
All right.
And there's one other possibility here I've missed,

288
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:39.330
which is what if Pepsi prices at marginal cost itself,

289
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.970
this is the one missing case here.
What if Pepsi prices at marginal cost?

290
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.400
What's my best response?
In this case?

291
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.190
Pepsi's pricing.
Exactly.
At marginal cost.
What's my best response?
Uh,
yeah.
Uh,

292
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.980
wait for the mic.
This,
this is Henry.

293
00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:01.250
I think shout out to price at marginal cost as well.

294
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.380
I could price at a marginal cost as well.
How much profit do I make if I,

295
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.630
if I price it,
medical cost as well.
Zero profits,
I make zero profits.

296
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.840
So that certainly is a best response by saying at marginal cost as well.

297
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.260
What else would be a best response?
That's,
that's correct.

298
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.960
But what else would be a best response
price above that?
All right.

299
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.260
It doesn't really matter as long as I do price below weights.
All right.

300
00:18:23.261 --> 00:18:28.070
As long as they are priced below it,
I'm not gonna make any money anyway,
right?

301
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.580
If I price below it,
I'm going to lose money.
All right,

302
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.450
so this best response actually is a pretty complicated object and we could,

303
00:18:34.451 --> 00:18:36.250
if we're going to go like we did last time,

304
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.430
we could take the time to draw this thing,
but it's a bit of a mess,

305
00:18:39.431 --> 00:18:43.060
so I won't worry about doing that right now.
All right,

306
00:18:43.061 --> 00:18:45.010
so the best response is actually pretty complicated,

307
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.980
even though the press response is pretty complicated.
And by the way,

308
00:18:47.981 --> 00:18:50.400
obviously the things,
that's a metric for player too,

309
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.900
even though these best responses are pretty complicated,

310
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.710
it turns out that there's only one nash equilibrium in this game.

311
00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.310
Watch the Nash Equilibrium.
Somebody watched the but what rate?

312
00:19:00.311 --> 00:19:03.000
Raise your hand high.
All you guys,
it was a huge number of hands.

313
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:07.300
They said they'd seen it before.
So,
uh,
uh,
who saw this model before?

314
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.990
So fewer hands go up where they know there's a question coming,
right?

315
00:19:10.991 --> 00:19:12.070
There's a different incentive.
All right.

316
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.800
Who remembers what the Nash Equilibrium is?
Yeah,

317
00:19:14.801 --> 00:19:16.330
there's a guy tied that guy right by you.

318
00:19:16.331 --> 00:19:21.250
They're at sea shout back even I caught her,
you see at to see,

319
00:19:21.251 --> 00:19:23.650
okay,
so the,
the Nash equilibrium here,

320
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.210
the Nash equilibrium is for both firms to set their prices equal to marginal

321
00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:33.424
cost

322
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.310
and you can check that both firms are then playing a best response.
So that's,

323
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.970
that's all right if it,
if m two is,
is charting a c,

324
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.300
then a best response for from one is to set up just with the ones that hit is to

325
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:51.080
set a price.
He put a marginal costs.
And if um,
uh,

326
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.820
one is it the pricing at marginal costs,
then conversely,

327
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.600
a best response for from to is to price it marginal cost.
All right?

328
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.370
Slightly harder exercise is to check that nothing else is in actually whenever

329
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.630
am what else?
Think about that a second.

330
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.450
Suppose from one is pricing,
uh,

331
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.480
at marginal cost and from two a is pricing at something higher?

332
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.730
Uh,
at um,
uh,

333
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.100
a c plus?
Uh,
I dunno.
Three apps.
One a little bit higher.

334
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.383
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

335
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.830
<v 0>All right.</v>

336
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.830
Suppose foam one is pricing at marginal cost and from to and from a two is

337
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:36.450
pricing at c pass three epsilon.
Is this an actually collaborate?

338
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.420
I just think about from two.
First of all,

339
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.270
it's from to playing a best response to foam one.

340
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.880
It's from to playing at restaurants to found one.
So I claim it is right.

341
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:53.710
What does this check Kathleen from?
One is to PR is pricing at marginal costs,

342
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:54.490
right?

343
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.390
The best respondents if the other guys pricing at marginal costs is to price at

344
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.900
marginal costs or above.
And this is marginal cost or above.

345
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:04.870
So this is the best response.
So from two is playing a bass response.

346
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:11.190
This is the best response for from two given that he won.

347
00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:14.200
Is it?
See what's the problem here?
Why is it nevertheless,

348
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:17.230
I claimed that he's not an actual equilibrium.
Why is it not a Nash Equilibrium?

349
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:21.790
Who has an incentive to deviate.
Take him to get the guy way at the back way,
way,

350
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:25.420
way in the back by the door.
Go ahead.
Shout out from ones,

351
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:30.250
get along and produce at c plus to epsilon.
Exactly.
Exactly.

352
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.520
Exactly.
This is not a best response.
This is not

353
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.030
<v 2>the best response.</v>

354
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.580
<v 0>And the reason is that the best response for from one if from two is charging c</v>

355
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:48.590
plus three little bits is to try it is to price it c plus two the guys.

356
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.810
Thank you.
All right,

357
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.490
so it turns out it's pretty easy to check that this is the only nash equilibrium

358
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.623
in the game.

359
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.463
<v 2>All right.</v>

360
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.350
<v 0>Now what's the lesson?
What a draw from this?</v>

361
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.820
Well,
as an exercise in game through that really wasn't very hard.
All right?

362
00:22:12.821 --> 00:22:15.700
As an exercise in finding nash equilibrium by this stage.

363
00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.800
And of course most of you are looking at that saying,
yeah,
that wasn't hard.

364
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.540
So what's the point here?

365
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:25.020
The point is that in this game in which firms competed in prices,

366
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.640
even though there were only two firms in the market,
right?

367
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:33.820
Only one from more than monopoly.
Right?

368
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.770
We get a dramatically different result than we had last time.
In particular,

369
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.950
we find that prices in the market are equal to marginal costs.

370
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.530
We find that profits and equilibrium is equal to

371
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.930
zero and we find this lots of consumer surplus cause prices really as low as

372
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:59.020
they ever could be.
In fact,
the outcome here,

373
00:22:59.021 --> 00:23:02.350
this equilibrium here is for all intents and purposes,

374
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:07.210
the same equilibrium we would have had had the bean thousands of firms in the

375
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:10.510
market and had this been a perfectly competitive market.
All right,

376
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:14.110
so even though there's only two firms here with price competition,

377
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.850
identical products,

378
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:21.060
we end up with an outcome that looks exactly like perfect competition accepted

379
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.910
the for the fact that only two phones,
that's the outcome.

380
00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.360
<v 2>It's like</v>

381
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.130
perfect competition

382
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.540
even though

383
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:45.850
it's only two.
Fuck.

384
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.120
<v 0>That's a pretty surprising results.
It would suggest.</v>

385
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:52.670
Think about this as a policy things.
If you believe this model,

386
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.330
do you think that has really an accurate model of,

387
00:23:54.331 --> 00:23:58.700
of society and you're a regulator working in the Department of Justice or you're

388
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:02.780
a judge trying to judge some monopoly case or you're a commissioner on the

389
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.600
European Court or whatever.
Trying to judge some compassion and competition case.

390
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.370
All you'd worry about is getting one competitor in each market to firms in each

391
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:14.630
market and you'd be done,
right?
You wouldn't worry about entry beyond two.

392
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.240
All right.
Now my guess is we don't believe that.

393
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.450
<v 2>We don't believe that.
All right,</v>

394
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.140
<v 0>we'll come back to that in a second,
but they make a different amount.</v>

395
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:27.974
If we get that,

396
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.080
<v 2>not me doing that.
Let me move this down.
All right.</v>

397
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.940
Still doing it.
Okay.
That's probably the wire.

398
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.073
Sorry.

399
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:51.650
<v 0>Hi.
Let me just remove it and I'll shout.
Okay.</v>

400
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:55.160
I'm going to shout now.
Can People still hell banks?
Can people still hear me?
Yup.

401
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.670
Okay,
thank you.
All right.
Uh,
so I have to turn down the other mic a bit.

402
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.213
All right,

403
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:05.530
so what's another thing to remark here is even though we looked at essentially

404
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:10.160
the same market as we looked at last time and we didn't make it and he's really

405
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:11.450
significant change,

406
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.130
we just say instead of thinking of them pricing study in quantities,

407
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.440
think of them saying prices have been here.
Just thought experiments.

408
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.300
We ended up with a radically different outcome.
All right,

409
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.220
so another lesson here is the same,
assessing

410
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.030
the same assessing as lost time as core.
No,

411
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.690
<v 2>but with
a different</v>

412
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.680
<v 0>strategy set,</v>

413
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.100
I definitely thinking about what they're doing

414
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.980
led to a very different outcome

415
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.150
and that's worrying,
right?

416
00:25:58.151 --> 00:26:01.730
It's worrying because you can't go away feeling comfortable out this.

417
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.400
You can't think that it really could make so much difference in the real world.

418
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.080
How prices and quantities is welfare and profit is going to work out depending

419
00:26:11.081 --> 00:26:14.770
on some thought experiment about how I think about my strategy set.

420
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.183
<v 1>All right,</v>

421
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.560
<v 0>so there's little worry going in about not just this example but about the</v>

422
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:25.100
course,
about the whole theme of Learning Game Theory.

423
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.120
All right,
so what's going to save us here?

424
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:35.590
What's going to save us is if we inject a little bit more reality back in the

425
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:38.720
model,
we're going to get back and more sensible results.

426
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.620
So what we're going to do now is we're going to relax some of the assumptions of

427
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:47.430
this batch Ron model,
and it's going to do two things for us.
First,

428
00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:50.970
it's going to give us an outcome that we believe the outcome we believe,

429
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:55.890
I think is that imperfect competition should look something between monopoly and

430
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:58.140
perfect competition.
It shouldn't look like better competition.

431
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.550
I think most of us don't believe the two firms is enough to make a perfect

432
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:06.990
competition that the regulator shouldn't worry about the third farm.
All right,

433
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.730
I'm the second thing that's going to do from a more theoretical point of view is

434
00:27:10.731 --> 00:27:14.760
it's going to suggest to us that actually actually things aren't quite as bad as

435
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:18.090
we thought.
In fact,
if we modeled this more carefully,

436
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.510
we'll get roughly the same prediction.
Uh,
either way.
All right,

437
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.430
so what's the assumption we're going to change?
Well,
before I say that,

438
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.090
I just say I'm not going to change it.
You are all right.

439
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.800
So rather than go through this again,

440
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:34.740
that whole third time I've gone through it once and quantities and once in

441
00:27:34.741 --> 00:27:35.574
prices.

442
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.660
I'm going to get you guys to do it this time by having you do it on a homework

443
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:42.660
assignment.
Well why?

444
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.570
Well partly because I think it's a good exercise but also I didn't want this

445
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:47.700
class to be a class where you sit there,

446
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.460
you know with your cup of well of his coffee.
Uh,

447
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.640
if needed to keep awake and you watch me solve models cause that's not how you

448
00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:57.150
learn what I want this to pass to be as a class where it is sometimes like in

449
00:27:57.151 --> 00:28:00.150
this homework assignment you take,
you know,
I set up a model for you,

450
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.750
what sort of sets up the story for you and then you have to actually figure out

451
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.450
how do I set this up properly and how do I solve it out?

452
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:07.920
Because at the end of the day,

453
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.710
if game three is going to be useful for you in your later lives,

454
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.640
whether it's in dating or in running a company or whatever happens to be,

455
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.720
you need to be able to go from the story to the model.
All right.

456
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.630
Having said that,
I'll tell you what the homework assignments going to be about.

457
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.910
The assumption we're going to change is the idea that products are identical.

458
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.400
So we're gonna look at a case

459
00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.710
<v 1>when you say you board.</v>

460
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.760
<v 0>Well,
products are differentiated.</v>

461
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

462
00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.221
<v 0>Hello?</v>

463
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:49.221
I'm going to claim that assuming that products are not identical is a pretty

464
00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:53.570
safe assumption for most of the world.
Well,

465
00:28:53.571 --> 00:28:55.000
most things are going to see in the world.

466
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.920
So we're going to look at what are called differentiated.

467
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.773
<v 1>Okay?</v>

468
00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.960
<v 0>Differentiated products,
and in particular,</v>

469
00:29:07.961 --> 00:29:09.760
we're going to get a particular version of this,

470
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.390
but we're going to call the linear Stacy

471
00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.993
<v 1>model.</v>

472
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.980
<v 0>All right?
So what do we mean by products being differentiated?</v>

473
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.520
So I started off with an example that's pretty bad for this story,

474
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.070
namely coke and Pepsi.
And I'll be honest,

475
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:31.250
how many of you in a blind taste test can taste the difference between ordinary

476
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:35.670
coke and ordinary Pepsi?
Oh,
quite a few.
Okay,
that's good for my case,
right?

477
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:39.330
It's a number of,
you think those are different products,
right?
So number of you,

478
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.560
even if the price was just a tiny bit different,

479
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.780
might have a preference for one rather than the other.

480
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:45.460
So without getting in trouble by putting the camera on you,

481
00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.670
how many of you have would have a profit if the prices were essentially the
same?

482
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.300
How many of you would have a strip preference of a Pepsi and how many of those

483
00:29:52.301 --> 00:29:56.230
strict preference for coke?
And how many of you have a strip preference for diet?

484
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.770
A diet coke?
That's amazing.
I stopped.
I don't in mind.

485
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.810
Okay,
I'll get with that.
But you're making my point.

486
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.530
The point I'm trying to make case products and not identical.
Alright.

487
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.340
Products are not identical.
Okay?
For the most part,

488
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.250
there's a little bit of difference between products and that's actually gonna

489
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.730
work.
If we inject that a little bit of realism into the world,

490
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.180
it's actually going to help us.
So what we would like,
what would we'd like?

491
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.260
We'd like a model in which firms set prices,

492
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.140
because for the most part we think firms do set prices.

493
00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:31.180
Not Quantity is not always,
but for the most part,

494
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.760
but we'd like a modal that yields the yields and outcome that looks that when

495
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:41.650
you only have two firms look somewhere between monopoly and perfect competition.

496
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.410
So we'd make an outcome that looks a little bit like core.
No,

497
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.700
but we'd like the strategy set to be prices.
And this is going to do,

498
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:51.280
the trick is going to tell up to do the trick as you'll find out in your

499
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:54.370
homework assignments.
So how are we going to model this on the homework?

500
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.540
The way we're going to model differentiated products is to imagine,

501
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.130
just to take a simple example,

502
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.390
imagine a city and this city has one long straight road through it.

503
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.200
So this study is not a city in New England.

504
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.860
It's a city in the Midwest where everything's flat and the roads just go

505
00:31:11.861 --> 00:31:16.690
completely straight.
All right,
you can think of as being,
I know a mile long,

506
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.330
does it really matter?
All right,
let's just think of it as being a mile long.

507
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:26.250
And we're going to assume that consumers are evenly spread along this city.

508
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.940
All right?
Let's do it was evenly spread along the city.

509
00:31:29.941 --> 00:31:32.890
So there's basically consumers everywhere.
They evenly distributed.

510
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.250
And we're going to assume that one of these firms,

511
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.890
one of these firms that's call it from one

512
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:40.590
<v 1>yeah,</v>

513
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.220
<v 0>sits at 0.0 and the other firm</v>

514
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.100
I'm to sits at 0.1.

515
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.380
Now this is what we're gonna do in the homework assignment,

516
00:31:52.381 --> 00:31:55.160
but I'm just make it make the arguments that you could also imagine firms

517
00:31:55.161 --> 00:31:57.030
sitting think somewhere between zero and one,
right?
You're going,
wait,

518
00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.160
we could do a more general jog if we wanted to,

519
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:04.110
but for now it's just assume that one of these firms has its shop at one end of

520
00:32:04.111 --> 00:32:08.610
the town and the other one has it shot at,
uh,
at the other end of the town.

521
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.820
All right?
So let's think about a particular consumer.

522
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.740
Just oppose this consumer is here.
Point.

523
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.030
Why is it all right?

524
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.500
So notice that this consumer is a distance.

525
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.740
Why Hawaii from from one sort of if if she consumes from from one,

526
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.630
she has to walk a distance of why.
All right.

527
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.690
And she's a distance of one minus y from foam to,
is that right?

528
00:32:38.691 --> 00:32:41.600
So if she from from to she has to walk,

529
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.000
she has to walk one minus y.

530
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.133
<v 1>All right.</v>

531
00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:46.851
<v 0>All right.</v>

532
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:49.850
That's going to turn out to be key in our model as we'll see in a second.

533
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.990
All right,
so firms as before,

534
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:55.910
I'll going to set prices

535
00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.040
and I won't write everything down because it's all written down on the homework

536
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:02.450
assignment,
which is already on the web.

537
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.050
But in fact firms are going to maximize profits aimed to maximize profits.

538
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.390
Firms are going to have constant marginal costs,

539
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.580
will make one other assumption to keep life simple.

540
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.790
We'll assume that each consumer buys one and only one product.

541
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.320
Each consumer's going to buy one product either from,
from one or from from two.

542
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.510
Alright,

543
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:28.510
so the issue is going to be which foam does each consumer go and buy that

544
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:33.530
product from?
Which department does each consumer choose and what?

545
00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.610
Assume
but each consumer

546
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.830
chooses the products.

547
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.393
<v 1>Okay,</v>

548
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.290
<v 0>who's,
I'll be careful here.</v>

549
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:56.020
Who is total
cost to,
Huh?

550
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.510
It's smaller I why don't we may total costs.
What does that look for the,

551
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.450
for the consumer at point y for the front zone poll

552
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:10.810
for example,

553
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.480
for the consumer at point y if they buy from from one,

554
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.950
if they buy from from one,

555
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:28.030
then they pay the price p one which is set by from one,

556
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.150
but they also have to pay a transport cost.

557
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.530
The cost of them of having to walk all the way there and walk all the way back.

558
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.040
All right,
and we'll,
we'll give a name tag I transport cost.

559
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.790
Well say it t y squared.

560
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.890
All right,
so why,
why is the distance they have to travel?
Right?

561
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.190
And t why it's good is that transport costs.

562
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.580
So this object here we could think of as a transport cost,

563
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.430
right?

564
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:08.430
If the same consumer buys from from to she pays p two plus t times again the

565
00:35:14.681 --> 00:35:19.300
distance squared.
So that's going to be one minus y squared.

566
00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.310
And once again,
this last term is a transport cost.

567
00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:26.183
<v 1>All right?</v>

568
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.550
<v 0>I know just that these transport costs go up in the,</v>

569
00:35:33.551 --> 00:35:37.560
in the distance you have to travel and they go out pretty fast.
They'd go up,
uh,

570
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:38.950
at,
at,
at,
at rate square.

571
00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.173
<v 1>All right?</v>

572
00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.830
<v 0>So what you're going to do on the homework assignments is sold out this market.</v>

573
00:35:44.831 --> 00:35:48.160
You're gonna assume that firms set prices to maximize profits.

574
00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.230
You're going to know what firms costs are,

575
00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:54.610
you're going to work out what firms do demands are going to look like for each

576
00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:55.990
possible prices they could set.

577
00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.690
And you're going to solve out the whole nash equilibrium.

578
00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.380
And then we're going to look at that Nash equilibrium and you're gonna Think,
uh,

579
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.700
how does that compare to what I saw in the corner case and so on.
All right?

580
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.230
So that's on the homework assignments.

581
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.473
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

582
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.060
<v 0>but before I leave this,</v>

583
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.390
let me just point out that this is a little bit more general than it might

584
00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:20.224
appear.

585
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.210
So here I've treated what makes products difference as being,

586
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.770
uh,
where the,
where the shops are located.
All right?

587
00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:33.771
So here I've interpreted these terms here as transport costs and I've

588
00:36:34.211 --> 00:36:38.410
interpreted what makes the products difference is the fact that one of them is

589
00:36:38.411 --> 00:36:42.590
selling at one end of the town and the other one is selling at there at the,

590
00:36:42.591 --> 00:36:44.950
at the,
at the right hand,
end of town.
All right?

591
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:48.400
But actually we could consider this model more generally.

592
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:56.220
Let's just do so briefly here.
Let me just redraw the town.
Here's my town again.

593
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.790
All right,
I don't have to regard this,
this products,
uh,
this,
this,

594
00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:06.420
this line as being distance along the high street of the town.

595
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.260
It could be something else about the products.
So for example,

596
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.320
and whatever it is you guys imagine makes coke and Pepsi different.

597
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.830
It could be that thing and went what that is,
but whatever that,
whatever that is.

598
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.950
Let me take an example though.
I understand better Landis and coke and Pepsi.

599
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.910
So imagine we're talking about beer.
All right?
I think about beer.

600
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:29.500
This is the BMR kit,
alright,

601
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.370
this distance here could be something like the alcohol content of the flavor of

602
00:37:34.371 --> 00:37:37.970
the beer.
All right?
And you can imagine different products.

603
00:37:37.971 --> 00:37:41.690
Therefore that are on the market positioning themselves or being positions at

604
00:37:41.691 --> 00:37:45.400
different points on the line.
So for example,
you know up here everyone else,

605
00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:49.160
beer flavor,
this might be Guinness.
All right,

606
00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:51.080
this might be good actually I can't even spell,
but you know what I mean.

607
00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.340
All right.

608
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.940
And if you think about the drinks industry more generally here rather than just

609
00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:59.960
beer,
this would be Guinness.
This would be a Poland spring.

610
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.690
All right,
this is water,
right?
And everything else would be in between here.

611
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.710
All right?
So if we just go a tiny distance in here,
all right,

612
00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:14.500
this is a bud light,
right?

613
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.440
And so on.
Right?
Right.
And you,
you,
you could put everything on this line.

614
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:22.790
All right.
I think that maybe I'm not really allowed to do this on this model.

615
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.720
The only a counter is the part of the truth is that Bud light might be down here

616
00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:31.250
somewhere,
but I'm not allowed to do that.
Alright.
Alright.
So,

617
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.160
leaving aside that specific example of beer,

618
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:38.950
you think about some product that has some dimension on which it varies and we

619
00:38:38.951 --> 00:38:40.300
can use this model,

620
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.590
we can use this model to see how competition is going to work in that market.

621
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:49.660
But now notice that this transport costs is going to be a different

622
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.494
interpretation.

623
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.700
Now instead of being the cost of traveling that distance to go and buy the

624
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:57.910
product,
what's it going to be?
It's going to be that.
If my,

625
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.410
if my preferred bear flavor is here,
say,
Hey,
this is me,

626
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.570
my preferred bear flavors here,
then if I end up having to consume Guinness,

627
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:12.700
I have to pay the price of gas and I also incur some costs because Guinness

628
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:17.260
isn't the perfect beer for me.
It's a little bit too strong.
All right.

629
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:21.970
And if I consume a bud light,
then I have to pay for the bud lights.

630
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.370
I think typically costs less than the price.

631
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.770
It was a rural price is less than Guinness,

632
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.550
but I also pay an additional cost from the fact that the got bud light when I

633
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:35.080
drink it.
Um,
uh,
causes me to see,
tell us we've heard that put likely like that.

634
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:40.360
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
So basically that transport cost is now the,
the,

635
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:44.260
the lack of pleasure I caused by drinking a product that isn't perfect for me.

636
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:49.120
All right.
Does everyone understand the story here?
All right,

637
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.330
so you're going to figure out what happens with this story very generally,

638
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.200
even in the particular case actually,
uh,
on the homework assignment.

639
00:39:56.201 --> 00:39:59.590
But I want you to understand that there's this much more general story

640
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:04.860
underlying this and this is a pretty good model of how a have a lot of markets

641
00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:08.470
as a kind of model that you'd see again if you went on to graduate school.

642
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.593
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

643
00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.950
<v 0>Alright.
Now I want to spend the rest of today doing something quite different,</v>

644
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.470
but you'll see it isn't all that different.

645
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.930
I'm going to go away from starting imperfect competition and go back and visit

646
00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:27.780
something we studied almost the first day or maybe the second day.

647
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:31.890
And that's elections.
I want to go back to elections.

648
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.570
And why do I want to go back at this point?
Well,

649
00:40:33.571 --> 00:40:37.290
one reason I want to go back is you'll notice I've been putting up these lions

650
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:39.910
on the board and when we visited elections that uh,

651
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:45.020
on the second day we said that you can think of that line on the board as being

652
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.400
not just um,
not just uh,

653
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.680
left wing right wing politics but also some dimension of of products.

654
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.160
So I want to go back again now we're considering the line on the board as being

655
00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:57.900
flavor in beer.

656
00:40:59.540 --> 00:40:59.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.470
<v 0>Well location in a town and I want to go back to politics now and go back to the</v>

658
00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:08.480
interpretation we started with so that left and right will end up being left

659
00:41:08.481 --> 00:41:11.180
wing politics versus right wing politics.
All right.

660
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.090
I'm going to take the same basic idea back to the politics model.

661
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

662
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.130
<v 0>And we'll spend the rest of today in politics.</v>

663
00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:23.150
So we're going to be doing political science or political science as it means

664
00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:24.950
game theory for the rest of the day.

665
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.143
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

666
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.150
<v 0>We're going to study something called the candidate</v>

667
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:38.210
<v 2>voter model</v>

668
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.850
candidate voter model.
All right.

669
00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:47.550
<v 0>This model is going to look a lot like the models we looked at already a few</v>

670
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:51.660
weeks ago
in particular has I advertised?

671
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:57.080
There will be a line and this line will go from a zero to one and the left hand

672
00:41:57.931 --> 00:42:01.650
side of this line will represent the left wing and the right hand side of the

673
00:42:01.651 --> 00:42:03.210
line will represent the right wing.

674
00:42:03.211 --> 00:42:06.930
So that's the same as before and as before.

675
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.310
As in the downs or hoteling model we discussed already a few weeks ago,

676
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:16.170
we're going to assume that voters are evenly spread along the line.

677
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.100
All right,
so we're going to assume even distribution.

678
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:23.843
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

679
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.820
<v 0>all voters on the light.</v>

680
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.620
I'm also going to assume just as we did last time,

681
00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.130
that voters are going to vote for the closest candidate.

682
00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:45.330
<v 2>Okay.
Suppose just vote for the closest</v>

683
00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:48.683
candidate.

684
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:53.820
<v 0>So all of these assumptions are the same assumptions we started two weeks ago or</v>

685
00:42:53.821 --> 00:42:54.690
two and a half weeks ago,

686
00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.900
and which you actually started in your first homework assignment.
Is that right?

687
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.970
But I want to go back there because I want to do now is I want to change some

688
00:43:02.971 --> 00:43:07.470
critical assumptions of that model and see that by making those,

689
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.430
making those changes,
we're going to get some very different outcomes.

690
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.700
So in particular,
the new things here,

691
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.210
two things,
water,

692
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.610
<v 2>the number of candidates,</v>

693
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.740
the number of candidates is not,

694
00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:29.980
is not fixed.

695
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.130
<v 0>So the number of candidates in this model is going to be indigenous.</v>

696
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:38.471
All right?

697
00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:41.740
Previously we looked at models where there were two candidates are on your

698
00:43:41.741 --> 00:43:43.690
homework assignment,
three candidates.

699
00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.170
Now we're going to allow the number of candidates to adjust itself.

700
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.900
And the second assumption we're going to make,
which is new,

701
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.680
is that we're going to assume that candidates cannot choose that position.

702
00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:01.850
All right?
So the idea is any candidate who spans and it's election,

703
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.570
you know who that candidate is,
you know whether their right wing or left wing.

704
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.610
So they can't tell you there's something else,

705
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.510
<v 2>right?
So candidates</v>

706
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.510
can not choose

707
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.920
that position.
All right?

708
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.020
<v 0>So this is a,
this is a simple thing,
right?</v>

709
00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:28.730
Because you think about the current election,

710
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.060
there's a debate about whether Hillary Clinton,
for example,

711
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:37.080
can choose right now to be at the center of the Democratic Party,

712
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.660
given her past history of votes.
For example,

713
00:44:39.661 --> 00:44:41.880
on the Iraq war or on the other side.

714
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.510
There's a debate about whether Mitt Romney can choose to be,

715
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:49.320
I guess he's trying to choose himself to be on the right hand wing of the

716
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:49.560
Republican Party,

717
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.590
given he has a record of government as being governor of Massachusetts,

718
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.620
when Provo,
when he provided state health care,
for example.
All right,

719
00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.060
so it's quite difficult in the real world for candidates to position themselves,

720
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.540
voters tend to know that those candidates have track records.

721
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.420
That's something we mentioned already three weeks ago,
two weeks ago.

722
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.520
We're going to take that fixed now.

723
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.350
We're gonna assume you know who these candidates are.
All right,

724
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.240
so what are we actually going to assume?

725
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:22.370
We're going to assume that each voter in the model is a potential candidate.

726
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.510
So this is the thinking,
nice idealized version of American politics.

727
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.720
Each of you who is above 18 and is an American citizen and was born in America

728
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:35.060
and maybe have your mom,
you've got to be more than Bobby tier,

729
00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.680
above whatever it is,
whatever the rule is,
whatever the constitution says,

730
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.940
each of you can potentially stand up now and say you're going to run for

731
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:45.170
president,
right?
I'm guessing all of you are ruled out by age actually.
Oh,

732
00:45:45.171 --> 00:45:46.620
this is not the same rule in the constitution,
but of them.

733
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:48.180
I just pretend that's not there.
All right,

734
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.590
so the idea of the model is each vota

735
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:58.310
<v 2>is,
hey,</v>

736
00:45:58.311 --> 00:45:59.390
potential

737
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.710
<v 0>a potential candidate.</v>

738
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.270
All right.
That's a very appealing assumption,
I think in a democracy.

739
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.840
So what I want to do is I want to lay this out a little bit more formally as a

740
00:46:18.841 --> 00:46:22.890
game,
and then since we haven't done anything like this for a week or so,

741
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:27.900
we're going to play the game.
All right?
So you're about to play this game.

742
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:32.220
So pay attention,
please.
All right,
so who are the voters?
Who are the players?

743
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.440
The players are the voters,
right?

744
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.680
The voters or candidates would have you want to call them

745
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.200
<v 2>candidates.
Can the greats,
I knew one day</v>

746
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.240
<v 0>in this game they're going to be you.</v>

747
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:54.080
And the key strategy here,
essentially the Australia is,

748
00:46:54.081 --> 00:46:58.340
can be very simple.
The strategy is do you run or not?

749
00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.760
The reason that's going to be the strategy is that voting is not going to be

750
00:47:01.761 --> 00:47:05.480
difficult.
You're always going to end up voting for the candidate who's closest.

751
00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:06.320
Alright,

752
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.320
so they're only really relevant strategy is to run or not.

753
00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.760
It's a rock to stand on,
not to stand.
All right,

754
00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.740
so just to make that clear,

755
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.040
<v 2>voters vote</v>

756
00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.340
for the closest running candidates

757
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.270
<v 0>first and second.
What does it mean to win?</v>

758
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.690
We'll assume that we're in a plurality election here.

759
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.360
So the winner is the person who gets a plurality.

760
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:48.623
<v 2>You win.</v>

761
00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.050
<v 0>If you get the most votes in the woods,</v>

762
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.660
you win.
If you get the most votes and want,

763
00:47:56.661 --> 00:48:01.661
assume that if there's a tie that we flip a fair coin or a Supreme Court judge,

764
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.390
whatever you want to say.
Good bye.
All right.
Sorry.

765
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.043
<v 2>Flip if ty.</v>

766
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.670
All right.

767
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.960
<v 0>And the payoffs in this game</v>

768
00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:23.230
as follows,
we'll assume that there's a price for winning.

769
00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:30.730
So if you win the election,
you get a prize equal to B.

770
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:33.500
All right?

771
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:38.450
We'll also assume that there's a cost of running.

772
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.660
So if you enter this election,
win or not,

773
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:46.790
you incur a cost of C and we'll assume,

774
00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.280
<v 2>okay,</v>

775
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.900
<v 0>that B is greater than equal,</v>

776
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:55.790
greater than or equal to two c and actually for today.
But today,

777
00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:59.150
let's just keep things simple and assume it's actually equal to Suzy.

778
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.450
Ah,
but that's not the every part of the payoffs.

779
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.420
There's also a part of the payoff that's analogous to forcing me to drink by

780
00:49:09.421 --> 00:49:14.060
blight or forcing the Pepsi drinkers to Drink Coca Cola and watch that.

781
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:18.360
That's if,
regardless of of,
uh,
uh,
of whether I run on ours,

782
00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.890
if some other candidate is elected other than me,

783
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.910
then they're not going to have my ideal policies.
All right?

784
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.700
So it's going to cause me on happiness.

785
00:49:28.701 --> 00:49:33.380
It's going to cause me dish Tennessee having a candidate win who's far away from

786
00:49:33.381 --> 00:49:37.370
me.
All right?
So there's going to be a,
an extra thing.

787
00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.013
And

788
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.003
<v 2>so if,</v>

789
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.130
<v 0>if your position is x,</v>

790
00:49:44.131 --> 00:49:48.180
if you are x on that line

791
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.070
<v 2>and the winner of the election</v>

792
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:55.060
<v 0>is at y,</v>

793
00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:02.220
then you pay a cost of minus x minus y,

794
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:06.880
the absolute distance between between you and the winning candidate.
So again,

795
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:09.260
if you're an ex and the winners,

796
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.280
that why it hurts you minus the distance between x and Y in terms of your own

797
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:19.630
happiness and having a winner who isn't,
who's far away from you winning.

798
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.420
So let's do an example.

799
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.833
<v 2>Okay?</v>

800
00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.010
<v 0>Just to make sure we understand the pay offs.</v>

801
00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:48.960
So example one,
if you're an x,
just called,

802
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.970
you missed the x,
it's kind of missed act.
Can I get glare?

803
00:50:51.971 --> 00:50:54.130
So Mr [inaudible] position x,

804
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:59.410
if he enters the election and he wins the election,

805
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:05.130
then his payoff is B because he entered minus c,

806
00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:11.020
sorry B,
because he one minus c cause he had to pay his lecture expense,

807
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.220
right?
But the winning candidate is him.

808
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.140
So he gets no disutility from the winning candidate being someone else.

809
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.193
<v 2>All right,</v>

810
00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.190
<v 0>second possible.
Let's see</v>

811
00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.990
if mr x enters.

812
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.660
But Mr,

813
00:51:28.661 --> 00:51:32.050
why wins then?

814
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:34.440
X is payoff is what he's,

815
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:39.810
he's still incurred minus c cause he ran and he also has a cost of x minus y

816
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:43.600
cause he doesn't like Mr. Why winning

817
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.570
<v 2>and
food.</v>

818
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:54.670
<v 0>Hey if mr x stays out,</v>

819
00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.460
but Mr why wins?

820
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:00.953
<v 2>Okay</v>

821
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:07.330
<v 0>then missed x's payoff.
He doesn't,
when he doesn't get B,
he doesn't lose.</v>

822
00:52:07.331 --> 00:52:08.590
See cause he didn't run,

823
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:13.950
but he still has this disability minus x minus y cause it doesn't like why

824
00:52:13.991 --> 00:52:14.824
winning?

825
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:20.830
<v 2>All right.
Does everyone understand this game?</v>

826
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.910
Ever understand the game.
They are not understanding the game at this point.

827
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:34.740
<v 0>All right,
so in principle we could play this with the whole class,
but let's uh,</v>

828
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.700
single out a particular row of the class.

829
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:41.300
So I'm going to come down here and I guess eventually while I grab it in a

830
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.860
minute,
all right,
so I'm going to use this row,

831
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:50.630
I think this row,
okay.
This Rogers,
everyone in this row stand up a second.

832
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.740
<v 2>Okay.
I remember.
And this row stand up.</v>

833
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:57.980
All right.

834
00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.510
<v 0>This is the row of potential voters.</v>

835
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:06.150
They're the voters there also the potential candidates.
All right.
So we need,

836
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.640
we need to have a convention here,
whether we're,

837
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:11.130
whether we're viewing this from the perspective of people behind them or people

838
00:53:11.131 --> 00:53:13.980
in front of them.
Let's view it from the perspective people in front of them.
So,

839
00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:16.950
so,
uh,
I got an hour I'll cal did around.

840
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.600
People were in behind the head there was active.
Okay.

841
00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:23.340
So this gentleman here whose name is
Andy.

842
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:27.630
Andy,
thank you.
Andy is our crazy right wing guy.

843
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.590
All right.
And uh,
so,

844
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:34.790
so deep tip toe tip toe is all crazy left wing guy,
right?

845
00:53:34.791 --> 00:53:38.370
And everyone else is in between.
There's one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,

846
00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:43.310
nine,
10,
11,
12,
13,
14,
15,
16 people here.
Um,
uh,
let,

847
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.490
let me,
let me add [inaudible] make it 17 peoples.
We haven't had an odd numbers.

848
00:53:46.491 --> 00:53:49.830
They've got to go and just go and sit in that row.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

849
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.440
Just cause it's more like,
okay,
now we have 17 people at this bit.
Bit Easier.

850
00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.260
All right?
Just want to avoid obvious ties.
Okay.
All right.

851
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.650
So how's this going to work?
Every sit down again.
But don't put your,

852
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.260
you keep your books hand,
you can go like you get,

853
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.670
this is gonna be pretty aerobic.
Alright,
so these are,

854
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:07.730
these are the potential voters and each of them is in the position that uh,

855
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.540
Fred Thompson was in two weeks ago in the Republican primary when he's deciding

856
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.590
whether to run or not.
All right?
But in the real world,

857
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:19.500
that's like a sequential game.
People decide to run in some order.

858
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:22.860
We're going to as soon as his,
all simultaneous.
All right?

859
00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:27.720
So what we're gonna do is we're going to hold essentially this game,
right?

860
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.080
We're going to ask everybody in this row,
right?
Whether they want to intern on,

861
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.640
let's make some real numbers.
Let's assume that B is equal to $2.

862
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
So the spoils of government are $2 and intrigue cost you $1 a c is $1.

863
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.110
And we'll assume that the amount of digital is that you get from being,

864
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:51.290
from being a far away from the winner is one 17th of each of these.

865
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.000
Each place is worth one 17 to a dollar.
All right?
On the sensor,
whatever.

866
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.140
Want somebody to be told over,
bro.
Roughly 5 cents,

867
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:02.770
roughly 5 cents for each position away.
Okay,
everyone understanding the frog,

868
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:06.600
what we're doing,
I'm not getting to know you guys.
You guys over here.

869
00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:09.600
You understand what we're doing?
All right,
so on the count of three,

870
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:14.610
on the count of three,
anybody who's entering this election is going to stand up.

871
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:20.120
Ready?
One,
two.
Okay,

872
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:20.973
well

873
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.050
that's the opposite of what's happening with the Florida primary.
Yeah.
Question.

874
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.470
You guys have to decide whether you're okay if you're going to,

875
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.640
if you're running,
you stand up.
Okay.
If for standing,
you stand.
All right.

876
00:55:38.641 --> 00:55:43.170
For Stanley used hand.
All right,
let's try again.
One,
two,

877
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.300
three.
All right.
Stay standing.

878
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:52.230
Stay standing.
Stay standing.
Thanks.
They anything and I'll come around a second.

879
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.720
All right,
so here's our,
here's our election.

880
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:57.810
Here's our election and it's between a which way to under do it.

881
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:59.130
This is all left wing candidate.

882
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:03.030
This is our moderate left wing candidate whose name is Alex,
Alex,

883
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:04.740
and are kind of center candidate.

884
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:08.610
Maybe even the centrist candidate whose name is Beatrice.
Alright.
Alright,

885
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:12.390
so this is the election.
Who's going to win this election?

886
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.290
Right?
Beatrice is going to win this election,
right?

887
00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.520
But let's just check that bitterness is going to get for me to waitress is going

888
00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:25.660
to get all of right wing votes,
right?

889
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:31.290
Beatrice is also going to get a one and a half of the votes in the middle.

890
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:35.960
So what?
Right,
right.
So this vote and half the person guys vote,
right?

891
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:37.990
I've forgotten your name already again.

892
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:40.030
And Alex is going to get all the left wing boots,

893
00:56:40.031 --> 00:56:41.740
but there aren't enough left wing votes here,
right?

894
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:44.500
So this is so bad is going to win.
All right?

895
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:49.210
So bear just won the selection is this array and actually collaborate?

896
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.020
Is this an equilibrium?
How do we know it's not an equilibrium?

897
00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:55.971
I'm not telling you Katie,

898
00:56:55.971 --> 00:56:58.130
how do we know this is not an even wait for the Mike with the mic.
I don't know.

899
00:56:58.131 --> 00:57:00.470
This is not an equilibrium because Alex,
um,

900
00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:05.360
best response to her running is to not run.
Absolutely.
So Alex here,
Alex,

901
00:57:05.361 --> 00:57:07.520
and got with a payoff of what Alexson dealt with.

902
00:57:07.521 --> 00:57:10.820
A payoff of minus c actually more than that,

903
00:57:10.821 --> 00:57:14.260
minus c minus the distance between him and Beatrice.

904
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:18.740
So that's another a $1 5 cents,
10 cents,
20 cents,
whatever it is.
Right?

905
00:57:18.741 --> 00:57:20.780
And he did it on better than not Toronto.
He hadn't run,

906
00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.860
Beatrice would still have one.
They were just build accustomed.

907
00:57:22.861 --> 00:57:25.280
The 20th sense of unhappiness at Petrus winning,

908
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:28.540
but at least you saved himself the sea of running.
Everyone here.

909
00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:32.330
Let's try it again.
Let's try it again.
Okay.
Okay.
Same row.
Same row,

910
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.330
but don't hesitate so much this time,
right?
Anyway,
count of three.

911
00:57:35.331 --> 00:57:38.240
You gonna just go on.
Not Everybody in this road closed their eyes.

912
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.630
You can't look around.
You close your eyes.
Those are eyes.

913
00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.960
We can do all sorts of nasty things.
Now.
Close your eyes.
All right.

914
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:49.610
Most of your stolen this row.
Okay.
All right.
All right,

915
00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:54.050
so ready.
All right,
so one,

916
00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:59.410
two,
three.
All right.
Can Open your eyes again.

917
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:02.890
All right,
so now,
all right,
so now what happened?

918
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:05.530
We ended up with two centrist candidates.
Let's see what happened.

919
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:09.810
So we have beer tress and your name is Claire.
Elise claralise.
All right.

920
00:58:09.811 --> 00:58:14.470
And clearly she's going to get heroin vote plus one or one,
two,
three,
four,
five,

921
00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:19.270
six,
seven,
eight,
eight votes.
And Bare Truss is getting one,
two,

922
00:58:19.271 --> 00:58:23.380
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven.
How they end up with a don't,
I don't know.
Number one,

923
00:58:23.381 --> 00:58:27.530
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven.
It must have been an have a full walk.
Say So.

924
00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:30.520
So Clara isn't going to win this election.
All right.
All right.

925
00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:31.600
Cause you've got one more vote.

926
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.110
Now here we ended up with too centrist candidates,

927
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:39.100
which is a result pretty close to what we saw and though telling marvel,

928
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:44.050
is that right?
Is this any collaborative?
So check out,
I counted,
right?
One,
two,

929
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:48.910
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
one,
two,

930
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.480
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven.
I guess I guess if you count,
right?

931
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:54.670
So clarity is turned out to win this.
I counted that.
Correct.

932
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:57.070
What is another vote hidden behind that?
I didn't see you.
I didn't,

933
00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:04.210
uh,
yeah.
Okay.
So let's,
let's just try again.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five,

934
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:07.480
six,
seven,
eight.
I apologize.
Beatrice won this election.
I apologize.

935
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:10.630
Beatrice won this election.
All right.
Is this an equilibrium?

936
00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:15.710
Is this an equilibrium?
How do we know this isn't an equilibrium?

937
00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:23.030
Cause Tony's would rather not have.
Ron is right.
All right,
let's try one small.

938
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.980
All right.
Down again.
Close your eyes again.
Let's,
um,
uh,
let's just,

939
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:31.370
uh,
just keep life interesting.
Let's switch to these,
to this row.

940
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:34.120
Can we switch to this row?
Okay.
All right.
So this is our road.

941
00:59:34.121 --> 00:59:36.290
Now everyone understand this?

942
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.440
Close your computer so you can get up without destroying thousands of dollars of

943
00:59:39.441 --> 00:59:44.120
technology.
All right.
This is our row and at the count of three,

944
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.510
we're going to see you.
It's going to run.
Okay.
Everyone understand the game?

945
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.220
All right.
Close your eyes.
Close Your eyes about them.

946
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:55.250
One,
two,
three.

947
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

948
00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.140
<v 0>All right.
All right.
So</v>

949
01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.520
he said,
okay.
So I told him this,
he's going to win this election.
Is that right?

950
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:12.890
All right.
Uh,
and just,
uh,
ask the question,
is this an equilibrium?

951
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.430
Is this an equilibrium?
Is He,
let's count.
One,
two,
three,

952
01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:22.070
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,

953
01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:27.680
get 10 votes.
Obviously he hit,
there were 10 including himself through 10 votes.

954
01:00:27.681 --> 01:00:31.190
Here you don't count correctly.
One,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six.

955
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.620
Is He actually the center guy here?
There?

956
01:00:32.621 --> 01:00:34.610
I don't think he used the center guy here.
All right,

957
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:39.470
so I claim if I've counted correctly that this actually isn't an equilibrium.

958
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:44.140
Right?
Who can deviate and do better here?
Yeah.

959
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.340
This guy stand up a second.

960
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:50.230
Whose name is John Entered?
If I've counted correctly,

961
01:00:50.231 --> 01:00:51.190
it's pretend I have.

962
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.980
John would actually have won this election because John is actually further to

963
01:00:53.981 --> 01:00:58.850
the center.
All right.
All right.
Okay,
so let's,

964
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.400
thanks for a second guys.
I'll,
I'll,
I'll come back to something second.
All right.

965
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:07.120
All right.
Let's try and figure out how to analyze this game.

966
01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:08.440
We've played it three times.

967
01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:13.010
Let's try and figure out what the equilibrium look like in this game.
Right?

968
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.460
This game is going on more or less right now in the primaries,

969
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:19.480
I guess the entrance data entry stage of it.
It's gone there.
All right,

970
01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.950
so first of all,

971
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.280
is there a nash equilibrium in which no candidates stand?

972
01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.830
Is there a nash equilibrium in which nobody stands?
No.

973
01:01:32.831 --> 01:01:36.460
How do we know that's not a Nash equilibrium?
Somebody.
Somebody,
yeah.

974
01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:39.640
How do we know that's not a Nash equilibrium?
Shout it out.

975
01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:44.290
Somebody who's definitely a better off by standing up,
right?

976
01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:48.440
If nobody stands,
each and every possible candidate would do better individually.

977
01:01:48.441 --> 01:01:52.240
So any,
any particular voter would do better standing.

978
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:55.360
They would win the election.
Is that right?
All right.

979
01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.450
So clearly it's not an equilibrium for nobody to stand.
That's good.
Good.

980
01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:01.420
We don't see that very often.
All right.

981
01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.720
Is there a nash equilibrium in which one and only one candidate stands?

982
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

983
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:16.100
<v 0>Yeah,
so,
so,
so yeah,
so directly in the center.
All right,</v>

984
01:02:16.101 --> 01:02:19.530
so given that we chose an odd number of an odd number of people on the row,

985
01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:24.850
if exactly one candidate stands and that candidate is the center candidates,

986
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:29.760
then that's an equilibrium.
How do we know that's an equilibrium?

987
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.970
Somebody give me the arguments why that's an equipment so that that's a,
it's a,

988
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.650
it's a good,
it's infected.
Correct gas.
But how do we know that to an equilibrium?

989
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:41.970
That's the guest pot.
How do we check that to an equilibrium?
Yeah.

990
01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:46.980
Curry's shout out if anybody on either side of them chose to run,

991
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.430
they would lose.
They would lose.
Exactly.

992
01:02:50.431 --> 01:02:55.080
So if anybody on either side of them runs right,
that person would simply lose.

993
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:57.600
It.
Wouldn't make any difference to the outcome,
right?

994
01:02:57.601 --> 01:03:01.380
If a person on the right stones,
let's just try it again.
We,
we figured out that,

995
01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:04.800
um,
how,
how if a pitcher stands up a second,
right?

996
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:08.730
So here's our potential equilibrium with just better standing,
right?

997
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:11.180
And if somebody's to the,
which way do we doing it?

998
01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.800
Somebody just the rights of Petrus was to stand so matter.

999
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:17.730
If you sound a second and your name is Stacy stands,

1000
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.250
it doesn't make any difference.
You just lose it.
It's Beatrice winds anyway.

1001
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:23.850
It just costs a bare trust and money.
Right?
And conversely,

1002
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.200
if pitchers don't understand,

1003
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:29.820
and so going a second on the woman who's wandered in from the side that just
sit,

1004
01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:34.160
sit down a second,
say,
see if this person stands and your name is Sarah stands.

1005
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.050
It doesn't help.
Sarah told you,
just lose this.
Is that right?

1006
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.190
So the evening equilibrium with exactly one candidates,

1007
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.540
the center candidates.

1008
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.190
Now that's looking a little bit like the median voter model,
right?

1009
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:51.390
It says the isn't equilibrium with only one candidate standing and that and that

1010
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.960
candidate would be the median candidates,
right?

1011
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:59.340
Just like it was in the model we saw on your homework assignment and also a,
um,

1012
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:03.900
uh,
an clause.
However we're not done yet.

1013
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:08.910
There could be other equilibria,
there could be other equilibrium.

1014
01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:12.810
All right?
So let's just try and think about whether there are other equilibria.

1015
01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:17.850
So for example,
suppose now just to make life a little bit more interesting,

1016
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.120
suppose that the voters were actually two rows and just just allow me the uh,

1017
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:24.750
the uh,
um,

1018
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:27.750
suspension of disbelief that these roads have the same number of people in
there.

1019
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:29.340
I know they don't really.
All right,

1020
01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.850
so now what I want you to think of is that every person at every political

1021
01:04:32.851 --> 01:04:37.410
position,
there are two voters and hence two possible candidates.

1022
01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.960
All right?
There's two people at every position.

1023
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:42.900
These two people at this position,
these two people are at this position.

1024
01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.340
All right?
Everyone understand that?

1025
01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.920
Let's assume that the roads are the same even though they're not.

1026
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:52.170
And let's examine the following thing.
Suppose Beatrice stands again,
sorry.

1027
01:04:52.171 --> 01:04:54.870
Beatrice and the gentleman in front of him.

1028
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:59.040
A friend of foe whose name is robots.
Towns as well.
So it's not a second.

1029
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.150
All right,

1030
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:05.150
so now we have two candidates standing who identical politically that right into

1031
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:10.680
go write that right on top of each other.
All right,

1032
01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:15.450
now is that an equilibrium is not an equilibrium.

1033
01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.420
Awful limit.
That looks a lot like the downs are telling model,
right?

1034
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:23.080
We've got two candidates.
Exactly at the middle.
Is that an equilibrium?

1035
01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.330
<v 2>Let me try the guy up here.</v>

1036
01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.230
<v 0>No,
because if someone on either side of them were to stand up,</v>

1037
01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.840
that person on the side would win.
Good,
good.

1038
01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.460
This can't be an equilibrium because look what happens if for clearly stands a

1039
01:05:38.461 --> 01:05:40.230
second.
All right,

1040
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:45.210
Clara lease is gonna win all of the right wing votes,

1041
01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.180
right?
Ranging from crazy to moderate,
right?

1042
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.050
And these guys are going to split the left wing votes,
right?

1043
01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:58.060
So the total sum of right wing votes is going to beat out half of the left wing

1044
01:05:58.291 --> 01:06:02.060
votes.
All right?
All right.
So that can't be any gray,

1045
01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:06.090
the exact prediction of the downs model.
Two guys right on top of each other.

1046
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:10.500
It's not an equal and sit down again guys.
All right.
All right,

1047
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:14.010
let's go back to one row again cause it's easy to work with.
All right,

1048
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:18.890
let's try a slightly different pattern.
So suppose seeming I counted rights,

1049
01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:23.130
I suppose that the following candidates enter.
So,
uh,

1050
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:27.210
Clara Lewis enters and I'm sorry,
I don't know your name.
Uh,

1051
01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:32.070
Jean Jean enters.
So let's,
let's,
let's have a look at this array.
All right.

1052
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:35.850
And assume I got it right.
And Richard is actually the center.
All right.

1053
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:38.370
Now is that an equilibrium?

1054
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.793
<v 2>Is that an equilibrium?</v>

1055
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.620
<v 0>Who thinks that isn't any collaborative?
Who thinks it's not an equilibrium?</v>

1056
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:52.110
Who's waiting to see how,
how,
how other people vote?
Well,
let's check.

1057
01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:53.730
Let's check.
All right,

1058
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.840
so there's three possible types of deviation here that we can't need to check.

1059
01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:02.400
We need to check another entrance from the outside.
Leftwing or rightwing.

1060
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:04.290
We need to check.

1061
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:07.920
And another entrance in the middle of the Disney one possible one that,

1062
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:11.280
and there's a third kind of deviation we should check what the third type of

1063
01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:15.030
deviation
one of these might choose not to run.

1064
01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.160
Why don't you mind if I tried to do it?
It might choose not to run.

1065
01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.050
Let's do them in turn.

1066
01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:23.970
So suppose suppose that we consider a deviation in which they're gonna have

1067
01:07:23.971 --> 01:07:27.540
forgotten your name in which Stacy stands as well.
Stacey,
just down a second.

1068
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:33.180
All right,
so is this a profitable deviation for spacey?
No,

1069
01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:36.330
it's not right.
It's not.
Why isn't it a profitable deviation,
Stacy?

1070
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:40.860
So two reasons,
and I also have that same one,
is that she loses,

1071
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:44.010
right?
She's not going to win this election by standing.

1072
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:48.120
But there's a second reason why this is a really bad deviation.
Why is it,

1073
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:52.430
what's the second reason?
Yes sir.
The winter's going to be farther away from her.

1074
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:56.940
Good.
Good.
So by standing alone is usually not win the election,

1075
01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:01.530
but she actually causes the election to be one for sure,

1076
01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:03.390
by Jean who's further away from her.

1077
01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.170
That's not right to space is going to pick up the right wing votes.

1078
01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:11.310
She's going to split the crazy right wing voters going to pick up the moderate

1079
01:08:11.311 --> 01:08:14.960
rightwing votes.
She's going to split with,
uh,
with claralise fry.

1080
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.500
And gene's going to have all the left wing votes extreme and moderates.

1081
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.710
And so from Stacy's point of view,
this is a double bad.

1082
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.370
She doesn't get to be president.
Sorry,
I end.
You end up with a,

1083
01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:28.240
with a left wing president,
which he didn't like.
All right,

1084
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.100
everyone see this so clearly.
That's a little thank you.

1085
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.350
That sort of probably deviation.
Hang on.
Wait,
wait,
wait.
You guys were guys,

1086
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.380
and it's also not a profitable deviation for people on the,
on the left.

1087
01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:38.140
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second.
All right.

1088
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:41.000
So I think it's probably obvious why it's not off.

1089
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:44.490
It's not a good strategy for a bit for bedrest and to hear if betters enters,

1090
01:08:44.491 --> 01:08:48.230
she loses.
Everyone can see that the person in the middle,
if they enter here,

1091
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:51.590
lose,
loses.
They're not gonna want to answer.
All right.

1092
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:56.180
So the other possible deviation we have to consider is a deviation of the form

1093
01:08:56.270 --> 01:09:01.100
of one of these guys dropping out.
All right,
so let's consider it.

1094
01:09:01.101 --> 01:09:05.650
So,
so coming back to to Clara,
lease is clarity.

1095
01:09:05.651 --> 01:09:08.150
It's doing better in or out.

1096
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:12.500
He's clearly doing better in this election or out.

1097
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:18.230
Alright,
let's think it through a second.
If she stays in,
what's her payoff?

1098
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:24.010
She wins be with probably a half she costs.

1099
01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:26.540
See for sure that's a wash,
right?

1100
01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:31.130
Because be over the way we work things out be with $2.
See was $1.

1101
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.820
So be over two minus C is,
is a wash,
right?

1102
01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:36.540
In terms of the of,

1103
01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.010
so in terms of the benefits of the spoils of government versus the cost of

1104
01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:43.820
running,
it's a wash for clarity's whether she enters a note,
right?

1105
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.950
But by entering she has a half chance of winning the election.
All right.

1106
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.300
So when we think about is,

1107
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:55.390
is the expected distance from her of the winning candidates is with probably a

1108
01:09:55.761 --> 01:09:58.400
half it herself.
That's nothing.
No distance.

1109
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:03.020
And we'll probably a half to two places away,
right?
So an expectation.

1110
01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:07.070
It's one place away.
If she drops out,
gene wins for sure.

1111
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.391
All right,

1112
01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:11.510
so the expected distance away from her for the winning candidate is to away.

1113
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.880
All right?
Just to say it again.

1114
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.760
So the cost and direct benefits of government or a wash for her,

1115
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:21.410
but by dropping out,
she ensures that somebody further away from her wins.

1116
01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:22.820
For sure.
That's bad.

1117
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:26.150
So she's going to stay in under Saint Margaret goes the other way.

1118
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:30.250
So this is an equilibrium,
man.
We're not done.

1119
01:10:30.251 --> 01:10:31.310
And of course we're at a time.

1120
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.150
So what are we going to do when we come back next week?
But what are you doing?

1121
01:10:34.151 --> 01:10:38.330
Don't pack up yet.
We're going to do,
we're going to come back to this row.

1122
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.250
I'm going to figure out not just this equilibrium but all equal.

1123
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.230
But before you go there,

1124
01:10:42.231 --> 01:10:44.750
it's just think about it a second so you can think about it and talk about it at

1125
01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:45.584
home.

1126
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:50.240
So what we just saw was an election in which we saw two candidates,

1127
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:54.170
Jean and Clara,
Elise,
who both stood very close to each other.

1128
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.070
But a different question is,
hang on before you go,
before you go.

1129
01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:03.220
Stand up my very that my very left wing Guy [inaudible] way or that way there's,

1130
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:07.760
Yup.
Yup,
Yup.
And stand up my very right wing guy.

1131
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:10.460
He's a candidate.

1132
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:14.840
Here's now carbon with two entrance and it's an extreme right wing guy and

1133
01:11:14.841 --> 01:11:18.020
extreme left wing guy.
Is that an equilibrium?

1134
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.180
Think about it until we come back on Monday.
