&gt;&gt;Hello.
This year's annual meeting's theme is Rethink,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.150
Redesign, Rebuild.
And I think when considering this very nice

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.550
themes, I would like to
raise the question of state sovereignty.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.940
I think it is a good time to redefine the
concept of state sovereignty

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.660
in a way that oppressive government would
not be able to oppress their

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.859
people, to violate their people.
A government such as Iran government, especially

00:00:49.859 --> 00:01:00.350
since fraudulent
election, cracking down protest, trying to,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.030
you know, terrorize people
to stop coming to the street and to protest

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.710
the against the state.
So this is responsibility of international

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:20.370
community to take, you know,
responsibility, to raise and criticize Iran's

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.610
government regarding
human rights violation.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.170
Here are other few countries that are oppressing
their people so I

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.530
think it is time to raise and to redefine
the concept of state

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.140
sovereignty.
I hope at the final report of the annual meeting

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.070
we could see
reflection of this new definition on the final

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.799
report.
Thank you.
