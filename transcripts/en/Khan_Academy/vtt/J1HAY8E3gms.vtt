00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.120
We're told that the glass
portion of the window shown

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.720
below-- that's the window--
has a height to width the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.660
ratio of 3:2.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.450
So the height of the glass
portion can be represented as

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:21.250
3x and the width of the
glass portion can be

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.500
represented as 2x.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.890
The wood trim adds 7 inches to
the total width and 8 inches

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.540
to the total height.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.670
So let me write that down.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.450
So 8 in height, we're
doing it in yellow.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.650
So 8 inches to the total height,
I'll do it in yellow,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.330
and 7 inches to the total
width, I'll do in this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.680
purplish color, right?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.670
We're doing the width
in purple.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.050
Now what they say is write a
polynomial expression that

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.350
represents the total area of
the window, including the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.450
glass and wood.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.750
Simplify the expression.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.480
Now, the way they've described
it, they're telling us the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.460
ratio of 3:2 for the
glass portion.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.500
I think when they're talking
about the glass portion,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.610
they're talking about this
entire portion right here.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.370
Even though it's not all glass,
you have that thing in

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.010
the middle, you have this
divider right over here,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.450
that's not glass, but I think
they're including that as the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.160
glass portion, because they're
not giving us any

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.460
measurements for that.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.125
So the height of the glass
portion can be

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:26.830
represented as 3x.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.050
So this height right here of
just the glass portion is 3x.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.920
You can't see that.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.360
Let me do it in a
better color.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.510
This portion right here is 3x,
just this distance right here.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.290
That is the height of
the glass portion.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.610
And then they tell us the wood
trim adds 8 inches to the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.650
total height.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.670
So if you take that 3x and then
you add that plus that,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.600
this whole distance over here,
which is the glass portion

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.740
plus the wood trim on either
end, it adds 8 inches to the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.310
glass portion.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.990
The glass portion is 3x, so
we're going to add 8 to it.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.990
So this height right
here 3x plus 8.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.090
And now let's think
about the width.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.090
The width of the glass portion
can be represented as 2x, so

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.020
that distance right there, just
the glass portion, is 2x.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.255
But then they say when you add
the wood trim, the wood trim

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:23.550
adds 7 inches to the total
width, so this total width

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.770
right here, because we're adding
that piece and that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.050
piece to it, is 2x plus 7.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.860
That is the total width of
the window, the total

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.670
height is 3x plus 8.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.460
Now, what they want us to
do is write a polynomial

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.900
expression that represents the
total area of the window

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.510
including the glass and wood.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.230
Simplify the expression.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.890
Now, the total area is
just going to be the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.630
height times the width.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.950
So let's just write that down.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.360
The area is just going to be
equal to the height, which is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.996
3x plus 8 times the width,
times 2x plus 7.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.700
And that is the expression
we've written up.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.680
Well, we haven't done
it as a polynomial.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.300
We've written it as a product
of two binomials.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.580
And if we want to simplify it,
we can just multiply it out.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.560
So the way you can think about
it is we multiply-- you're

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.760
doing the distributive property
twice essentially.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.150
But you could say let's multiply
3x times 2x, so you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.680
get 3x times 2x.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.160
That's multiplying
it times that.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.600
Then you want to multiply 3x
times 7, which is 21x-- let me

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.260
just write it this way--
plus 3x times 7.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.740
And then you want to multiply
this 8 times both of these

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.320
terms. So then you have
plus 8 times 2x.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.900
Let me do this.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.185
So plus 8 times 2x and then
you have plus 8 times 7.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.610
And now we just have to
simplify everything.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.130
So what does this become?

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:17.920
3x times 2x is 6x squared plus
3x times 7 is plus 21x plus 8

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.700
times 2x, so plus 16x, and then
plus 8 times 7, 8 times 7

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.340
is 56, plus 56.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.370
We can combine these
two middle terms.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.650
21x plus 16x is what?

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.120
37x.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.940
So then we get-- let me just
do it in another color-- 6x

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.870
squared plus 37x plus 56.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.260
Now we've expressed it as
a simplified polynomial

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.510
expression.
