00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.600
It's funny, when I first saw the movie "Lilo &amp; Stitch" my initial thought was,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.340
I loved everything with the human characters and thought the alien stuff was only okay.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.160
Well, now with its sequel "Stitch", I find that strangely enough,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.040
the human stuff is only okay but the aliens are actually a little bit more entertaining this time.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.860
Does that make for a good sequel?

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.160
Well, let's look at the story.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.220
Lilo and Stitch are enjoying their time getting used to their new alien family,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.660
Yeah, remember the Russian alien and the skinny one? They're all living together now.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.960
But the alien captain of the guard is furious because he's lost his job and he wants revenge.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.760
So he comes across this sort of strange, hamster-rabbit thing with a German accent.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.260
(How do all these aliens have Earth accents anyway?)

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.880
And he's sent to get the Russian alien, bring him back,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.800
and find out where all the other experiments they worked on are.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.560
Yeah, remember? Stitch is number 626, so where are the other 625?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.460
Well, it turns out he's hidden them and Lilo and Stitch come across a few.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.140
So it's up to them not only to discover these other experiments, kind of like finding PokÃ©mon in a sense,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.380
but also to save their alien comrade.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.540
So like I said before, this time it's a little switched around.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.180
The aliens in this actually have some really good laughs.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.600
This weird rabbit-gerbil thing is pretty funny,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.420
the captain of the guard is trying to be serious but keeps having to come across these annoyances,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.960
He even gets this sidekick voiced by Rob Paulsen.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.480
Even Stitch gets a few more laughs this time.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.320
I also really like how the skinny alien is really getting used to wearing women's' clothing, and he's totally okay with it.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.060
Who knows, this might be the first openly transvestite Disney character.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.580
Unfortunately though, like I said, the human characters are not as good.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.940
They're not the worst, they're just kind of bland and generic.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.360
But for me, Lilo is one of my favorite kid characters,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.980
and to see her just kind of be like any other Disney generic kid is really kind of a letdown.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.420
Even Nani, who had to go through so much in the first film, now just kind of has this side role.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.260
I dunno, I felt like coming off of the first film where those connections were so strong and so good,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.280
this one is just kind of a background thing.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.100
Maybe that's why it was called "Stitch", because they just wanted to give him more attention and not as much to the humans,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.280
But I liked the humans, I liked them a lot, I wish more effort was put into them in this one.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.300
But, let's also be honest, this isn't really meant to be a fleshed-out motion picture.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.940
I mean, look at the animation, it looks like a TV show. And, yeah, it became a TV show.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.620
It's a little difficult to be hard on it when it's pretty obvious it's just supposed to be a pilot.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.540
Aaand as pilots go, it got a few laughs.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.660
The aliens were neat, they were creative. I like the idea of trying to find more of them.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.780
In fact, I think that's what the show's about.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.800
But yeah, it is a letdown that a character as good as Nani and Lilo are just reduced down to, well,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.680
any generic character you would see in a Disney sequel.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.520
But I guess if you're just looking for a laugh or two and something relatively harmless, it's...fine.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.660
It's fine for little kids, I think that's who it was aimed at, and there's nothing really insulting in it.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.300
I mean Lilo and Nani are not done well, but they're totally passable for the audience it's aiming towards.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.180
It is what it is, a cute little direct to DVD pilot for a TV show and, yeah, you just kind of take what comes with that.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.400
I wouldn't watch it again, I don't really think I got much out of it even watching the first time,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.220
But for what it's trying to do, it does it...okay.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.360
Get lost in space and see for yourself.
