00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.742
When we talk about processor performance, we typically

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:06.571
talk about its speed, how many instructions per

00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:08.779
second can it finish, but we also have

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.470
to consider its fabrication cost and the power

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.806
consumption it will have. Lower fabrication costs allow

00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:18.722
us to put processors that are more powerful

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:22.853
into devices that cannot be expensive, like refrigerators

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:26.180
and watches and all sorts of other things.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.890
Low power consumption is important not only because

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.570
of the cost of electricity, but also because

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.190
it translates into longer battery life and smaller

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.536
form factors for things like cell phones. So what

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:40.944
we really want is that the speed of

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:45.072
a processor doubles over something like two years, that

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.910
the cost of this twice as fast processor

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.780
stays about the same, and that the power consumption

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.585
of this twice as fast processor stays about the same as before. But we don't

00:00:57.585 --> 00:01:00.560
have to use technology improvement to get

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.263
this. We can get, instead, a smaller improvement

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:09.958
in speed, let's say 1.1x, for about half the cost as the original processor, and

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.844
let's say about half the power consumption

00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:16.850
of the original processor. Which one of these

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.920
do you want? Well, it depends what kind of computer you're building. So, one

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.190
of the jobs of computer architects is

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.690
really to figure out, given that the technology

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.330
can provide either this or this, or

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.210
something in between them. Actually, there are

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.460
many more options. Which one do I really want for a specific type of computer?
