that's that course works now today we're

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
that's that course works now today we're
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.010
that's that course works now today we're
going to talk about the infectious cycle

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020
going to talk about the infectious cycle
 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.280
going to talk about the infectious cycle
how it is that viruses infect cells and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
how it is that viruses infect cells and
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.480
how it is that viruses infect cells and
we also call the infectious cycle virus

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
we also call the infectious cycle virus
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.359
we also call the infectious cycle virus
replication same thing synonymous terms

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
replication same thing synonymous terms
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.270
replication same thing synonymous terms
it is the sum total of everything that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
it is the sum total of everything that
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.810
it is the sum total of everything that
happens from the point when a virus

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
happens from the point when a virus
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390
happens from the point when a virus
attaches to its cell everything that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
attaches to its cell everything that
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.210
attaches to its cell everything that
happens in between until new virions are

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
happens in between until new virions are
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980
happens in between until new virions are
made and they're released from selves so

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
made and they're released from selves so
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530
made and they're released from selves so
that's infectious cycle or virus

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
that's infectious cycle or virus
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200
that's infectious cycle or virus
replication so during this process you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
replication so during this process you
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.840
replication so during this process you
make many copies of the viral genome you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
make many copies of the viral genome you
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.870
make many copies of the viral genome you
package them into particles and then

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
package them into particles and then
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.429
package them into particles and then
those particles come out of the cell and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
those particles come out of the cell and
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440
those particles come out of the cell and
reinfect these are all processes that we

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
reinfect these are all processes that we
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.749
reinfect these are all processes that we
will talk about in detail during this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
will talk about in detail during this
 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.749
will talk about in detail during this
course everything begins with one cell

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759
course everything begins with one cell
 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.639
course everything begins with one cell
whether it's in an animal or in cell

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
whether it's in an animal or in cell
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.200
whether it's in an animal or in cell
culture and today we're going to look at

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
culture and today we're going to look at
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.660
culture and today we're going to look at
the ways we study this infectious cycle

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
the ways we study this infectious cycle
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.719
the ways we study this infectious cycle
in a single cell and this is an example

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
in a single cell and this is an example
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660
in a single cell and this is an example
of a typical infectious cycle for a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
of a typical infectious cycle for a
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.020
of a typical infectious cycle for a
virus this happens to be polio via

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
virus this happens to be polio via
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.390
virus this happens to be polio via
but there's one for every virus they're

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
but there's one for every virus they're
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.170
but there's one for every virus they're
all different

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
all different
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.460
all different
and we as virologist like to divide the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
and we as virologist like to divide the
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.790
and we as virologist like to divide the
infectious cycle into discrete stages to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800
infectious cycle into discrete stages to
 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.309
infectious cycle into discrete stages to
help study and describe them but of

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319
help study and describe them but of
 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.770
help study and describe them but of
course in an infected cell there is no

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
course in an infected cell there is no
 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.199
course in an infected cell there is no
first stage second stage third state

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
first stage second stage third state
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.630
first stage second stage third state
everything happens in a continuum but we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640
everything happens in a continuum but we
 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.580
everything happens in a continuum but we
do that we make artificial boundaries

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
do that we make artificial boundaries
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.080
do that we make artificial boundaries
where they don't exist so here for

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090
where they don't exist so here for
 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.059
where they don't exist so here for
example is an infectious cycle of

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069
example is an infectious cycle of
 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.840
example is an infectious cycle of
poliovirus

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
poliovirus
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.180
poliovirus
it starts with the process called

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
it starts with the process called
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.370
it starts with the process called
attachment and entry the viruses bind to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380
attachment and entry the viruses bind to
 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.160
attachment and entry the viruses bind to
receptors on the cell surface they enter

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
receptors on the cell surface they enter
 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170
receptors on the cell surface they enter
the cell in some way here we just show

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180
the cell in some way here we just show
 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.110
the cell in some way here we just show
the genome appearing in the cytoplasm

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
the genome appearing in the cytoplasm
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.150
the genome appearing in the cytoplasm
but there are specific mechanisms that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160
but there are specific mechanisms that
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.630
but there are specific mechanisms that
lead to that which we will talk about

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640
lead to that which we will talk about
 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.250
lead to that which we will talk about
and then what happens next depends on

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
and then what happens next depends on
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.759
and then what happens next depends on
the kind of nucleic acid that each virus

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769
the kind of nucleic acid that each virus
 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.160
the kind of nucleic acid that each virus
encases so in this case the virus has a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
encases so in this case the virus has a
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.520
encases so in this case the virus has a
plus stranded RNA inside the capsid so

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
plus stranded RNA inside the capsid so
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.870
plus stranded RNA inside the capsid so
that means the first thing that can

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
that means the first thing that can
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.059
that means the first thing that can
happen is that it can be translated in a

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069
happen is that it can be translated in a
 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.070
happen is that it can be translated in a
cell nothing else is necessary except

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080
cell nothing else is necessary except
 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.220
cell nothing else is necessary except
the RNA here we show the translation

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
the RNA here we show the translation
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.800
the RNA here we show the translation
process the production of viral proteins

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
process the production of viral proteins
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.380
process the production of viral proteins
and eventually those proteins give rise

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390
and eventually those proteins give rise
 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.890
and eventually those proteins give rise
to new capsids new shells for the viral

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
to new capsids new shells for the viral
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.259
to new capsids new shells for the viral
genome but of course you also have to

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269
genome but of course you also have to
 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.390
genome but of course you also have to
replicate the nucleic acid and that's

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
replicate the nucleic acid and that's
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.670
replicate the nucleic acid and that's
shown here as well for this virus the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680
shown here as well for this virus the
 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.550
shown here as well for this virus the
nucleic acid is replicated or copies are

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560
nucleic acid is replicated or copies are
 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.160
nucleic acid is replicated or copies are
made of it on membranous vesicles within

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170
made of it on membranous vesicles within
 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.259
made of it on membranous vesicles within
the cytoplasm and we'll talk about this

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269
the cytoplasm and we'll talk about this
 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.900
the cytoplasm and we'll talk about this
process in some detail and eventually

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910
process in some detail and eventually
 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.729
process in some detail and eventually
the virus RNA comes together with the

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739
the virus RNA comes together with the
 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.890
the virus RNA comes together with the
capsid proteins new virions are made and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900
capsid proteins new virions are made and
 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.190
capsid proteins new virions are made and
released this infectious cycle for polio

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200
released this infectious cycle for polio
 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.020
released this infectious cycle for polio
happens to take place only in the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030
happens to take place only in the
 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.420
happens to take place only in the
cytoplasm of the cell nucleus isn't

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430
cytoplasm of the cell nucleus isn't
 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.910

susceptible all that refers to is
whether the cell has a receptor for the

about susceptibility that is the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550
about susceptibility that is the
 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.450
about susceptibility that is the
presence or absence of a virus receptor

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460
presence or absence of a virus receptor
 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.360
presence or absence of a virus receptor
all right now as you might imagine the

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370
all right now as you might imagine the
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.480
all right now as you might imagine the
cell that a virus can bind to and enter

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490
cell that a virus can bind to and enter
 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.269
cell that a virus can bind to and enter
and replicate in is both susceptible and

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279
and replicate in is both susceptible and
 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.939
and replicate in is both susceptible and
permissive so it has receptors on the

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949
permissive so it has receptors on the
 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.829
permissive so it has receptors on the
cell surface and it is permissive

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839
cell surface and it is permissive
 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:43.129
cell surface and it is permissive
meaning that once the virus gets past

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139
meaning that once the virus gets past
 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.700
meaning that once the virus gets past
the plasma membrane it has everything it

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710
the plasma membrane it has everything it
 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.499
the plasma membrane it has everything it
needs in order to replicate make more

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509
needs in order to replicate make more
 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.629
needs in order to replicate make more
genomes and make more particles alright

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639
genomes and make more particles alright
 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.990

so we'll use these over and over in this

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000
so we'll use these over and over in this
 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.480
so we'll use these over and over in this
course so I think this is something that

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490
course so I think this is something that
 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.290
course so I think this is something that
is worth committing to memory now let's

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300
is worth committing to memory now let's
 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.499
is worth committing to memory now let's
start with the infectious cycle again

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509
start with the infectious cycle again
 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.279
start with the infectious cycle again

until many years later that we learned
how to grow viruses and cells so in fact

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500
how to grow viruses and cells so in fact
 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.140
how to grow viruses and cells so in fact
most viruses were not only studied in

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150
most viruses were not only studied in
 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.850
most viruses were not only studied in
animals but they were propagated in them

it'd take out the spinal cord grind it
 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.570
it'd take out the spinal cord grind it
up and you would have a stock of virus

up and you would have a stock of virus
 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.850
up and you would have a stock of virus
and then because there weren't freezers

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860

at the turn of the 20th century
 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.620
at the turn of the 20th century
you couldn't store your virus stock so

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630
you couldn't store your virus stock so
 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.510
you couldn't store your virus stock so
you had to keep passing it in animals

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520
you had to keep passing it in animals
 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.670
you had to keep passing it in animals

grow cells in culture we could then

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:20.910
grow cells in culture we could then
 

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.150
grow cells in culture we could then
study the infectious cycle in them and

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160
study the infectious cycle in them and
 

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.889
study the infectious cycle in them and
you'll see why it was necessary to have

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899
you'll see why it was necessary to have
 

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:26.930
you'll see why it was necessary to have
cells to do that that wasn't possible

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940
cells to do that that wasn't possible
 

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.139

before 1949 for animal viruses we could
 

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:32.269
before 1949 for animal viruses we could
do it for bacteria and they in fact led

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279
do it for bacteria and they in fact led
 

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.829
do it for bacteria and they in fact led
the way and studying the infectious

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839
the way and studying the infectious
 

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.730

scientists at Harvard Medical School
 

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.340
scientists at Harvard Medical School
learned that they could grow poliovirus

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:46.350
learned that they could grow poliovirus
 

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.249
learned that they could grow poliovirus
in a human cell culture and they took

00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:49.259
in a human cell culture and they took
 

00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:51.259
in a human cell culture and they took
human embryos and disrupted them and

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:51.269
human embryos and disrupted them and
 

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:52.970
human embryos and disrupted them and
made various cell cultures and they said

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980
made various cell cultures and they said
 

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.740
made various cell cultures and they said
they found that that poliovirus would

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:54.750
they found that that poliovirus would
 

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.569
they found that that poliovirus would
grow in them and no one had been able to

00:09:56.569 --> 00:09:56.579
grow in them and no one had been able to
 

00:09:56.579 --> 00:09:59.509
grow in them and no one had been able to
do that before and they won the Nobel

00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519
do that before and they won the Nobel
 

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:02.660
do that before and they won the Nobel
Prize for that in 1954 the head of the

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:02.670
Prize for that in 1954 the head of the
 

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.050

that he was going to get the Nobel Prize

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:12.630
that he was going to get the Nobel Prize
 

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.019
that he was going to get the Nobel Prize
he said you have to include Weller and

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:15.029
he said you have to include Weller and
 

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:18.769
he said you have to include Weller and
Robbins and they did as well so that was

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.139
chemicals or by viruses themselves but
now you have what's called the cell line

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:48.149
now you have what's called the cell line
 

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:52.220
now you have what's called the cell line
which you can propagate indefinitely so

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:52.230
which you can propagate indefinitely so
 

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.900
which you can propagate indefinitely so
here is an immortal Mouse cell line the

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:53.910
here is an immortal Mouse cell line the
 

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.810
here is an immortal Mouse cell line the
3t3 line here's a human epithelial cell

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820
3t3 line here's a human epithelial cell
 

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.150
3t3 line here's a human epithelial cell
line the HeLa cell line so we call these

00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160
line the HeLa cell line so we call these
 

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.310
line the HeLa cell line so we call these
continuous cell lines and they've been

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320
continuous cell lines and they've been
 

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.320
continuous cell lines and they've been
enormous ly useful for studying many

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:03.330
enormous ly useful for studying many
 

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.990
enormous ly useful for studying many
viruses but the problem is they're not

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000
viruses but the problem is they're not
 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.090
viruses but the problem is they're not
normal they have odd numbers of

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100
normal they have odd numbers of
 

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.949
normal they have odd numbers of
chromosomes they have not the normal

00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959
chromosomes they have not the normal
 

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.269
chromosomes they have not the normal
number of human chromosomes that have

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279
number of human chromosomes that have
 

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:14.240
number of human chromosomes that have
other aberrations as well and if you

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.250
other aberrations as well and if you
 

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.740
other aberrations as well and if you
want to grow vaccines you don't want to

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:15.750
want to grow vaccines you don't want to
 

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.199
want to grow vaccines you don't want to
use these for vaccine propagation so

00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:18.209
use these for vaccine propagation so
 

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:20.150
use these for vaccine propagation so
other cell lines have been developed

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160
other cell lines have been developed
 

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.070
other cell lines have been developed
which are called diploid cell strains

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:22.080
which are called diploid cell strains
 

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.620
which are called diploid cell strains
these have the normal numbers of human

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:24.630
these have the normal numbers of human
 

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.290
these have the normal numbers of human
chromosomes and they will multiply for a

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300
chromosomes and they will multiply for a
 

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.940
chromosomes and they will multiply for a
fixed number of divisions they will

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:28.950
fixed number of divisions they will
 

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.850
fixed number of divisions they will
eventually die so they're not immortal

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860
eventually die so they're not immortal
 

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.160
eventually die so they're not immortal
but they will live longer than the

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.170
but they will live longer than the
 

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.199
but they will live longer than the
primary cells so they're useful for

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:36.209
primary cells so they're useful for
 

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:39.620
primary cells so they're useful for
vaccine production so here we have an

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:39.630
vaccine production so here we have an
 

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.250
vaccine production so here we have an
illustration of how you can grow some of

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260
illustration of how you can grow some of
 

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.190
illustration of how you can grow some of
these cell cultures these are cell lines

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.200
these cell cultures these are cell lines
 

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.199
these cell cultures these are cell lines
grown in an incubator in the laboratory

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:48.209
grown in an incubator in the laboratory
 

00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:49.760
grown in an incubator in the laboratory
they're grown typically in plastic

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:49.770
they're grown typically in plastic
 

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.860
they're grown typically in plastic
dishes and flasks and they're covered

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:51.870
dishes and flasks and they're covered
 

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.769
dishes and flasks and they're covered
with medium the the cells adhere to the

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779
with medium the the cells adhere to the
 

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:57.500
with medium the the cells adhere to the
plastic and propagating and you can use

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:57.510
plastic and propagating and you can use
 

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.720
plastic and propagating and you can use
these to grow your and study or viruses

00:12:59.720 --> 00:12:59.730
these to grow your and study or viruses
 

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.120
these to grow your and study or viruses
and now some cells can be grown in what

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.130
and now some cells can be grown in what
 

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.480
and now some cells can be grown in what
we call suspension cultures so this is a

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:05.490
we call suspension cultures so this is a
 

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.990
we call suspension cultures so this is a
flask sitting on a spin on a magnetic

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000
flask sitting on a spin on a magnetic
 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.560
flask sitting on a spin on a magnetic
plate and it has cells in it and there's

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:12.570
plate and it has cells in it and there's
 

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.780
plate and it has cells in it and there's
a spin bar here suspended on a glass rod

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:14.790
a spin bar here suspended on a glass rod
 

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.170
a spin bar here suspended on a glass rod
and this turns around by virtue of the

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180
and this turns around by virtue of the
 

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.120
and this turns around by virtue of the
magnet in the plate below it and so

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.130
magnet in the plate below it and so
 

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.980
magnet in the plate below it and so
these cells are growing in suspension as

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:21.990
these cells are growing in suspension as
 

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.340
these cells are growing in suspension as
a po

to being adhered to the plastic the

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:24.690
to being adhered to the plastic the
 

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.060
to being adhered to the plastic the
advantage of this is that you can grow a

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.070
advantage of this is that you can grow a
 

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.430
advantage of this is that you can grow a
lot of cells the volumes and numbers you

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440
lot of cells the volumes and numbers you
 

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.950
lot of cells the volumes and numbers you
can grow are much greater than in those

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:30.960
can grow are much greater than in those
 

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.110
can grow are much greater than in those

it's very interesting story now how do

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:20.670
it's very interesting story now how do
 

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.720
it's very interesting story now how do
we detect the the fact that viruses are

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:23.730
we detect the the fact that viruses are
 

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.050
we detect the the fact that viruses are
growing in cells one of the ways we can

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060
growing in cells one of the ways we can
 

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.180
growing in cells one of the ways we can
do it is by what's called cytopathic

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:29.190
do it is by what's called cytopathic
 

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.250
do it is by what's called cytopathic
effects and John Enders when he first

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.260
effects and John Enders when he first
 

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.230
effects and John Enders when he first
took cell cultures and infected them

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240
took cell cultures and infected them
 

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.960
took cell cultures and infected them
with polio that's how he detected that

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:35.970
with polio that's how he detected that
 

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.490
with polio that's how he detected that
there was virus growing because the

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500
there was virus growing because the
 

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.030
there was virus growing because the
cells died so cytopathic effect or CPE

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040
cells died so cytopathic effect or CPE
 

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:46.030
cells died so cytopathic effect or CPE
it's alteration in the behavior and the

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040
it's alteration in the behavior and the
 

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.470
it's alteration in the behavior and the
appearance of cells caused by virus

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480
appearance of cells caused by virus
 

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.570
appearance of cells caused by virus
infection we'll talk about this a lot in

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:50.580
infection we'll talk about this a lot in
 

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.090
infection we'll talk about this a lot in
this course so here's an example of HeLa

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.100
this course so here's an example of HeLa
 

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.730
this course so here's an example of HeLa
cells on the upper left these are

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740
cells on the upper left these are
 

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.560
cells on the upper left these are
uninfected HeLa cells they make a very

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:57.570
uninfected HeLa cells they make a very
 

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.020
uninfected HeLa cells they make a very
nice mono layer on the plastic dish you

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.030
nice mono layer on the plastic dish you
 

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.210
nice mono layer on the plastic dish you
infect them with polio and then four

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220
infect them with polio and then four
 

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.250
infect them with polio and then four
hours later you can see the cells are

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260
hours later you can see the cells are
 

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.440
hours later you can see the cells are
beginning to round up by eight hours

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:06.450
beginning to round up by eight hours
 

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.930
beginning to round up by eight hours
they've all detached and by 16 hours

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940
they've all detached and by 16 hours
 

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.820
they've all detached and by 16 hours
they're all dead so this is what we call

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:10.830
they're all dead so this is what we call
 

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.920
they're all dead so this is what we call
cytopathic effect there are many

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:12.930
cytopathic effect there are many
 

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.230
cytopathic effect there are many
different kinds of cytopathic effects

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240
different kinds of cytopathic effects
 

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.350
different kinds of cytopathic effects
not just this sort of rounding up here's

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360
not just this sort of rounding up here's
 

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.860
not just this sort of rounding up here's
another kind of cytopathic effect this

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:21.870
another kind of cytopathic effect this
 

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.410
another kind of cytopathic effect this
one is called the formation of since

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420
one is called the formation of since
 

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.860
one is called the formation of since
Isha in some cases some viruses when

Isha in some cases some viruses when
 

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.950
Isha in some cases some viruses when
they infect cells lead the cells to fuse

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:30.960
they infect cells lead the cells to fuse
 

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.900
they infect cells lead the cells to fuse
so adjacent cells fuse to one another

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:33.910
so adjacent cells fuse to one another
 

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.910
so adjacent cells fuse to one another
so two and four and eight cells will

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920
so two and four and eight cells will
 

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.310
so two and four and eight cells will
fuse giving you a very big cell with

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320
fuse giving you a very big cell with
 

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.130
fuse giving you a very big cell with
many nuclei this is called a syncytium

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.140
many nuclei this is called a syncytium
 

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.470
many nuclei this is called a syncytium
we'll get at the basis for this later

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480
we'll get at the basis for this later
 

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.480
we'll get at the basis for this later
but it's another form of cytopathic

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.490
but it's another form of cytopathic
 

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.600
but it's another form of cytopathic
effect you can see it here in this cell

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:48.610
effect you can see it here in this cell
 

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.870
effect you can see it here in this cell
culture this is a cell culture infected

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880
culture this is a cell culture infected
 

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.240
culture this is a cell culture infected
with a virus that causes fusion these

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.250
with a virus that causes fusion these
 

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.070
with a virus that causes fusion these
are the individual cells here and you

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:56.080
are the individual cells here and you
 

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.500
are the individual cells here and you
can see a syncytium a big cell with a

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:58.510
can see a syncytium a big cell with a
 

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.620
can see a syncytium a big cell with a
lot of nuclei okay another form of

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:01.630
lot of nuclei okay another form of
 

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.870
lot of nuclei okay another form of
cytopathic effect so here are examples

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880
cytopathic effect so here are examples
 

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.970
cytopathic effect so here are examples
of different sorts of cytopathic effects

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:05.980
of different sorts of cytopathic effects
 

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.920

showing these to you just to show you

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:09.700
showing these to you just to show you
 

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.410
showing these to you just to show you
that viruses do things in very different

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:13.420
that viruses do things in very different
 

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.900
that viruses do things in very different
ways to cells so for example there are

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:15.910
ways to cells so for example there are
 

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.750
ways to cells so for example there are
morphological alterations I just showed

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:18.760
morphological alterations I just showed
 

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.730

cell that are sometimes very specific
 

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.680
cell that are sometimes very specific
for the virus so for example

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:42.690
for the virus so for example
 

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.300

talk about two general ways that we can

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:20.500
talk about two general ways that we can
 

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.689
talk about two general ways that we can
assay the infectivity of viruses besides

00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:24.699
assay the infectivity of viruses besides
 

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:26.370
assay the infectivity of viruses besides
looking at the what they do to cells how

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:26.380
looking at the what they do to cells how
 

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.860
looking at the what they do to cells how
can we quantify the amount of virus that

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:28.870
can we quantify the amount of virus that
 

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.100
can we quantify the amount of virus that
is present and a first way will be the

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:32.110
is present and a first way will be the
 

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.680
is present and a first way will be the
measurement of infectious units so

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:34.690
measurement of infectious units so
 

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.990
measurement of infectious units so
viruses can be infectious we can measure

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000
viruses can be infectious we can measure
 

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.990
viruses can be infectious we can measure
it and we also measure virus particles

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000
it and we also measure virus particles
 

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.190
it and we also measure virus particles

so I want to talk about these now for

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:49.450
so I want to talk about these now for
 

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.070
so I want to talk about these now for
most of the time the first infectivity

essay is the plaque assay and this was

00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159
essay is the plaque assay and this was
 

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:59.789
essay is the plaque assay and this was
developed in the 1930s again by the

00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799
developed in the 1930s again by the
 

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:03.270
developed in the 1930s again by the
virologist who studied bacterial viruses

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280
virologist who studied bacterial viruses
 

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.149
virologist who studied bacterial viruses
and what they found was if they took

00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159
and what they found was if they took
 

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:08.070
and what they found was if they took
their virus and mixed it with a

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080
their virus and mixed it with a
 

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.310
their virus and mixed it with a
bacterial culture and then spread the

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320
bacterial culture and then spread the
 

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.370
bacterial culture and then spread the
culture on an agar plate when they

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.380
culture on an agar plate when they
 

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.149
culture on an agar plate when they
incubated this plate

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159
incubated this plate
 

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:20.789
incubated this plate
wherever the virus was multiplying there

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799
wherever the virus was multiplying there
 

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.860
wherever the virus was multiplying there
was a hole in the bacterial mono layer

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:22.870
was a hole in the bacterial mono layer
 

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.700
was a hole in the bacterial mono layer
so this cloudy background if you will is

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:26.710
so this cloudy background if you will is
 

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.039
so this cloudy background if you will is
a layer of bacteria and then the virus

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:29.049
a layer of bacteria and then the virus
 

00:18:29.049 --> 00:18:31.649
a layer of bacteria and then the virus
clears the layer for a little iris

00:18:31.649 --> 00:18:31.659
clears the layer for a little iris
 

00:18:31.659 --> 00:18:33.750
clears the layer for a little iris
anyway wherever there's been an

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760
anyway wherever there's been an
 

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.640
anyway wherever there's been an
infection so you can count each of these

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:35.650
infection so you can count each of these
 

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.470
infection so you can count each of these
plaques and you assume that each one

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480
plaques and you assume that each one
 

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.919
plaques and you assume that each one
arises from one virus and calculate the

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:40.929
arises from one virus and calculate the
 

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:42.570
arises from one virus and calculate the
titer of the virus as we'll see in a

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:42.580
titer of the virus as we'll see in a
 

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.580
titer of the virus as we'll see in a
moment so this was first done with

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:44.590
moment so this was first done with
 

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.799
moment so this was first done with
bacteria phages again because we didn't

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:46.809
bacteria phages again because we didn't
 

00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:48.360
bacteria phages again because we didn't
have cell cultures for animal viruses

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:48.370
have cell cultures for animal viruses
 

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.930
have cell cultures for animal viruses

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:32.590
used in the related field of
 

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.580
used in the related field of
bacteriophage studies he's basically

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:35.590
bacteriophage studies he's basically
 

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.740
bacteriophage studies he's basically
saying we need quantitative techniques

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:37.750
saying we need quantitative techniques
 

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.600
saying we need quantitative techniques
to study animal viruses and we have to

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:39.610
to study animal viruses and we have to
 

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.850
to study animal viruses and we have to
do what the bacteriophage people have

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:41.860
do what the bacteriophage people have
 

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.789
do what the bacteriophage people have
done as well so he did that so what is a

00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799
done as well so he did that so what is a
 

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:48.630
done as well so he did that so what is a
plaque assay to do a plaque a say you

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640
plaque assay to do a plaque a say you
 

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.120
plaque assay to do a plaque a say you
take a stock of virus and you make

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.130
take a stock of virus and you make
 

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.730
take a stock of virus and you make
serial dilutions typically you make ten

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:53.740
serial dilutions typically you make ten
 

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.159
serial dilutions typically you make ten
fold serial dilutions which means in

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:56.169
fold serial dilutions which means in
 

00:19:56.169 --> 00:19:58.740
fold serial dilutions which means in
this case you can take 0.1 ml of your

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:58.750
this case you can take 0.1 ml of your
 

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.230
this case you can take 0.1 ml of your
virus and mix it with 0.9 ml of a

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240
virus and mix it with 0.9 ml of a
 

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.120
virus and mix it with 0.9 ml of a
buffer that's a tenfold dilution and

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.130
buffer that's a tenfold dilution and
 

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.510
buffer that's a tenfold dilution and
then you do that down the line and then

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520
then you do that down the line and then
 

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.550
then you do that down the line and then
you take a little bit of each dilution

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:08.560
you take a little bit of each dilution
 

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.030
you take a little bit of each dilution
and you infect separate plates of cells

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.040
and you infect separate plates of cells
 

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.550
and you infect separate plates of cells
so you have some kind of animal cell

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:14.560
so you have some kind of animal cell
 

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.520
so you have some kind of animal cell
growing on a monolayer you infect with

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:17.530
growing on a monolayer you infect with
 

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.150
growing on a monolayer you infect with
that allow the virus to adsorb and then

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.160
that allow the virus to adsorb and then
 

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.280
that allow the virus to adsorb and then
you cover the cells with a semi-solid

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:23.290
you cover the cells with a semi-solid
 

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.980
you cover the cells with a semi-solid
overlay all right

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:25.990
overlay all right
 

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.440
overlay all right
the semi-solid overlay restricts the

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:28.450
the semi-solid overlay restricts the
 

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.820
the semi-solid overlay restricts the
diffusion of the virus if you put a

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:29.830
diffusion of the virus if you put a
 

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.250
diffusion of the virus if you put a
liquid overlay on top what would happen

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:32.260
liquid overlay on top what would happen
 

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.570
liquid overlay on top what would happen
the virus would come out of the first

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:33.580
the virus would come out of the first
 

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.980
the virus would come out of the first
infected cells and would infect

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:34.990
infected cells and would infect
 

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.990
infected cells and would infect
everything and wipe all the cells out

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000
everything and wipe all the cells out
 

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.330
everything and wipe all the cells out
you wouldn't be able to count anything

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340
you wouldn't be able to count anything
 

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.650
you wouldn't be able to count anything
so you put a semi-solid overlay

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:40.660
so you put a semi-solid overlay
 

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.440
so you put a semi-solid overlay
typically auger or agarose carboxymethyl

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.450
typically auger or agarose carboxymethyl
 

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.420
typically auger or agarose carboxymethyl
cellulose some kind of medium to

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:45.430
cellulose some kind of medium to
 

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.190
cellulose some kind of medium to
restrict the diffusion of the virus

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200
restrict the diffusion of the virus
 

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.890
restrict the diffusion of the virus
particles that produces localized

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:49.900
particles that produces localized
 

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.140
particles that produces localized
destruction visible as a plaque and then

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.150
destruction visible as a plaque and then
 

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.420
destruction visible as a plaque and then
you can count the plaques so here we

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:54.430
you can count the plaques so here we
 

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.230
you can count the plaques so here we
have 17 plaques on this plate the

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240
have 17 plaques on this plate the
 

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.230
have 17 plaques on this plate the
dilution can be back calculated so that

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240
dilution can be back calculated so that
 

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.530
dilution can be back calculated so that
we now know that we have one point seven

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:04.540
we now know that we have one point seven
 

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.590
we now know that we have one point seven
times ten to the eighth pfu per mil so

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600
times ten to the eighth pfu per mil so
 

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.810
times ten to the eighth pfu per mil so
the original dilution was minus six plus

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:09.820
the original dilution was minus six plus
 

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.140
the original dilution was minus six plus
another tenfold dilution because we put

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:13.150
another tenfold dilution because we put
 

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.680
another tenfold dilution because we put
only 0.1 ml on and then that would be 17

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:16.690
only 0.1 ml on and then that would be 17
 

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.890
only 0.1 ml on and then that would be 17
times 10 to the seventh if you move the

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:19.900
times 10 to the seventh if you move the
 

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.960
times 10 to the seventh if you move the
decimal place over one one point seven

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.970
decimal place over one one point seven
 

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.640
decimal place over one one point seven
times ten to the eighth plaque forming

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:23.650
times ten to the eighth plaque forming
 

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.290
times ten to the eighth plaque forming
units per mil so that's how that's

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:25.300
units per mil so that's how that's
 

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.920
units per mil so that's how that's
calculated so let's look at a little bit

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:28.930
calculated so let's look at a little bit
 

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.920
calculated so let's look at a little bit
about how a plaque develops just to make

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:31.930
about how a plaque develops just to make
 

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.360
about how a plaque develops just to make
sure you understand this so when you

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:33.370
sure you understand this so when you
 

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.790
sure you understand this so when you
infect a plate of cells you don't put a

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:35.800
infect a plate of cells you don't put a
 

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.890
infect a plate of cells you don't put a
lot of viruses on that cell maybe a

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:37.900
lot of viruses on that cell maybe a
 

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.630
lot of viruses on that cell maybe a
hundred or so so that you can count the

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640
hundred or so so that you can count the
 

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.060
hundred or so so that you can count the
plaques and each virus starts out by

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.070
plaques and each virus starts out by
 

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.370
plaques and each virus starts out by
infecting a single cell and because it's

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:44.380
infecting a single cell and because it's
 

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.830
infecting a single cell and because it's
under a semi-solid overlay when that

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840
under a semi-solid overlay when that
 

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.900
under a semi-solid overlay when that
cell releases its new virus particles

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:48.910
cell releases its new virus particles
 

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.490
cell releases its new virus particles
they spread only to neighboring cells

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:50.500
they spread only to neighboring cells
 

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.070
they spread only to neighboring cells
and those in turn spread viruses to

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080
and those in turn spread viruses to
 

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.870
and those in turn spread viruses to
neighboring cells so that the zone of

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880
neighboring cells so that the zone of
 

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.820
neighboring cells so that the zone of
cell killing gets bigger and bigger and

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:56.830
cell killing gets bigger and bigger and
 

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.330
cell killing gets bigger and bigger and
then after a certain incubation period

00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340
then after a certain incubation period
 

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.160
then after a certain incubation period
you take off the overlay and stain the

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.170
you take off the overlay and stain the
 

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.840
you take off the overlay and stain the
cells and you can see holes in the mono

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:03.850
cells and you can see holes in the mono
 

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.300
cells and you can see holes in the mono
layer all right now here's another view

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:06.310

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:09.390
layer all right now here's another view
of plaques on the left is a photograph

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400
of plaques on the left is a photograph
 

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.970
of plaques on the left is a photograph
high magnification of a viral plaque you

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:11.980
high magnification of a viral plaque you
 

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.120
high magnification of a viral plaque you
can see the intact cells on the outside

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.130
can see the intact cells on the outside
 

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.430
can see the intact cells on the outside
inside the cells have been killed so if

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440
inside the cells have been killed so if
 

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.110
inside the cells have been killed so if
you take the overlay off these dead

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120
you take the overlay off these dead
 

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.590
you take the overlay off these dead
cells wash off and you can stain them on

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600
cells wash off and you can stain them on
 

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.330
cells wash off and you can stain them on
the right is a different view this is a

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.340
the right is a different view this is a
 

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.270
the right is a different view this is a
virus that has an enzyme a gene encoding

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280
virus that has an enzyme a gene encoding
 

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.779
virus that has an enzyme a gene encoding
an enzyme inserted into its genome so

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:30.789
an enzyme inserted into its genome so
 

00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:33.080
an enzyme inserted into its genome so
that you can stain the plaque with a

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.090
that you can stain the plaque with a
 

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.490
that you can stain the plaque with a
substrate that gives rise to blue color

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:35.500
substrate that gives rise to blue color
 

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.520
substrate that gives rise to blue color
and so you can see now on this mono

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:38.530
and so you can see now on this mono
 

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.000
and so you can see now on this mono
layer instead of staining with a dye

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.010
layer instead of staining with a dye
 

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.440
layer instead of staining with a dye
that would stain the cells you are now

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:43.450
that would stain the cells you are now
 

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.909
that would stain the cells you are now
staining the cells within the plaque

00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919
staining the cells within the plaque
 

00:22:44.919 --> 00:22:48.270
staining the cells within the plaque
because that's where the virus is okay

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:48.280
because that's where the virus is okay
 

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.820
because that's where the virus is okay
now I have I have two movies of plaque

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:50.830
now I have I have two movies of plaque
 

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.980
now I have I have two movies of plaque
formation which just came out last year

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:52.990
formation which just came out last year
 

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.430
formation which just came out last year
these are formation of a plaque in pox

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440
these are formation of a plaque in pox
 

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.370
these are formation of a plaque in pox
virus infected cells so what these

00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380
virus infected cells so what these
 

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.930
virus infected cells so what these
individuals did was they infected a

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:00.940
individuals did was they infected a
 

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.230
individuals did was they infected a
monolayer with virus and then after

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240
monolayer with virus and then after
 

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.360
monolayer with virus and then after
about eight hours they put the plate on

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:06.370
about eight hours they put the plate on
 

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.000
about eight hours they put the plate on
a microscope stage the stage was

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.010
a microscope stage the stage was
 

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.399
a microscope stage the stage was
surrounded by an incubator and then they

00:23:11.399 --> 00:23:11.409
surrounded by an incubator and then they
 

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:14.520
surrounded by an incubator and then they
found an infected cell and then they put

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:14.530
found an infected cell and then they put
 

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.620
found an infected cell and then they put
a movie camera on top and took a frame

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:16.630
a movie camera on top and took a frame
 

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.649
a movie camera on top and took a frame
every X number of minutes so what we're

00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:19.659
every X number of minutes so what we're
 

00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:22.049
every X number of minutes so what we're
going to see here is the development of

00:23:22.049 --> 00:23:22.059
going to see here is the development of
 

00:23:22.059 --> 00:23:24.120
going to see here is the development of
a plaque in real time starting from the

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.130
a plaque in real time starting from the
 

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.680
a plaque in real time starting from the
middle you can see the cell death is

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:25.690
middle you can see the cell death is
 

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.510
middle you can see the cell death is
spreading outwards so this is going to

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520
spreading outwards so this is going to
 

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.760
spreading outwards so this is going to
repeat over and over again the initial

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:29.770
repeat over and over again the initial
 

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.250
repeat over and over again the initial
infected cell and then eventually all

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:32.260
infected cell and then eventually all
 

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.279
infected cell and then eventually all
the surrounding cells become infected as

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:35.289
the surrounding cells become infected as
 

00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:39.570
the surrounding cells become infected as
well I think this is an hours up here so

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:39.580
well I think this is an hours up here so
 

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.060
well I think this is an hours up here so
it's 15 hours by the end of the

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.070
it's 15 hours by the end of the
 

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.330
it's 15 hours by the end of the
experiment so this is the first time I

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:45.340
experiment so this is the first time I
 

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.799
experiment so this is the first time I
could show this last year this

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:46.809
could show this last year this
 

00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:49.830
could show this last year this
development of a plaque in real time and

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840
development of a plaque in real time and
 

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.510
development of a plaque in real time and
this is basically what is happening to

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520
this is basically what is happening to
 

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.610
this is basically what is happening to
give you that zone of of clearance now

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:53.620
give you that zone of of clearance now
 

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.310
give you that zone of of clearance now
in the next movie what we've done is

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320
in the next movie what we've done is
 

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.200
in the next movie what we've done is
we've taken the same virus and we've

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:58.210
we've taken the same virus and we've
 

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.810
we've taken the same virus and we've
inserted a gene for green fluorescent

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:00.820
inserted a gene for green fluorescent
 

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.000
inserted a gene for green fluorescent
protein into the virus so now we can

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.010
protein into the virus so now we can
 

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.149
protein into the virus so now we can
visualize the viruses in the cells as a

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159
visualize the viruses in the cells as a
 

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:10.169
visualize the viruses in the cells as a
green color so this is now the edge of

00:24:10.169 --> 00:24:10.179
green color so this is now the edge of
 

00:24:10.179 --> 00:24:11.850
green color so this is now the edge of
the plaque you can see it's moving out

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:11.860
the plaque you can see it's moving out
 

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.430
the plaque you can see it's moving out
as the cells are dying they're changing

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440
as the cells are dying they're changing
 

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.649
as the cells are dying they're changing
and refraction so the plaque and then

00:24:16.649 --> 00:24:16.659
and refraction so the plaque and then
 

00:24:16.659 --> 00:24:19.049
and refraction so the plaque and then
the cells are making green fluorescent

00:24:19.049 --> 00:24:19.059
the cells are making green fluorescent
 

00:24:19.059 --> 00:24:21.149
the cells are making green fluorescent
protein so you notice actually that the

00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159
protein so you notice actually that the
 

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:23.700
protein so you notice actually that the
killing is proceeding the green it's

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:23.710
killing is proceeding the green it's
 

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.580
killing is proceeding the green it's
because the green is expressed late in

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:26.590
because the green is expressed late in
 

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.780
because the green is expressed late in
the viral replication cycle

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:28.790
the viral replication cycle
 

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.880
the viral replication cycle
all right so the cells are dying because

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:30.890
all right so the cells are dying because
 

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.640
all right so the cells are dying because
virus is in them and then later on the

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:33.650
virus is in them and then later on the
 

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.320
virus is in them and then later on the
cells make green protein because it's

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:35.330
cells make green protein because it's
 

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.060
cells make green protein because it's
the late proteins okay so that's how a

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.070
the late proteins okay so that's how a
 

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.180
the late proteins okay so that's how a
plaque develops and to show you the

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:40.190
plaque develops and to show you the
 

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.400
plaque develops and to show you the
staining procedure these are cells that

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:42.410
staining procedure these are cells that
 

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.680
staining procedure these are cells that
were infected with influenza virus in

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:44.690
were infected with influenza virus in
 

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.380
were infected with influenza virus in
the terms of a plaque assay and these

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:47.390
the terms of a plaque assay and these
 

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.960
the terms of a plaque assay and these
are three different dilutions and they

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:49.970
are three different dilutions and they
 

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.400
are three different dilutions and they
were stained after a couple of days and

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:51.410
were stained after a couple of days and
 

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.690
were stained after a couple of days and
you can see the clearing of the mono

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:52.700
you can see the clearing of the mono
 

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.910
you can see the clearing of the mono
layer where the virus has killed the

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:54.920
layer where the virus has killed the
 

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.320
layer where the virus has killed the
cells so it's very easy to count these

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:56.330
cells so it's very easy to count these
 

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.420
cells so it's very easy to count these
plaques and calculate the plaque titer

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:58.430
plaques and calculate the plaque titer
 

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.710
plaques and calculate the plaque titer
okay so now we ask the question how many

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720
okay so now we ask the question how many
 

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.140
okay so now we ask the question how many
viruses do you need to form a plaque

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:05.150
viruses do you need to form a plaque
 

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.240
viruses do you need to form a plaque
just remember that when I when we

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:07.250
just remember that when I when we
 

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.030
just remember that when I when we
calculate the titer by this method we're

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:10.040
calculate the titer by this method we're
 

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.940
calculate the titer by this method we're
using platforming units per milliliter I

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:12.950
using platforming units per milliliter I
 

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.130
using platforming units per milliliter I
don't say infectious viruses per

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:15.140
don't say infectious viruses per
 

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.110
don't say infectious viruses per
milliliter because we're not not sure if

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120
milliliter because we're not not sure if
 

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.260
milliliter because we're not not sure if
it's just one so that's an interesting

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:20.270
it's just one so that's an interesting
 

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.770
it's just one so that's an interesting
question

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:20.780
question
 

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.900
question
do you need one or do you need more well

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:22.910
do you need one or do you need more well
 

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.220
do you need one or do you need more well
how do you figure that out well you do

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:24.230
how do you figure that out well you do
 

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.680
how do you figure that out well you do
an experiment fold a dose-response curve

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:28.690
an experiment fold a dose-response curve
 

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.120
an experiment fold a dose-response curve
when you do a dose-response experiment

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.130
when you do a dose-response experiment
 

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.650
when you do a dose-response experiment
and you plot the data as a dose-response

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:32.660
and you plot the data as a dose-response
 

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.930
and you plot the data as a dose-response
curve and what you do is you'd make

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:34.940
curve and what you do is you'd make
 

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.510
curve and what you do is you'd make
dilutions of virus here we're putting

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520
dilutions of virus here we're putting
 

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.090
dilutions of virus here we're putting
increasing amounts of virus and then you

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:40.100
increasing amounts of virus and then you
 

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.830
increasing amounts of virus and then you
do a plaque assay and count the number

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840
do a plaque assay and count the number
 

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.330
do a plaque assay and count the number
of plaques so if one virus is enough to

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:46.340
of plaques so if one virus is enough to
 

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.760
of plaques so if one virus is enough to
make a plaque the dose-response curve

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:48.770
make a plaque the dose-response curve
 

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.550
make a plaque the dose-response curve
will be linear that is it follows one

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:51.560
will be linear that is it follows one
 

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.890
will be linear that is it follows one

purification we do a plaque assay

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:56.510
purification we do a plaque assay
 

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.810
purification we do a plaque assay
instead of taking the mana layer off and

00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:58.820
instead of taking the mana layer off and
 

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.240
instead of taking the mana layer off and
staining the mana layer which would kill

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:01.250
staining the mana layer which would kill
 

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.370
staining the mana layer which would kill
the cells and the virus we leave the

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:03.380
the cells and the virus we leave the
 

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.320
the cells and the virus we leave the
mana layer on and most times you can

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:05.330
mana layer on and most times you can
 

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.210
mana layer on and most times you can
actually see the plaques if you hold the

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:07.220
actually see the plaques if you hold the
 

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.340
actually see the plaques if you hold the
dish to the light and you can take a

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:09.350
dish to the light and you can take a
 

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.500
dish to the light and you can take a
pipette and plunge it into one of those

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:11.510
pipette and plunge it into one of those
 

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.510
pipette and plunge it into one of those
plaques and then you get the virus

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520
plaques and then you get the virus
 

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.640
plaques and then you get the virus
that's within that piece of augur so you

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:15.650
that's within that piece of augur so you
 

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.650
that's within that piece of augur so you
take a little plug of agar you put it in

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:17.660
take a little plug of agar you put it in
 

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.540
take a little plug of agar you put it in
buffer and the virus comes into the

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:19.550
buffer and the virus comes into the
 

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.270
buffer and the virus comes into the
buffer and you can repeat this a few

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:22.280
buffer and you can repeat this a few
 

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.940
buffer and you can repeat this a few
times and then eventually we get what we

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:24.950
times and then eventually we get what we
 

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.370
times and then eventually we get what we
called clonal virus stocks now why do

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:27.380
called clonal virus stocks now why do
 

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.720
called clonal virus stocks now why do
you think we would have to do this

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:28.730
you think we would have to do this
 

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:36.460
you think we would have to do this
multiple times any idea I mean it looks

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:36.470
multiple times any idea I mean it looks
 

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.280
multiple times any idea I mean it looks
like there's one plaque here why would I

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:38.290
like there's one plaque here why would I
 

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.690
like there's one plaque here why would I
need to do it three times just to make

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:40.700
need to do it three times just to make
 

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:46.950
need to do it three times just to make
more work for the graduate students no

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960
more work for the graduate students no
 

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.300
more work for the graduate students no
okay you have to do it because you don't

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:49.310
okay you have to do it because you don't
 

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.310
okay you have to do it because you don't
know if two viruses fell in the same

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320
know if two viruses fell in the same
 

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.800
know if two viruses fell in the same
place it could happen and made one

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:53.810
place it could happen and made one
 

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.930
place it could happen and made one
plaque so that wouldn't be a clonal

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:55.940
plaque so that wouldn't be a clonal
 

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.760
plaque so that wouldn't be a clonal
virus stock because it would be arising

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:57.770
virus stock because it would be arising
 

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.070
virus stock because it would be arising
from do different viruses so we do

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080
from do different viruses so we do
 

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.020
from do different viruses so we do
multiple plaque purifications just to

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:02.030
multiple plaque purifications just to
 

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.800
multiple plaque purifications just to
get around that likelihood now another

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:05.810
get around that likelihood now another
 

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.410
get around that likelihood now another
kind of assay for infectivity is the

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:08.420
kind of assay for infectivity is the
 

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.390
kind of assay for infectivity is the
endpoint dilution assay some viruses

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:10.400
endpoint dilution assay some viruses
 

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.030
endpoint dilution assay some viruses
just do not make plaques on any kind of

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:13.040
just do not make plaques on any kind of
 

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.150
just do not make plaques on any kind of
cell so you can't use the plaque acid to

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:16.160
cell so you can't use the plaque acid to
 

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.430
cell so you can't use the plaque acid to
titrate their infectivity so you use

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440
titrate their infectivity so you use
 

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.640
titrate their infectivity so you use
this assay endpoint dilution what we're

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:21.650
this assay endpoint dilution what we're
 

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.190
this assay endpoint dilution what we're
doing here is measuring cell killing by

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200
doing here is measuring cell killing by
 

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.680
doing here is measuring cell killing by
the virus and we're figuring out the

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:26.690
the virus and we're figuring out the
 

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.170
the virus and we're figuring out the
delusion that will give us half of the

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:29.180
delusion that will give us half of the
 

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.630
delusion that will give us half of the
cells infected or as measured by cell

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640
cells infected or as measured by cell
 

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.270
cells infected or as measured by cell
killing so what you do is you make a

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:34.280
killing so what you do is you make a
 

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.670
killing so what you do is you make a
series of delusions of virus minus 2

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:36.680
series of delusions of virus minus 2
 

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.250
series of delusions of virus minus 2
minus 3 minus 4 and then you infect

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:39.260
minus 3 minus 4 and then you infect
 

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.500
minus 3 minus 4 and then you infect
wells of cells so this is a 96-well

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:41.510
wells of cells so this is a 96-well
 

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.380
wells of cells so this is a 96-well
plate and you infect the whole row with

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:44.390
plate and you infect the whole row with
 

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.720
plate and you infect the whole row with
one dilution and X dilution and so forth

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:46.730
one dilution and X dilution and so forth
 

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.120
one dilution and X dilution and so forth
and you incubate the cells and then

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.130
and you incubate the cells and then
 

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.950
and you incubate the cells and then
after so many days you stain them and

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960
after so many days you stain them and
 

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.940
after so many days you stain them and
you you you record which monolayers are

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:54.950
you you you record which monolayers are
 

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.650
you you you record which monolayers are
in which or not you can easily tell that

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:56.660
in which or not you can easily tell that
 

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.200
in which or not you can easily tell that
when you stain them so here we've quant

00:28:59.200 --> 00:28:59.210
when you stain them so here we've quant
 

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.299
when you stain them so here we've quant
we've put those data for one experiment

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:01.309
we've put those data for one experiment
 

00:29:01.309 --> 00:29:03.730
we've put those data for one experiment
so at a minus two dilution all the cells

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:03.740
so at a minus two dilution all the cells
 

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.510
so at a minus two dilution all the cells
are killed

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:04.520
are killed
 

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.240
are killed
same thing with minus three now minus

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:07.250
same thing with minus three now minus
 

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.549
same thing with minus three now minus
four we see one well is not dead

00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559
four we see one well is not dead
 

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:11.799
four we see one well is not dead
so we've diluted out the virus such that

00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:11.809
so we've diluted out the virus such that
 

00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:16.150
so we've diluted out the virus such that
one well is protected and here at minus

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:16.160
one well is protected and here at minus
 

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.440
one well is protected and here at minus
five let's say we have one two three

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:17.450
five let's say we have one two three
 

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.650
five let's say we have one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten one

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:20.660
four five six seven eight nine ten one
 

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.070
four five six seven eight nine ten one
two three four five are killed and five

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080
two three four five are killed and five
 

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.250
two three four five are killed and five
are not killed so we say the 50%

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:29.260
 
 

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.280
 
infectivity dose for this virus is ten

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:33.290
infectivity dose for this virus is ten
 

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.409
infectivity dose for this virus is ten
to the five so we say there are 10 to

00:29:35.409 --> 00:29:35.419
to the five so we say there are 10 to
 

00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:38.110
to the five so we say there are 10 to
the five 50% infectivity doses so that's

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120
the five 50% infectivity doses so that's
 

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.030
the five 50% infectivity doses so that's
method of quantifying the virus that you

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:40.040
method of quantifying the virus that you
 

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.710
method of quantifying the virus that you
can use to standardize experiments so we

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720
can use to standardize experiments so we
 

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.659
can use to standardize experiments so we
call it tissue culture infectious dose

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:46.669
call it tissue culture infectious dose
 

00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:51.370
call it tissue culture infectious dose
is 50 percent now there is another very

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:51.380
is 50 percent now there is another very
 

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.539
is 50 percent now there is another very
interesting phenomenon in virology and

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:55.549
interesting phenomenon in virology and
 

00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:58.659
interesting phenomenon in virology and
that is that if you do a plaque assay

00:29:58.659 --> 00:29:58.669
that is that if you do a plaque assay
 

00:29:58.669 --> 00:30:01.419
that is that if you do a plaque assay
and you calculate the pfu per mil of a

00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:01.429
and you calculate the pfu per mil of a
 

00:30:01.429 --> 00:30:02.950
and you calculate the pfu per mil of a
virus stock and then if you could

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960
virus stock and then if you could
 

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.750
virus stock and then if you could
somehow count the number of particles

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760
somehow count the number of particles
 

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.820
somehow count the number of particles
you could use an electron microscope or

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:06.830
you could use an electron microscope or
 

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.990
you could use an electron microscope or
some other ways turns out that not every

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000
some other ways turns out that not every
 

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.240
some other ways turns out that not every
particle seems to be infectious in a

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:13.250
particle seems to be infectious in a
 

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.270
particle seems to be infectious in a
plaque assay so this is the number of

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:16.280
plaque assay so this is the number of
 

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.190
plaque assay so this is the number of
virus particles at a sample divided by

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200
virus particles at a sample divided by
 

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.510
virus particles at a sample divided by
the number of infectious particles

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520
the number of infectious particles
 

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.000
the number of infectious particles
measured say by a plaque asset so you

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.010
measured say by a plaque asset so you
 

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:24.100
measured say by a plaque asset so you
get it's called the particle to pfu

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.110
get it's called the particle to pfu
 

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.380
get it's called the particle to pfu
ratio this we don't do very often

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:26.390
ratio this we don't do very often
 

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:28.690
ratio this we don't do very often
because you we don't routinely look at

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:28.700
because you we don't routinely look at
 

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.909
because you we don't routinely look at
virus preparations in the microscope and

00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919
virus preparations in the microscope and
 

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:33.220
virus preparations in the microscope and
count them but this was done many years

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.230
count them but this was done many years
 

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.419
count them but this was done many years
ago and that's where this information

00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:34.429
ago and that's where this information
 

00:30:34.429 --> 00:30:37.090
ago and that's where this information
comes from for many bacteria phages this

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.100
comes from for many bacteria phages this
 

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.490
comes from for many bacteria phages this
number is 1 that means every phage

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:39.500
number is 1 that means every phage
 

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.860
number is 1 that means every phage
particle that you see in an electron

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:41.870
particle that you see in an electron
 

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.659
particle that you see in an electron
microscope is infectious it can give

microscope is infectious it can give
 

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:45.840
microscope is infectious it can give
rise to a plaque on a lawn of bacteria

rise to a plaque on a lawn of bacteria
 

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.340
rise to a plaque on a lawn of bacteria
but it's higher typically for most

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:48.350
but it's higher typically for most
 

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:52.260
but it's higher typically for most
animal viruses it's it can go from 1 to

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.080
animal viruses it's it can go from 1 to
10,000 and this makes life hard for

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.090
10,000 and this makes life hard for
 

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.919
10,000 and this makes life hard for
biologists because when you do an

00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:56.929
biologists because when you do an
 

00:30:56.929 --> 00:31:00.220
biologists because when you do an
experiment if only 1 in 10,000 of your

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:00.230
experiment if only 1 in 10,000 of your
 

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.860
experiment if only 1 in 10,000 of your
particles is infectious you're not quite

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:02.870
particles is infectious you're not quite
 

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.499
particles is infectious you're not quite
sure what you're looking at in your

00:31:04.499 --> 00:31:04.509
sure what you're looking at in your
 

00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:08.699
sure what you're looking at in your
ferma so here's an example of the

00:31:08.699 --> 00:31:08.709
ferma so here's an example of the
 

00:31:08.709 --> 00:31:11.279
ferma so here's an example of the

poxviruses to some RNA viruses you can

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:21.009
poxviruses to some RNA viruses you can
 

00:31:21.009 --> 00:31:22.829
poxviruses to some RNA viruses you can
see some of them are one or two which is

00:31:22.829 --> 00:31:22.839
see some of them are one or two which is
 

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:26.189
see some of them are one or two which is
good but others are higher 20 100 200

00:31:26.189 --> 00:31:26.199
good but others are higher 20 100 200
 

00:31:26.199 --> 00:31:30.359
good but others are higher 20 100 200
and 10,000 so this is a complicating

00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:30.369
and 10,000 so this is a complicating
 

00:31:30.369 --> 00:31:32.159
and 10,000 so this is a complicating
factor for studying viruses but maybe

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:32.169
factor for studying viruses but maybe
 

00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:34.680
factor for studying viruses but maybe
the more interesting question is why why

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:34.690
the more interesting question is why why
 

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.709
the more interesting question is why why
is this the case why do we find that not

00:31:37.709 --> 00:31:37.719
is this the case why do we find that not
 

00:31:37.719 --> 00:31:40.589
is this the case why do we find that not
every physical particle is infectious

00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:40.599
every physical particle is infectious
 

00:31:40.599 --> 00:31:44.489
every physical particle is infectious
well there are a couple of reasons first

00:31:44.489 --> 00:31:44.499
well there are a couple of reasons first
 

00:31:44.499 --> 00:31:45.839
well there are a couple of reasons first
of all you remember the dose response

00:31:45.839 --> 00:31:45.849
of all you remember the dose response
 

00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:48.449
of all you remember the dose response
curve that we showed a few slides ago

00:31:48.449 --> 00:31:48.459
curve that we showed a few slides ago
 

00:31:48.459 --> 00:31:51.629
curve that we showed a few slides ago
that tells us that a single particle is

00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639
that tells us that a single particle is
 

00:31:51.639 --> 00:31:53.519
that tells us that a single particle is
enough to initiate infection one

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:53.529
enough to initiate infection one
 

00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:55.529
enough to initiate infection one
particle is enough to make a plaque but

00:31:55.529 --> 00:31:55.539
particle is enough to make a plaque but
 

00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:58.529
particle is enough to make a plaque but
it doesn't tell us that all viruses are

00:31:58.529 --> 00:31:58.539
it doesn't tell us that all viruses are
 

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:00.779
it doesn't tell us that all viruses are
successful at doing that all it tells us

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:00.789
successful at doing that all it tells us
 

00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:03.209
successful at doing that all it tells us
is that one is is able to do it so why

00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:03.219
is that one is is able to do it so why
 

00:32:03.219 --> 00:32:06.359
is that one is is able to do it so why
not well some particles may be damaged

00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:06.369
not well some particles may be damaged
 

00:32:06.369 --> 00:32:08.939
not well some particles may be damaged
so when viruses propagate they can make

00:32:08.939 --> 00:32:08.949
so when viruses propagate they can make
 

00:32:08.949 --> 00:32:11.039
so when viruses propagate they can make
damaged particles or when you make

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:11.049
damaged particles or when you make
 

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:12.809
damaged particles or when you make
stocks in the laboratory maybe you

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:12.819
stocks in the laboratory maybe you
 

00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:14.519
stocks in the laboratory maybe you
damaging the particles can have

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:14.529
damaging the particles can have
 

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:16.409
damaging the particles can have
mutations in the genome and we'll see

00:32:16.409 --> 00:32:16.419
mutations in the genome and we'll see
 

00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:19.319
mutations in the genome and we'll see
later that every virus stock has many

00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:19.329
later that every virus stock has many
 

00:32:19.329 --> 00:32:23.159
later that every virus stock has many
many mutations in it but I think

00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:23.169
many mutations in it but I think
 

00:32:23.169 --> 00:32:25.529
many mutations in it but I think
possibly the most important fact there

00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:25.539
possibly the most important fact there
 

00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:27.719
possibly the most important fact there
is that the infectious cycle is very

00:32:27.719 --> 00:32:27.729
is that the infectious cycle is very
 

00:32:27.729 --> 00:32:30.149
is that the infectious cycle is very
complicated there are multiple steps

00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159
complicated there are multiple steps
 

00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:32.789
complicated there are multiple steps
that have to occur in order if you're

00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799
that have to occur in order if you're
 

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:34.439
that have to occur in order if you're
proceeding along the infectious cycle

00:32:34.439 --> 00:32:34.449
proceeding along the infectious cycle
 

00:32:34.449 --> 00:32:35.969
proceeding along the infectious cycle
and we'll talk about the individual

00:32:35.969 --> 00:32:35.979
and we'll talk about the individual
 

00:32:35.979 --> 00:32:38.159
and we'll talk about the individual
steps of each and in a lecture here in

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:38.169
steps of each and in a lecture here in
 

00:32:38.169 --> 00:32:41.069
steps of each and in a lecture here in
this course if you fail at an early step

00:32:41.069 --> 00:32:41.079
this course if you fail at an early step
 

00:32:41.079 --> 00:32:42.599
this course if you fail at an early step
you never get to the end you can't

00:32:42.599 --> 00:32:42.609
you never get to the end you can't
 

00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:45.299
you never get to the end you can't
bypass the early step so if in just

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:45.309
bypass the early step so if in just
 

00:32:45.309 --> 00:32:48.029
bypass the early step so if in just
terms of randomness if the virus fails

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039
terms of randomness if the virus fails
 

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:49.919
terms of randomness if the virus fails
at an early step it never completes the

00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:49.929
at an early step it never completes the
 

00:32:49.929 --> 00:32:51.959
at an early step it never completes the
cycle so because they would say twelve

00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:51.969
cycle so because they would say twelve
 

00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:54.180
cycle so because they would say twelve
or fourteen steps in an infectious cycle

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:54.190
or fourteen steps in an infectious cycle
 

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.489
or fourteen steps in an infectious cycle
this may explain why not every particle

00:32:56.489 --> 00:32:56.499
this may explain why not every particle
 

00:32:56.499 --> 00:32:59.669
this may explain why not every particle
can complete it so that's the particle

00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679
can complete it so that's the particle
 

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:02.430
can complete it so that's the particle
to pee a few ratio now let's move into

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440
to pee a few ratio now let's move into
 

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.639
to pee a few ratio now let's move into
how we can use this virus and cell

00:33:05.639 --> 00:33:05.649
how we can use this virus and cell
 

00:33:05.649 --> 00:33:08.819
how we can use this virus and cell
culture system to study replication in a

00:33:08.819 --> 00:33:08.829
culture system to study replication in a
 

00:33:08.829 --> 00:33:11.219
culture system to study replication in a
very important experiment that's used

00:33:11.219 --> 00:33:11.229
very important experiment that's used
 

00:33:11.229 --> 00:33:12.659
very important experiment that's used
over and over in virology it's called

00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:12.669
over and over in virology it's called
 

00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:14.669
over and over in virology it's called
the one step growth cycle and as you may

00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679
the one step growth cycle and as you may
 

00:33:14.679 --> 00:33:16.409
the one step growth cycle and as you may
guess this was first worked out for

00:33:16.409 --> 00:33:16.419
guess this was first worked out for
 

00:33:16.419 --> 00:33:18.419
guess this was first worked out for
bacteria phages here's a

00:33:18.419 --> 00:33:18.429
bacteria phages here's a
 

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:21.779

Furio virus infecting a bacterium this

00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:21.789
Furio virus infecting a bacterium this
 

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:25.409
Furio virus infecting a bacterium this
was done in 1939 Ellis and delbruck who

00:33:25.409 --> 00:33:25.419
was done in 1939 Ellis and delbruck who
 

00:33:25.419 --> 00:33:27.810
was done in 1939 Ellis and delbruck who
used ecoli the bacterium and the phages

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:27.820
used ecoli the bacterium and the phages
 

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.480
used ecoli the bacterium and the phages
of that bacterium and what they did they

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:30.490
of that bacterium and what they did they
 

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.909
of that bacterium and what they did they
would add virus to their cells and let

00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919
would add virus to their cells and let
 

00:33:32.919 --> 00:33:33.659
would add virus to their cells and let
it attach

00:33:33.659 --> 00:33:33.669
it attach
 

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:37.049
it attach
that's called adsorption then they

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:37.059
that's called adsorption then they
 

00:33:37.059 --> 00:33:39.509
that's called adsorption then they
diluted the culture and that prevents

00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519
diluted the culture and that prevents
 

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:40.769
diluted the culture and that prevents
further adsorption

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:40.779
further adsorption
 

00:33:40.779 --> 00:33:42.720
further adsorption
so it basically synchronizes the

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:42.730
so it basically synchronizes the
 

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.369
so it basically synchronizes the
infection so all the phages that were

00:33:44.369 --> 00:33:44.379
infection so all the phages that were
 

00:33:44.379 --> 00:33:46.109
infection so all the phages that were
attached are the ones that are going to

00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:46.119
attached are the ones that are going to
 

00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:48.720
attached are the ones that are going to
go on to do the rest of the infection no

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:48.730
go on to do the rest of the infection no
 

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.399
go on to do the rest of the infection no
more infections will occur because the

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:50.409
more infections will occur because the
 

00:33:50.409 --> 00:33:52.859
more infections will occur because the
culture has been diluted they then

00:33:52.859 --> 00:33:52.869
culture has been diluted they then
 

00:33:52.869 --> 00:33:56.580
culture has been diluted they then
incubate this culture at 37 degrees and

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:56.590
incubate this culture at 37 degrees and
 

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.889
incubate this culture at 37 degrees and
take a sample every few minutes and do a

00:33:58.889 --> 00:33:58.899
take a sample every few minutes and do a
 

00:33:58.899 --> 00:34:01.889
take a sample every few minutes and do a
plaque assay and ask how much infectious

00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:01.899
plaque assay and ask how much infectious
 

00:34:01.899 --> 00:34:05.100
plaque assay and ask how much infectious
bacteria phage is present and they

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:05.110
bacteria phage is present and they
 

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.379
bacteria phage is present and they
plotted those on graphs and this is what

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:07.389
plotted those on graphs and this is what
 

00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:10.260
plotted those on graphs and this is what
they look like so on the left is an

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:10.270
they look like so on the left is an
 

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.770
they look like so on the left is an
example of this experiment where all the

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:13.780
example of this experiment where all the
 

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.500
example of this experiment where all the
cells in the culture were infected so

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:16.510
cells in the culture were infected so
 

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.480
cells in the culture were infected so
what you have is initially you have no

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:18.490
what you have is initially you have no
 

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:21.180
what you have is initially you have no
phages detected by plaque assay so here

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:21.190
phages detected by plaque assay so here
 

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.819
phages detected by plaque assay so here
we have time versus the number of

00:34:23.819 --> 00:34:23.829
we have time versus the number of
 

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:25.559
we have time versus the number of
infectious particles determined by a

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:25.569
infectious particles determined by a
 

00:34:25.569 --> 00:34:27.899
infectious particles determined by a
plaque assay so initially we don't see

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:27.909
plaque assay so initially we don't see
 

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:29.789
plaque assay so initially we don't see
any infectivity even though we added

00:34:29.789 --> 00:34:29.799
any infectivity even though we added
 

00:34:29.799 --> 00:34:32.309
any infectivity even though we added
bacteria phages we don't see it and then

00:34:32.309 --> 00:34:32.319
bacteria phages we don't see it and then
 

00:34:32.319 --> 00:34:34.680
bacteria phages we don't see it and then
suddenly there's a burst of infectious

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:34.690
suddenly there's a burst of infectious
 

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.470
suddenly there's a burst of infectious
virus production so that's called the

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480
virus production so that's called the
 

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.240
virus production so that's called the
burst they saw this very rapid

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:39.250
burst they saw this very rapid
 

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.829
burst they saw this very rapid
production of phages they called it a

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839
production of phages they called it a
 

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:43.049
production of phages they called it a
burst and that's stuck until today and

00:34:43.049 --> 00:34:43.059
burst and that's stuck until today and
 

00:34:43.059 --> 00:34:46.440
burst and that's stuck until today and
then eventually it plateaus we call this

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:46.450
then eventually it plateaus we call this
 

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:48.450
then eventually it plateaus we call this
a one-step growth curve because we have

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:48.460
a one-step growth curve because we have
 

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.639
a one-step growth curve because we have
one all the cells are infected and

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:50.649
one all the cells are infected and
 

00:34:50.649 --> 00:34:52.950
one all the cells are infected and
there's one cycle of replication and

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960
there's one cycle of replication and
 

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.730
there's one cycle of replication and
virus production so a single cycle of

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:56.740
virus production so a single cycle of
 

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.920
virus production so a single cycle of
replication produces this verse now if

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:58.930
replication produces this verse now if
 

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.930
replication produces this verse now if
you do a different experiment and don't

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:00.940
you do a different experiment and don't
 

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.030
you do a different experiment and don't
add a lot of virus in the beginning we

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040
add a lot of virus in the beginning we
 

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.099
add a lot of virus in the beginning we
had fewer virus particles so that only a

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:05.109
had fewer virus particles so that only a
 

00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:08.010
had fewer virus particles so that only a
few bacteria are infected then you get

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:08.020
few bacteria are infected then you get
 

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:09.630
few bacteria are infected then you get
multiple bursts so you have your initial

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640
multiple bursts so you have your initial
 

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.760
multiple bursts so you have your initial
lag you have the first burst but not

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:11.770
lag you have the first burst but not
 

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:13.890
lag you have the first burst but not
every cell isn't is producing virus

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:13.900
every cell isn't is producing virus
 

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.140
every cell isn't is producing virus
those cells produce virus which then

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:16.150
those cells produce virus which then
 

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.660
those cells produce virus which then
goes on to infect the uninfected cells

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:18.670
goes on to infect the uninfected cells
 

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.220
goes on to infect the uninfected cells
in the culture and you have your second

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:20.230
in the culture and you have your second
 

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.710
in the culture and you have your second
burst here so these are two very typical

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720
burst here so these are two very typical
 

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.359
burst here so these are two very typical
patterns of growth curves is the one

00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:24.369
patterns of growth curves is the one
 

00:35:24.369 --> 00:35:26.069
patterns of growth curves is the one
step this is obviously a multi cycle

00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079
step this is obviously a multi cycle
 

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:29.099
step this is obviously a multi cycle
growth curve and this led to the

00:35:29.099 --> 00:35:29.109
growth curve and this led to the
 

00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:32.190
growth curve and this led to the
description of very specific phase

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200
description of very specific phase
 

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.109
description of very specific phase
of the growth cycle and one of them here

00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119
of the growth cycle and one of them here
 

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:35.970
of the growth cycle and one of them here
is the eclipse phase that's this phase

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:35.980
is the eclipse phase that's this phase
 

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.460
is the eclipse phase that's this phase
here where we don't see any infectivity

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:38.470
here where we don't see any infectivity
 

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.339
here where we don't see any infectivity
we just take these samples from this

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:41.349
we just take these samples from this
 

00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:43.920
we just take these samples from this
culture and assay for PF fuse we don't

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:43.930
culture and assay for PF fuse we don't
 

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.560
culture and assay for PF fuse we don't
see anything they called it the Eclipse

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:46.570
see anything they called it the Eclipse
 

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.359
see anything they called it the Eclipse
phase and they figured out that this is

00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:48.369
phase and they figured out that this is
 

00:35:48.369 --> 00:35:50.609
phase and they figured out that this is
because what happens is early an

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:50.619
because what happens is early an
 

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:52.829
because what happens is early an
infection the genome comes out of the

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839
infection the genome comes out of the
 

00:35:52.839 --> 00:35:55.230
infection the genome comes out of the
virus and it's no longer infectious in a

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240
virus and it's no longer infectious in a
 

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.540
virus and it's no longer infectious in a
plaque assay so the genome comes out you

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:57.550
plaque assay so the genome comes out you
 

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.370
plaque assay so the genome comes out you
can't detect it in a plaque assay and

00:35:59.370 --> 00:35:59.380
can't detect it in a plaque assay and
 

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.589
can't detect it in a plaque assay and
you have to wait till new virions are

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599
you have to wait till new virions are
 

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:03.569
you have to wait till new virions are
assembled to see infectivity and that's

00:36:03.569 --> 00:36:03.579
assembled to see infectivity and that's
 

00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:09.359
assembled to see infectivity and that's
what you see in the bursts so these in

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:09.369
what you see in the bursts so these in
 

00:36:09.369 --> 00:36:11.670
what you see in the bursts so these in
the case of phages or in this experiment

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680
the case of phages or in this experiment
 

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.620
the case of phages or in this experiment
in particular new infectious viruses can

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:13.630
in particular new infectious viruses can
 

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.380
in particular new infectious viruses can
be detected inside of the cell before

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:16.390
be detected inside of the cell before
 

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.569
be detected inside of the cell before
they are released into the medium so

00:36:18.569 --> 00:36:18.579
they are released into the medium so
 

00:36:18.579 --> 00:36:20.310
they are released into the medium so
this is actually what we see here they

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320
this is actually what we see here they
 

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.349
this is actually what we see here they
didn't in their initial experiments they

00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359
didn't in their initial experiments they
 

00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:24.180
didn't in their initial experiments they
didn't actually separate the cells from

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.190
didn't actually separate the cells from
 

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.579
didn't actually separate the cells from
the medium because in bacteria phages

00:36:26.579 --> 00:36:26.589
the medium because in bacteria phages
 

00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:29.130
the medium because in bacteria phages
and many bacteria phages that viruses

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:29.140
and many bacteria phages that viruses
 

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.990
and many bacteria phages that viruses
are assembled inside the cell and

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000
are assembled inside the cell and
 

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.520
are assembled inside the cell and
they're actually infectious inside the

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:32.530
they're actually infectious inside the
 

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.069
they're actually infectious inside the
cell then they're released so in this

00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079
cell then they're released so in this
 

00:36:35.079 --> 00:36:36.510
cell then they're released so in this
experiment they're measuring both but as

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520
experiment they're measuring both but as
 

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.140
experiment they're measuring both but as
we'll see you can separate the two now

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:40.150
we'll see you can separate the two now
 

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.579
we'll see you can separate the two now
what do you think happened next well the

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:41.589
what do you think happened next well the
 

00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:43.829
what do you think happened next well the
animal virologist took the one-step

00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839
animal virologist took the one-step
 

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:45.599
animal virologist took the one-step
growth curve and did their own version

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:45.609
growth curve and did their own version
 

00:36:45.609 --> 00:36:48.059
growth curve and did their own version
once John Enders had showed them how to

00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:48.069
once John Enders had showed them how to
 

00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:50.700
once John Enders had showed them how to
grow viruses in cells so here's an

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:50.710
grow viruses in cells so here's an
 

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.800
grow viruses in cells so here's an
example of a growth curve for an animal

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:52.810
example of a growth curve for an animal
 

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.170
example of a growth curve for an animal
virus adenovirus happens to be type 5

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:55.180
virus adenovirus happens to be type 5
 

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.250
virus adenovirus happens to be type 5
doesn't really matter

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:56.260
doesn't really matter
 

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.520
doesn't really matter
we've infected cells and at different

00:36:59.520 --> 00:36:59.530
we've infected cells and at different
 

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.500
we've infected cells and at different
times after infection here the hours

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:01.510
times after infection here the hours
 

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.530
times after infection here the hours
after absorption we assay for plaque

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:04.540
after absorption we assay for plaque
 

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.780
after absorption we assay for plaque
forming units per mil and we have two

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:06.790
forming units per mil and we have two
 

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.540
forming units per mil and we have two
different assays here we have

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:08.550
different assays here we have
 

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.280
different assays here we have
intracellular virus and extracellular

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:11.290
intracellular virus and extracellular
 

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.730
intracellular virus and extracellular
virus so intracellular we take the cells

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:14.740
virus so intracellular we take the cells
 

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.980
virus so intracellular we take the cells
and centrifuge them out of the medium

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:16.990
and centrifuge them out of the medium
 

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.170
and centrifuge them out of the medium
break them open and measure the virus in

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.180
break them open and measure the virus in
 

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.230
break them open and measure the virus in
them and for extracellular we just take

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240
them and for extracellular we just take
 

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.940
them and for extracellular we just take
the medium and remove any cells that

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:23.950
the medium and remove any cells that
 

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.950
the medium and remove any cells that
might be present so we can separate the

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960
might be present so we can separate the
 

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.630
might be present so we can separate the
two and measure what's in the cell and

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640
two and measure what's in the cell and
 

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.700
two and measure what's in the cell and
what's out of the cell so initially you

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:29.710
what's out of the cell so initially you
 

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.160
what's out of the cell so initially you
see this Eclipse period up to 12 hours

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.170
see this Eclipse period up to 12 hours
 

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:34.559
see this Eclipse period up to 12 hours
just as we did for bacteria phages we

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:34.569
just as we did for bacteria phages we
 

00:37:34.569 --> 00:37:37.079
just as we did for bacteria phages we
can't detect any infectivity either in

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:37.089
can't detect any infectivity either in
 

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:39.450
can't detect any infectivity either in
the supernatant or in the cells

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:39.460
the supernatant or in the cells
 

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:43.410
the supernatant or in the cells
themselves then at about 12 hours just

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:43.420
themselves then at about 12 hours just
 

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.140
themselves then at about 12 hours just
after 12 hours you see we start to have

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:46.150
after 12 hours you see we start to have
 

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.559
after 12 hours you see we start to have
produced within the cell but we still

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:49.569
produced within the cell but we still
 

00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:52.079
produced within the cell but we still
don't see anything extracellular Lee

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:52.089
don't see anything extracellular Lee
 

00:37:52.089 --> 00:37:55.499
don't see anything extracellular Lee
until 16 hours actually past 16 hours so

00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:55.509
until 16 hours actually past 16 hours so
 

00:37:55.509 --> 00:37:56.940
until 16 hours actually past 16 hours so
there's a period here where we see

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:56.950
there's a period here where we see
 

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.640
there's a period here where we see
inside the cell infectious viruses but

00:37:59.640 --> 00:37:59.650
inside the cell infectious viruses but
 

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.230
inside the cell infectious viruses but
not outside the cell so they've been

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240
not outside the cell so they've been
 

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.849
not outside the cell so they've been
made and assembled but they just haven't

00:38:02.849 --> 00:38:02.859
made and assembled but they just haven't
 

00:38:02.859 --> 00:38:04.529
made and assembled but they just haven't
gotten out of the cell yet and that's

00:38:04.529 --> 00:38:04.539
gotten out of the cell yet and that's
 

00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:06.930
gotten out of the cell yet and that's
called the latent period from the

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:06.940
called the latent period from the
 

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.150
called the latent period from the
beginning of infection to the time when

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160
beginning of infection to the time when
 

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.559
beginning of infection to the time when
they're put out of the cell so the

00:38:10.559 --> 00:38:10.569
they're put out of the cell so the
 

00:38:10.569 --> 00:38:12.690
they're put out of the cell so the
eclipsed period is the time when we

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:12.700
eclipsed period is the time when we
 

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.539
eclipsed period is the time when we
can't detect any infectivity whatsoever

00:38:15.539 --> 00:38:15.549
can't detect any infectivity whatsoever

wherever you look latent period is
 

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.650
wherever you look latent period is
simply the time you don't see infectious

viruses lag behind you can see the titer

00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599
viruses lag behind you can see the titer
 

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:33.180
viruses lag behind you can see the titer
is always lower because not everything

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:33.190
is always lower because not everything
 

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.039

very difficult to trace what was going
 

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.230
very difficult to trace what was going
on now you remember with the

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240
on now you remember with the
 

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.540
on now you remember with the
bacteriophage one-step growth cycles the

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:06.550

way to synchronize was to dilute the

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.170
way to synchronize was to dilute the
 

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.630
way to synchronize was to dilute the
culture so no more viruses could attach

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640

we do this with animal viruses in in two

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:15.370
we do this with animal viruses in in two
 

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.390
we do this with animal viruses in in two
ways we infect cells with enough virus

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400
ways we infect cells with enough virus
 

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.330
ways we infect cells with enough virus
to infect all the cells at once so that

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:21.340
to infect all the cells at once so that
 

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.980
to infect all the cells at once so that
everything starts at the same time and

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:22.990
everything starts at the same time and
 

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.760
everything starts at the same time and
then we dilute the culture to prevent

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:25.770
then we dilute the culture to prevent
 

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:31.290
then we dilute the culture to prevent
absorption so the question is how do you

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:31.300
absorption so the question is how do you
 

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:35.040
absorption so the question is how do you
know when you have enough virus so can

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:35.050
know when you have enough virus so can
 

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.750
know when you have enough virus so can
you just throw a ton of virus on cells

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:36.760
you just throw a ton of virus on cells
 

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.370
you just throw a ton of virus on cells
or is there a precise way to measure

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:38.380
or is there a precise way to measure
 

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.530
or is there a precise way to measure
this well of course there is a precise

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:40.540
this well of course there is a precise
 

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.410
this well of course there is a precise
way and it has to do with what we call

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:43.420
way and it has to do with what we call
 

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.060
way and it has to do with what we call
the multiplicity of infection or mo I

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:47.070
the multiplicity of infection or mo I
 

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:53.040
the multiplicity of infection or mo I
usually like the lights on multiplicity

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.050
usually like the lights on multiplicity
 

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.310
usually like the lights on multiplicity
of infection this is how we determine

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320
of infection this is how we determine
 

00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.090
of infection this is how we determine
how many viruses we put on cells it is

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:00.100
how many viruses we put on cells it is
 

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.190

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.160
the number of infectious particles added
per cell so if I have a million cells in

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.170
per cell so if I have a million cells in
 

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:12.060
per cell so if I have a million cells in
a plate and I add a million viruses what

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.070
a plate and I add a million viruses what
 

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:16.530
a plate and I add a million viruses what
is the multiplicity of infection one

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:16.540
is the multiplicity of infection one
 

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.470
is the multiplicity of infection one
it's real simple nothing tricky if

I'm adding it doesn't mean that every
 

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.800
I'm adding it doesn't mean that every
cell gets one virus though that's just

simple but what gets complicated is

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:36.970
simple but what gets complicated is
 

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.450
simple but what gets complicated is
figuring out how many particles each

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:39.460
figuring out how many particles each
 

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.850
figuring out how many particles each
cell receives that's the harder part

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:41.860

which will bring you through now but the
 

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.780
which will bring you through now but the
first part is very easy can look at it

this way if there are a hundred buckets

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560
this way if there are a hundred buckets
 

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.400
this way if there are a hundred buckets
in this room and I could somehow carry a

this wonderful formula here at the top
which was figured out by plus some many

00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599
which was figured out by plus some many
 

00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:58.229
which was figured out by plus some many
years ago and for viruses we've actually

00:42:58.229 --> 00:42:58.239
years ago and for viruses we've actually
 

00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:01.709
years ago and for viruses we've actually
rewritten it so that it means PK is the

00:43:01.709 --> 00:43:01.719
rewritten it so that it means PK is the
 

00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:04.049
rewritten it so that it means PK is the

virus particles and M is the

00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:07.479
virus particles and M is the
 

00:43:07.479 --> 00:43:10.229
virus particles and M is the
multiplicity of infection so we can

00:43:10.229 --> 00:43:10.239
multiplicity of infection so we can
 

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:12.799

actually simplify this equation

00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:12.809
actually simplify this equation
 

00:43:12.809 --> 00:43:15.779
actually simplify this equation
substantially and we can do that by

00:43:15.779 --> 00:43:15.789
substantially and we can do that by
 

00:43:15.789 --> 00:43:20.009
substantially and we can do that by
inserting for K either 0 1 or greater

00:43:20.009 --> 00:43:20.019
inserting for K either 0 1 or greater
 

00:43:20.019 --> 00:43:22.559
inserting for K either 0 1 or greater
than 1 and these are the equations that

00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:22.569
than 1 and these are the equations that
 

00:43:22.569 --> 00:43:24.150
than 1 and these are the equations that
result when you do that for example if

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160
result when you do that for example if
 

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.269
result when you do that for example if
you put 0 into this equation this is how

00:43:27.269 --> 00:43:27.279
you put 0 into this equation this is how
 

00:43:27.279 --> 00:43:29.549
you put 0 into this equation this is how
it simplifies so p0 equals e to the

00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559
it simplifies so p0 equals e to the
 

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:31.979
it simplifies so p0 equals e to the
minus M the natural logarithm to the

00:43:31.979 --> 00:43:31.989
minus M the natural logarithm to the
 

00:43:31.989 --> 00:43:33.509
minus M the natural logarithm to the

exponent of the multiplicity of
 

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:34.620
exponent of the multiplicity of
infection so it's a very easy

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:34.630
infection so it's a very easy
 

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.920
infection so it's a very easy
calculation cells receiving one particle

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:37.930

calculation cells receiving one particle
p1 equals m e to the minus m and then

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:40.690
p1 equals m e to the minus m and then
 

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.859
p1 equals m e to the minus m and then
for greater than one here's the formula

00:43:43.859 --> 00:43:43.869
for greater than one here's the formula
 

00:43:43.869 --> 00:43:46.229
for greater than one here's the formula
which is basically subtracting from one

00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:46.239
which is basically subtracting from one
 

00:43:46.239 --> 00:43:47.880

the sum of all probabilities for any
 

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.759
the sum of all probabilities for any
value of K so let's look at the numbers

00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:50.769
value of K so let's look at the numbers
 

00:43:50.769 --> 00:43:52.859
value of K so let's look at the numbers
you'd get with this formula if you

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:52.869
you'd get with this formula if you
 

00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:56.999
you'd get with this formula if you
infect a million cells at an my of 10:45

00:43:56.999 --> 00:43:57.009
infect a million cells at an my of 10:45
 

00:43:57.009 --> 00:43:58.589
infect a million cells at an my of 10:45
cells then you plug that into the

00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599
cells then you plug that into the
 

00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:00.959
cells then you plug that into the
formula if 45 cells are uninfected so

00:44:00.959 --> 00:44:00.969
formula if 45 cells are uninfected so
 

00:44:00.969 --> 00:44:02.279
formula if 45 cells are uninfected so
that's nothing in the culture of a

00:44:02.279 --> 00:44:02.289
that's nothing in the culture of a
 

00:44:02.289 --> 00:44:05.130
that's nothing in the culture of a
million cells 450 cells received just

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:05.140
million cells 450 cells received just
 

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:07.410
million cells 450 cells received just
one particle and the rest get more than

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:07.420
one particle and the rest get more than
 

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.019
one particle and the rest get more than
one so basically in a million cell at an

00:44:10.019 --> 00:44:10.029
one so basically in a million cell at an
 

00:44:10.029 --> 00:44:11.849
one so basically in a million cell at an
mo of 10 you've got everybody infected

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:11.859
mo of 10 you've got everybody infected
 

00:44:11.859 --> 00:44:14.249
mo of 10 you've got everybody infected
so that's why we use mo i of 10 most of

00:44:14.249 --> 00:44:14.259
so that's why we use mo i of 10 most of
 

00:44:14.259 --> 00:44:16.559
so that's why we use mo i of 10 most of
the time in the laboratory but sometimes

00:44:16.559 --> 00:44:16.569
the time in the laboratory but sometimes
 

00:44:16.569 --> 00:44:18.239
the time in the laboratory but sometimes
we don't want to infect all the cells we

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:18.249
we don't want to infect all the cells we
 

00:44:18.249 --> 00:44:20.279
we don't want to infect all the cells we
want to have a multi cycle infection to

00:44:20.279 --> 00:44:20.289
want to have a multi cycle infection to
 

00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:22.680
want to have a multi cycle infection to
study so we use a lower mo I let's try

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:22.690
study so we use a lower mo I let's try
 

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.039
study so we use a lower mo I let's try
one here 37 percent of the cells are

00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:26.049

seven received one particle and 26% more

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:31.180
seven received one particle and 26% more
 

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.500
seven received one particle and 26% more
than one so about seventy-five percent

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:34.510
than one so about seventy-five percent
 

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:36.450
than one so about seventy-five percent
of the cells end up getting infected

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:36.460
of the cells end up getting infected
 

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:42.990
of the cells end up getting infected
73% if we use 0.001 very low mo I 99

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000
73% if we use 0.001 very low mo I 99
 

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.980
73% if we use 0.001 very low mo I 99
percent of the cells are uninfected so

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:45.990
percent of the cells are uninfected so
 

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:49.350
percent of the cells are uninfected so
0.1% or a thousand cells get one

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:49.360
0.1% or a thousand cells get one
 

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.530
0.1% or a thousand cells get one

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.780
particle and in a vanishingly small
percentage get more than one so most

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:53.790
percentage get more than one so most
 

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:56.100
percentage get more than one so most

could never count a thousand Plex but
 

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:03.900
could never count a thousand Plex but
you could do a multi nice multi cycle

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:03.910
you could do a multi nice multi cycle
 

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.840
you could do a multi nice multi cycle
experiment at that MRI all right so

blood cells which are big have silac

00:45:59.099 --> 00:45:59.109
blood cells which are big have silac
 

00:45:59.109 --> 00:46:01.560
blood cells which are big have silac
acids on their surface it's very easy to

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:01.570
acids on their surface it's very easy to
 

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.770
acids on their surface it's very easy to
get red blood cells come by them and so

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:04.780
get red blood cells come by them and so
 

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.710
get red blood cells come by them and so
in 1941 George Hearst right here in New

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.380
in 1941 George Hearst right here in New
York City figured out the assay for

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:10.390
York City figured out the assay for
 

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.690
York City figured out the assay for
measuring influenza virus using red

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:12.700
measuring influenza virus using red
 

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.760
measuring influenza virus using red
blood cells if you mix the virus with

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:14.770
blood cells if you mix the virus with
 

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:16.859
blood cells if you mix the virus with
red blood cells it will make them all

00:46:16.859 --> 00:46:16.869
red blood cells it will make them all
 

00:46:16.869 --> 00:46:18.960
red blood cells it will make them all
stick together because one virus will

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:18.970
stick together because one virus will
 

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:20.670
stick together because one virus will
stick to multiple red blood cells via

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680
stick to multiple red blood cells via
 

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.220
stick to multiple red blood cells via
this sciatic acid and because red blood

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:23.230
this sciatic acid and because red blood
 

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.300
this sciatic acid and because red blood
cells are pretty big you can see this so

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:27.310
cells are pretty big you can see this so
 

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.430
cells are pretty big you can see this so
here for example is a hemagglutination a

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440
here for example is a hemagglutination a
 

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.010
here for example is a hemagglutination a
say you make dilutions of your virus and

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:32.020
say you make dilutions of your virus and
 

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.580
say you make dilutions of your virus and
you mix them with red blood cells and

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:34.590
you mix them with red blood cells and
 

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.410
you mix them with red blood cells and
then you see which ones the red blood

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:37.420
then you see which ones the red blood
 

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.300
then you see which ones the red blood
cells stick to one another how can you

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.310
cells stick to one another how can you
 

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.339
cells stick to one another how can you
tell that well if the red blood

00:46:41.339 --> 00:46:41.349
tell that well if the red blood
 

00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:42.989
tell that well if the red blood
don't stick to one another they rolls to

00:46:42.989 --> 00:46:42.999
don't stick to one another they rolls to
 

00:46:42.999 --> 00:46:44.219
don't stick to one another they rolls to
the bottom of the well and they make a

00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:44.229
the bottom of the well and they make a
 

00:46:44.229 --> 00:46:46.259
the bottom of the well and they make a
nice little button so that means there's

00:46:46.259 --> 00:46:46.269
nice little button so that means there's
 

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:48.359
nice little button so that means there's
no virus in this sample at all or this

00:46:48.359 --> 00:46:48.369
no virus in this sample at all or this
 

00:46:48.369 --> 00:46:50.910
no virus in this sample at all or this
one below but if there is virus present

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920
one below but if there is virus present
 

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.759
one below but if there is virus present
the red blood cells make a nice mat

00:46:53.759 --> 00:46:53.769
the red blood cells make a nice mat
 

00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:56.130
the red blood cells make a nice mat
along the well and you can see that in

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:56.140
along the well and you can see that in
 

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.859
along the well and you can see that in
many of these wells here and so what you

00:46:58.859 --> 00:46:58.869
many of these wells here and so what you
 

00:46:58.869 --> 00:47:01.499
many of these wells here and so what you
basically do is you go to the dilution

00:47:01.499 --> 00:47:01.509
basically do is you go to the dilution
 

00:47:01.509 --> 00:47:03.599
basically do is you go to the dilution
where you don't see that mat anymore and

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:03.609
where you don't see that mat anymore and
 

00:47:03.609 --> 00:47:06.870
where you don't see that mat anymore and
that's the H a titer of the virus so it

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880
that's the H a titer of the virus so it
 

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.130
that's the H a titer of the virus so it
doesn't tell you about infectious

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:08.140
doesn't tell you about infectious
 

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:12.359
doesn't tell you about infectious
particles but it does tell you how much

00:47:12.359 --> 00:47:12.369
particles but it does tell you how much
 

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:15.449
particles but it does tell you how much
virus is present which is useful for

00:47:15.449 --> 00:47:15.459
virus is present which is useful for
 

00:47:15.459 --> 00:47:17.759
virus is present which is useful for
many viruses we can't do plaque assay we

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:17.769
many viruses we can't do plaque assay we
 

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:20.339
many viruses we can't do plaque assay we
can't to H a team agglutination so we

00:47:20.339 --> 00:47:20.349
can't to H a team agglutination so we
 

00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:22.410
can't to H a team agglutination so we
measure viral enzyme activity as you

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:22.420
measure viral enzyme activity as you
 

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.410
measure viral enzyme activity as you
will see some animal viruses have

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:25.420
will see some animal viruses have
 

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.269
will see some animal viruses have
enzymes in the particle they have

00:47:27.269 --> 00:47:27.279
enzymes in the particle they have
 

00:47:27.279 --> 00:47:28.709
enzymes in the particle they have
nucleic acid polymer aces they have

00:47:28.709 --> 00:47:28.719
nucleic acid polymer aces they have
 

00:47:28.719 --> 00:47:36.150
nucleic acid polymer aces they have
other enzymes as well and you can

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160
other enzymes as well and you can
 

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.680
other enzymes as well and you can
measure those so you mix virus particles

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:40.690
measure those so you mix virus particles
 

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.049
measure those so you mix virus particles
with some kind of nucleic acid precursor

00:47:43.049 --> 00:47:43.059
with some kind of nucleic acid precursor
 

00:47:43.059 --> 00:47:45.359
with some kind of nucleic acid precursor
you have two permeable eyes the particle

00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:45.369
you have two permeable eyes the particle
 

00:47:45.369 --> 00:47:48.120
you have two permeable eyes the particle
because these triphosphates can't get

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:48.130
because these triphosphates can't get
 

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.650
because these triphosphates can't get
through membranes so you mix them with a

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:49.660
through membranes so you mix them with a
 

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.299
through membranes so you mix them with a
little detergent the labeled

00:47:51.299 --> 00:47:51.309
little detergent the labeled
 

00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:53.400
little detergent the labeled
triphosphates get in the enzyme

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:53.410
triphosphates get in the enzyme
 

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.049
triphosphates get in the enzyme
polymerizes them and you can measure

00:47:55.049 --> 00:47:55.059
polymerizes them and you can measure
 

00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:57.809
polymerizes them and you can measure
that and this is most often done for

00:47:57.809 --> 00:47:57.819
that and this is most often done for
 

00:47:57.819 --> 00:47:59.880
that and this is most often done for
retroviruses which many of which do not

00:47:59.880 --> 00:47:59.890
retroviruses which many of which do not
 

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.999

then you filter that through a membrane

00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839
then you filter that through a membrane
 

00:48:40.839 --> 00:48:43.410
then you filter that through a membrane
and if there's any nucleic acid

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:43.420
and if there's any nucleic acid
 

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.269
and if there's any nucleic acid
synthesized in the particle it will

is the interior of a cell and you can

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400
is the interior of a cell and you can
 

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.130
is the interior of a cell and you can
see these green dots are individual

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:35.140
see these green dots are individual
 

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.400

years ago was suggested that the virus

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960
years ago was suggested that the virus
 

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.500
years ago was suggested that the virus
might be involved in this disease and so

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:25.510
might be involved in this disease and so
 

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:28.250
might be involved in this disease and so
this is an experiment where serum

and you can see the normal controls are

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:00.550
and you can see the normal controls are
 

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:03.300

do cause disease and that's much harder

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:18.940
do cause disease and that's much harder
 

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:22.910

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:43.710
deep level you can go down to almost
single molecules so it was originally

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720
single molecules so it was originally
 

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.990
single molecules so it was originally
developed as pyro sequencing because the

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000
developed as pyro sequencing because the
 

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.060
developed as pyro sequencing because the
method involved taking DNA that you want

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:48.070
method involved taking DNA that you want
 

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:50.730
method involved taking DNA that you want
a sequence denaturing it so you have

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:50.740
a sequence denaturing it so you have
 

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.890
a sequence denaturing it so you have
single strands and then attaching them

00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:52.900
single strands and then attaching them
 

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.800
single strands and then attaching them
to beads very small beads such that each

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:55.810
to beads very small beads such that each
 

00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:58.710
to beads very small beads such that each
bead gets one piece of DNA only

00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720
bead gets one piece of DNA only
 

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.950
bead gets one piece of DNA only
and then you amplify the sequences on

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960
and then you amplify the sequences on
 

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.590
and then you amplify the sequences on
the beads and then you put the beads in

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:04.600
the beads and then you put the beads in
 

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.460
the beads and then you put the beads in
the well of a 96 or 1500 well plate will

the well of a 96 or 1500 well plate will
you do sequencing reactions and these

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:10.180
you do sequencing reactions and these
 

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.359
you do sequencing reactions and these
are amazingly clever reactions they're

00:58:12.359 --> 00:58:12.369
are amazingly clever reactions they're
 

00:58:12.369 --> 00:58:15.000
are amazingly clever reactions they're
called pyro sequencing because they

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.010
called pyro sequencing because they
 

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.250
called pyro sequencing because they
depend on the release of pyrophosphate

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:17.260
depend on the release of pyrophosphate
 

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.550
depend on the release of pyrophosphate
in a reaction which we won't go into but

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:20.560
in a reaction which we won't go into but
 

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.040
in a reaction which we won't go into but
as each you add a polymerase to these

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:23.050
as each you add a polymerase to these
 

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.530
as each you add a polymerase to these
beads and the polymerase copies the

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:25.540
beads and the polymerase copies the
 

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.270
beads and the polymerase copies the
single-stranded nucleic acid that's

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280
single-stranded nucleic acid that's
 

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.410
single-stranded nucleic acid that's
present and added as it adds a base that

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420
present and added as it adds a base that
 

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.060

base emits light which can be detected

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.070
base emits light which can be detected
 

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:36.000
base emits light which can be detected
by a machine so you can see the sequence

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:36.010
by a machine so you can see the sequence
 

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:38.700
by a machine so you can see the sequence
of the product basically by reading

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:38.710
of the product basically by reading
 

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:40.950
of the product basically by reading
about the colors of light that emerge so

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960
about the colors of light that emerge so
 

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.500
about the colors of light that emerge so
this has now been used to sequence our

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:43.510
this has now been used to sequence our
 

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:46.440

with respiratory disease and just took
 

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:22.349
with respiratory disease and just took
sputum samples and in this case they did

00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359
sputum samples and in this case they did
 

00:59:22.359 --> 00:59:26.940
sputum samples and in this case they did
PCR but another work they have also done

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:26.950
PCR but another work they have also done
 

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:29.490

bacteriologist Koch who you remember

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.250
bacteriologist Koch who you remember
 

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:36.540
bacteriologist Koch who you remember
from last time was seriously involved in

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:36.550
from last time was seriously involved in
 

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.190
from last time was seriously involved in
formulating the germ theory of disease

01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200
formulating the germ theory of disease
 

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.590
formulating the germ theory of disease
he said there are these microorganisms

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:40.600
he said there are these microorganisms
 

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.770
he said there are these microorganisms
and they cause disease and he formulated

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:43.780
and they cause disease and he formulated
 

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.930
and they cause disease and he formulated
what we call his postulates to prove

first of all you have to regularly

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:52.930
first of all you have to regularly
 

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:56.820
first of all you have to regularly
associate the organism with a disease so

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:56.830
associate the organism with a disease so
 

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:59.220
associate the organism with a disease so
if you're looking at tuberculosis you

01:00:59.220 --> 01:00:59.230
if you're looking at tuberculosis you
 

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:00.330
if you're looking at tuberculosis you
have to see in people with tuberculosis

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:00.340
have to see in people with tuberculosis
 

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.790
have to see in people with tuberculosis
you have to always see the organism in

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:02.800
you have to always see the organism in
 

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.760
you have to always see the organism in
those individuals secondly you have to

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:05.770
those individuals secondly you have to
 

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:07.980
those individuals secondly you have to
get the organism from the individual and

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:07.990
get the organism from the individual and
 

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:11.550
get the organism from the individual and
grow it in culture all right third you

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:11.560
grow it in culture all right third you
 

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.530
grow it in culture all right third you
have to put the organism back into a

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:13.540
have to put the organism back into a
 

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.900
have to put the organism back into a
healthy host and show that it course is

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:15.910
healthy host and show that it course is
 

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:20.460
healthy host and show that it course is
the same disease and finally you have to

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:20.470
the same disease and finally you have to
 

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.350
the same disease and finally you have to
get the isolate the organism from that

01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:22.360
get the isolate the organism from that
 

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.080
get the isolate the organism from that
experimentally infected host so we said

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:25.090
experimentally infected host so we said
 

01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:27.000
experimentally infected host so we said
you fulfill these four things and you

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:27.010
you fulfill these four things and you
 

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:29.460
you fulfill these four things and you
can prove that something is causing an

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:29.470
can prove that something is causing an
 

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:33.180
can prove that something is causing an
infectious disease so this is 1885 or so

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:33.190
infectious disease so this is 1885 or so
 

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.900
infectious disease so this is 1885 or so
so now we have we don't have organisms

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:36.910
so now we have we don't have organisms
 

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.630
so now we have we don't have organisms
anymore we have sequences right we don't

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640
anymore we have sequences right we don't
 

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.460
