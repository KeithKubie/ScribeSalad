00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.920
So, we just covered six different
caching strategies that you can use.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.270
Cache first then network, network first
then cache, cache only, network only,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.230
though I guess technically that's
not really cache and strategy, oops.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.810
Cache and network race, and
finally cache then network.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.090
It's important to choose the right
strategy for the right kind of data.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.230
And don't be afraid to experiment or
even combine the different strategies.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.670
If there are parts of your
app that you can't cache for

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.720
some reason, give the users
something fun to do in the meantime.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.710
For example,
the Guardian newspaper in the UK

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.050
gives users a crossword puzzle
to play while they're offline.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.160
If you want to dive deeper into
ways that you can cache content,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.340
