Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics and today, I'm gonna get inside

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.880
the head of the American voter, and then we
are going to win every election ever ahaha!

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.820
No. Not literally. That would require some
sort of shrink ray technology that hasn't

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.080
been invented, although I understand there
is an Antman movie. Today we're going to look

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.660
at how voters make decisions, and when it
comes right down to it, we don't really know.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.199
After all, voting is like any other decision.
It results from a number of factors, only

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.449
some of which are conscious at the time, and
the main way we can tell about what caused

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.730
someone to vote one way or another is to ask
them, and human beings are notoriously unreliable

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.149
when it comes to knowing their own motivations.
So when I say we're gonna try to figure out

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.569
how voters decide, really we'll be looking
at what political scientists have decided

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.280
are the factors that influence voting decisions
-- which is way less exciting than saying we'll

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.580
be inside the heads of voters. So we're gonna
say we'll be inside the heads of voters!

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:56.440
[Theme Music]

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.260
Political scientists have identified three main
factors that influence how a person will vote.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.920
These are party loyalty, the issues
involved in an election, and characteristics

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.190
of the candidates running for office. If you
stop to think about it, this makes total sense

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.570
and may cause you to wonder whether we should
be paying political scientists their exorbitant

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.440
salaries. Let's start with party loyalty since
this is supposedly the single largest predictor

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.260
of how a person will vote. Many voters identify
as members of a political party, usually democrat

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.480
or republican, although a large percentage
of people call themselves independents too.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.560
We'll discuss the makeup of these parties in another
episode. Really we're gonna discuss makeup, Stan? Oh..

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.080
For now, we should acknowledge that party
loyalty is very very important in predicting

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.580
voter behavior. In fact, it is usually in
the range of 90%. People identify with a political

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.300
party for a number of reasons. Some develop
a psychological attachment to their party,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.640
often from youth. I've mentioned this before,
but your parents can have a powerful effect

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.770
on whether you identify as a democrat or republican,
although it's not always easy to predict how

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.650
this effect will work. I know plenty of staunch
republicans who adopted their party in rebellion

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.930
against their parents, and vice versa, and
there's some evidence that these political

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.570
parties - democrat and republican - are becoming
more opposed to each other, which political

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.110
writers describe as "increasing polarization".

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.220
One piece of evidence for this polarization
are polls showing a greater percentage of

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.580
Americans reporting that they'd be disappointed
if their child married someone who was from

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.709
the opposing political party. Yikes. Many
people identify with a particular party because

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.480
they believe that the party's ideals coincided
with their personal ideology. This is where

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.389
we get the democrats are liberals and republicans
are conservatives dichotomy. Past experience

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.189
with political leaders and representatives
also contributes to an individual's party

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.849
identity. A good example on the democratic
side is that people who grew up during the

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.569
Great Depression and formed a positive view
of FDR tended to become, and to stay, democrat.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.849
Something similar happened in the 1980s with
Ronald Reagan who appealed to voters across

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.939
party lines. 'Cos he was just so jovial and
folksy! Gibbity gibbity!

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.979
The second factor that influences voter decisions is
candidate characteristics. Again, political scientists and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.320
common sense are in agreement here. People often
vote for candidates with characteristics that they like.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.260
Which characteristics seem to matter? Well,
the ones you'd expect. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.300
Voters may be attracted to, or repelled by,
a candidate's race, ethnicity, religion, gender,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.169
or beard. Sometimes these characteristics
are more obvious than other times, and uninformed

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.429
voters may rely on stereotypes of candidates,
especially when it comes to ethnicity or religion.

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:09.029
Another personal characteristic that seems
important is geography, which in this case,

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:13.359
means the region that the candidate is identified
as being from. Joe Biden, when he was a senator,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.810
did a lot to identify himself with Delaware,
including pointing out how he took Amtrak

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.109
home from Washington. Which, if you're familiar
with U.S. geography, or have ridden in the

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.489
northeast corridor trains, you'll know is
actually pretty close to Delaware. Sometimes

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.579
though, geography doesn't seem to matter at
all. Hillary Clinton hadn't spent much time

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.309
in New York before voters in that state elected
her to the senate. If anything, she was associated

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.109
more with Arkansas, but in that case her gender
and probably more important her star power

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.329
were enough to overcome complaints that she
was a carpet bagger. And she and Bill did

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.529
buy a sweet place in Chappaqua, mkay?

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.719
One characteristic that is supposed to make
a difference to voters is social background.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.909
The assumption here is that voters will choose
candidates whom they believe are similar to

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.340
themselves in terms of social class. Candidates
certainly strive to appear like regular Joes

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.450
and Janes, but I'm a bit skeptical on this
one. That's not like me at all, my name is

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.169
Craig. A remarkably high number of congressmen
and senators are millionaires, for example,

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.269
but most Americans decidedly are not. Same
goes for college education. Most congressmen

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.199
and all presidents since Harry Truman have
graduated from college, but only about 30%

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.919
of Americans have. Many voters are also influenced
by a candidate's personality. These include

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.169
virtues like a reputation for honesty, energy,
and decisiveness, but maybe all candidates

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.100
are decisive and that's why they ran in the first place.
I don't know, I can't decide. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.830
So the third factor that influences how voters
make their choices is where the candidates

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.890
stand on issues. We would hope that this would
be the voters' top priority, but in fact it's

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.060
pretty far down the list. There are two types
of issue voting, retrospective and prospective,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.190
and both add information costs to voters'
decisions. Retrospective voting is when a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.820
voter chooses a candidate based on that candidate's
past performance. Like if your main issue

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.040
was eagle punching, you would know from my
past experience that there is a whole lot

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.660
of eagle punching going on, [punches eagle
off the desk] even my current experience.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.380
But a common problem with this is that finding out how
a candidate has performed does take some time and research.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.400
Prospective voting, as you might have guessed,
is voting based on the imagined future performance

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.260
of a candidate. Like let's imagine how I would
perform in the future. [Craig imagines himself

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.660
punching eagle off the desk again.] Ahh, I
love the future. [Reflecting] Oh yeah, I thought so.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.700
Imagining what a candidate will do in
the future seems like it will be easy, just

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.900
watch the debates, they will tell you what
they're gonna do-- but is that really what

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.280
they're gonna do? I don't have a time machine,
at least one that you know about.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.650
If you'll allow me to indulge in some poli-sci
jargon at this point, I'd like to mention

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.060
that there are at least two types of political
issues. There are spatial issues and valence

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.560
issues. Spatial issues are those for which
there is a range of possible options or choices.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.760
Think of them as existing on a spectrum. Minimum
wage is a good example of a spatial issue,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.740
some voters want it to be higher, and some
want it to be lowered. Some want it to be

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.340
basically infra-red, cause they don't want
any of it at all. Abortion is sometimes considered

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.760
a spatial issue as well, although there are
probably fewer points on the continuum for

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.660
it than something like minimum wage, or taxes,
jeez, that's a crazy spectrum!

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.440
Valence issues are those for which all voters
will prefer a higher value. One example here

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.520
might be government transparency, it's hard
to find a voters who wants a candidate to

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.500
run against transparency, although I'm sure
they're out there, maybe.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.920
So there you have the basic idea of how voters
make decisions. Much of this seems pretty

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.710
common sensical, but there's a couple things
to point out. First, even though political

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.740
scientists have identified these three factors:
party loyalty, candidate characteristics,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.860
and issues, there are probably others that
play a role and there are probably also factors

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.230
that interact with each other. For example,
personal prejudices aren't really mentioned,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.400
but I'm sure they matter and they interact
with candidate characteristics. One example

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.350
of this is the so-called Bradley Effect, named
after former L.A. mayor Tom Bradley. Bradley

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.130
was leading in all the polls for California
governor in 1982, but he lost. Political scientists

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.420
surmise that the polls were off because white
voters told pollsters that they were willing

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.280
to vote for Bradley, when they really weren't.
The idea is that Bradley's race was more important

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.460
than his political party, even though voters
claimed that it wouldn't be a factor in their decision.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.200
So which of these factors is best at predicting
election outcomes? Well, party loyalty is

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.320
probably your best bet, but as so-called Reagan
Democrats show us, party loyalty might matter

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.380
less when a candidate is particularly charismatic,
or if the issues line up in their favor. One

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.750
thing that political scientists have discovered
is that the more informed the electorate is,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.820
the more heavily issues and candidate characteristics
matter. But since, as we've seen, Americans

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.950
are generally not well-informed voters, party
affiliation looms particularly large in American

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.020
campaigns, and that's what we'll be looking at next time
-- campaigns. Thanks for watching, see you next time.
