[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.790
Hi everyone.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.810
And welcome to another
GDL for Google Drive.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.310
And today, we are going
to walk through one

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.400
of our Quick Starts.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.190
We've been doing all of
these for each of

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.930
the different languages.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.740
Today, we're going to look at
our iOS application, which is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.580
our Quick Start for Objective-C.
This is a really

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.225
simple iPhone app that uses
the camera or the photo

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:40.380
library on the phone to allow
the user to select a picture,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.140
and upload it into
Google Drive.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.780
Most of these Quick Starts we've
been trying to keep down

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.460
to about five minutes.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.930
This one I timed.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.610
Honestly, it's a little bit
longer than five minutes.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.240
I think that the quickest
I did this one

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.110
is about eight minutes.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.880
That was moving at a
pretty quick pace.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.400
Today, I'll probably slow it
down a little bit, just so we

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
can explain what's going
on at each step.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.990
But for the most part, it is
pretty easy to get going.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.090
And it's a pretty good example
to show you how you can start

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.190
to use the Drive SDK
on iOS and in your

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.120
iPhone and iPad apps.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.410
So I'm going to switch over,
and just take a look at the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.890
web page on
developers.google.com.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.890
You can see here, we have
the Quick-Start guide.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.640
And you're all encouraged
to try this on your own.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.870
It does require Xcode.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.280
I think I'm using 4.4.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.110
But so long as you have a Google
Drive account, Xcode,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.680
you pretty much can just follow
along at your own pace

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.690
or try to keep up, if you can.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.110
So the first thing we need to
do is enable the Drive SDK.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.270
And I'm going to go over
to our API's console.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.690
And I already have a
bunch of projects.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.335
But I'm going to go
create a new one.

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:55.630
I'll call this [? RR ?]

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.040
[? Detail ?]

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.290
iOS project.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.960
And we need to enable the Drive
API, which we'll find

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.730
down here, turn that on, and
more importantly, set up our

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.770
API access.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.030
This stuff is actually a little
bit confusing for iOS

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.760
developers.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.250
Because there is a step in here
which is a little bit

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.910
misleading.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.700
So we'll just say this
is our GL demo.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.280
We'll skip the logo and
homepage URL for now.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.530
But we're going to select
this installed

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.391
application sitting here.

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:37.120
It is a native app
that runs on iOS.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.510
Here's the confusing
part, though.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.420
This iOS option, basically, you
don't want to use this.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.990
This is, basically,
for a feature that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.460
doesn't exist yet.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.700
Or I don't know if
it ever will.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.360
But for those of you who have
done Android Develop, you've

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.690
noticed some changes to how we
do OAuth and Android, which is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.260
why there's a specific
option for Android.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.830
Because things are a little
bit different.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.520
But for now, for iOS, we're just
using a generic installed

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.000
application.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.910
And we are going
to create that.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.140
And we're all good.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.410
So I'm going to come
back to this.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.030
We're going to need some of
the values from here,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.850
specifically, the client ID
and the client secret.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.730
But we have a couple other
things that we

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.560
need to go do first.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.530
Basically, we've done step one
for enabling the Drive API.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.670
The next thing is we need to get
the Google Client Library.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.660
The instructions are here.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.150
Basically, it is really not
much more than a copy and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.580
paste of this line.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.070
So right now we just have
[INAUDIBLE] directory here.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.420
We'll go check that out.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.510
Life is pretty good.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.600
And while that's going, I'm
going to move on to step

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.840
three, which is create and
configure an Xcode project.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.940
So I have Xcode here.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.890
I already did the Create
New Project.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.250
Here's the wizard.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.680
And for this example, we're
going to use a single view

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.520
application as a template.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.760
It's just pretty easy that way,
a little bit less work in

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.200
order to get the
sample running.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.130
But obviously, you're going to
pick whichever template is

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.940
appropriate for your application
when you're doing

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.740
this for real, or
draw everything

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.970
from an empty project.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.260
So we'll enable that.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.020
We will say this is
our GDL Demo.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.740
And pretty much, the rest
of this is fine.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.300
Obviously, for a real
application, we would want to

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.560
fill this in and use proper
package names.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.450
But for today, we're going
to skip a lot of that.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.130
And let me just go back.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.420
And I'll give it
a home in here.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.360
So we have a nice empty
project here.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.560
We do need to do a bit of work,
though, in order to get

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.640
the setup to use the Library
for the Google APIs.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.962
And this is a little bit
of a lengthy process.

00:04:52.962 --> 00:04:56.240
It does involve copying
a few files around.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.170
So if you see here, we created
our SDK project, filled in our

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.550
products and everything.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.350
Now, we need to make sure that
the API Client is available to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.910
our project.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.610
And the easiest way to do that
is just to drag this extra

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.720
project into our project here.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.490
So we'll do that.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.335
It's going to ask us to
create a workspace.

00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:21.600
And we'll just do that.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.530
And just save that right here.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.330
But now we brought
in our source.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.640
And for those who haven't used
our API Library yet on iOS, I

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.550
would suggest going through the

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.870
documentation for the library.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.150
There's actually about three
different ways that you can go

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.480
about using the Library
on iOS.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.710
One involves copying
in the source.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.100
That does require setting up
some different build settings,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.300
depending on whether or not
you're using ARC or not.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.420
In this case, I opted for the
approach, which is using the

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.400
static library.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.520
And it does require a little
bit of extra work

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.360
in order to do so.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.420
But for me, it just felt
like the best option.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.880
So we're going to go and
move on with the rest

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.480
of the steps here.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.850
So we've added it in.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.070
We do need to update
our build settings.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.230
So we're going to update
our Library that we

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.310
need for our project.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.215
So go in here, and do
a quick search for--

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.565
let's see, where is
our setting here?

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.400
I'll cheat a little bit.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.460
Switch over to here.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:47.690
And we need to add some
dependencies.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.840
So one is--

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.340
this is the static library
produced by the API Library.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.290
We're going to add that.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.120
But then, we're going
to add a few more.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.600
And let's make sure I
remember which ones.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.200
So we need Security, System
Configuration,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.510
and Mobile Core Services.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.530
And let's see.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.270
So just so you know, the
security and system

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.960
configuration are required
by the Client Library.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.870
Mobile Core services we're just
including in this demo,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.470
mostly just to get access
to the camera.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.590
There's some library classes in
there that are useful for

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.820
the image picker.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.460
So we have those.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.340
We do need to update
our link flags.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.150
This is a step that is required

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.790
by the Client Library.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.686
Let's see now, this is the--

00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:54.170
oh, OK.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.420
They're link flags.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.660
All right.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.790
Oh, here we go.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.170
I got that.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.000
I really wanted to add these
to both of them.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.530
But for now, since I clicked on
the wrong one, we'll just

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.929
add it here in both.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:38.140
Normally, we just add this
for both versions.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.780
And the last thing
we need to do--

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.409
actually, not the last thing.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.580
We've still got a couple
more steps.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.560
We do need to copy over
this one resource

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.050
file from our project.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:54.460
So if you go here you should be
able to find, in our Touch

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.690
Library, this resource file.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.955
We are going to copy this over
into our supporting files.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.710
Then, one more thing--

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.130
really, two more things--
is basically

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.430
making the headers available.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.660
And then, copying over the
Drive specific services.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.510
So we will add to our user
Header Search Path.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.760
Go back to our Build Settings.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.240
They're over here.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.710
And so we're going to
go look into here,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.960
just to get our path.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.125
There we go.

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:54.660
That gives us a nice search path
for all of our headers.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.430
Make sure that we make sure
this is recursive.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.490
And number eight is making sure
GTL Drive and GTL Drive

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.390
sources is copied over
to our project.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.045
So that you can find.

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:13.370
And if you go into--

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.310
let's see, actually not
in the Workspace here.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.575
But you can go into Services,
Drive, Generated.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.990
And we need these
first two files.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.600
And we will drag
them into here.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.690
And we should be pretty good.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.680
So it's a little bit of work.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.035
A lot of this is really just how
the library for Objective

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:51.760
C is built.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.360
It does require a little
bit of setup work.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.490
But once you've done that--
you've done that a few times

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.340
for different projects-- it
actually turns out not to be

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.660
all the that difficult.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.730
It's just a lot of steps.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.980
But at that point, we do have
an empty project set up, at

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.570
this point, that we could
use for writing our app.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.640
This next step is really just
focusing on the sample itself.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.330
So we have two sources here.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.440
We're just going to copy
and paste these over.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.075
First, is our header file.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.200
We're just going to copy and
paste that in, and do the same

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.545
thing for the actual
implementation.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.330
So don't worry too much about
what the content of this file

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.030
is right now.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.510
We're actually going to go,
once we have this working,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.520
walk through a couple of the
critical sections related to

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.090
OAuth and the Drive API to
see what they're doing.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.040
Because this is a generic,
there's a couple placeholder

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.440
values that we do need
to fill in here--

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.690
mostly our client ID and
our client secret.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.510
And these go back to what
we created earlier

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.690
in the API's console.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.780
So we're going to copy this
over, and replace our client

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:10.595
ID, and one more with
our client secret.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.290
And I'm going to make one
other change that's not

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.950
necessary for most people.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.920
But I'm just going to change
this keychain item name,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.010
mostly because I have another
version of this app running.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.140
And I have some saved
credentials in there.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.380
So we'll just make this--

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.375
we'll just add that just to give
us a unique name space in

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:37.870
the keychain.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.380
And if all goes well, and if
I didn't make any mistakes,

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.140
which is quite possible that I
did, we should be able to run

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.160
this on our iPhone simulator.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.180
One thing is, because this
application uses the image

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.170
picker and the camera on the
simulator, you don't actually

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.990
have a camera available
to you.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.180
So it does require that whatever
simulated device

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.700
you're using that you have
some images saved

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.120
in the photo library.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.120
And because of some UI
differences between how the UI

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.435
standards on iPhone versus an
iPad, the way the image picker

00:13:17.435 --> 00:13:20.160
is being used in this way, is
not actually compatible with

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.040
the iPad simulator.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.840
So you actually see this alert
message in here that if you're

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.830
on an iPad on a simulator that's
using an image picker,

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.080
it's just not going to work.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.170
So make sure if you are running
this at home or at

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.410
work, that you do switch
to using the iPhone

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.470
simulator for this.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.810
So hopefully, if everything
went well--

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.670
oh, I did make a mistake
somewhere here.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.270
Now, what did I do wrong?

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.050
All right, I'm not entirely
sure which to step

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.040
I screwed up on.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:21.170
I am going to cheat slightly,
and show you this in another

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.500
window, because I did
set this up earlier.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.430
And rather than doing live
debugging, I would just rather

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.250
show you the actual result.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.700
So I am going to go over to--

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.850
actually, just let
us run this.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.400
And the nice thing is it's
already authenticated.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.190
I'll go back, and I'll change
the keychain name again.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.700
But can see here, you have
the image picker.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.730
These are just some pictures
of my kittens.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.435
That is Oliver.

00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:51.160
I'm going to upload.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.480
And you can ignore this
debug message.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.970
But in just a moment,
this should

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.280
actually upload in Drive.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.720
And we'll get a little
confirmation message that

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.970
everything worked just fine.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.350
And particularly slow today
for some reason.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.790
But the file was saved.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.710
And if you go back here,
we can see the

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.590
file ID for that file.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.110
And I'm going to do
one thing here.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.520
So I'm just going to stop this,
and just change this

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.450
keychain item name again, just
to show the Auth experience.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.910
So let's just change
this to GL.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.720
We'll run.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.080
And this time what we should
see is a signup form.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.130
So this is our login form.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.150
We can go in here.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.920
And we'll just use one
of my test accounts.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.655
Oops, actually, let's
use a different one.

00:16:02.698 --> 00:16:04.340
I have far too many accounts.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.310
All right, one last time here.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.266
I have no idea why I'm having
such a difficult time today.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.090
There we go.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.340
Probably help if I use
the right account.

00:16:58.757 --> 00:16:59.740
There we go.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.280
So we have our Permission
Screen.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.620
This is the Drive Quick Start.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.760
It is [? our ?] email address
and our Drive files.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.410
We'll allow access?

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.020
And now, we're back
to where we are.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.780
And the way this app is written,
it does, basically,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.240
store the refresh token
in the keychain.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.460
So the next time the user comes
along, and uses their

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.589
app, they' don't have
to enter in their

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.000
username and their password.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.750
So let's just go back
and look at a little

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.044
bit of the code here.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:29.070
There's only a couple parts that
are important for working

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.320
with Drive.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.910
The first is the OAuth.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.190
And the second is uploading
the file itself.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:44.380
So let's see if I can zoom
in here a little bit.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.870
So first here is this bit of
code here, where we're

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.830
initializing our Client.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.590
This is basically--

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.070
when the app is loading, the
first thing we want to do is

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.910
just check, did this user
ever log in before?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.190
So what we are using is
the Auth controller.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.790
This is from our Google Toolkit
for Mac, the OAuth

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.780
controller.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.960
And we're just checking to see
whether or not we have

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.380
something in the keychain for
this particular client.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.400
If we do, great.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.350
We can save that authorization,
use it to

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.180
access the API.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.210
Later on, we're going
to check.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.850
And that's going to determine
whether or not we show the

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.860
authorization screen, or jump
right back into the

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.360
application.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.970
So you can actually see that
here, when we're building the

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.070
view, is a check to see
if we're authorized.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.270
That call I'll show
you in a second.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.280
But basically, if we're not,
we're going to push on.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.710
We're going to create an
Auth controller, push

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.030
that onto the ViewStack.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.330
And then go through the
authorization flow.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.140
The nice thing is authorization
with the iOS

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.680
Library-- the Objective-C
Library,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.940
rather, is really simple.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.655
All the UI work is actually just
built into the library.

00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:51.010
So all you really need to do is
create the controller, push

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:55.280
it onto the stack, and just
wait for it to complete.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.740
So let's look at how we
actually create the

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.220
controller.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.980
This code block right here,
basically, we just create and

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.010
initialize.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.920
And here, we just give it a
couple bits of information,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.380
mostly the scope.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.570
In this case, we're
asking for Drive.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.260
It does include the email scope
automatically, unless

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.150
you override that.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.580
But again, just our client ID,
our secret from our API

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.905
console project, an item,
basically, the project name or

00:19:22.905 --> 00:19:26.760
app name for storing the refresh
token in the keychain,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.250
and then, obviously, the
delegators and call backs for

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.780
what happens when this
actually completes.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.380
That's pretty much it
for authentication.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.260
Pretty simple, and you can look
at the full source for

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.730
more details.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.030
The other interesting
part is how do you

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.900
actually upload to Drive?

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.285
That is fairly easy.

00:19:48.285 --> 00:19:51.440
This is this upload photo
method in here.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.790
And you can just see what's
going on here.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.490
First thing, is we're just
creating a file name just by

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.130
taking a Quick Start uploaded
file with a current timestamp,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.950
formatted as a human
readable string.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.000
Create a file.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.650
Set the title, and
the description,

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.350
and the MIME type.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.940
In this case, we're
uploading as PNGs.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.740
We do need to take the image
that we got from the image

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.750
picker, and convert that into
data that we can upload.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.500
So we just get the PNG
representation, use the upload

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.950
parameters to give
it the data.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.450
So you can see upload
with data.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.560
That's the PNG.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.340
MIME type is image
PNG, of course.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.260
And then, the last thing is we
actually just need to build a

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.190
query and execute it.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.030
So it's a GTL Drive query.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.770
The insert method is
query for files.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.860
Insert with object-- a very long
name, but basically, it's

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.020
upload a file.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.790
In short, we give it the data,
along with the metadata, which

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.410
is the title and description.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.150
Execute and our completion
handler doesn't really do all

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.800
that much, other than just
change our status message from

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.620
waiting to done, and logs
out the actual file ID.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.730
And of course, if there is an
error, you want to handle

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.120
those conditions gracefully
and so on.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.770
The rest of the coding here is
mostly just plumbing for the

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:16.980
UI, a weight indicator, an alert
message, working with

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.560
the photo picker for iOS.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.850
But really, the key parts to
focus on for working with

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.910
Drive are the sections around
creating the Auth controller

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.680
and the sections for
uploading a photo.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.710
So that's it.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.880
I'm not entirely sure where
in the Quick Start--

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.770
I didn't get quite right
in this new project.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:38.880
I'll try to figure
it out later.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.940
But not to take up too much
time on today's broadcast

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.670
we're just going to
leave it as is.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.790
But I do encourage people
to try it out if you are

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.530
interested in using the
Drive SDK on iOS.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.080
Hopefully, this is a
valuable example.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.350
If there are other things that
you would like us to do in

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.620
these examples, other
concepts, certainly

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.220
reach out to us.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.570
One thing that's really
important--

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.000
and this is a great resource for
everyone who is watching

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.950
or may watch this in the
future-- is we do have a new

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.340
community on Google+.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.750
This is our official Google
Drive Developers community.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.260
So you can find it if you just
search communities for Google

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.500
Drive Developers.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.400
You should find it.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.120
You're all welcome to join.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.640
We're very active there.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.750
It's got a surprising number
of people already.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.580
It's only been up for a few
days, I think since Friday.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.970
But everyone is encouraged
to join and participate.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.110
Let us know what you're
working on.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.370
If you have any particular
great tips or tricks

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.690
to share, post them.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.810
Feature requests
and the APIs--

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.420
we'd love to hear about them.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.630
One thing is, it is not a
general forum for discussing

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.460
Drive features.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.660
It is really focused on the
SDK and topics that are of

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.360
interest to developers building
on Google Drive.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.090
But I really look forward
to people join up.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.930
And it's really up to you guys
to make sure that is a healthy

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.740
and vibrant community.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.910
We'll certainly post some
interesting stuff ourselves.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.120
But really it's an opportunity
for you guys to speak up and

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.430
let us know what's
important to you.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.270
So that's it for today.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.350
And hopefully, you found
this helpful.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.800
And if you do have any feedback
you can find us on

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.260
Stack Overflow or in the
new Google+ community.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.510
Thanks.

00:23:35.235 --> 00:24:04.700
