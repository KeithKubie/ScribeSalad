from science but this does not just

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310
from science but this does not just
 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.070

have got our values wrong if we get our
 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.390
have got our values wrong if we get our
values right then the technology and the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400
values right then the technology and the
 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.199
values right then the technology and the

final thing that's so what we're doing
here is a phylogenetic tree there are

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:23.569
here is a phylogenetic tree there are
 

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.079
here is a phylogenetic tree there are
10,000 of those published each year each

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.089
10,000 of those published each year each
 

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:30.970
10,000 of those published each year each
costs several thousand CPU hours and so

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:30.980
costs several thousand CPU hours and so
 

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.919
costs several thousand CPU hours and so
it's probably of the order of hundreds

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:32.929
it's probably of the order of hundreds
 

00:17:32.929 --> 00:17:34.630
it's probably of the order of hundreds
of millions of dollars spent on it and

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640
of millions of dollars spent on it and
 

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.090
of millions of dollars spent on it and
that is all the data you get just a

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:37.100
that is all the data you get just a
 

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.760
that is all the data you get just a
picture on a bit of paper no data no

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:39.770
picture on a bit of paper no data no
 

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.700

nothing so what Amy does is actually to

nothing so what Amy does is actually to
 

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.250
nothing so what Amy does is actually to
'extract that into structured XML it's

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:45.260

been a lot of work and it's not finished

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:48.800
been a lot of work and it's not finished
 

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.620
been a lot of work and it's not finished
yet if you want to join that's fine but

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:50.630
yet if you want to join that's fine but
 

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.510
yet if you want to join that's fine but
we can read the literature into

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520
we can read the literature into
 

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.270
we can read the literature into
semantics form if the publishers don't

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280
semantics form if the publishers don't
 

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.490
semantics form if the publishers don't
stop us but the publishers have been

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:57.500
stop us but the publishers have been
 

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.370
stop us but the publishers have been
dragging their feet every time we

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:00.380
dragging their feet every time we
 

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.440

half my time fighting we're fighting in

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.150
half my time fighting we're fighting in
 

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.820
half my time fighting we're fighting in
Europe because the publishers trying to

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:11.830
Europe because the publishers trying to
 

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.090

take tie-down text mining so the final

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.100
take tie-down text mining so the final
 

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.590
take tie-down text mining so the final
thing is what should we do well we're

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600
thing is what should we do well we're
 

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.660
thing is what should we do well we're
