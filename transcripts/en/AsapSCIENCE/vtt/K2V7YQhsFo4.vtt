This episode is supported by hims.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.870
With over three million Americans having used steroids, the desire to bulk up is strong

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:14.309
But what even happens to your body when you take steroids and are there major risks to performance-enhancing drugs?

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
Every time you pump a weight at the gym your muscles experience damage,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.590
but the body recovers by forming new muscle protein strands to repair the muscle fibers.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.310
Over time these strands increase in thickness and number and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.510
ultimately if muscle protein synthesis is greater than muscle protein breakdown

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.400
your muscles will grow.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.590
The degree of growth is largely regulated by testosterone, which increases protein synthesis.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.989
It's why, generally, men have larger muscle mass than women as they have higher levels of testosterone.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.660
Now steroids are any compound with a specific 4-carbon ring structure, so the term

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.169
steroid actually includes some chemicals that can be used to treat fever and headaches and even sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.038
But the type of steroid we'll be looking at actually mimic natural

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.659
testosterone with the intention to enhance performance and are used by more than

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.460
15% of gym-goers.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.200
Within a single day of taking steroids the expression of your genes will begin to change.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.979
Steroids easily enter your cells and bind to the androgen receptor. At this point they can move into the nucleus and attach to your DNA,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.339
which activates hundreds of genes to increase protein synthesis, while slowing protein breakdown.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.587
In the end, people who take steroids can have three to five times more nuclei in some muscle cells.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:29.939
Steroids can also stop the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.620
differentiation of fat stem cells and decrease a person's body fat.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.530
Days in and your quickly increasing muscle size and strength,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.459
while also protecting muscle fibers against damage, making steroids ideal for exercise tolerance and recovery as well.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.089
But continue to take them and your behavior may start to change.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.799
Because steroid receptors are found in parts of our central nervous system like the forebrain,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.901
hypothalamus and pituitary gland, steroids can lead to the classic roid rage.

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.449
A study of athletes taking steroids showed

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.759
20% developed higher manic and depressive

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.340
scores than non-users.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.660
Mice given steroids over ten weeks also become more aggressive towards other mice put in the same cages.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.539
Male mice also become more dominant and are more willing to compete for sex with female mice.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.080
But that sex drive may not translate to better sex.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.339
For female users

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.690
steroids can interfere with the estrus cycle and may decrease sexual drive.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.929
Masculinization can occur as well with female users gaining deeper voices and starting to grow more body and facial hair.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.789
Male users may experience sperm cell abnormalities and decreased sperm count.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.609
Steroids also decreased natural production of hormones that are necessary for maintaining testicular size,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.240
meaning your balls will shrink.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.539
And since most steroid users follow a cycle of on and off dosing periods

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.708
natural levels of testosterone can be quite low at times causing erectile dysfunction and decreased libido in males.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.369
40% of male users also developed enlarged breast tissue, as steroids break down into estradiol,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.460
which stimulates the growth of mammary tissue.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.569
Finally steroids can cause a high level of acne in almost half of users and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.920
increase the risk of heart disease and stroke

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.829
So yes, steroids will make you bulk up faster and improve your athletic ability,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.679
but as with most things, comes with a set of risks and side effects that you'll likely experience as well.

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.200
