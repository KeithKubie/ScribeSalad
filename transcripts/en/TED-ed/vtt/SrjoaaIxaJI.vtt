00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:18.791
Welcome to the Department of Plagiarism Investigation.

00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.653
The D.P.I. has dealt with numerous complex cases

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:24.010
in their effort to bring plagiarists to justice

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.348
and to rescue purloined texts.

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:27.942
The first form of plagiarism

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:30.187
that the D.P.I. regularly encounters

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:32.314
is known as brain child snatching,

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:34.399
in honor of the Latin word, plagiarius,

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.400
from which plagiarism originates.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.082
Brain child snatchers sneak up on innocent papers

00:00:39.082 --> 00:00:40.237
and copy and paste them

00:00:40.237 --> 00:00:41.989
without citing any sources,

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.176
putting quotation marks around direct quotes

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.867
or changing a word.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:47.787
They've also been known to steal and hold

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:51.025
particularly eloquent essays for ransom.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:53.208
When brain child snatchers get together,

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:54.957
they form a kidnapping ring,

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:56.461
which involves brain child snatching

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.296
from multiple sources.

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.215
Some perpetrators have even been known

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:01.967
to commit self-plagiarism,

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:05.388
one of the laziest crimes in the annals of the D.P.I.

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:07.704
Also known as one-sided collaborators,

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:09.809
these odd balls snatch up entire texts

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:12.306
or small passages that they've written before

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.854
and present them as brand-new material.

00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:16.674
Brain child snatchers and kidnapping rings

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:18.718
are easy for the D.P.I. to catch.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:21.157
Just paste a few passages into a search engine,

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:21.825
and BAM!

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:23.633
They're caught red-handed.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.269
The more covert forms of plagiarism

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:27.640
include the wild goose chase technique,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.971
in which plagiarists create fake authors,

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.757
book titles,

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:31.566
page numbers,

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.736
or other information

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:34.674
in order to cover up plagiarism.

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:36.668
And the old synonym switcheroo

00:01:36.668 --> 00:01:38.602
in which plagiarists utilize a thesaurus

00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:39.874
as their main weapon.

00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:41.143
By substituting a synonym

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:42.913
for nearly every word in the document

00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:44.331
and leaving the sentence structure

00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:46.495
and order of the ideas the same,

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.211
plagiarists give legitimate paraphrasing

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:49.666
a very bad name.

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.668
Shoddy paraphrasing is also a key part

00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:53.796
of variations on a smokescreen,

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:55.504
a technique in which multiple passages

00:01:55.504 --> 00:01:56.512
are paraphrased,

00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:00.266
then pasted together into one.

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.588
The thorniest issue that the D.P.I. deals with

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:03.850
is the misconception

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.842
that you can never be accused of plagiarism

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:08.229
if you use quotes and cite your sources.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.552
This is most certainly not the case

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:11.942
because a paper that is made up

00:02:11.942 --> 00:02:14.707
of passage upon passage of other people's ideas

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:16.998
is known as a wholly quotable document.

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:18.164
This is considered plagiarism

00:02:18.164 --> 00:02:21.398
since there are no original thoughts in the work.

00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:23.294
Similarly, passage after passage

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:26.623
of too closely paraphrased text from multiple cited sources

00:02:26.623 --> 00:02:30.078
is also plagiarism of the pervasively paraphrased kind

00:02:30.078 --> 00:02:33.545
because the ideas still aren't one's own.

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:36.818
And lastly, the technique of revealing while concealing

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:39.499
is plagiarism because it involves selective amnesia

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:40.962
regarding one's sources

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:43.104
in an attempt to cover up wholly quotable

00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:46.067
and pervasively paraphrased issues in a text.

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.485
Some passages are meticulously documented,

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:49.109
quoted,

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.129
or paraphrased,

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.862
while others are presented entirely as one's own.

00:02:53.862 --> 00:02:56.495
As you can see, the D.P.I. has its hands full,

00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:59.372
tackling all sorts of academic mischief and mayhem,

00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:02.375
ranging from the petty to the outrageous.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.515
Given the gravity of these transgressions,

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:06.431
you might be wondering why you've never heard

00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:09.610
of the Department of Plagiarism Investigation's victories.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.132
That's because it doesn't technically exist.

00:03:12.132 --> 00:03:15.467
But people, like you and me, can be our own D.P.I. agents

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:16.629
to fight plagiarism

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.306
and uphold the values of original thinking.

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:21.951
We know that the best defense against plagiarism

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.774
consists of writers who save themselves

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:25.381
time, worry, and effort

00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:27.020
by taking the far easier road

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.524
of just doing the work themselves.
