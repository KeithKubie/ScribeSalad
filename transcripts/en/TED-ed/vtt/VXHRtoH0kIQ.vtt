00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:09.188
If I were to distill the 20 years of elephant research

00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:10.623
that I've done

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:12.583
into one sentence,

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:14.047
what would it be?

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.713
What could I tell you?

00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:19.675
I would say that elephants are just like us!

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:21.308
And what do I mean by that?

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:23.428
It takes a lot of patience

00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:24.596
to be out there in the field

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:26.012
and trying to figure out patterns

00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:28.973
of these very slow and intelligent animals.

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:33.439
But over time, it is true they are very similar to us.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.390
And you think, "Well, how can I say that?

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.862
Look, they have huge ears,

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:38.806
they have really long noses.

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:40.388
What do you mean they're like us?"

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:44.308
Well, in fact, their families are very similar to ours.

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:47.743
And family is extremely important to elephants.

00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:50.579
They grow up in very tight-knit families

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.083
and they have extended families.

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:54.916
And it's just like our family reunions

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:57.087
where you have all the aunts gathering around

00:00:57.087 --> 00:00:59.138
with all the food they're going to bring and plan,

00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:00.339
and all the boys are thinking,

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.166
"Are we going to play our video games together?

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.762
Are we going to spar?"

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.554
It's very, very similar,

00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:09.640
and it's jubilant, and screaming, yelling, it's really amazing to see.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.815
But, as soon as you get that family gathering,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:14.686
it's just like a wedding or anything else,

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:17.315
all of the sudden the family politics come out,

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:20.111
and the lower-ranking individuals in this scene,

00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:22.282
you see the arrow off to the back,

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.651
the lower-ranking individuals already know their station,

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.284
they're going to drink at the muddiest part of the pan

00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:30.984
because the whole family's here and we can't drink at the best water

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:34.399
because that's reserved for the top-ranking family.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.835
What's also very similar

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:38.335
is that you have elders in the group

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:40.087
that everyone reveres.

00:01:40.087 --> 00:01:41.483
This is the matriarch,

00:01:41.483 --> 00:01:43.383
and the other female is reaching over

00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:45.176
and doing what's called a trunk to mouth

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:46.843
placing her trunk in the mouth,

00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:48.346
and it's a sign of respect,

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:50.650
it's kind of like a handshake,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.600
but it's also like a salute.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.853
And this salute is learned at a very young age.

00:01:55.853 --> 00:01:58.692
Now, ritual and bonding within the family

00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:01.982
also facilitates coordinated activities.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:05.697
So, here's a young female whose calf has fallen into the trough

00:02:05.697 --> 00:02:07.816
and she doesn't know what to do and she panics.

00:02:07.816 --> 00:02:10.360
Well, the older female, that's the matriarch,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.702
she says, "No problem here," she just scoops the baby out.

00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:16.541
Now, that's not true for a lot of different families,

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:18.483
they can't coordinate very well,

00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:20.753
the younger females don't really know what to do,

00:02:20.753 --> 00:02:22.905
but the older ones will just get down,

00:02:22.905 --> 00:02:26.048
kneel down together and pick the baby out.

00:02:26.048 --> 00:02:27.639
Another thing that's very similar

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.925
is the coming of age of teenage boys.

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.838
Male elephants at the age of about 12 to 15.

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:36.755
The biggest elephant in this photograph here

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.731
is an elephant who's about the leave the family.

00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.004
He gets too big, he gets a little fresh,

00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:44.088
the adult females had enough of him,

00:02:44.088 --> 00:02:45.445
but he also is independent,

00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:48.366
he wants to go out and play with the guys.

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:51.950
So what happens then is that you have this all male society,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.839
very ritual male society.

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.172
Greg is our main dominant bull here,

00:02:56.172 --> 00:02:57.456
you can see him in the middle.

00:02:57.456 --> 00:03:01.670
He's got a huge posse, his following reveres him.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.296
And it's very interesting how very good leaders,

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:05.927
very good dominant individuals

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:09.337
know how to titrate the carrot and the stick.

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.137
This guy's a master at it,

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:12.503
and there's other bullies out there

00:03:12.503 --> 00:03:14.978
that want to kind of want to create their own little following,

00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:17.254
but they can't do it because they're too agressive.

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:19.088
And so when he's not around

00:03:19.088 --> 00:03:22.606
they try and sweet talk the underlings to come into their fold,

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.421
and they actually become less agressive.

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.672
So it's very interesting to see how politics play out

00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:32.837
in these male and female societies.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.619
Now back to the ladies here.

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.587
In a core family group you'll have a mother,

00:03:37.587 --> 00:03:39.041
maybe even a grandmother,

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.927
her daughters and all of their offspring,

00:03:40.927 --> 00:03:43.254
the male and female calves.

00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:44.923
And what's very interesting here

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:47.466
is that how character makes a difference.

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:50.467
So each matriarch has a very different character.

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:52.588
These two characters are kind of curious,

00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:54.389
they're uncertain,

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.726
whereas these other two characters are really agressive.

00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:01.475
"We're going to charge first, ask questions later."

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.928
But then there are also matriarchs that say,

00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:05.678
"Forget it! I'm going to run first

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.307
and then figure it out when we're in the bush

00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:08.520
and it's safe."

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.140
But the wisest matriarch,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.267
the matriarchs that succeed best

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:14.604
in all of the studies that have been done,

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:17.106
is the one that assesses the danger

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:20.140
and decides is this worth running away from

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.278
or is this not a big deal at all.

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:25.866
Now being social is super important for elephants

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:28.116
and of course right at the beginning,

00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:30.036
just like early childhood development,

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:32.165
socialization is very important.

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:35.001
Bathing together, eating together, playing together,

00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:37.502
rough housing, this is all very important

00:04:37.502 --> 00:04:39.057
for social development.

00:04:39.057 --> 00:04:40.807
And who hasn't tried to beat their sibling

00:04:40.807 --> 00:04:44.473
to the head of the line coming into the water hole?

00:04:44.473 --> 00:04:48.389
And these relationships from the beginning

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.558
is just like best friends forever for real.

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:53.557
These females are going to live together for life.

00:04:53.557 --> 00:04:56.724
Now if it's a male, female they might know each other for life,

00:04:56.724 --> 00:05:00.307
but it's really important to develop those bonds early on.

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:03.639
Those are the relationships that are going to save you later.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.224
I'll show you a little schoolyard scenario here.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:10.244
Where, I think if you just focus on what's happening here

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:13.056
you can see that we have the bully,

00:05:13.056 --> 00:05:16.249
he's pulling on the trunk of this baby calf,

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.125
and then we have the diplomat

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:19.306
who's reaching over and saying,

00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:21.388
"No, don't do that! Stop doing that!"

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.798
And then, of course, we have the bystander.

00:05:23.798 --> 00:05:25.724
And how do you get these three different characters

00:05:25.724 --> 00:05:28.058
within the family?

00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:30.513
It's kind of fascinating to think that elephants

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:32.266
really are just like us.

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:34.104
And so I got curious about this

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:37.605
and I thought, "Well, what if you measure

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:41.900
the difference in character of a dominant female's calf

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.419
versus a lower-ranking female's calf,

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.364
and see what happens in their growing up."

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:49.850
And so we started doing this.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.450
And you can see this little guy with his ears out,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.326
really charging at you.

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:55.121
The difference between that character

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.335
and the character who holds back,

00:05:57.335 --> 00:05:59.168
wants to touch mom,

00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:00.835
isn't so certain about what's going on here.

00:06:00.835 --> 00:06:03.672
But the other one's charging ahead all confident.

00:06:03.672 --> 00:06:06.624
Well, we started measuring how far away

00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:09.123
a calf will stray from mom,

00:06:09.123 --> 00:06:10.763
how often do they touch others,

00:06:10.763 --> 00:06:12.624
how often do they initiate play,

00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:16.642
and then look at the dominance of the females, of their mothers.

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:21.188
And what we found is that socializing with the dominant calves

00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:24.707
actually socialize more significantly more than the lower-ranking calves.

00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:26.903
And what it looks like is

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:29.863
it's not that the lower-ranking calves don't want to play,

00:06:29.863 --> 00:06:31.616
they're actually not allowed to interact

00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:33.207
with the higher-ranking calves.

00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:36.162
They get swatted away from the dominant females.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.164
and so this is kind of the downside of,

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:40.165
okay we are very much like elephants,

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:42.128
elephants are as much like us,

00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:44.847
but it's kind of for better or for worse

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:47.268
because I can also see this happening in humans

00:06:47.268 --> 00:06:50.294
and maybe we should take a lesson from that.

00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:51.796
One last thing that we found

00:06:51.796 --> 00:06:54.358
is that the males will be the risk-takers,

00:06:54.358 --> 00:06:55.734
they're more independent

00:06:55.734 --> 00:06:58.694
and they're more likely to spend more time away from mom.

00:06:58.694 --> 00:07:00.905
And that's very true in human societies

00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:03.294
and with other social animals.

00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:04.867
So I hope I've convinced you

00:07:04.867 --> 00:07:07.794
that we have very similar lives to elephants

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:11.999
and that elephants have very individual, durable

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:14.252
characters that we've measured across years.

00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:16.251
The bully always tends to be the bully

00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.174
unless there's some kind of social upset,

00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:20.544
and he decides he better be a softy

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:23.678
or else he's not going to gain favor at all.

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:25.427
And then you have the gentle giants

00:07:25.427 --> 00:07:27.265
that are always going to be gentle.

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:30.128
The young males really need mentoring from the elders,

00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:33.313
and those gentle giants are very good at doing that,

00:07:33.313 --> 00:07:35.229
soliciting them.

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.151
Leaving family is a really hard things for the males,

00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:42.489
but they survive and they figure out who to hang out with.

00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:45.450
So, just to end here, I just wanted to say that

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.451
since they are so similar to us,

00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:48.710
and have these characters,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.662
I hope when you see them on TV

00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:53.084
or you go out and you're lucky enough to see them in the wild,

00:07:53.084 --> 00:07:54.546
that maybe you'll think of them

00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:57.605
as individual characters deserving of our attention,

00:07:57.605 --> 00:08:01.111
and also deserving of our protection. Thank you.
