00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
 

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.249
We already know a little
bit about random variables.

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:05.790
What we're going to
see in this video

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.300
is that random variables
come in two varieties.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.260
You have discrete
random variables,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.450
and you have continuous
random variables.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.120
 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.870
And discrete random
variables, these

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.411
are essentially
random variables that

00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:23.220
can take on distinct
or separate values.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.750
And we'll give examples
of that in a second.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.040
So that comes straight from the
meaning of the word discrete

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:39.380
in the English language--
distinct or separate values.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.636
While continuous-- and I
guess just another definition

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:43.510
for the word discrete
in the English language

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.400
would be polite, or not
obnoxious, or kind of subtle.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.260
That is not what
we're talking about.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.676
We are not talking about random
variables that are polite.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:55.760
We're talking about ones that
can take on distinct values.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.990
And continuous random
variables, they

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.670
can take on any
value in a range.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490
And that range could
even be infinite.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.285
So any value in an interval.

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:10.500
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
So with those two
definitions out of the way,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.444
let's look at some actual
random variable definitions.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.610
And I want to think together
about whether you would

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.590
classify them as discrete or
continuous random variables.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.890
So let's say that I have a
random variable capital X.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.254
And it is equal to--
well, this is one

00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:35.670
that we covered
in the last video.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.030
It's 1 if my fair coin is heads.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.690
It's 0 if my fair coin is tails.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.370
So is this a discrete or a
continuous random variable?

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.580
Well, this random
variable right over here

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.280
can take on distinctive values.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.111
It can take on either a 1
or it could take on a 0.

00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:57.610
Another way to think
about it is you

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.700
can count the number
of different values

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.380
it can take on.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.030
This is the first
value it can take on,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.580
this is the second value
that it can take on.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.625
So this is clearly a
discrete random variable.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.320
 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.460
Let's think about another one.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.260
Let's define random
variable Y as

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:35.720
equal to the mass of a random
animal selected at the New

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.820
Orleans zoo, where I
grew up, the Audubon Zoo.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.480
 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.920
Y is the mass of a random animal
selected at the New Orleans

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.420
zoo.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.710
Is this a discrete
random variable

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.380
or a continuous random variable?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.690
Well, the exact mass--
and I should probably

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.150
put that qualifier here.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.900
I'll even add it here just to
make it really, really clear.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.920
The exact mass of a random
animal, or a random object

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.590
in our universe, it can take on
any of a whole set of values.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.180
I mean, who knows
exactly the exact number

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.390
of electrons that are
part of that object

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.920
right at that moment?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.060
Who knows the
neutrons, the protons,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.540
the exact number of
molecules in that object,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.360
or a part of that animal
exactly at that moment?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.990
So that mass, for
example, at the zoo,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.700
it might take on a value
anywhere between-- well,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.370
maybe close to 0.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.690
There's no animal
that has 0 mass.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.760
But it could be close to zero,
if we're thinking about an ant,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.310
or we're thinking
about a dust mite,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.740
or maybe if you consider
even a bacterium an animal.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.550
I believe bacterium is
the singular of bacteria.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.770
And it could go all the way.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.140
Maybe the most massive
animal in the zoo

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.612
is the elephant of some kind.

00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:55.570
And I don't know what it
would be in kilograms,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.778
but it would be fairly large.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.990
So maybe you can
get up all the way

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.490
to 3,000 kilograms,
or probably larger.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.930
Let's say 5,000 kilograms.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.350
I don't know what the mass of a
very heavy elephant-- or a very

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.570
massive elephant, I
should say-- actually is.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.730
It may be something
fun for you to look at.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.920
But any animal could have a
mass anywhere in between here.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.470
It does not take
on discrete values.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:32.800
You could have an animal that
is exactly maybe 123.75921

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.344
kilograms.

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:35.760
And even there, that actually
might not be the exact mass.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.801
You might have to get even
more precise, --10732.

00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:43.260
0, 7, And I think
you get the picture.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
Even though this is the
way I've defined it now,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.310
a finite interval, you can take
on any value in between here.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.700
They are not discrete values.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.800
So this one is clearly a
continuous random variable.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.980
 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.940
Let's think about another one.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.630
Let's think about-- let's say
that random variable Y, instead

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.620
of it being this, let's say it's
the year that a random student

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.740
in the class was born.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:25.080
 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.730
Is this a discrete or a
continuous random variable?

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.620
Well, that year, you
literally can define it

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.470
as a specific discrete year.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:45.420
It could be 1992, or it could
be 1985, or it could be 2001.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.900
There are discrete values
that this random variable

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.820
can actually take on.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.145
It won't be able to take on
any value between, say, 2000

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:55.970
and 2001.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.280
It'll either be 2000 or
it'll be 2001 or 2002.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.000
Once again, you can count
the values it can take on.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.060
Most of the times that
you're dealing with,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.175
as in the case right here,
a discrete random variable--

00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:11.800
let me make it clear
this one over here

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.840
is also a discrete
random variable.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.340
Most of the time
that you're dealing

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.140
with a discrete random
variable, you're

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.340
probably going to be dealing
with a finite number of values.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.400
But it does not have to be
a finite number of values.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.775
You can actually have an
infinite potential number

00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:30.150
of values that it
could take on--

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.200
as long as the
values are countable.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.905
As long as you
can literally say,

00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:35.780
OK, this is the first
value it could take on,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.710
the second, the third.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.734
And you might be counting
forever, but as long

00:06:38.734 --> 00:06:40.150
as you can literally
list-- and it

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.441
could be even an infinite list.

00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:43.900
But if you can list the
values that it could take on,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.390
then you're dealing with a
discrete random variable.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.910
Notice in this
scenario with the zoo,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.281
you could not list all
of the possible masses.

00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.530
You could not even count them.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.460
You might attempt to--
and it's a fun exercise

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.730
to try at least
once, to try to list

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.420
all of the values
this might take on.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.795
You might say,
OK, maybe it could

00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:05.179
take on 0.01 and maybe 0.02.

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:07.470
But wait, you just skipped
an infinite number of values

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.510
that it could take on, because
it could have taken on 0.011,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.857
0.012.

00:07:12.857 --> 00:07:14.940
And even between those,
there's an infinite number

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.064
of values it could take on.

00:07:16.064 --> 00:07:18.880
There's no way for you to
count the number of values

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.950
that a continuous random
variable can take on.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.750
There's no way for
you to list them.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.220
With a discrete random variable,
you can count the values.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.670
You can list the values.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.590
Let's do another example.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.540
Let's let random
variable Z, capital Z,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:47.095
be the number ants born
tomorrow in the universe.

00:07:47.095 --> 00:07:48.720
Now, you're probably
arguing that there

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.780
aren't ants on other planets.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.580
Or maybe there are
ant-like creatures,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.710
but they're not going to
be ants as we define them.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.910
But how do we know?

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.300
So number of ants
born in the universe.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.030
Maybe some ants have figured
out interstellar travel

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.290
of some kind.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.660
So the number of ants born
tomorrow in the universe.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.940
That's my random variable Z. Is
this a discrete random variable

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.420
or a continuous random variable?

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.572
Well, once again, we
can count the number

00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:16.780
of values this could take on.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:17.420
This could be 1.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.003
It could be 2.

00:08:18.003 --> 00:08:18.660
It could be 3.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.310
It could be 4.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.867
It could be 5 quadrillion ants.

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.200
It could be 5 quadrillion and 1.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.574
We can actually
count the values.

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:25.280
Those values are discrete.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.800
So once again, this
right over here

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.970
is a discrete random variable.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.740
This is fun, so let's
keep doing more of these.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.559
Let's say that I have
random variable X.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.000
So we're not using this
definition anymore.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.680
Now I'm going to define
random variable X

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.580
to be the winning time-- now
let me write it this way.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:09:02.660
The exact winning time for
the men's 100-meter dash

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.700
at the 2016 Olympics.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.860
So the exact time that it took
for the winner-- who's probably

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.184
going to be Usain Bolt,
but it might not be.

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:14.600
Actually, he's
aging a little bit.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.700
But whatever the exact
winning time for the men's

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.940
100-meter in the 2016 Olympics.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.200
And not the one that you
necessarily see on the clock.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.660
The exact, the
precise time that you

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.610
would see at the
men's 100-meter dash.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.885
Is this a discrete or a
continuous random variable?

00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:35.510
Well, the way I've defined, and
this one's a little bit tricky.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.820
Because you might
say it's countable.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.320
You might say, well,
it could either

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:45.852
be 956, 9.56 seconds, or 9.57
seconds, or 9.58 seconds.

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:47.310
And you might be
tempted to believe

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.980
that, because when you watch the
100-meter dash at the Olympics,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.990
they measure it to the
nearest hundredths.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.650
They round to the
nearest hundredth.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.180
That's how precise
their timing is.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.000
But I'm talking about the exact
winning time, the exact number

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.610
of seconds it takes
for that person

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.000
to, from the starting gun,
to cross the finish line.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.090
And there, it can
take on any value.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.520
It can take on any
value between-- well,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.640
I guess they're limited
by the speed of light.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.060
But it could take on any
value you could imagine.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:22.620
It might be anywhere between 5
seconds and maybe 12 seconds.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.140
And it could be anywhere
in between there.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.884
It might not be 9.57.

00:10:26.884 --> 00:10:28.300
That might be what
the clock says,

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.120
but in reality the exact
winning time could be 9.571,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.500
or it could be 9.572359.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.450
I think you see what I'm saying.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.170
The exact precise time could
be any value in an interval.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:50.070
So this right over here is a
continuous random variable.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.090
Now what would be
the case, instead

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.880
of saying the
exact winning time,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.970
if instead I defined X to be the
winning time of the men's 100

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:09.051
meter dash at the 2016
Olympics rounded to the nearest

00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:09.550
hundredth?

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.480
 

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.494
Is this a discrete or a
continuous random variable?

00:11:15.494 --> 00:11:16.410
So let me delete this.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.490
I've changed the
random variable now.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.090
Is this going to
be a discrete or

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.810
a continuous random variable?

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.987
Well now, we can actually
count the actual values

00:11:25.987 --> 00:11:27.570
that this random
variable can take on.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.270
It might be 9.56.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.780
It could be 9.57.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.370
It could be 9.58.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.540
We can actually list them.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.109
So in this case, when we round
it to the nearest hundredth,

00:11:37.109 --> 00:11:38.400
we can actually list of values.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:47.670
We are now dealing with a
discrete random variable.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.230
Anyway, I'll let you go there.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.090
Hopefully this gives you
a sense of the distinction

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.330
between discrete and
continuous random variables.
