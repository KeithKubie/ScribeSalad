00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Today's video is sponsored
by World of Warships.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.880
What's it like
to have over a gallon

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.500
of hand sanitizer at once?

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.300
And what happens

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.450
if you heat it up
to the point of boiling?

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.820
Today, we're going to find out.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.440
[Music]

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.700
Guys, most people only use hand
sanitizer in small quantities.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.860
Fortunately, they sell
these refill packs

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.720
that are pretty big.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.120
We want to see
what happens to hand sanitizer

00:00:29.138 --> 00:00:30.000
if it heats up,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.340
and not just a little bit at
a time, a lot of it at a time.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.620
It does say on the bottle,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.580
"Flammable. Keep away
from fire or flame."

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.320
We're not going to do that.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.280
We're going to play
around with this.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:42.418
We're going to try
a few different things with it.

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:43.100
And in the end,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.200
I think we're going to end up
with over a gallon

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.120
of hand sanitizer
in this pot on a stove.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.400
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.280
We have about a gallon
and a half of hand sanitizer.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.500
We're going to put
that in a pot,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.800
put that pot on the stove,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.500
turn it on,
and see what happens.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.950
So this is hand sanitizer.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.320
It's usually used for killing
germs on your hand,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.099
so you just need like
a little drop about that size.

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:04.954
It is way too cold
to be doing that.

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:06.836
Yeah, it does evaporate quickly.

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:08.047
There's actually steam...

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:08.701
There it is.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:09.737
Coming off of that.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.700
Now, I feel like I
have super powers.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.900
So as it does that,
this is 63% ethyl alcohol,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.720
and that kills the germs
on your hands.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.900
And that's a really
good use for it.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.560
But we're going to be using it
for some other stuff today,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.680
because ethyl alcohol
is flammable.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.600
Before we do the whole
gallon at once,

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.795
let's do a few
smaller scale things.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.302
I want to see just
how flammable this is.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.779
Flammable test.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.900
[Music]

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.420
Ah.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.300
Ah, yes.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:52.980
[Music]

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.120
So it doesn't
burn super quickly,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.480
it doesn't burn super hot,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.300
and as you can see we're able
to leave it on her hands

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.440
for a few seconds without
causing any real problems.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.140
We just burned off
some of the alcohol,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.020
so it's now a higher percentage
of water and glycerin,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.440
and less percent of alcohol.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:19.220
[Music]

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.260
More.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.760
[Music]

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.940
Yes.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:40.220
[Music]

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.314
You know those,
those happy birthday candles,

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:44.550
the trick candles
that keep relighting,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.620
this is worse.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.100
[Music]

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.940
Aha!

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.640
[Music]

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.560
Now that the alcohol
has burned off,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.360
this smells amazing.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.820
It's kind of perfumey now,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.680
like I knew some hand sanitizers
had perfumes in them.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.638
This is about as
bland as you can get,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.700
but I think we might
be smelling the what?

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.692
The aloe vera in it, maybe?

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:11.769
Well, we've played

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.043
with small amounts
of it at a time now,

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:15.300
I think we need more.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.660
[Music]

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.940
Don't cross the streams.

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:20.742
Crossed.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:21.960
Don't cross the streams.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.240
Universe is broken now.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:31.260
[Music]

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.240
Whoo.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.260
That's chilly.

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:35.988
Now, it does look cool though.

00:03:35.988 --> 00:03:37.900
It looks like my hand
is just like encased.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.614
Wow.

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:40.964
Yeah, it looks like you,
you resin do your hand.

00:03:40.964 --> 00:03:41.764
Yeah.

00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:43.560
When things evaporate
off of our skin,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.840
they take heat with them.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.355
And if something
evaporates faster,

00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:49.023
it's taking more heat away.

00:03:49.023 --> 00:03:51.736
Alcohol will evaporate faster
than water will,

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:55.174
and so it will leave your skin
feeling cold very quickly.

00:03:55.174 --> 00:03:58.307
Even more so, for instance,
acetone will do that.

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:00.580
Because acetone
evaporates even faster

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.340
than this diluted alcohol.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.300
[Music]

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.200
All right, there's adding heat.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.920
Cool.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.660
And now we run.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.840
That's over a gallon,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.150
so it's going to take a while
before I think we see anything,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.500
but I don't think it's a good
idea to be in here with that.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.800
Just in case so...

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.920
We're gonna skedaddle,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.820
and let the cameras
do their thing.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.540
While we're waiting
for that to boil,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.500
let's talk about our sponsor
for today's video,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.780
World of Warships.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.650
Guys, this game is freaking fun.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.740
We've all downloaded it
onto our computers.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.980
We kind of binge at it all morning.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.500
I kicked his butt.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.000
&gt;&gt; No. Maybe.
&gt;&gt; You guys should play it too.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.420
The game is free to play.

00:04:42.423 --> 00:04:44.850
It's a great balance
of action and strategy.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.614
You've got a naval fleet
that you're commanding.

00:04:47.614 --> 00:04:50.250
You're driving those
around fighting other people,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.895
and they're all based on like
real iconic historical warships,

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:55.186
which is pretty cool.

00:04:55.186 --> 00:04:57.149
As you play,
you unlock new ships.

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:58.713
You can just grow your fleet.

00:04:58.713 --> 00:05:01.250
Start taking over,
dominate the Seven Seas.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.526
The gameplay is pretty detailed.

00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:04.089
One of the things I
think is the coolest

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:05.559
that weather will
affect the game.

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.299
If you've got wind
blowing towards you,

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:09.428
then it's harder to move
through the water.

00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:11.050
Your maneuverability is changed.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.813
Where your shots land is going
to move with the wind as well,

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.300
so you have to learn to take
those things into account.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.947
It's not just point
and shoot like some games.

00:05:18.947 --> 00:05:19.747
Gotcha!

00:05:19.747 --> 00:05:22.080

I'm kicking your butt, Nate.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.595
I'm kicking your butt.

00:05:39.595 --> 00:05:41.002
We're on the same team.

00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:42.462
Wait, are you
actually shooting me?

00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:44.620
Yeah, I was actively
shooting at you,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.280
and now, I'm going
to fire missile at you.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.700
Don't shoot me, and let me live.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.720
Nah!

00:05:48.940 --> 00:06:33.880
[Music]

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.680
It caught!

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.500
Yeah!

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.044
That sounded neat.

00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:41.000
And you can still see...

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.500
Okay.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.440
So now, with the fire,
it's boiled off all of the steam,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.027
so you can just see like bubbling,
boiling gel inside that pot.

00:06:49.027 --> 00:06:49.834
Yeah.

00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:53.372
It's now shooting bits
of flame out of the pot.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.520
The ground around
it is lighting.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.720
This looks amazing.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.060
Also, we're lighting multiple
things on fire right now.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.440
And so far, at least,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.540
the fire is sparse enough
that I'm not worried

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.050
about like the propane tank
heating up or anything.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.682
No.

00:07:09.682 --> 00:07:15.240
[Music]

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.900
But as it's boiling,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.550
it is the fumes
that are actually catching fire.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.600
The liquid itself isn't on fire.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.200
You can see,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.220
it's just kind of resting
on the top of the pot.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.100
That's amazing.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.640
Well, we succeeded in auto
igniting the hand sanitizer,

00:07:28.642 --> 00:07:31.650
and nothing is spitting
out quite so far

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.440
as we thought it might,
so we feel pretty safe standing

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.440
where we are.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.100
But now, we need to do
something with all of that.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.700
You guys saw
how difficult it was

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.000
for us to blow out just
a small cup of this stuff.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.200
It started steaming
really quickly,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.950
and I think
that just so much heat

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.950
from the bottom was causing
the water in this to boil,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.750
or the alcohol to boil.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.487
Whatever was turning
into a vapor,

00:07:53.487 --> 00:07:54.716
and that was raising up

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.320
through the rest of that gallon
plus of hand sanitizer.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.780
We started seeing steam come up

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.972
with these cool
little like bubbly...

00:08:01.972 --> 00:08:02.689
I don't know.

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:04.960
It looked like a special
effect of a swamp,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.160
if the swamp were clear,
kind of thing.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.058
Just because it's
so thick and viscous,

00:08:09.058 --> 00:08:10.765
and then once it
really got going,

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:11.768
I especially like,

00:08:11.768 --> 00:08:13.680
I noticed it because of
the sound first.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.860
Because you just heard this...

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.020
There's like a cartoon
bubbling boiling noise.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.060
What's that noise?

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.640
I think this point,
as Calli was saying,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.040
it's time to do
something else with it.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.400
So we're going to try
and turn off the burner,

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.300
carefully lift that pot
off using some tools,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.100
set it down,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.149
and then knock it over,

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:35.080
and hopefully, just
have like a flood

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.840
of burning alcohol spread
across the dirt.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.880
I love my job.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.380
Lifting.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.553
Carrying.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.240
It's still shooting
boiling alcohol.

00:08:47.245 --> 00:08:48.150
Sat that down.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.660
But it made it cool noise.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.940
That's just going
to keep burning itself.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.600
Let's turn off the stove.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.960
[Music]

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.920
What is that noise?

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.280
I think it's bubbling.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.480
Bubble, bubble,
toil and trouble.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:12.860
[Music]

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.580
The world's most
dangerous game of hockey?

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.080
[Music]

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.780
Yes.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.380
Wait...

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.534
No, no, put it out.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.580
I didn't mean
for it to land like that.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.980
You almost killed it.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:38.700
[Music]

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.600
Oh, paint with fire.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:51.100
[Music]

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.520
We do say things.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.020
That's a really cool color.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.712
Like blue to purple to orange.

00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:57.750
And the sparks.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.662
The sparks that are coming
out of this is just...

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.000
Look at that.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.800
That's beautiful.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.677
