00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Faces are possibly the most important visual stimuli
that we perceive.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.700
The moment you see a person’s face, you
can infer their race, age, mood, identity,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.240
and possibly their gender expression (always ask).

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.000
Unless, of course, you have prosopagnosia,
aka ‘face blindness’ --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.120
where you can’t tell familiar or unfamiliar faces apart.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.400
Prosopagnosia is important because severe
sufferers of the disorder have reported difficulty

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.880
recognizing not only faces, but also animals
and objects, like cars.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.500
Do you have a friend who can see a car and be like,
“that’s a 1995 Subaru Outback, 2 Door,

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.599
with a leather interior?”

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.220
Or a friend who can look at a dog and be like,
“Hmm, 50% American Staffordshire

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.200
and 50% Coton de Tulear...”?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.600
Well, these people have too much time on their
hands, but more importantly they have expertise

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600
for these objects and animals that they probably
learned over time.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.200
The same nodes in our brains linked to facial
recognition also help us distinguish animals,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.340
objects, and even car types.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.160
These areas, discovered using fMRI, include
the occipital face area, the fusiform face area,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.320
superior temporal sulcus, and an old
friend, the amygdala.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.940
Those parts of the brain light up because
the way people build expertise for dog breeds

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.460
and cars is the same way we do it for faces.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.280
If you’re consistently around diverse faces,
you can more easily tell them apart.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.120
If not, we call this sociological and psychological
phenomenon “own-race bias.”

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.020
The theory of own-race bias posits that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.840
people tend to be better at recognizing faces from their own race than across races.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.000
(We're talking about race here as a combination of socially significant physical features...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
because we all know by now there's no biological
basis to race...

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.720
right?)

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.300
Own-race faces are better remembered when
compared with memory for faces of another,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.880
less familiar race, and this is called the
“cross race effect.”

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.760
And it starts mad early.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.460
In 2013, a group of researchers found out
that babies as young as two months old

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.720
prefer faces compared to other geometric shapes.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.140
This shows that even as a baby, we’re building
facial expertise.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.623
But if you’re building your facial expertise up 
from a young age

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:49.700
in a racially homogenous community,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.920
those are all the faces you know, so, of course,
you’d know your racial in-group extremely well.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.640
As for anyone outside of your race, you’re
gonna have a tough time, my guy.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.680
“See, Mamoudou told me I’m not racist!”

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.720
First of all, I did not say that.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.420
CRE does exist, but it’s not a blanket excuse
for not telling people apart.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.760
This goes all the way from telling Octavia
Spencer and Viola Davis apart

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.740
to being able to discern between two Asian coworkers.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.780
Even I’ve been confused for my friend Yedoye
and we don’t look the same...

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.920
we’re just black at the same time!

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.540
Not only that, but the cross-race effect makes
eyewitness testimony less reliable,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.360
because what if the dude on the stand can’t tell Black or Asian people apart

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.100
and someone gets wrongfully convicted?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.620
Some evidence shows that simply being aware
of the CRE can help your brain focus

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.780
on more subtle differences of faces, and thus treat
people in other race groups as individuals

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.740
and not just people who are part of a 
monolithic “other” group.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.540
The cross-race effect is something to keep in mind when you can’t tell people from another race apart,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.960
but it shouldn’t be
an excuse for not trying.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.160
After all, if you can tell Pokémon, cars,
and dogs apart,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.220
you definitely can tell me and Yedoye apart.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.320
I mean, we're both devilishly handsome...

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.000
but we just aren't the same person.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.980
Hey what's up? Thanks for hangin'.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.840
Speaking of facial recognition, do you think
your DNA could be giving away

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.280
what your face looks like?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.860
Check out this video right here to find out
if your DNA is out here snitchin' on your face.
