00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.900
-There are 10 types of
people in the world.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.390
Those who understand binary,
and those who don't.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.380
MATT PARKER: OK, it doesn't
really work when it's said.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.100
But written down, the
joke kind of holds.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.190
Because if I do a 1 and
then a 0, that looks

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.400
like the number 10.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.610
Because you expect it to be
a normal base 10 number.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.270
However, if this is in binary,
then this is our units column.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.060
That's our twos column.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.020
And so this actually equals
2 in base 10.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.270
And so you expect it to
be 10, but it's not.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.820
It's 2, and that's the joke.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.330
There are actually two
types of people.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.370
Those who knew this was binary,
and those who didn't.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.570
-There are 10 types of
people in the world.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.020
Those who understand binary,
those who don't, and those who

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.740
didn't expect this joke
to be in base 3.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.820
MATT PARKER: OK, good point,
because I guess you--

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.570
OK, so it depends on the base.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.580
So if you've got 10, but this
time it's in base 3, then now

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.580
you've got a units column, and
then a threes column, and then

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.510
nines, and so on.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.200
And so that in normal numbers
would be 3 in base 10.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.230
And so the same 1 and 0 in
a different base mean 3.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.680
Hence the three categories.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.630
-There are 10 types of
people in the world.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.800
Those who understand binary,
those who don't, and--

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.350
MATT PARKER: Look, you can
generalize it to any base, OK?

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.160
10 in base b is going to
equal b in base 10, OK?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.000
There's an infinite set
of these jokes.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.600
Cut it out.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.680
-There are 10 types of
people in the world.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.200
Those who understand
hexadecimal, and F the rest.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.750
MATT PARKER: OK, I give it to
you, that one is actually

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.790
quite funny.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.950
Because now in hexadecimal,
which is base 16--

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.730
10 in base 16 still does mean
there are 16 types of people.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.830
And so there's the one category
of people who

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.320
understand hexadecimal,
base 16.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.170
But then the remaining
15 in hexadecimal--

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.580
15 is just the letter F. And so
when they say F the rest,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.240
they're saying 15
are the rest.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.630
Or I guess the joke is the
double meaning, where if you

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.825
just say F in a sentence, it
means you're implying--

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:07.960
uh, fools.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.780
You're saying they're very
foolish, all the people who

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.820
don't understand hexadecimal.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.550
-Why do mathematicians confuse
Halloween and Christmas?

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.510
Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.005
MATT PARKER: OK, so the
joke here is that Oct

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:31.200
31 equals Dec 25.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.370
And the surface reading is that
this stands for October,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.840
and this stands for December.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.330
But it doesn't.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.110
Oct can stand for the eighth
thing, because October is the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.160
eighth month in the--

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.150
it was until Julius Caesar
messed with it.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.360
And Dec used to be the 10th
month, blah, blah, blah.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.450
So anyway, instead of using
these as months, you can use

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.570
Oct to mean base 8.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.480
So instead of 31 being in our
normal base 10 setup, if we

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.620
put it into base 8, you
have a units column.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.290
You have an eights column.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.230
And so you've now got one
unit and three 8's.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.450
And three 8's is 24, plus
a single unit equals 25.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.470
And so 31 in base 8 equals 25
in base 10, which is why one

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.520
equals the other, and
why a mathematician

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.770
would confuse them.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.610
I actually sampled the product
myself in the last few weeks.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.080
I downloaded a couple of
mountaineering books while I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.340
was holidaying in Nepal.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.040
I love books about mountains.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.390
These are the two I chose.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.930
They were both excellent.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.950
And it was actually really good
fun to be walking through

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.650
the mountains while listening to
the book, having it sort of

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.810
inside my head.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.530
So I recommend those two as
possible ones when you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.970
