00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.811
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So we know that that's still going

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:09.775
to need to be the denominator of our combined fraction. To change the fraction x

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:14.695
over 2 to have a denominator of 6 instead, we need to multiply it by 1 in the

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:19.455
form of 3 over 3, since 2 times 3 is 6. For x over 3, we need to multiply it by

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:23.884
2 over 2. If this step was tricky for you at all, please go back and review

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:28.646
fractions again. It's never too late to do some extra practice. Carrying out

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:33.488
this multiplication gives us this. And then we just need to combine like terms.

00:00:33.488 --> 00:00:35.525
We end up with 5 x over 6 equals 4.
