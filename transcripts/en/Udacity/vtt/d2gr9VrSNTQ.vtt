00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.460
So by the way, here's a question for you. We can make it a quiz but I'm

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.755
not going to make it a quiz. What is the value of the game at p equals 0.4?

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:12.105
&gt;&gt; So I just plug it into those equations, and so negative 10 times

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:17.150
0.4 is like, negative 4 plus 5, is 1. So I'm going to say 1.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So the value here is in fact $0.01. And if you put it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.870
in the other equation you get the

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.970
same thing. Yes, right, because they're equal there.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.690
&gt;&gt; That's

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.520
actually the answer to the entire kit and kaboodle. If.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.800
&gt;&gt; Sorry, where were the kittens?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.150
&gt;&gt; If A chooses a mixed strategy, where with probability 0.4 he

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.580
chooses to be a holder. Notice that it doesn't matter whether B

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.140
is a resigner or B is a seer. You will end up

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.790
here and there will be a value of plus 1 penny to A.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.020
&gt;&gt; On average.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.933
&gt;&gt; The expected value is.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.960
&gt;&gt; plus 1.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.220
&gt;&gt; Neat!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.360
&gt;&gt; Now you might ask yourself, well what if B

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.530
decides to be a smarty pants and also do a mixed

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.600
strategy? What do you think would happen in that case? So

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.730
of course it changes something, but it doesn't change the value

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.440
of the game, because B, if B is a resigner, A

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.310
is getting one on average. If B is a seer then

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.620
A is getting one on average, and an, any average, any

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.870
convex average of one and one is going to give us one.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.960
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.850
So in fact if you think about it, if B tries to

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.800
do a mixed strategy between these two lines. It's going to have to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.060
be for every single point between the two lines, somewhere the average

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.080
is going to have to be somewhere in between there. No matter how you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980
weight that average. So it's like a bow tie is this space

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.360
of possible payoffs. Right and since for any let's if I just,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.210
If B decided to pick some, you know, some values such that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.900
it's in this region of the space. And it's going to end up somewhere,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.750
say between

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.720
here that's fine, or here that's fine, or here that's fine,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.740
or here that's fine, or here that's fine. More importantly, right here

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.260
it's going to have to be between the two lines. Where those

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.800
two lines cross. So, no matter what mixed strategy B chooses. On

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.510
average we will end up here, so the value of this

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.290
game is the expected value of this game and it is, plus

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.460
1 for A. Okay so hang on why is that not

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.120
there are other values that can be obtained. There is a minus

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.585
5 a plus 5, true. Why is it plus 1? Well its plus

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:22.160
1 here on average, the expected value of this game. Is plus 1.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.520
&gt;&gt; So you say that the strategy for A is to choose .4.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.084
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:29.860
&gt;&gt; But why? Like, why is that, of all the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.710
different values. What [INAUDIBLE], just because the lines intersect. I

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.120
don't understand what makes that a good idea for A.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.280
Like, it's not like it gets any additional payoff for having

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.550
things intersect. Well, if a is going to choose a mixed

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.560
strategy, and b is going to choose a mixed strategy. This is

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.840
the mixed strategy for a, that guarantees an expected value of

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.620
plus 1. Meanwhile, let's imagine this is the way you're going to set

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.880
it up. So we've been kind of talking in general that

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.250
a's going to choose the strategy; b's going to choose a strategy, and they're

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.540
going to go. And that, because we know everyone's rational, you already

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.460
know what strategy b's going to pick, and b already knows what strategy

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.630
a's going to pick Right, because we made this assumption about everyone

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.470
is trying to maximize their own utility, there own reward. So in

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.010
a mixed strategy, if you know you're going to go for a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.080
mixed strategy, you have exactly the same situation. B can figure out

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.560
well what is it that A should choose and A can

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.110
figure out what is it that B should choose. So notice that

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.840
in this particular version of the game, the way it's setup. Even

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.660
if A announced beforehand to B. Listen I am going to choose

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.520
to be a holder with probability 0.4. It doesn't matter

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.620
what B chooses the expected value is this +1. Right?

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.520
&gt;&gt; But imagine if A said I am going to pick, I'm going to choose to be

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.140
a holder with probability 1. Well then, what

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.360
should b do? B should choose to seer.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.040
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.215
&gt;&gt; It's exactly the situation we were in before.

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:51.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, but here's the thing I'm having trouble wrapping

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.000
my head around. So, it's not special that it's an intersection,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.535
what's special maybe, is it that, you know, if b is always.

00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:03.150
Okay; taking what you said before, that a is going to announce a

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.780
strategy. So for anything that A can announce B is going to

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.890
presumably do what's best for B which is to just minimize right?

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.500
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.470
&gt;&gt; So if you look at that triangle at the bottom.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.031
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:21.055
&gt;&gt; If you think about that as those lines that V, upside down

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:23.587
V shape. Yeah exactly that thing. If you

00:04:23.587 --> 00:04:26.539
think about that as being the payoffs, the

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.245
payoff function for A, as a function of

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:32.253
the probability P that it chooses to hold.

00:04:32.253 --> 00:04:32.740
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.380
&gt;&gt; Then we've chosen the maximum.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.150
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.520
&gt;&gt; Right, we're trying to find the, the probability for which A gets

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.846
the highest expected value. And it's at that, it's at that peak there.

00:04:42.846 --> 00:04:46.470
&gt;&gt; Hm-hm. But notice something, Michael. For any case

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.370
where the two lines cross, you're going to have a function of this form.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.940
&gt;&gt; Well, let's be sure of that, because that's,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.010
I wasn't seeing, I was thinking that that was not

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.590
true. because basically in this case, we have a, a

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.800
line of positive slope and a line of negative slope.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.785
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:03.340
&gt;&gt; Right? So, what if we, we can have

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.000
an intersection between two lines of negative slope. huh. So

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.210
again, by doing the same exercise you were doing before,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.700
where you draw the, you sort of take the minimum

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.960
of the two lines at all points.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.820
&gt;&gt; You'll end up with this. Where do you pick it then?

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.030
&gt;&gt; The far left, p equals 0.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.630
&gt;&gt; But not the intersection in particular.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.690
&gt;&gt; No, that's true.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.050
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright, I just, wasn't quite

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.630
getting that. But so, the intersection is special,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.320
Because in some cases that is where the max is. It can only I guess

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.360
the max can only be in those three places, right, it could be far left

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.310
far right or the intersection. There' s no other way to have a maximum of lines.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.150
&gt;&gt; Right. And

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.980
b by the way there's another case like this where

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.480
they never actually cross.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.504
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:05:43.504 --> 00:05:45.100
&gt;&gt; Or like this where they never actually cross. Got it.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.460
&gt;&gt; Right, but in either case, right, it's always going to

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.190
be those three points. It's going to be the extreme or

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.350
where they cross. If they happen to never cross, then

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.560
that point goes away and you just pick the maximum. So

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.100
what you could, so, in fact, if you wanted to

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.830
think of an algorithm to choose the right thing to

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.450
do for A, you basically plot the lines. You take

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.900
the min at every point and you find the maximum point.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.850
&gt;&gt; Oh I see, so you could just kind

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.950
of discretized it almost.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you're done. Seem reasonable?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.370
&gt;&gt; Well discretized seems problematic but like I get

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.190
that we're trying to find the probability so that

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.670
we maximize. Oh wait we maximize the minimum of

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.000
the two other things. So it's like maximin again. Yeah.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.210
&gt;&gt; Except here, so, in fact, it is exactly min

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.560
and max or max and min, except, oh, I guess, if

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.470
you're thinking from A's point of view. It's min and max

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.070
or max and min but in this case, there's this other

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.780
parameter, which is the probability. Which is how

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.190
you determine how you're doing the min and max.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.530
&gt;&gt; Got it, right. In this bigger space, it's min

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.360
and max. I see, yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. What

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.850
about so, why is A the one who needs to be

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.460
random? Why isn't B the one who needs to be random?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.260
&gt;&gt; It's, you end up with the same, you end up in

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.880
the same place. Because again, remember,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.500
you're, you're doing this kind of optimal

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.710
notion, where underneath all of that is this belief that both people are

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.250
going to be rational. So the only reason to do this, to take

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.370
the, you know, maximum minimum, is if you believe

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.950
that B is always going to try to minimize what

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.160
you do. But B's in exactly the same situation.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.210
Right, from B's point of view, That's what's happening.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.040
&gt;&gt; Huh. It's the same equations?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just it gets turned around. That's

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.390
actually an interesting exercise. Maybe that's the next homework assignment.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.030
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.580
&gt;&gt; So, did that all make sense to you?

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] It looks a little

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.600
green and scribbley, but yeah. Sure. That's cool.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.370
&gt;&gt; That's how you know

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.340
when you're done, Michael. When it's all green and scribbley.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.120
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Does this generalize to more than two

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.720
options? It seems like it's going to get messy fast.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.200
&gt;&gt; Yes, it does. It generalizes to more than two options. Effectively

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.070
now, you're just doing a max over n things, instead of two things.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.780
&gt;&gt; And you have to search for,

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.150
there's possibly way more intersections to worry about.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but all you care about is the minimum.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.470
Think of it as you're always drawing the minimum function.
