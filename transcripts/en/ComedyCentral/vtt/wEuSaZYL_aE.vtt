LATELY.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.606 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT CAN BE HARD TO KEEP
UP WITH THE BACK STORY.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.975 size:78% position:39% line:91%

&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO PROOF IT HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLANNED

PARENTHOOD, REPUBLICANS ARE
THREATENING TO SHUT DOWN THE

&gt;&gt; FIVE HOURS WHAT IS THERE
TO SAY.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:00.927 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS ABORTION LEGAL?

SUDOKU, CANDY CRUSH, A HOBBIT
MOVIE, FIVE HOURS IS A LONG

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.514 size:88% position:44% line:91%
TIME TO LET THE PRESIDENT OF
PLANNED PARENTHOOD SPEAK BUT

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.916 size:81% position:41% line:91%
NICE THAT THEY GAVE HER SO
MUCH TIME TO GET HER POINT

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:24.851 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.719 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMEN, LET ME TELL

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:27.720 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR BIG
NARRATIVES.

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
MY POINT IS --
&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH WE ARE --

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:35.094 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T OWN ANYTHING IN

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:47.073 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; COULD I ANSWER THE
QUESTION?

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.108 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU CAN'T ANSWER THE
QUESTION.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S CALLED A HEARING, NOT A
SPEAKING.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.481 align:start position:0% line:91%
JESUS, LET THE WOMAN SPEAK
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:58.351 size:81% position:41% line:91%
AT LEAST ALLOW HER TO USE
THE WORDS YOU'RE NOT GOING

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.485 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO LISTEN TO.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.954 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I CAN ASSURE YOU I'M NOT
GOING TO BE TOUGH ON YOU BUT

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.357 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SURELY YOU DON'T EXPECT US
TO BE EASIER ON YOU BECAUSE

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.060 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE A WOMAN.

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:09.529 align:start position:0% line:85%
 .

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.796 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND SURELY YOU
DON'T EXPECT ME TO BE EASIER

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.099 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE AN
ASSHOLE.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:17.270 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
WHAT KIND OF BULL [BLEEP] IS

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:17.737 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.805 align:start position:0% line:85%
A NASTY ATTITUDE.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.407 size:81% position:41% line:91%
NOW OF COURSE, THIS WASN'T
REALLY ABOUT LISTENING AT

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.141 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL.

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.910 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WAS ABOUT THE THEATER OF
IT.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:25.745 size:78% position:39% line:91%
SPECIFICALLY PUTTING ON A
GOOD SHOW FOR AMERICA.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.314 size:78% position:39% line:91%
AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS
TROUPE OF CONGRESSIONAL

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.116 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:42.395 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY A
TOTAL MISCHARACTERIZATION.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:45.531 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: [BLEEP] WHY WOULD
ANYONE WANT TO SELL BABY

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.634 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BODY PARTS WHEN LEASING IS
SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:49.202 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.903 align:start position:0% line:85%

WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:33.913 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE SORRY THEY GOT
CAUGHT.

&gt;&gt; Larry: YES, THE FLOOR

THIS ONE I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:12.251 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THAT IS THE REDUCTION IN THE
BREAST EXAMS AND THE RED IS

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:15.554 line:85%
THE INCREASE IN THE ABORTION.

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:19.525 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S WHAT IS GOING ON IN
YOUR ORGANIZATION.

00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:21.761 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, I WANT YOU

SHOWED YOU.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.498 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT CHART MAKES NO SENSE AT
ALL.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.100 align:start position:0% line:91%
DID YOU SEE, THEY'RE
COMPARING THE DECREASE IN

THEY'RE RELATED.

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:35.841 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD DID
935,000 CANCER SCREENINGS

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:38.711 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMPARED TO 327,000
ABORTIONSMENT BUT ABORTION

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.613 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS LIKE WAY HIGHER ON THE
CHART.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:43.082 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE UP HOW
CHARTS WORK.

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:44.917 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT A THING.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.686 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT?

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.553 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:51.223 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
GOOD LORD.

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.859 size:84% position:42% line:91%
OTHERWISE YOU COULD PROVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT THAT WAY.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.996 align:start position:0% line:91%
