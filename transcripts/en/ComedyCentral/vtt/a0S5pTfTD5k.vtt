Maybe he might go out

- Why do you love
customizing car so much?

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:26.119

just the fact that, you know, if

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.988 align:start position:0%
you got a crazy idea and we've
been able to fulfill it,

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:30.656

"Oh, my God."

is gave you cameras, dawg.

What are we looking at?

That says, "Don't pull us over.
