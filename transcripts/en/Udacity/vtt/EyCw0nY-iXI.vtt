00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.200
Now how do we actually compute
these types of things for images.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.910
How can we actually deblur imagines
that are actually because of focus.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.880
So here are two different
sets of examples.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.580
These are actually approaches
proposed by Levin et al., in 2007.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.260
Basically, the two methods
they proposed as one exploit,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.420
prior information on natural images.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.230
Look and model the types of signal
deconvolutions that happen from natural

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.520
images like this.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.240
And actually use that to figure out
depth discontinuities and discrimination

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
that will allow us to improve
deconvolution and also depth estimation.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.390
So, you know, natural images or scenes
like this, unnatural images would be,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.880
you know, random noise types of things.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.360
The other method, and this is the one we
will actually focus on in this lecture,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.816
is basically come up with
different patterns and

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:50.390
that basically use these
patterns on the lens itself.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.744
So make a defocus pattern that is known.

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:55.060
In this case, it's the aperture itself.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.750
But change the defocus pattern to have
some sort of a characteristic like this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.340
and use that discriminate where
the defocus is differently for

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.880
different planes of defocus
planes in an image.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.949
Again, we'll talk about
this in lot more detail.

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:12.744
And the idea really comes up is that
what we want to do is come up with

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:14.180
a coded aperture.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.860
An aperture that would have different
characteristics like this, and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.200
you can put this inside a lens
before the image is formed,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.830
the amount of light that goes in
through the lens, through the sensor.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.055
If you can put this in,
we can actually perhaps,

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:28.505
quantify the defocus on the sensor.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.700
And that will actually let us know how
to deconvolve it based on the fact

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.640
that we have actually quantified
what the focus plane would be.
