00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.210
&gt;&gt; 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.210
MALE: Welcome. Can you give us an introduction
of yourselves, your company, and your product?

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.320
&gt;&gt; JAMES: Sure. My name is Kimberly James.
I'm a Director of Wireless Operations for

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.650
NBA Digital.
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: Hi. I'm Robert Occhialini.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.380
And I'm the Director of Technology for Product
Development for NBA Digital.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.180
&gt;&gt; MALE: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit
about the products that you're demoing today?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.660
&gt;&gt; JAMES: Sure. The--only the products we're
demoing is called T-Mobile Close Up. It's

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.690
basically a video streaming application of
the TNT-4 camera angles over Android. And

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.170
basically it's over the Eastern Conference
finals only. And during each game, we'll stream

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:53.542
live from four camera angles; Cavaliers cam,
MagicCam, ActionCam, and the Robocam. When

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:59.980
games are not going on, we provide you with
video clips of the day's previously played.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.810
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: And the other app that we're
showing today is NBA Game Time for Android,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.640
which is the basic application that most basketball
fans would need to follow their teams, scores,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.070
standings, schedule, and play-off series throughout
the season.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:29.272
&gt;&gt; MALE: So talk to me a little bit about
your decision to use the Android platform?

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:32.642
&gt;&gt; JAMES: So basically, we decided to put
these applications out towards the end of

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:38.330
play-offs to see what the adoption would be
across two platforms. And wanted them being

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.289
Android was very interesting to us because
of the touch interface that the Android device

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:54.119
provides. And it works well with the designs
we did across iPhone. So we thought we would

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.470
use that same design and similar functionality
across Android. With Android streaming functionality

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.540
available across RTSP and--in a 3GPP format,
we were able to also leverage that platform

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.470
as well to accommodate any type of direct
screening into our encoder for TNT. So, Android,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.510
it just opens up doors to see what we can
do across that platform from a touch device.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.820
&gt;&gt; MALE: What's the biggest differentiator
that you see in Android?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.220
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: I think one of the biggest
differentiator is the ability to reuse the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.470
code you write for Android on other mobile
platforms, where some other more popular touch

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:53.640
screen devices used add ball form of tool
set and make it kind of one-time use. With

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.311
Android, we can use about 75 to 80 percent
of our code across other mobile platforms

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:04.510
as well.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Have there been any significant challenges

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.071
that you've had in working with the platform?
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: I think with NBA Game Time,

00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:16.060
we've made a decision to do sort of a more-high
concept user interface than most touch screen

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.160
applications. And really implementing that
sort of high concept UI was a real challenge

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.260
at times, but it did turn out really, really
nice in the end.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:41.776
&gt;&gt; MALE: So are there any new teachers in
Cupcake that you've been able to take advantage

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:42.776
of?
&gt;&gt; JAMES: That was probably one of our heaviest

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:44.350
challenges with the video streaming application
is being able to work with the Cupcake platform.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.560
Recently, Cupcake has upgraded their versions
to account for H.264 that we think will be

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:58.700
a great upgrade for us next season. But for
this season, there was some challenges getting

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:09.920
the video to coordinate with the Cupcake platform.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Any tips or an info just getting

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.340
started on the Android platform?
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: I think really two things that

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.880
I definitely learned early on is that Android
users expect a very lean app. They want to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.740
conserve the room on their phones. We got
a lot of feedback from users initially that

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.819
the app was larger than we should have, but
we fixed that over time. I'm definitely really

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.340
happy with sort of the engagement with users.
We get a lot of positive feedback directly

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:51.290
from users at our Gmail accounts, so...
&gt;&gt; MALE: Is that interaction with your users

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.290
on the Android platform different from the
other platform?

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.840
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: Yeah. I mean, we really--there's
a lot more of an opportunity through the infrastructure

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.650
that Google's built to get direct feedback
and have two-way communication with your users

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.889
where some other platforms, the communication
is very one-way. And you don't have that opportunity

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.370
to kind of address issues with users unless
you sort of build your own customer support

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:24.889
silos. You know, having sort of that base
Gmail box that we can aggregate the user response

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.419
at is a really helpful tool, so...
&gt;&gt; JAMES: Yes.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.419
&gt;&gt; MALE: So do you have any favorite features
with Android?

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.419
&gt;&gt; JAMES: Yeah. I mean, one favorite feature
of Android specific to the T-Mobile Close

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:39.940
Up application is the application that you
play a video up in the corner of the screen

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:48.860
as you're trying to choose another channel,
which is pretty unique to that particular

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.060
application. So that's my favorite feature.
&gt;&gt; MALE: What about you Robert, do you have

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.620
any favorites?
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: Nothing pops into my head.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:04.759
I mean, the whole thing is pretty smooth and
easy to use. So there's actually one UIL that

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.860
we ended up being able to implement a lot
easier on Android, now that I think about

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:16.190
it for the play-offs than it was for some
other platforms too which are bracket navigation,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.439
so...
&gt;&gt; MALE: Great. Kimberly, Robert, I want to

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:24.309
thank you for you time today. It's very good.
&gt;&gt; JAMES: Thank you.

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:25.129
&gt;&gt; OCCHIALINI: Thanks.
