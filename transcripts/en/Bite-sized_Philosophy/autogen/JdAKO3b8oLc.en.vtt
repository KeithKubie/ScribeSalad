called the circumambulation and Jung had
this idea that you had a potential

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
this idea that you had a potential
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.700
this idea that you had a potential
future self which would be in potential

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
future self which would be in potential

your present life by making you
interested in things and the things that

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
interested in things and the things that
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.279
interested in things and the things that
you're interested in are the things that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
you're interested in are the things that
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.929
you're interested in are the things that
would guide you along the path that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
would guide you along the path that
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640
would guide you along the path that
would lead you to maximal development

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
would lead you to maximal development
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.519
would lead you to maximal development
now it sounds of like a metaphysical

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
now it sounds of like a metaphysical
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.970
now it sounds of like a metaphysical
idea or a or a mystical idea even but

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
idea or a or a mystical idea even but
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.880
idea or a or a mystical idea even but
but it's not it's it's not it's a really

profoundly biological idea the idea is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
profoundly biological idea the idea is
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650
profoundly biological idea the idea is
something like well you're set up so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
something like well you're set up so
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.150
something like well you're set up so
that you're automatically interested in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
that you're automatically interested in
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.760
that you're automatically interested in
those things that we've fully expand you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
those things that we've fully expand you
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.459
those things that we've fully expand you
as a well adapted creature well like

as a well adapted creature well like
there's nothing radical about that idea

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
there's nothing radical about that idea
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.470
there's nothing radical about that idea
how else what else could possibly be the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
how else what else could possibly be the
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.819
how else what else could possibly be the
case unless there's something

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
case unless there's something
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.670
case unless there's something
fundamentally flawed about you that is

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
fundamentally flawed about you that is
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.860
fundamentally flawed about you that is
what the the situation would be it's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
what the the situation would be it's
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.270
what the the situation would be it's
kind of interesting to think about how

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
kind of interesting to think about how
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189
kind of interesting to think about how
that would be manifest moment to moment

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
that would be manifest moment to moment
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650
that would be manifest moment to moment
but the idea is something like well your

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
but the idea is something like well your
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179
but the idea is something like well your
interest is captured by those things

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
interest is captured by those things
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.219
interest is captured by those things
that lead you down the path of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
that lead you down the path of
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:07.850
that lead you down the path of
development

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
development
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399
development
well that better be the case okay so

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
well that better be the case okay so
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.859
well that better be the case okay so
that's fine and so there's some utility

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
that's fine and so there's some utility
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.270
that's fine and so there's some utility
in pursuing those things that you're

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
in pursuing those things that you're
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.740
in pursuing those things that you're
interested in that's the call to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
interested in that's the call to
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.130
interested in that's the call to
adventure let's say so and the call to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
adventure let's say so and the call to
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.480
adventure let's say so and the call to
adventure takes you all sorts of places

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
adventure takes you all sorts of places
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950
adventure takes you all sorts of places
now the problem with the call to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
now the problem with the call to
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539
now the problem with the call to
adventure is like what the hell do you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
adventure is like what the hell do you
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.910
adventure is like what the hell do you
know you might be interested in things

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
know you might be interested in things
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.149
know you might be interested in things
that are kind of warped and bent and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
that are kind of warped and bent and
 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.460
that are kind of warped and bent and
often it's the case that when new parts

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
often it's the case that when new parts
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.069
often it's the case that when new parts
of people manifest themselves and grip

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
of people manifest themselves and grip
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.560
of people manifest themselves and grip
their interest say they do it very badly

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
their interest say they do it very badly
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560
their interest say they do it very badly
and shoddily and so you stumble around

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
and shoddily and so you stumble around
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.789
and shoddily and so you stumble around
like an idiot when you try to do

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
like an idiot when you try to do
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.710
like an idiot when you try to do
something new that's where the fool is

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
something new that's where the fool is
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.359
something new that's where the fool is
the precursor to the Savior from the

the precursor to the Savior from the
from the symbolic perspectives because

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
from the symbolic perspectives because
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469
from the symbolic perspectives because
you have to be a fool before you can be

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
you have to be a fool before you can be
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060
you have to be a fool before you can be
a master and if you're not willing to be

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
a master and if you're not willing to be
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.480
a master and if you're not willing to be
a fool and you can't be a master so so

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
a fool and you can't be a master so so
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.999
a fool and you can't be a master so so
you're gonna it's it's an error mmm

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
you're gonna it's it's an error mmm
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039
you're gonna it's it's an error mmm
error ridden process and that's also

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
error ridden process and that's also
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.359
error ridden process and that's also
laid out in the Old Testament stories

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
laid out in the Old Testament stories
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069
laid out in the Old Testament stories
because the first thing that happens to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
because the first thing that happens to
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.560
because the first thing that happens to
all these patriarchal figures when God

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
all these patriarchal figures when God
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.149
all these patriarchal figures when God
kicks them out of their father's house

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
kicks them out of their father's house
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.479
kicks them out of their father's house
when they're like 84 is that they they

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
when they're like 84 is that they they
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.580
when they're like 84 is that they they
run into all sorts of trouble and some

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
run into all sorts of trouble and some
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.199
run into all sorts of trouble and some
of its social and some of its natural

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
of its social and some of its natural
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.790
of its social and some of its natural
and some of it's a consequence of their

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
and some of it's a consequence of their
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.640
and some of it's a consequence of their
moral inadequacy so they're fools and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
moral inadequacy so they're fools and
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.280
moral inadequacy so they're fools and
but but the thing that's so interesting

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
but but the thing that's so interesting
 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.020
but but the thing that's so interesting
is that despite the fact that they're

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
is that despite the fact that they're
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.460
is that despite the fact that they're
fools they're still supposed to go on

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
fools they're still supposed to go on
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.680
fools they're still supposed to go on
the adventure and that they're capable

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
the adventure and that they're capable
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230
the adventure and that they're capable
of learning enough as a consequence of

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240
of learning enough as a consequence of
 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.090
of learning enough as a consequence of
moving forward on the adventure so that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
moving forward on the adventure so that
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.500
moving forward on the adventure so that
they straighten themselves out across

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
they straighten themselves out across
 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.050
they straighten themselves out across
time and so it's something like this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
time and so it's something like this
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.090
time and so it's something like this
this circumambulation that jung talked

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100
this circumambulation that jung talked
 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.270
this circumambulation that jung talked
about was this continual will return to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280
about was this continual will return to
 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.430
about was this continual will return to
this this continual circling in some

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
this this continual circling in some
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.740
this this continual circling in some
sense of who you could be you might

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
sense of who you could be you might
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480
sense of who you could be you might
notice for example that there are themes

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490
notice for example that there are themes
 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.070
notice for example that there are themes
in your life you know when you go back

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
in your life you know when you go back
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.530
in your life you know when you go back
across your experiences you see you kind

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
across your experiences you see you kind
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.060
across your experiences you see you kind
of have your typical experience that

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
of have your typical experience that
 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.640
of have your typical experience that
sort of repeats itself and there might

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
sort of repeats itself and there might
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.860
sort of repeats itself and there might
be variation on it like a musical theme

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
be variation on it like a musical theme
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.350
be variation on it like a musical theme
but it's it's like you're circling

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
but it's it's like you're circling
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.090
but it's it's like you're circling
yourself and getting closer to yourself

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100
yourself and getting closer to yourself
 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.850
yourself and getting closer to yourself
as you move across time that's the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
as you move across time that's the
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.770
as you move across time that's the
circumambulation now you remember that

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
circumambulation now you remember that
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.030
circumambulation now you remember that
for a sec because we'll go back to it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040
for a sec because we'll go back to it
 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.490
for a sec because we'll go back to it
okay so imagine that something glimmers

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
okay so imagine that something glimmers
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.620
okay so imagine that something glimmers
before you it's an an interest that's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630
before you it's an an interest that's
 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.350
before you it's an an interest that's
dawning and you decide well first of all

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
dawning and you decide well first of all
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.910
dawning and you decide well first of all
you're paralyzed you think well how do I

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
you're paralyzed you think well how do I
 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.200
you're paralyzed you think well how do I
know if I should pursue that it's

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210
know if I should pursue that it's
 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.870
know if I should pursue that it's
probably a stupid idea and the proper

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
probably a stupid idea and the proper
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.550
probably a stupid idea and the proper
response to that is you're right it

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560
response to that is you're right it
 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.650
response to that is you're right it
probably is a stupid idea because almost

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660
probably is a stupid idea because almost
 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.880
probably is a stupid idea because almost
all ideas are stupid and so the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890
all ideas are stupid and so the
 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.560
all ideas are stupid and so the
probability that as you move forward on

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
probability that as you move forward on
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.030
probability that as you move forward on
your adventure that you're gonna get it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
your adventure that you're gonna get it
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.060
your adventure that you're gonna get it
right the first time is zero it's just

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070
right the first time is zero it's just
 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.960
right the first time is zero it's just
not gonna happen

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
not gonna happen
 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.030
not gonna happen
and so then you might think well maybe

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040
and so then you might think well maybe
 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.130
and so then you might think well maybe
I'll just wait around until I get the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140
I'll just wait around until I get the
 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.860
I'll just wait around until I get the
right idea and which people do right so

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870
right idea and which people do right so
 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.720
right idea and which people do right so
they're like 40 year old thirteen year

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730
they're like 40 year old thirteen year
 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.970
they're like 40 year old thirteen year
olds which is not a good idea and so

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980
olds which is not a good idea and so
 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.130
olds which is not a good idea and so
they wait around until it's Waiting for

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
they wait around until it's Waiting for
 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.320
they wait around until it's Waiting for
Godot until they finally got it right

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330
Godot until they finally got it right
 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.030
Godot until they finally got it right
but the problem is you're too stupid to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040
but the problem is you're too stupid to
 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.130
but the problem is you're too stupid to
know when you've got it right so waiting

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
know when you've got it right so waiting
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.500
know when you've got it right so waiting
around isn't gonna help because even if

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
around isn't gonna help because even if
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.930
around isn't gonna help because even if
it the perfect opportunity manifested

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
it the perfect opportunity manifested
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.240
it the perfect opportunity manifested
itself to you in your incomplete form

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250
itself to you in your incomplete form
 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.430
itself to you in your incomplete form
the probability that you would recognize

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
the probability that you would recognize
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.470
the probability that you would recognize
it as the perfect opportunity is zero

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480
it as the perfect opportunity is zero
 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.180
it as the perfect opportunity is zero
you might even think it's the worst

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190
you might even think it's the worst
 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.190
you might even think it's the worst
possible idea that you've ever heard of

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200
possible idea that you've ever heard of
 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.670
possible idea that you've ever heard of
anywhere highly likely highly likely so

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680
anywhere highly likely highly likely so
 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.520
anywhere highly likely highly likely so
so you had there's an itch of nature

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530
so you had there's an itch of nature
 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.259
so you had there's an itch of nature
called that a will will to stupidity

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269
called that a will will to stupidity
 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.050
called that a will will to stupidity
which I really liked so because he

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060
which I really liked so because he
 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.659
which I really liked so because he
thought of stupidity as being it you

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669
thought of stupidity as being it you
 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.670
thought of stupidity as being it you
know it's it's you have to take it into

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680
know it's it's you have to take it into
 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.219
know it's it's you have to take it into
account fundamentally and work with it

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229
account fundamentally and work with it
 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.710
account fundamentally and work with it
and so and so you can take these

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720
and so and so you can take these
 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.680
and so and so you can take these
tentative steps on your pathway to

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690
tentative steps on your pathway to
 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.110
tentative steps on your pathway to
destiny and you can assume that you're

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120
destiny and you can assume that you're
 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.090
destiny and you can assume that you're
gonna do it badly and that's really

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100
gonna do it badly and that's really
 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.830
gonna do it badly and that's really
useful because you don't have to beat

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840
useful because you don't have to beat
 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.300
useful because you don't have to beat
yourself up it's pretty easy to do it

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310
yourself up it's pretty easy to do it
 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.670
yourself up it's pretty easy to do it
badly but the thing is it's way better

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680
badly but the thing is it's way better
 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.470
badly but the thing is it's way better
to do it badly than not to do it at all

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480
to do it badly than not to do it at all
 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.380
to do it badly than not to do it at all
and that's the continual message that

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390
and that's the continual message that
 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.840
and that's the continual message that
echoes through these historical stories

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850
echoes through these historical stories
 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.940
echoes through these historical stories
in Genesis it's like these are flawed

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950
in Genesis it's like these are flawed
 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.400
in Genesis it's like these are flawed
people they should have got the hell out

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410
people they should have got the hell out
 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.680
people they should have got the hell out
of their house way before they did and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690
of their house way before they did and
 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.990
of their house way before they did and
they go out and they stumble around in

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000
they go out and they stumble around in
 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.200
they go out and they stumble around in
tyranny and famine and self betrayal and

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210
tyranny and famine and self betrayal and
 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.920
tyranny and famine and self betrayal and
and violence and but it's a hell of a

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930
and violence and but it's a hell of a
 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.750
and violence and but it's a hell of a
lot better than just rotting away at

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760
lot better than just rotting away at
 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.390
lot better than just rotting away at
home and that's the that's great so

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400
home and that's the that's great so
 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.050
home and that's the that's great so
that's good

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060
that's good
 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.600
that's good
and so why is that well okay so you you

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610
and so why is that well okay so you you
 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.100
and so why is that well okay so you you
start your path and you think that

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110
start your path and you think that
 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.810
start your path and you think that
you're heading you know towards your

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820
you're heading you know towards your
 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.780
you're heading you know towards your
star and so you go in that direction and

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790
star and so you go in that direction and
 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.620
star and so you go in that direction and
then because you're here the world looks

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630
then because you're here the world looks
 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.420
then because you're here the world looks
a particular way but then when you move

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430
a particular way but then when you move
 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.720
a particular way but then when you move
here the world looks different and

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730
here the world looks different and
 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.280
here the world looks different and
you're different as a consequence of

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290
you're different as a consequence of
 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.530
you're different as a consequence of
having made that voyage and so what that

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540
having made that voyage and so what that
 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.240
having made that voyage and so what that
means is that now that thing that

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250
means is that now that thing that
 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.860
means is that now that thing that
glimmers in front of you is going to

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870
glimmers in front of you is going to
 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.010
glimmers in front of you is going to
have shifted its location because you

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020
have shifted its location because you
 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.020
have shifted its location because you
weren't very good at specifying it to

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030
weren't very good at specifying it to
 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.310
weren't very good at specifying it to
begin with and now that you're a little

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320
begin with and now that you're a little
 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.740
begin with and now that you're a little
sharper and more focused than you were

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750
sharper and more focused than you were
 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.650
sharper and more focused than you were
it's it's going to reveal itself with

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660
it's it's going to reveal itself with
 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.710
it's it's going to reveal itself with
more accuracy to you and so then you

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720
more accuracy to you and so then you
 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.280
more accuracy to you and so then you
have to take you know it's almost like

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290
have to take you know it's almost like
 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.640
have to take you know it's almost like
180 degree reversal but it isn't because

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650
180 degree reversal but it isn't because
 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.990
180 degree reversal but it isn't because
you know you've I mean you've gone this

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000
you know you've I mean you've gone this
 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.850
you know you've I mean you've gone this
far and that's a long ways to get that

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860
far and that's a long ways to get that
 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.290
far and that's a long ways to get that
far but that's a lot farther than you

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300
far but that's a lot farther than you
 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.150
far but that's a lot farther than you
would be if you just stayed where you

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160
would be if you just stayed where you
 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.030
would be if you just stayed where you
were waiting and so it doesn't matter

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040
were waiting and so it doesn't matter
 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.350
were waiting and so it doesn't matter
that you overshoot continually

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360
that you overshoot continually
 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.110
that you overshoot continually
because as you overshoot even if you

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120
because as you overshoot even if you
 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.880
because as you overshoot even if you
don't learn what you should have done

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890
don't learn what you should have done
 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.010
don't learn what you should have done
you're going to continually learn what

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020
you're going to continually learn what
 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.920
you're going to continually learn what
you shouldn't keep doing and if you

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930
you shouldn't keep doing and if you
 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.840
you shouldn't keep doing and if you
learn enough about what you shouldn't

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850
learn enough about what you shouldn't
 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.780
learn enough about what you shouldn't
keep doing then that's tantamount at

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790
keep doing then that's tantamount at
 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.700
keep doing then that's tantamount at
some point to learning at the same time

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710
some point to learning at the same time
 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.779
some point to learning at the same time
what you should be doing so it's okay so

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789
what you should be doing so it's okay so
 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.520
what you should be doing so it's okay so
it's like this

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530
it's like this
 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.779
it's like this
now what's cool about it though I think

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789
now what's cool about it though I think
 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.520
now what's cool about it though I think
is that as you progress the degree of

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530
is that as you progress the degree of
 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.200
is that as you progress the degree of
overshooting starts to decline right and

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210
overshooting starts to decline right and
 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.120
overshooting starts to decline right and
that we know that there's nothing

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130
that we know that there's nothing
 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.100
that we know that there's nothing
hypothetical about that as you learn a

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110
hypothetical about that as you learn a
 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.110
hypothetical about that as you learn a
new skill like even to play it play a

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120

00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:18.459
forward and you collapse and you think
 

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.100
forward and you collapse and you think
well that didn't work I collapsed it's

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.110
well that didn't work I collapsed it's
 

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.760
well that didn't work I collapsed it's
like no that's par for the course it's

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:23.770
like no that's par for the course it's
 

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.620
like no that's par for the course it's
not indication that you failed it's just

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:25.630
not indication that you failed it's just
 

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.480
not indication that you failed it's just
indication that it's really hard and

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:27.490
indication that it's really hard and
 

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.400
indication that it's really hard and
that when you learn something you also

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:29.410
that when you learn something you also
 

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.290
that when you learn something you also
unlearn something and the thing you

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:31.300
unlearn something and the thing you
 

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.970
unlearn something and the thing you
unlearned is probably useful and

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:32.980
unlearned is probably useful and
 

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.040
unlearned is probably useful and
unlearning it actually is painful you

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.050
unlearning it actually is painful you
 

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.090
unlearning it actually is painful you
know let's say if you have to get out of

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.100
know let's say if you have to get out of
 

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.340
know let's say if you have to get out of
a bad relationship it's like not every

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.350
a bad relationship it's like not every
 

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.319
a bad relationship it's like not every
not any really there isn't any

00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:40.329
not any really there isn't any
 

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:41.699
not any really there isn't any
relationship that's a hundred percent

00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:41.709
relationship that's a hundred percent
 

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:44.970
relationship that's a hundred percent
bad and so when you jump out of it well

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:44.980
bad and so when you jump out of it well
 

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.800
bad and so when you jump out of it well
maybe you're in better shape but you're

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:46.810
maybe you're in better shape but you're
 

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.600
maybe you're in better shape but you're
still lonesome and disoriented you don't

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:48.610
still lonesome and disoriented you don't
 

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.949
still lonesome and disoriented you don't
know what your past was and you don't

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959
know what your past was and you don't
 

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:51.180
know what your past was and you don't
know what your present is and you don't

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.190
know what your present is and you don't
 

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.480
know what your present is and you don't
know what your future is it's that's not

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:53.490
know what your future is it's that's not
 

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.040
know what your future is it's that's not
that's why people stay with the devil

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.050
that's why people stay with the devil
 

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.900
that's why people stay with the devil
they know instead of you know looking

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:57.910
they know instead of you know looking
 

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.560
they know instead of you know looking
for the devil they don't know so so

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.570
for the devil they don't know so so
 

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.440
for the devil they don't know so so
anyways the fact that

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.450
anyways the fact that
 

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.510
anyways the fact that
you're full of faults doesn't mean you

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:06.520
you're full of faults doesn't mean you
 

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.330
you're full of faults doesn't mean you
have to stop and thank God for that

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:09.340
have to stop and thank God for that
 

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.940
have to stop and thank God for that
that's a really useful thing and the

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:11.950
that's a really useful thing and the
 

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.470
that's a really useful thing and the
fact that you're full of faults doesn't

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480
fact that you're full of faults doesn't
 

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.650
fact that you're full of faults doesn't
mean that you can't learn and so you can

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:16.660
mean that you can't learn and so you can
 

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.750
mean that you can't learn and so you can
pause it an ideal and you're gonna be

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760
pause it an ideal and you're gonna be
 

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.430
pause it an ideal and you're gonna be
wrong about it but it doesn't matter

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440
wrong about it but it doesn't matter
 

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.960
wrong about it but it doesn't matter
because what you're right about is

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:21.970
because what you're right about is
 

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.940
because what you're right about is
positing the ideal moving towards it if

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:23.950
positing the ideal moving towards it if
 

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.860
positing the ideal moving towards it if
the actual ideal isn't conceptualize

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:28.870
the actual ideal isn't conceptualize
 

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.050
the actual ideal isn't conceptualize
perfectly well first surprise surprise

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.060
perfectly well first surprise surprise
 

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.310
perfectly well first surprise surprise
cuz like what are you going to do that's

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320
cuz like what are you going to do that's
 

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.970
cuz like what are you going to do that's
perfect

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:32.980
perfect
 

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.640
perfect
so it doesn't matter that it's imperfect

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:35.650
so it doesn't matter that it's imperfect
 

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.650
so it doesn't matter that it's imperfect
imperfect it just matters that you do it

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:37.660
imperfect it just matters that you do it
 

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.450
imperfect it just matters that you do it
and that you move forward so that's

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:39.460
and that you move forward so that's
 

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.430
and that you move forward so that's
really that's really positive news as

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440
really that's really positive news as
 

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.750
really that's really positive news as
far as I'm concerned because you can

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760
far as I'm concerned because you can
 

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.610
far as I'm concerned because you can
actually do that right you can do it

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:44.620
actually do that right you can do it
 

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.830
actually do that right you can do it
badly anyone can do that so that's

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:46.840
badly anyone can do that so that's
 

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.700
badly anyone can do that so that's
that's useful okay so like if you're an

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:50.710
that's useful okay so like if you're an
 

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.900
that's useful okay so like if you're an
efficient person you would have just

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:51.910
efficient person you would have just
 

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.140
efficient person you would have just
done that but you're not but who cares

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:55.150
done that but you're not but who cares
 

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.360
done that but you're not but who cares
you know you still end up in the in the

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.370
you know you still end up in the in the
 

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.880
you know you still end up in the in the
same place and maybe the trip is even

00:11:59.880 --> 00:11:59.890
same place and maybe the trip is even
 

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.740
same place and maybe the trip is even
more interesting who knows probably two

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:01.750
more interesting who knows probably two
 

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.380
more interesting who knows probably two
