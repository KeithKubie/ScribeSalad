00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Since I have the side that is opposite and the side that is adjacent, remember this is adjacent

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and this is hypotenuse, that looks like tangent would be easiest.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Why don't you go ahead and calculate the tangent of this angle?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I'm going to start calling it angle--I don't know--Î±. It seems like a good letter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I know the tangent of a is equal to the opposite over the adjacent.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And when I do this, I get about 0.8684 and that's really basically 0.869. We're very close to this.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I can actually figure out, hey, this must be a 41-degree angle more or less.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We're not at exactly 0.869 but close enough.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Using this fact, I can say with confidence that alpha is a 41-degree angle.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And now maybe you are seeing how we can use trigonometric ratios to calculate the angle

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
at which the sun's rays are striking the earth in a particular location.

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We're making some serious progress. Before we move on, let's do one more practice problem.
