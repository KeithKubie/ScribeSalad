00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.030
We're given that angle ADB
is congruent to angle ADC.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.330
So let me write that down.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.270
So angle ADB, so that's
this angle right over here.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.970
They're telling us that
that's congruent to ADC,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.450
so that's this angle
right over there.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.350
They also tell us that
angle BAD, angle bad,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.260
so that's this angle.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.468
I'll do it with two arcs
because it's not necessarily

00:00:28.468 --> 00:00:29.960
the same measure
as this one here.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.040
So angle BAD is
congruent to angle CAD.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.630
That's angle CAD, so this is
this angle right over here.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.770
Prove that triangle BAD-- this
is the triangle on the left--

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.630
is congruent to triangle CAD.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.270
That's this triangle
on the right.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.660
And so they give
the givens here.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.590
Angle BAD is congruent to CAD.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.440
Well, they've
already told us that.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.250
And they also told us that
angle ADB is congruent to ADC.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.530
So we've already marked that
up, so how do we prove this?

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.600
Well, the one thing we know,
and this is almost intuitively

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.790
obvious, is that the
measure of this segment

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.460
is equal to itself.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.450
And the reason why
that's a useful thing

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.570
to state explicitly is because
that side, the segment AD,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.760
is part of both triangles.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.710
So let's just mark that there.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.110
It's equal to itself.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.554
So let me write this here.

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:27.970
And the reason why
it's useful, is

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.430
you're kind of saying, hey,
look, this is a side on both

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.180
of those triangles
that we care about.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.321
So we could write AD
is congruent to AD,

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:37.320
and it would be by the
reflexive property, which

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.480
is the most obvious
property that something

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.530
is going to be equal to itself.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.760
So reflexive property,
there you go.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.690
But now, by stating
that we've explicitly

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.910
put up enough
information in our proof,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.250
to now say that
the left triangle

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.370
is congruent to the right.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.070
And the reason why
we can say that is we

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.690
have a corresponding angle,
corresponding side, and then

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.550
another corresponding
angle that is

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.604
congruent to this angle,
this side, and this angle.

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:04.020
And we talk about
in other videos,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.430
about why
angle-side-angle works.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.999
If I have one triangle that has
congruent one angle, a side,

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.290
and another angle that's
congruent to another triangle,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.420
it's impossible for me to draw a
triangle that is not congruent.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.540
This is a basic
axiom that we assume.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.200
It's a basic assumption.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.210
So now we have
enough information.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.776
We can now write
that triangle BAD,

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:28.150
and we want to make sure we
have the corresponding sides.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.630
So what corresponds to angle
B, or vertex B, right over here

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.310
is C. So it's going
to be C, and then

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.510
we'd want to go to
A and then D, CAD.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.830
And the reason is we have an
angle, a side, and an angle.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.020
So let me get an
angle-side-angle congruence.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.760
There you go.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.000
And I think we are done.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.520
Let's see how we did.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.370
There you go.
