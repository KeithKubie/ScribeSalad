Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.320
And welcome to: Star Trek Month.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.080
Engage review!

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.640
Yes sir!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.540
[Kirk screams "Khan!" over and over to the opening theme of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.320
What can you say about Star Trek?

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.140
Well, really, everything.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.680
"It's a great vehicle for creative ideas!"

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.180
"It's an onslaught of clichÃ©d writing."

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.540
"Its characters are timeless and unforgettable!"

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.400
"Their personalities are on par with the Ninja Turtles."

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.340
"It's one of the greatest works in sci fi of all time!"

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.200
"It's the corniest schlock you'll ever watch."

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.380
Everybody has an opinion on Star Trek.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.700
But, there is one pattern that most people seem to agree on:

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.140
When it comes to the movies, the even-numbered ones seem to be the best.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.680
For whatever reason, the odd-numbered Star Trek films seem to be the ones

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.300
that get once-in-a-while viewers and die-hard fans REALLY pissed off.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.300
I believe we can attribute that to the binary structure that emanates from these movies-

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.440
Or it could just be a giant coincidence.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.560
Dammit! I almost sounded intellimigent!

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.280
So all throughout January, we're going to look at the odd-numbered Star Trek movies:

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.360
the ones that seem to get Trekkies' panties in a bundle.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.580
And we're gonna start off with "Star Trek: The Motion Picture."

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.500
Roll clip number one.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.140
Energize!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.880
(Bad Scottish accent) I cannae do it Critic, I don't have the power!

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.740
Or, the, uh, (clears throat) money?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.680
(Sighs)

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.940
[Mario Brothers coin sound]
Thank you!

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.460
[Theme to Star Trek: The Motion Picture]

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.180
So we see our opening credits.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.240
We've got William Shatner,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.000
Leonard Nimoy,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.900
DeForest Kelley,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.100
[From Gilligan's Island Intro]
And the rest!

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.760
We then cut to some sort of anomaly in space,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.860
where the Klingons come to check it out.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.440
(Speaking Klingon)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.720
Well, wait a minute. In the original show, the Klingons had flat heads.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.960
Now they're all round and pointy?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.760
What's up with that?

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.800
[Ominous music]
Incoming cameo, Critic!

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.020
Oh, God, I was hoping I could avoid this.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.820
I guess I have no choice, I have to face the music.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.380
Put him on screen.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.080
[STATIC]

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.320
Hi, Critic!

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.480
Angry Joe?

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.340
Oh ho, thank God, I thought you were Linkara for a second.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.320
Yeah I know, he's obsessed with Star Trek.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.520
He's a total geek.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.640
Ha, yeah tell me about it. [Laughs]

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.620
So anyway, I wanted to point out why, exactly, the Klingons' heads look like that...

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.360
you see there's actually several different theories that's popped up over the years,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.240
uh, the first one being that the Klingons, uh, suffer from the "nekh'rat,"

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.260
which is a degenerative disease that uh, only their species suffers from.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.500
Uh, yeah, look, uh, when I asked that question, I was only half curious.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.040
Well not even half, a third. A fifth.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.940
The fans would kill me if I didn't bring it up, so, you don't need to explain it.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.660
B-B-But surely you need a Star Trek expert like me to help you through this...

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.820
No, I don't!

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.660
And we're not gonna do that thing where we go back and forth and then suddenly I give in.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.960
I'm doing it alone!

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.140
B-But Critic, you have no idea what you're in for.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.820
Oh come on, it was directed by Robert Wise, one of the greatest directors of all time.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.320
I'm sure I can get through this.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.520
Very well, Critic, very well,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.700
but do you know the ancient Klingon proverb that tells us: "Revenge..."

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.640
Nope, I'm not allowing any quotes either. Just piss off.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.240
Oh but come on! I've been wanting to do the speech for years!

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.360

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.380

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.140
Does thees incredibly racist accent offend you?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.120
Good! I don't even think it's the right nationality!

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.480
That'll teach you next ty-eem to interrupt my review.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.040
Nicely done. Now back to the review.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.720
Engage!

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.100
You know, you don't have to point every time you say that...

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.160
(Critic insisting)

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.420
Fine.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.000
So, in typical Klingon fashion,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.460
if they don't know what something is,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.240
they shoot it!

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.660
Oh yeah, I should probably mention this anomaly always seems to make what I guess is supposed to be a disturbing sound, but

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.880
it always sounds like a chord off of an electric guitar.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.740
[Ominous chord]

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.100
BILL AND TED: Excellent!
[Electric guitars playing]

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.480
But the anomaly doesn't like that, and fries them faster than...

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.480
well, I don't know, a cheap Vulcan replacement for Spock.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.880
Oh hey, look! A cheap Vulcan replacement for Spock!

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.380
SONAK: Report to you, sir?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.700
KIRK: It is my intention

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.460
to be on that ship

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.120
following that meeting.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.300
Report to me in one hour.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.600
Mmm...I give him two more lines before he finally kicks the bucket...

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.180
Wow! I hope you paid that actor by the word,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.340
'cause he must have been pissed.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.580
And where's the real Spock, you may ask?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.560
He's on the planet Vulcan, about to partake in a ceremony that will totally wipe out his emotions.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.040
But he senses the anomaly and suddenly finds he can't go through with it.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.420
[Ominous chord]

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.760

(Speaking Vulcan)

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.680
So she mind melds with him and finds his brain is still filled with the most illogical of human remains.

LEONARD NIMOY: (singing "The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins"): In the middle of the Earth, from the land of the Shire,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.400
lives a brave little hobbit whom we all admire.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.320
Bilbo! (Bilbo!) Bilbo Baggins,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.980
he's only three feet tall.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.400
CRITIC (as Spock): Ugh, so illogical.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.440
(Normal voice) Seems Kirk is relieving Captain Decker of his duties,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.660
for no other reason than,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.500
well, HE wants to do it.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.160
KIRK: I'm replacing you as captain of the Enterprise.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.440
DECKER: May I ask why?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.000
My familiarity with the Enterprise.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.800
This is an almost-totally-new Enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.800
That's why you're staying aboard.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.060
I'm sorry, Will.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.620
You told me how envious you were and how much you hoped you'd find a way to get a starship command again.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.260
Hey, it could be worse. You could be demoted to religious propaganda on the WB.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.840
But, more bad news happens,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.300
as it turns out the beaming of Mr. Not-Spock is going awry.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.020
Gee, I wonder what's going to happen to him?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
KIRK: Give it to me.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.100
CRITIC: Uh, yeah, let the CAPTAIN, who we've just been told doesn't know ONE-TENTH of the ship,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.080
take away control from the person who's been trained specifically for this job.

CRITIC: Well, good one Kirk, you've been in charge for only 120 seconds and you've already caused two casualties.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.600
That's gonna equal out to, what, a death a minute?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.040
And it's such a weird scene, too.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.140
Why have this character if all you were gonna do is kill him off?

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.580
It's a grim, pointless scene.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.880
It's like watching My Little Pony and then just throwing in a horse exploding.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.400
I mean, why do we need that?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.200
Oh well, battlefield promotion.

H-Hey, keep it up and maybe one day make you'll make captain eh heh heh...oh.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.700
[Music fades out]
Bones, there's a...thing out there.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.040
Why is any object we don't understand always called a "thing"?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.180
Why can't it be called a "whoosits" or a "whatsits"?

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.620
So the ship is all ready to go to stop the evil anomaly before it reaches Earth.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.600

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.700
What the?

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.860
Well I guess that was the action scene in the middle of the picture!

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:43.460
I guess they thought they needed a little bit more excitement during this moment, so they threw in a guy nearly missing a door.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.300
Well, good to know you had your thrilling cutaway shot, if you need it.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.080

Captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.460
Engineer, we need warp speed NOW.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.060
It's borderline on the simulator, captain. I cannae guarantee that she'll hold up.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.160
They enter through the opening of Vertigo when suddenly they realize, what a shock, something's gone wrong.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.680

Hey sir, listen to this! Luuuke, I am your faaathherrrr...

DECKER: Arm photon torpedoes!

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.680
CRITIC: It turns out there's an asteroid that's about to hit them in warp, but Decker figures out how to save the day.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:58.620
So, just to clarify, Kirk's been in charge for only a few hours, and he's already killed two crew members, and nearly wiped out the entire ship.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.880
I'd follow this man to eternal death.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.240
Mostly because I would have no choice.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.540
KIRK: Mr. Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.020
SCOTTY: Captain, it was the engine imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.460
(OVER INTERCOM) 
It'll happen again if we don't correct it.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.660
That object is less than two days away from Earth. 
We need to intercept while it still IS out there.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.960
CRITIC (as Scotty): Need I remind you of the "holy shit, you nearly killed us" moment not a few minutes ago?

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.640
You twat!

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.080
KIRK: Why was my phaser order countermanded?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.320
DECKER: Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.500
The phasers were automatically cut off.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.860
Then you acted properly, of course.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.740
Captain Decker is right. I mean, Captain Decker. I mean, Captain Decker. I mean...

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.360
He's the fucking captain, I don't know why Kirk is there.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.980
DECKER: Sorry if I embarrassed you.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.220
KIRK: You saved the ship.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.700
I'm aware of that, sir.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.760

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.400
CRITIC (as Kirk): Which means stop pointing out when I'm obviously wrong.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.860

But it turns out even Decker can fall victim to certain weaknesses,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.180

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.320
and Kirk is overjoyed because now he can partake in all the various, over-the-top ways he can say Spock's name.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.420
This is a mechanism.

So the anomaly is called V'Ger, and it's searching for who or whatever created her so that she may finally join with it.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.640
So while Decker shows her around the ship allowing her to collect data,

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.100
Spock, surprisingly, steals one of the space suits to see if he can communicate further with V'Ger.

SPOCK: Computer, commence recording.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.640

No, wait, wait, that was a joke! That was a joke! I wasn't serious! No! Hey! What are you doing? Stop!

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:07.340
So Spock journeys to the center of V'Ger and comes across, well, there's no subtle way to say it:

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.820
V'Ger's vagina.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.480
A V'Ger-na, if you will.

First we got the sky-gina in Langoliers and now we got the space-gina in Star Trek!

It's almost as if sci-fi writers don't get a lot of pussy!

Whoo, guy's a man whore!

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.160
Spock tries to mind-meld with V'Ger but gets his ass handed to him.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.760
He returns to the ship to report that V'Ger came from a planet populated by living machines,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.620
and has evolved with incredible knowledge, all except for one question: who The Creator is.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:53.080
And V'Ger vows to cure the universe of carbon units, mostly the ones on Earth, until she finds her answer.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.400
ILIA PROBE: The carbon unit infestation is to be removed from The Creator's planet.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.080
SPOCK: V'Ger is a child.

Evolving, learning, searching.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.140
I suggest you treat her as such.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.540
CRITIC (as Kirk): Hey, does V'Ger wanna go to Chuck E. Cheese?

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.560
Does V'Ger wanna see a Justin Bieber concert?

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:19.340
Does V'Ger wanna fund a franchise about a sparkling vampire that's setting women back dozens of years?

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.720
KIRK: The carbon units know why The Creator has not responded.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.540
Disclose the information.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.060
Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.220
CRITIC: So Kirk says he'll give the information, but only to the center of V'Ger herself.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.960
The probe complies, and Kirk plans his next move.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.100
KIRK: Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute Starfleet Order
2-0-0-5.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.400
CREWMEMBER: Why has the captain ordered self-destruct, sir?

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:49.960
SCOTTY: I would say, lass, because he thinks...he hopes...that when we go up, we'll take the intruder with us.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:58.620
Ah, huh huh, I signed up for Starfleet to pay for my college, uh, is there any chance we can not blow up on my very first mission?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.680
So how powerful is the emotional need at the center of V'Ger?

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.180
Well, apparently, it's so powerful,
(mockingly) it made Spock cry.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.460
KIRK: Not for us?

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.540
SPOCK: No, captain, not for us. For V'Ger.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.620
I weep for V'Ger as I would for a brother.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.660
CRITIC: A brother that we find out you have later and clearly did not weep for, but one movie at a time.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.380
So they get to the center of V'Ger and find out that V'Ger is, in fact, Voyager:

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.800
Voyager 6, the satellite that was sent out years ago and got sucked into a wormhole,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.620
landing it on the machine planet.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.920
It evolved over the years and now it wishes to still somehow join with its creator.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.300
MCCOY: You mean this machine wants to physically join with a human?

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.140
Is that possible?

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.400
DECKER: Let's find out.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.240
KIRK: Decker.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.780
I'm gonna key the final sequence through the ground test computer.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.880
CRITIC: So, whatever he just said apparently means Decker is giving himself to the computer.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:05.540
["Unchained Melody" from "Ghost"]

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.580
MOLLY: See you.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.880
CRITIC: So their joining sets off a giant explosion and Enterprise gets the hell out of there.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.680
KIRK: Did we just see the beginning of a new life form?

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.780
SPOCK: Yes, captain.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.400
We witnessed a birth, possibly a next step in our evolution.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.920
CRITIC: Well, let's never reference this big step in evolution again in anything Star Trek-related.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.320
That way it'll show just what an impact it had on our evolution.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.640
Truly, this is a big day.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.200
KIRK: That-a-way.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:40.580
CRITIC: So the crew is back in form, they're happy a big bang was set off by a big bang, and they go off to where no man has gone before!

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And that was the first Star Trek movie, and let me tell you, I can see why it's often called the Slow Motion Picture.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.600
The ideas are interesting, even provacative,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.040
but most of the characters aren't developed in an interesting way, the pacing is unbelievably slow, and on top of that,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.200
IT'S SO BORING!

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:08.760
The effects, I'll admit, are very impressive, but when you have to look at them for what feels like an eternity, you get sick of them pretty fast.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.480
I really feel like this film was trying to do what "2001: A Space Odyssey" did:

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.560
you know, sort of make it, like, an experience movie.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.960
But, that's not what Star Trek was mostly about.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.980
It was more about a mix of ideas and characters, not as much an out-of-body experience.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.300
The only out-of-body experience this movie can conjure is taking us to fucking Dreamland!

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.020
So, take it for what it's worth.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.280
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, and Star Trek Month is on the way!

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.820
[Star Trek: The Motion Picture theme]

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.260
ILIA: My oath of celibacy is on record.
