My name is Jason, CEO of Veewo

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.000
We have been dedicated to making small but enjoyable games

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.660
since we started the company in 2011

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.260
Some of our games were officially promoted by Google Play

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.680
like Dark Slash:Hero and Just Get 10

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.020
and have been well received globally

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.880
Our latest leading game is a casual action game

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.520
Super Phantom Cat

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.460
Thanks to Google Play game services

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.800
we are able to reach as many Android users as possible

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.440
The game got 870K visits and 120K downloads within a week

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.720
This is an exceptional achievement which we wouldn’t have imagined before

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.460
We decided to support Android TV at a very early stage

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.180
Now 10% of our users play this game on TV

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.340
As game makers who love TV games in our youth, we are very proud.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.720
I’m Yop, producer of Veewo

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.760
Beta testing and fast Iterations

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.560
have allowed us to achieve success on Google Play

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560
Since we implemented Beta Testing

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.880
the user score increased steadily from 4.1 to 4.6

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.740
Thanks to the group-distribution model

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.680
we are able to gather precise feedbacks

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.200
before we make any bold updates

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440
It makes our game quality very stable

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.900
Google Play helps us keep the promise of making best games

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.680
Admob is our primary revenue driver

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680
Our profit keep on rising 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.920
thanks to its high display rate

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.060
Our income has increased by dozens of times in the past 4 years

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.700
Google Play also allows us to reply to user comments in the games reviews

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.440
This feature not only helped us reduce 31% user loss

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.520
but also made some players became our friends

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.360
Players want to talk with developers, now we are more sure of it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.080
Promotion Codes give us a new way of operation

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.980
Google Play In-app Promotions allow us to reward users anytime, anywhere

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.840
We can give rewards in forms of a well-designed virtual character, or a level with special content

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.200
Google Play smooths the communication between us and players

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.220
and helps us improve the game and its operation more easily

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.640
Now 70% of our business and players comes from the Android platform

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.740
and this growth has made us more confident about the future of our company

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.620
We want to maintain our team philosophy into the future:

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.840
Bringing wonderful gaming experiences to our players
