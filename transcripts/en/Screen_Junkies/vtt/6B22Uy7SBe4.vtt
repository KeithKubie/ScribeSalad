00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.020
Prepare for the all-new sequel

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.420
to the franchise reboot

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.910
based on the sequel

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.500
to the original franchise.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.250
Star Trek Into Darkness.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.620
Uh, did someone forget a colon?

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.840
Get ready for the sequel that JJ Abrams swore
would be different from Star Trek II:

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.840
The Wrath of Khan.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.460
Except for this part:

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.960
"The needs of the many Outweigh the needs
of the few."

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.190
And this

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.910
And of course:

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.460
(screaming)

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.000
That.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.390
But JJ's not just stealing from The Wrath
of Khan;

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.510
he's recycling everything you loved about
his last Star Trek movie, too,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.970
like Kirk bedding aliens,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.880
Spock throwing tantrums,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.750
Kirk and Pike drinking,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.579
Red Bull Space Jumping,

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.200
hallway running,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200
Old Spock,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.200
and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.800
even

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.800
more

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.500
lens flares!

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.810
Ah, you guys get the point.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.840
So, ride once again with James T. Kirk,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.270
the galaxy's worst star-fleet captain,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.270
as he desecrates a culture's gods

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.700
"What the hell did you take?!"

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.100
"I have no idea, but they were bowing to it!"

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.889
Lets experienced crew members go out of spite.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.539
"Do you accept my resignation or not?"

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.299
"I do!"

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.349
Promotes inexperienced crew members out of
convenience.

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:35.509
"You're my new chief."

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.700
"Aye, captain."

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.490
And fails to protect his crew.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.389
(screams)

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:43.079
And the Enterprise.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.669
And downtown San Francisco.

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:52.389
Cringe at the stereotypical treatment of the
two female leads.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:55.099
Uhura, an otherwise competent officer,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.749
who stops a life or death mission

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.539
to nag her boyfriend for not sharing his feelings.

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:59.719
Uhura: "You prefer not to discuss this at
all, that's what you prefer."

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:00.649
Spock: "Our current --"

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.489
Kirk: "Are you really gonna do this right
now?"

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.599
Uhura: "What never seems to require your undivided
focus --"

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.020
Kirk: "Guys."

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.469
Uhura: "I'm sorry, Captain. Just two seconds."

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.420
And newcomer Carol Marcus,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.060
who's only there for one reason

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.580
Carol: "Turn around!"

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.970
Make that two reasons.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.850
Watch as this crew faces their most dangerous
enemy yet.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.140
Khan: "Khan."

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.010
He's a ruthless villain

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.120
Khan: "Shall we begin?"

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.140
so diabolical he'll... not kill Spock,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.550
let Kirk express his feelings,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.500
and ultimately be completely justified in
his actions.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.790
Khan: "My crew is my family.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.250
Is there anything you would not do for your
family?"

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.050
You gotta admit, he's got a point.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.470
So! Boldly go to a ridiculous alternate Star
Trek timeline,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.020
where the Enterprise survives more hits than
it took

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.200
in the entire original series,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.380
magical interplanetary transporters make star
ships obsolete,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.680
death has been cured by magical super blood,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.730
Bones: "I synthesized this serum from this
super blood."

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.280
and, whenever they're in a space jam,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.290
old Spock is just a FaceTime away.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.880
Old Spock: "Mr. Spock."

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.070
Spock: "Mr. Spock."

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.180
Ugh, I can just picture the next Star Trek already.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.930
[dreamy music]

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.220
Klingon General Chang,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.500
The Horta,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.150
Tholians,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.100
The Borg --

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.430
all really bad!

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.070
Anybody else we should look out for?

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.030
We covered The Gorn, right?

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.760
It is just a test. Do not actually kill The
Gorn.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.930
Correct. Oh, and when you go back to 1930's
New York you have to kill Kirk's

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.720
girlfriend or Hitler will win World War II.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.069
Fascinating.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.819
Oh and be sure to track down a couple humpback
whales. Cause that will save you a

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.620
lot of time later on.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.940
Humpback whales...

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.840
That should cover it. Now I believe you have
something for me...

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.840
You lucky dog. Best I could get was that weird
fan dance in Star Trek 5.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.900
Are we sure this is not going to rip apart
some time-space continuum?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.740
Hey, you want my help or not!?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.180
Starring...

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.160
Captain Twerk

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.260
Smock

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.740
Old Smock

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.190
Margaret Cho

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.260

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.430

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.630
Bling-ons

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.739

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.789
Star Trek Into Darkness

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.210
Are we SURE we don't wanna put a colon in
there?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.240
Thanks for watching.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.680
Set YouTube to subscribe.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.610
Big thanks to How It Should Have Ended!

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.810

Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger,
can I take your order?

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.199
I'm a pretty pretty princess.

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.439
Kick his ass, Sea-Bass.

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.249
Tread lightly.

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:58.159
Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!
