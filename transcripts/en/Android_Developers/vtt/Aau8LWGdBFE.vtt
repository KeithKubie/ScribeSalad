00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.800
Dave: Zalando is Europe's
leading

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.640
online fashion destination,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.680
now transforming into a
multiservice fashion platform.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.400
We are based out of Berlin,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.800
and we have offices across
several European cities.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.080
We are present in 15 European
countries at the moment,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.760
and we boast 1500 brands on
our online fashion platform.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.600
70% of our site traffic
comes via mobile devices,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.400
so we are innovating
the mobile experience

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.840
for our users
further and further.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.600
We launched photo search as well
as barcode scanner

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.040
to bridge this gap between

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.400
online and offline
fashion books.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.040
We also have certain features,
for example,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.760
garden wish list sync,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.360
which provides a seamless
cross platform experience.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.120
The high-quality app experience

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.200
can make or break
the customer journey.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.720
We invested a lot to improve
user experience

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.680
and the app quality
for our Android apps.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.480
We saw around 6% increase
on a monthly basis last year

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.080
in our app installs.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.240
We get around 40% of
our Android app installs

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.640
via organic traffic.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.480
We also saw increase
in our lifetime value,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.920
which we measure by
revenue per user.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.680
And we saw 15% increase on a
quarterly basis last quarter.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.200
Riera: We have been working in
several fronts

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.760
to improve app quality.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.240
We did a huge refactor
in our [inaudible]

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.080
and strengthen technical
formation.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.120
We also add more and more
test information,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.600
as well as a regression test
to be sure

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.240
that the app quality is intact
on every release.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.520
There are several tools
in the Google Play console

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
that really helps us to ensure
the app quality.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.520
Alpha and beta testing, as well
as pre-launch reports.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.360
The new release dashboard,
it's a powerful tool

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.480
which improves the app
distribution.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.400
It gives us all the data

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.360
with a bunch of metrics,
as in upgrades,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.400
crashes, ratings.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.360
That helps us to monitoring
[inaudible] very closely.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.000
Since we improved quality,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.760
we decrease the app start time
by around 30%,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.840
and we reduced the daily average
crashes

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.120
by up to 90%.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.080
Regarding ratings, we improved
from 4.3 to 4.4,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.920
which indicates that user
satisfaction is growing.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.000
Dave: We have invested a lot
in developing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.840
great customer experience
in our Android apps,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.240
and we have achieved many great
milestones out of it.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.280
As a product manager,
this motivates me

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.240
to deliver great
mobile experience

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.960
for our Android users.
