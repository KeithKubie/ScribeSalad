00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.327
Hey there I'm Mike Rugnetta,

00:00:01.327 --> 00:00:03.480
this is Crash Course Mythology, and today,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.600
we're going to finish up our look at pantheons with African Gods.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.160
Now some Crash Course fans are already scratching their heads because they know

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.120
that it's very hard to speak of African anything without drastically oversimplifying.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.940
It's enormous and filled with diverse peoples.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.320
Africa, as the saying goes, is not a country.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.680
It is however a song by the 80s band, Toto.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.200
Maybe some karaoke later Thoth-- to?

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.400
*singing* "Bless the rains down in Africa"

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.200
There is no one African mythology or Pantheon,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.940
just like there's no single Native American or Asian mythology.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.600
There are similarities in the stories of different groups,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.940
but no one consistent family of gods.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.560
So this episode is going to focus on an African people with a well documented set of deities:

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.560
the Yoruba, of Western Africa.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.460
In particular, we're going to look at their pantheon of Orishas,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.840
and one very wise chameleon.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.960
Yoruba is a language and a term used to describe the people who speak it.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.700
Yoruba people live in the region around the Bite of Benin

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.840
in the countries that are now Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.120
These regions are important:

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.120
they're home to millions of Africans

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
and were also centres of the African slave trade,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.320
meaning Yoruba traditions travelled from Africa to the Caribbean,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320
Latin America and North America.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.520
Some of these traditions have been modified and translated into the set of practises called Vodou in Haiti.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520
Probably you know them best as Voodoo

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.880
Vodun is a word in the Fon language that means "spirit".

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.960
Yoruba myths, however, are not the equivalent of Vodou

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.760
and most Vodou cults are actually a lot less intense than what you've seen in, like, horror movies and stuff.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.860
The Yoruba region is currently home to many religions

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.860
including Christianity and Islam

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.420
and the fact that the Yoruba people have maintained their Orisha stories in the face of other religious traditions

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.040
is a testament to the power and importance of this cultural heritage.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.760
The Orisha stories are similar in this way to the Native American myths.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.200
Okay. Now, let's meet the teams.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.680
Orishas are the gods and semi-divine heroes of Yoruba culture.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.380
According to Alex Koko, "there are countless deities in the Yoruba pantheon of Orishas,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.820
and each one of them, in one way or another, has accomplished deeds whereby the ancestors thought it was worthwhile

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.220
to include them in their oral traditions of story-telling,"

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.300
known as Eta.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.960
Out of the hundreds of Orishas there are a dozen or so that feature prominently in the myths,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.380
not unlike the twelve Olympians.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.520
First, there's Olorun, AKA Olodumare, sometimes hyphenated.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.980
He's the Great Sky Father - hey, Dad! - and ultimately responsible for the creation of world order.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.580
Then there's Eshu, the Trickster. He, like many tricksters, represents accident and the uncertainty of life.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.580
We'll look at him more closely in a later episode.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.260
Ogun is the Giver of Iron, who is also a hunter and a warrior.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.540
Like in the Greek pantheon, not all gods pair monogamously.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.620
Ogun had lovers including Oya.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.800
Oranyiman, a son of Ogun is another warrior and also a fertility god of sorts, being the creator of dry land,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.660
and the shaper of infants before their birth.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.140
So, if you know someone having a sonogram, tell them about Oranyiman; that's his handiwork.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.600
Olookun is the god or godess of oceans and Olosa is the goddess of lagoons,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.520
so, I imagine there are some arguments over who has jurisdiction over inlets.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.420
As with other pantheons, some Orishas have dominion over natural phenomena as well.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.140
The Orisha thunder god is Shango, who is also the same as Oramfe.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.840
Zeus, Thor and Shango should meet up sometime; I bet the conversation would be

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.080
electrifying. I'll just see myself out.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.780
Okay, alright.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.500
Onile-Ile is the goddess of Earth's soil, and there's also Oko, the god of fields, farms and agriculture.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.020
Oya is the goddess of winds and the Niger river.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.560
She's one of Shango's wives.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.700
Orungan is the god of air. He's the son of Aganju, god of the wilderness,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.700
and Yemoja, goddess of the river Ogun.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700
And it's not all positive phenomena either.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.860
Obaluaye is the god of smallpox, disease and death,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.860
so I bet he's a real treat at parties.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.580
You might have noticed that there is some overlap in divine responsibility.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.440
When myths exist mostly in oral traditions and come from such a huge and diverse geographic region,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.460
a certain amount of redundancy is pretty normal.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.460
We saw this in the Egyptian pantheon too.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.540
For instance: multiple Orishas are considered warrior gods

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.600
and others seem to control aspects of the human condition.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.460
Ori is the god of individuality and fate,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.860
while Iwa is the goddess of character.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.280
A number of Orishas relate to regional geography like forests, particular rivers and hunting,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.240
and some represent seemingly hyper-specific but key aspects of African life,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.380
such as Ogiyan, the god of crushed Cassava.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.140
Now that is a god who I bet is a real treat at a party.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.240
And just for you history fans out there, this shows that not all Orishas have ancient origins;

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.740
Cassava was introduced to Africa as part of the Columbian exchange.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:10.280
Other than Sky Dad Olorun, the most important Orisha is his oldest son Orunmila, the god of Wisdom and divination.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.760
According to Leonard and McClune, "Orunmila, by reading pine nuts and cowries,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.200
communicates Olorun's irreversible intentions and therefore, personifies fate."

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.040
So think of that the next time you're having pesto.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.820
Many of the Orisha myths feature Orunmila, including the one that explains how the Orishas got their powers.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.160
Oh yeah; let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.960
The Orishas lived on Earth, and before they each had unique powers, they were equals.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.580
Whenever they needed some special knowledge, they would ask Olorun or Orunmila for help.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.080
One day, and Orisha named Oko wondered why he should have to do that.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.360
He thought that if he had a special knowledge of a certain thing, then people could ask him, and not have to hassle Orunmila.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.720
So Oko asked Orunmila for special powers, to distinguish him from humans.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.300
Ogun also asked Orunmila for special power,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.800
to keep the world going.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.440
Soon, all the Orishas wanted powers.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.240
Orunmila was distressed; he held all the Orishas in equal esteem.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.800
He thought: "There are many powers to be shared. To whom should I give one power or another?"

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.040
One day he went for a walk and met Agemo, the chameleon,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.040
who asked Orunmila what was wrong.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.040
Orunmila explained, and Agemo responded:

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.780
"Perhaps it would be best to leave the distribution to chance.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.760
Return to the sky, then send messengers to announce that on such and such a day you will pour the powers down on the Earth.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.180
Let each Orisha catch what he can or retrieve it from the place where it falls

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.600
Whatever powers an Orisha collects in this way will be his.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.760
By sending your messengers you will have given everyone equal notice

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.720
and no-one can say "Orunmila neglected me.""

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.960
Orunmila followed this advice.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.640
When he sent out the messengers the Orishas said:

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.340
"Orunmila does a good thing. Thank him for us. We will receive what he rains down on us."

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.300
Five days later, the powers fell from the sky.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.140
The Orishas waited in the fields and and ran to catch them.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.260
They weren't all equally fast, strong or persistant,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.260
so not all were able to get as large or desirable a portion of Orunmila's bounty.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.920
But everyone got something.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.880
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, man, I love this origin story.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.040
It explains how the Orishas came to have their roles.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.900
Unlike the Greek Olympians, who were seemingly born with their attributes,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.660
the Orishas, while not exactly human,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.900
don't have any special abilities or knowledge until Orunmila rains them down.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.220
And, after he does, they're not all equal in their abilities,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.600
explaining why some Orishas have a lot of power,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.320
and why some just get to make really delicious side dishes.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.860
Think about Orunmila for a second:

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.860
he seems to be all-powerful.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.460
He could easily assign special characteristics to Orishas as he sees fit,

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.460
thus increasing his influence over them.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.180
Or he could just ignore them altogether: he's powerful; why help these noobs?

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.600
But no. Not only does he distribute divine favours,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.080
but he attempts to be fair in the process.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.800
Providing a lesson for how humans, 
and especially rulers, should behave.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.440
And despite his own power, Orunmila can't solve his problem without the help of a very wise chameleon,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.400
demonstrating the fallibility of Orishas and the connection between their world

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.400
and the world of animals.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.580
Animals play a big role in many African stories

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.580
and we're going to see more on that in a later episode.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.100
This story echoes another Orisha myth,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.360
featuring Olorun, that explains the human condition.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.740
In this story, Olorun responds to the humans of the first city, Ile-Ife, who demand

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.960
inequality.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.400
As one man claimed: "There is nothing that is unequal among us

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.400
and there is nothing to differentiate us!

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.600
We speak the same language, we live in the same town,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.120
and we each own equal amounts of possessions!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.140
No one among us has more than any other and yet, no one has less than anyone else.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.460
There is absolutely no variety in anything in our lives!

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.120
Why is it that we are all the same?"

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.240
Like Orunmila, Olorun didn't want to give in to the humans' demands.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.960
He knew that differences between people would lead to strife.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.460
He sent Eshu to explain this, but the people of Ile-Ife wouldn't listen.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.160
And eventually Olorun relented.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.500
He sent Eshu to hand out differences to people in the marketplace

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.860
and woah, big surprise here, chaos ensued.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.640
People complained about their individual differences;

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.940
one woman saying: "Why are men treating us so badly?"

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.100
and another: "Why are they acting superior to us?"

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.300
So, the next time someone makes a sexist comment,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.720
blame Eshu.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.820
But also the person making the sexist comment, too.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.480
Chaos and war were bred from Olorun's inequality.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.620
Eventually, the people couldn't even get along with each other and they had to leave Ile-Ife.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.040
This caused the formation of new nations, tribes, cities and kingdoms

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.540
and according to the story

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.920
in this manner inequality prevailed among the people of Earth.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.380
This story is a direct echo of the origins of the Orishas' powers

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.860
and shows just how similar the gods and humans are.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.520
As with the other pantheons we've seen, gods in human form have human frailties,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.400
which may make them more relatable as objects of worship,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.000
but also makes it easier to criticise them, or see them as fallible.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.840
Perhaps this helps explain why much of the world that worships a divine being

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.940
has chosen to put its faith in a power that, for the most part,

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.040
eschews human form and human emotion.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.320
But. Can they make delicious Cassava?

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.960
Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:30.060
