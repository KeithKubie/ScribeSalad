Moffat: A couple of tips
for using Google Web Toolkit.

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:05.467
When you're compiling
to JavaScript for testing,

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:08.334
uh, make sure you modify
your moduled XML file

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:09.901
so that you
only build JavaScript

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.567
for the browser
you're actually targeting.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.234
There's no point in producing
"IE 6" JavaScript

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.667
if you're only
gonna be testing "Firefox 3."

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.367
My second tip's
about performance.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.834
If you find that
your performance is limited

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.367
by the performance
of the HashMat implementation,

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.000
you can look at using
Fast StringMap instead.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400
If all your keys
are strings,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.767
this can give you
quite a boost.
