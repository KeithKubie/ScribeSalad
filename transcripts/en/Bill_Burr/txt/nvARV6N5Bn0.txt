Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, June 4th, 2018. What's going on? How are you? Hi, adorne. Lattie I'm in Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. Um, I've been on a fucking plane for, I don't know how long. Uh, we left to lax and uh, what were you supposed to leave in the afternoon? And then, uh, there was some problem with the hydraulics. They back the fucking thing up. They pulled it forward to back that up. They pulled it forward like, you know, two and a half hours later we finally left, which is all good because, you know, it's Don Rickles says in casino rather, it's, you know, spread it down here then you know, up there. Right. Um, so I was just sitting on the fucking plane and uh, they didn't give us any food. They get a little cup of water. That was in two and a half hour delay. Nothing, no food, no drinks or anything at all. I was thinking I was on Air France there. I was like, oh, this is how these fucking people stay so skinny. You know, they just leave you on there. They don't feed you or nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:10          MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:12          So anyways, but I kept my mind occupied. I was transcribing a pan terrorist song. I find get into shit. You know, I, I can eats up all the time. Um, rather than sitting there either do that or a police solitaire on my phone. It's somebody get me a deck of cards, they're like, you know, you can just get an app for that. And like that is really a lot easier isn't it? Plus I feel you win a lot more with the APP, you know, cause it wants you to keep playing or a deck of cards. They don't give a shit. They just want it done. They got your money that don't, that fucking solitaire game though. Don't get it. Don't get it. Because they've got like 50 fucking ads every time they shuffle the cards. Every time you win a game, be time you move your hand. They got like another ad and they put the acts in a different spot every time. If you don't really hit the acts and it goes to another fucking page, you know. So somebody gets credit for a look of viewing a click and analyze. I don't, I don't pretend to understand these things. So anyways.

And I was like, well don't do it before you leave. It'd be more exciting if people hear you talk to yourself in a different country that allowed a new fucking flavor.

I have noticed about soccer is when you score and your blasted by the goalie high on either side, it's e f they jump out of the water like a fucking sword fish.

Speaker 2:          08:17          It looks like, you know, not at all.

Speaker 1:          08:20          What are they jump up like like a swordfish coming out of the water and what's amazing is rather than just jumping up and fucking trying to block it, they always have to turn around and watch it go in the net. You know, it's like the Matrix. Don't you think you could jump a little higher? If you want some God damn concerned, you know where the fuck is going. If it got buyer, you know where it is. You know you can hear the crowd, you fucking piece of shit. Right. You know when it, you're always fucking look at goddamn soccer goalies there, there, there were no nosy group of people.

Are you that you know, there's a bunch of booze I like, I'm not going to go there and see how they make it salivating the whole tour. Getting the fucking shakes. Oh Man. Would you want to just dive in there? A 17 year old fell into a vat of Guinness.

Oh, this is going to be a good time. My Show's tomorrow night at the, the three arena. I don't know what that stands for. It sounds like some Illuminati shit to me. Was it the three banks that are left in all of Europe? Are they part of the European Union here? Who decided to leave? Was it Brussels? No. Was it Berlin? Nope. Was it Great Britain? I knew it was Brexit, so I try to guess all the Br. Once I spelled Berlin, I preempt the are Brelyn. Um, just to be interesting, you know, just, just to try to keep it fresh globally, you know? Um, anyways, uh, how about those fucking Washington capitals? I'll say it again. How about those fucking Washington capitals?

Speaker 1:          13:25          Tell you right now, if I'm a fan of the Vegas Knights, I gotta be thinking, what is my, what is our adjustment to their adjustment going to happen? All right, I'm going to go out and this waste of what happened. Okay. The capital's whatever the Fuck Vegas was doing a game one at the capital's adjusted to it and game three, I did not see an answer by the Vegas Knights. Okay. It, uh, as far as my limited knowledge of math goes, they better fucking respond in game four or this series going to be fucking, oh, Ba, no, vet skin's going to be on the cup. It's going to be great. Either way. It's, it's a, it's an incredible, it's going to be great. I mean, I'm rooting for the capitalist as a Josh Adam Meyers and I'm [inaudible], you know, and then plus everybody down there, they'd been waiting since 1974 the Redskins suck the nationals, you know, I don't, uh, you know these to be, the senators in the Senate is twice they left.

Speaker 1:          14:24          One time they became the fucking Texas rangers and other time they became the Minnesota twins. Then the fucking expos came down as a nationals and they still haven't won a title. You know, they're on their third fucking marriage. Actually, the senator's did want a title in like the 1920s, I think you don't think went to the fucking White House. Thank George. Washington was still there on it showed up. It's fucking wooden teeth. You have to sit there and listen to some boring story. How he said they made a bet on me. It makes the teeth of his fucking Betsy had as a kid, I'm going to shoot the guy lied his ass off that they had to come up with that dumb ass story about I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't tell a lie. I chopped down the cherry tree. What kind of ass kicking do you think he got over that? You know, when you really think about it, back then there was no supermarkets and this guy just chopped down a fucking tree that actually had edible fruit on it. You know, I'd probably beat him with the ax handle, knock that fucking powdered wig right off his head. Did rich kids wear powdered wigs back then?

Speaker 2:          15:36          You know,

Speaker 1:          15:38          people would come up with key their horse a shit. Fuck you guys. I've been on a plane for 12 hours. I don't give a fuck if this is funny or not. I mean I do, I do care. But uh, anyways, um, anyways, so, uh, I watch game one of the NBA finals.

Speaker 2:          16:00          Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          16:01          And I have to tell you when they fucking reversed that offensive foul call that basically every summit Jr Smith and I can't get mad at Jr Smith cause I didn't know what the score was either when he was dribbling it out. I was going, yes, yes. It was a lot of other people too that thought that thought they were up by one.

Speaker 2:          16:22          MMM.

Speaker 1:          16:23          The game was over on that offensive file. And, uh, you know, I've never seen them have a little POW wow in reverse a call. It's he, I mean, I just, I had like Tourette's when that happened and I was so fucking upset. And so once again, disappointed by the NBA and the way that they fucking run their league, I was so mad. I walked to my show that night. I just, I didn't want to get in the fucking car. I knew I had to go for a fucking why didn't watch the overtime because I knew, I knew the warriors are going to win it. I've watched enough games that went up, fucking want to kick in the balls with a call like that. And then the rain man, dude, and your team doesn't know that you fucking tongue tied and he runs out the, I, you know what's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          17:11          So Lebron knew, that's why he went back to the bench and he didn't talk to anybody. Um, I, I fucking, I had two shows in La and I walked to both of them at one in a dive bar. And then another one at a little more upscale place that wasn't quite a comedy club. And I just, I just walked to both of them. And I can tell you this right now. La has an unbelievable homeless problem. Holy Shit. I mean, they are fucking everywhere. Every doorway, every nook and cranny. There's somebody, you know, wrapped up in a like a fucking cocoon, a lot of mental illness out there. It's unreal. It's really unreal how we just fucking leave those people on the street. You know, mentally ill people.

Speaker 1:          18:08          No, they used to have those as silence. She can't. Yeah. I don't know. That didn't work. I Dunno. I just need to try to take care of him. It was really fucking depressing. Then I was sitting there walking down the street going like, did I really leave the safety of my car to fucking walk amongst all these fucking people who got God knows what kind of issues. Right? And I was standing there and this guy with this really dirty shirt was just staring at me and I'm waiting for the light to say walk. You know, it's La, you can't Jay walk. You'll get killed, right? And then I feel him, he's just staring right at me. I'm like, half the fuck. Here we go. Here we go. Oh, freckles. Couldn't take your car. Could yet get all mad about a basketball game. Right. The guy looks at me and he goes, hey. And I ignore it because hey, I ignore him again. And then he sorta like walked around, sue in my vision. He goes, Hey, I looked at him, I go, what? And he goes, are you Joel Mchale?

Speaker 1:          19:23          I just go, no. Then that said walk and I walked away from and I felt him behind me and I just kept walking. Then I was walking too fast. So then there was somebody in front of me and then he's doing this whole kind of looking back like, why is this guy walking so quick? You know? And I wanted to say that. Yeah, the guy, hey, you don't need to worry about me. It's the guy I'm walking away from. Um, anyways, so that's what the fuck I did after game one. Jesus Christ. But worries have to be the most hateable fucking team I've ever seen in my life. You don't get enough stars on your team. You got to poke Lebron in the eye. Jesus fucking Christ. That's some shit I've fucking girl would do. Plan nerf basketball, fucking disgrace. And then Lebron gets out there with his old ass body, takes a fucking charge. I know his foot was work was moving and I know that after they looked at it, you know, they did get the call. Right? But what the fuck they, they've never reversed something like that ever. So like they were looking for a way for the warriors to fuck it when it was just, it just, uh, I don't, I don't know why I give a shit so much. What do I give a fuck about either one of these teams? I, cause what I'm rooting for is just for sports to go back to the way they used to be,

Speaker 1:          20:53          where, uh, there was still free agency. I'm not that old when I was growing up, but there wasn't these pylons fucking teams, you know, I dunno, somebody sent me a thing about Lebron. Could possibly go to the Celtics. He better not, I don't want that title. You know, I don't know, Bill, you just old and all you do is complain. I know, I'm sorry. I can't, I just realize that the game isn't what it was when I was a kid and this new game, young people seem to be enjoying it. Don't have a problem with it. Should be the way where they had it. When I was a kid, there was an old man playing an organ. Um, anyways, uh, let me do a little bit advertising rates. There's this podcast. I'm not going gonna make an hour.

Well that's nice. It's nice that they're doing that. I better meet who at my age sends out an Emoji. Do you know you don't have emojis? I use I all the one that I used the most thumbs up.

Speaker 3:          35:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:45          Thumbs up. See what I love about thumbs up is it means, uh, yes I definitely want to do that. Or it means like fucking whatever. We got to get together sometime man. Hang out, thumbs up, not fucking hanging out with you. Right. Or it could be like, fuck yeah, get out there fucking drank. Um, all right. I should have made a top 10 lists of what I could do. What am, what am I going to do here to make my fifties you know, the best me lived your truth. Do you realize like the amount of shit that's going on in the world right now. Okay. And just to how self involved myself and club and literally doing a podcast, just talking to myself, how's fucking self involved? The world is right now, you know, live your truth. Be the best. You've fifty's the new 40 you know, everything has to be like, I'm on. That's, that's, that's why you got those fucking assholes who work out in the garage and then they start running down the streets. Everybody knows the crossfit people. Right? Everybody knows they're working out. It's like we get it, Yo, I work out too. I don't get to fucking start yelling at people who haven't brunch.

Speaker 1:          37:09          I don't know if you know something that, that right there, you remember a few years ago they decided to do away with bullying. All right. Which you know, is a great thing, but I think you should be able to bully adults because the fact that that's, you know, it's not, it's out of style to bully people.

Speaker 3:          37:27          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:27          I think is how crossfit actually exists. You know, if you basically categorize any sort of criticism is bullying, you know, how do you gonna know when you're acting like a complete fucking tool shed? I, I just don't understand. I don't find those crossfit people to be in any better shape than anybody else doing any other workout. And they had just parading up and down the fucking street. Like, I don't know what, like, they're inspirational. I Dunno. I've never liked, you know, I don't like people that do end zone dances. I just don't like any of that shit. It's just fucking, and it's just, it gives me Douche chills to look at it. I Dunno. Maybe it's a good workout. I'm going to start doing that, you know, through pull ups in my garage and then run up and down my driveway yelling shit. So my neighbors know that I just did a set of 10 fucking pullups.

Speaker 1:          38:26          Yeah. Fill in the pan. Um, Lebron is Celtic here. Kay has a question. Hey there, Billy. Not Quite from Boston. Uh, what if Lebron went to Boston? Kind of goes without saying that winning with Lebron wouldn't feel as good as winning without Lebron thoughts. Oh, Jesus Christ. What am I the president? You just fucking give me a half ass fucking question. I gotta answer. I don't know. Yeah, obviously, obviously I'm a, yeah, I would rather beat Lebron and fucking have him just joined my team and then everybody be like, well, it's a fucking pile on team, but gives a shit about your championship. Yeah, obviously. Thank you, sir. Those are my thoughts. I have the obvious thought on that. Now. I don't want that to happen. I would like us to continue doing what we're doing. We already signed a big free agent with a, what's his face there that hurt his knee?

Speaker 1:          39:24          Uh, ginger Vitus what the fuck is his name? I Dunno. I'm not, I'm on a selfie. I'm not, not a sound something. I'm just not a basketball guy. Um, and I missed all the games this year. All right. I got a kid, man. I got a kid in. I, I miss a lot of stuff. The guy with the beard who thinks the world is flat, right? Is that the guy that's the guy that go, I just want to see, you know, it's like the New York Yankees, New York Yankees, you know, they, they, they, they built off of their farm team and drafting and all that fucking shit. And then they added one that, that's fucking stud from the Marlin's there. Can't get mad at that.

Speaker 2:          40:01          MMM.

Speaker 1:          40:02          Wait, a couple of shrewd trades. We did give up Isaiah Thomas stuff, who I swear to God, if he's still was still with the Celtics, he would've got his own. He was like, he's going to be a big Papi of the Celtics a way I love a tail bill. Did you hear this? Did you hear about this whale?

Speaker 2:          40:24          MMM.

Speaker 1:          40:25          By the way, has anybody seen that fucking video, that poor girl calling up her ex boyfriend crying? It's, she literally sounds like the impression me and Paul do when we, when we do the crying thing, poo or she'd be like, hello, I'm sorry I missed your call. I really hope you call me back. I love you and I do want to say that I love you and I miss you.

Speaker 3:          41:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          41:00          I'm not even, I'm not even exaggerating. I'm really sad that I missed your call.

Speaker 3:          41:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          41:09          you fucking unbelievable. All right. Pilot whale dies in Thailand after being found with 17 pounds of plastic bags and its stomach. Yeah. And also so get excited because they have fucking ginger emojis.

Speaker 2:          41:25          Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          41:28          This is just what? What are we, what are we doing?

Speaker 1:          41:34          Oh Man. A male pilot. Whales struggled for five days to stay alive and Thailand near the Malaysian border. I'll tell you, it's fucking crazy, is those ocean currents of everyone. They think, oh, it's from their, their plot, Malaysian plastic bags. It's probably, you know, from fucking big fives sports in La. Um, Thailand near Malaysian border after rescues found 17 pounds of plastic bags and its stomach. Yeah, you can't just eat one. They like Doritos. The Washington Post reported on a Sunday, but it ultimately succumb to its illness. The whale died on Friday, the post road in and I tossed it. We discovered that Thailand's department of Marine and coastal resource said, we're 80 plastic bags lodged in his stomach. It's far from the first time whales have turned up sick or dead from ingesting trash experts say that the whale likely believed the bags for food.

Speaker 2:          42:32          Uh, God.

Speaker 1:          42:33          So what are we gonna do about it? What is the solution? Plastic pollution throughout the region is, okay, wait a minute. Let's see this. Is there anything positive here? According to another report by the nation. A 2015 study by the Ocean Conservatory and Mckinsey Center for Business and environment found that Thailand was the world's six worst offender for dumping plastics into the sea. So who's number one violence pollution control department says plastic waste is increasing by roughly 12% annual with only 25% being reused. The v, that's pretty good that we were used 25% that's better than what we used to do. The vast majority of it is plastic bags. The Bangkok Post writes that the 23 we're never going to get that shit out of the ocean by the way. It's like we just switched the cloth bags.

Speaker 2:          43:28          Oh my God,

Speaker 1:          43:30          we are a fucking plague with shoes. Bill Hicks said that fucking 25 years ago, the Bangkok Post writes that the 23 coastal provinces in Thailand generate around 11 million tons of garbage daily at those would be a year of which approximately 1.1 million tons ends up being dumped directly into the sea. Plastic pollution throughout the region is expected to remain a significant issue. As many Asian countries are experiencing economic growth that is outpacing waste management infrastructure. Here's the thing. When the fuck do you put it? You know what I mean? I Dunno. This is when you, this is when you need hipsters because they're going to go, go back to biodegradable shit. Just trying to be cool, but they're actually going to create a, hopefully, I don't know. Oh boy. What the fuck are we doing? These fucking corporations, what are they doing?

Speaker 1:          44:34          Which is all about the fucking money. They don't give a fuck wars pollution. They don't kill kids. They don't give a fuck, and none of these fucking politicians as a goddamn thing about it. It's just fucking unreal because they need the corporations money. It's just, it's literally, it's like a suicide pact. How the fuck do you get out of that? Ah, this is the press like the Irish News. It's depressing. All right. Massachusetts male mentality. All right, here we go. Hey Bill. I'm excited to be going to show, uh, your Boston show in the fall, by the way, man. I transcribed that fucking Metallica song and it might double Bass player is finally coming together. I've just been sticking with it. Now of course we're going to be on the road for a couple of weeks, but I'll get it back up to speed. Um, you know, Lars has like these four or five signature licks and once you get those things down you can kind of do a real shitty version of all of their songs.

Speaker 1:          45:33          I still suck, but like I can actually see I'm starting to be able to play along. Um, I can definitely do like the 16th note thing, but he does that little, that triplet before the snare with a crash, uh, China that he always does that. Yeah, that one's a little tough. Uh, love your podcast. It's one of the things that keeps me saying. All right, I appreciate when you say positive things about your relationship with your wife and now you're so glad to be on the other side. I'm a 42 year old single female and it's downright depressing around here. I've been married so don't need to do that again. We just like to meet someone who wants a steady monogamous relationship. Unfortunately, the guys around here seem to obtain their intimacy from their relationship with their male friends. Women are viewed as an afterthought at best, but usually as a nuisance or a threat or you're in Massachusetts.

Speaker 1:          46:27          I, this is easy. It's an easy fix. Get into sports, get into sports, start watching sports, increase your alcohol intake and your guy will be your best friend you ever had a, why do guys have a mob mentality when it comes to women? They seem to think it's giving up to settle down, but don't they fear being alone later in life? Why grown men care what their friends think and why wouldn't they be happy? They are. Boy is living with living a fulfilling life. I'm cute in decent shape. I'd say I'm a seven and a half in the looks department and you're humble and being serious. Yeah, decent shape. You know, you're honest. Have a fun personality, can support myself. I don't care about having kids, but the schmucks I've been dealing with lately make me feel like giving up altogether and another mystery to solve.

Speaker 1:          47:23          Why do my friends and I frequently see good looking? Why do my friends and I pregnancy good looking guys with women who look miserable? If you would mind taking a few minutes to wax philosophical on the benefits of relationship with the opposite sex, that would be great. Happy Birthday from a fellow Gemini. Um, all right. Why they got wire guys afraid to settle down? Well, uh, because women take guys for everything they've got in divorce court all the fucking time. All right. And like there's only so many of those fucking nightmares that you can, you can watch, um, before you're like, why the fuck would I want to do that? I mean, that was my attitudes for the longest God damn time. And um, when you get into a relationship, a lot of times you are at the mercy of the females moods and you know, there's, you know, there's all this shit out here right now talking about all this shit that guy's do to women.

Speaker 1:          48:29          All this horrible shit, but, uh, I went and put the, you know, the winds, the turn and pull back a little bit and talk about, you know, just this constant fucking like, you know, keeping you on eggshells. You know, keep it happy, keep it happy, keep her happy, you know, that happy, happy wife. Happy life is what they say. There's no rhyme for the debt. There isn't. So, you know, and everything is about you guys. I'm just being honest. You know the weddings all about you. Valentine's Day is all about you, the anniversaries, all about you. It's all the guy. What are you going to get her? And it's like, it's all geared that you are so fucking privileged and lucky to have this person, but there's really not that sort of reciprocal mentality. So, um, but when you're a single guy, you know, you got the world by the balls, we make more, more money an hour at dairy queen evidently, or whatever the fuck it is that you guys are saying.

Speaker 1:          49:29          It's happens in, you know, you hang out, you watch sports, you go down in the bar, you talk some shit. Maybe get laid, get up fucking blow job, and you wake up the next day, not in a relationship that's really appealing and you still have all your money or a lot of it, it's appealing. Um, I would also, you know, so I don't know. I'm not, I'm not, I know you want me to say something positive. I'm just answering that first thing. Um, you guys are terrifying and you act like you're not when you're talking to men, but amongst yourselves, you know, amongst yourself. I'm sure you're a little more honest about like, you know, the sanity of, uh, you know, so many women out there. Yes. There's just fucking nuts. The fuck them. They'll get pregnant on purpose. I mean, that they're fucking, they'll bring a into the fucking world. I mean, crazy fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          50:34          MMM.

Speaker 1:          50:35          God, I got to try to see something positive here. Jesus Christ. Uh, why you haven't Prob, well, you know, you're also like, you're like me. You waited a while.

Speaker 2:          50:47          MMM.

Speaker 1:          50:48          All those people that are like want to find love and all that. You know, you got a draft in the earlier rounds when you're in your 20s, there was a bunch of blue chip prospects there. Now you're in your 42. You got to try to find your six round draft. Tom Brady, that's what you have to do. So it's going to be more work. Um, but I somehow pulled it off.

Speaker 2:          51:11          MMM.

Speaker 1:          51:12          Grant, but I was 35. She was 25.

Speaker 2:          51:17          I Dunno,

Speaker 1:          51:18          I moved up in the draft. That's what I did. Maybe you want to date a younger guy. I Dunno, but I always looked at it this way that you know, you're, you know, if you're out there and you seem cool, you're out there, there's going to be your, your match is going to be out there. But like it's, it's dangerous as I just trashed women to go down that road to say they're all like this or why do so many people, blah, blah, blah. You start getting fucking jaded. And the reality is you could do that about anything. Why are most people fucking inconsiderate? Why are most people fucking morons white? Most people stand in a security line. At the airport, rolling their eyes, looking at you bonding at like, can you believe how long this is taking? And then they do nothing to be prepared for when it's their time, when it's show time, they just start to take the fucking belt off and all that and they become the fucking problem. They don't notice it. Okay. That's why I'm meeting somebody. Awesome. It's so fucking special cause there's not a lot of them out there. So you hang in there and I think you're going to find the person that wants to have the relationship you want, that you want. And I think the relationship you're looking for is what a lot of guys are probably looking for around your age. Right.

Speaker 1:          52:31          If I was you, I'd get a divorce seat. They're already had his fucking kids already did that bullshit. And then he can just fucking, you know, hang with you. You're not looking to get married and you're looking at have any fucking kids you can just fucking hang out and drink. Cape Cod is and watch the pets. Then you go bang, Bang, boom. I solve your problem. Probably not. A wife wants to use my computer. Oh Jesus. What? He got a bunch of porn on there. Hey, Billy Bob Burton. I've been with my girl for five years and married for one and I refuse to let her use my computer isn't because of porn or cheating is because my PC is worth close to 20 grand. I used to work for graphic designer animator and gaming a. I didn't know they made laptops worth that much. I even had it set up. So I am not. So if I'm not within three feet of it,

Speaker 1:          53:28          it is locked. I have a piece of jewelry with an RF ID chip that unlocks my PC when I'm near it. Well, I got news for you. Do it. Anybody who wants, who knows anything about computers can turn that fucking thing on from a different computer when they're not even in the fucking room. I guarantee, uh, I told her even before we were married that she will never use my computer. She has never had a phone that wasn't cracked or broken in the last time she brought up my computer, I bought her a thousand dollars PC of her own, which she lost within a week. Am I being too unreasonable or am I right? Not Wanting to ruin my computer. Do you let Nia use your computer? Uh, yes I do, but like my computer's a fucking mess. Um, no, I don't think, you know, she hasn't demonstrated that she is, you can take care of shit. Here's the thing. If she, if she was saying you couldn't use hers, if my wife was like, you can't use my computer, this is super expensive. I do graphic designer ivy. I don't want to use your fucking computer. I hate computers. Have Fun with your computer, you know, but um,

Speaker 2:          54:36          you know,

Speaker 1:          54:38          it probably makes her insecure because that is where porn and cheating and all that shit fucking happens. So I'm choosing to believe you when this, if you're not doing that shit, and if it truly is because you have this awesome fucking $20,000 fucking computer,

Speaker 2:          54:56          uh,

Speaker 1:          54:57          then yeah, I, I don't, I don't know what the problem is. I would just sit there. You know what I would do? I would take her phone. Yeah. I would open my laptop and then I'd have her phone right next to it, you know, with the cracked screen. I go, look at your phone, look at my computer. What's the difference? Oh, get your PC to honey. Oh, that's right. You lost it. You lost it. That's right. So now what have we learned here? And this is the thing. Let her get mad. She's going to fucking storm away and be all fucking mad. And then once again, like I was talking about in that previous one, she's gonna, you know, do that whole thing where I'm, you know, I'm saying the cal Dunnigan are mad at. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          55:41          yeah,

Speaker 1:          55:43          she's just going to do that shit. And you know what letter you just, you just, you said over that power all you want. You know I'm right, and then they'll get mad. They'll, they'll switch out of the pouty thing. Then they get fucking mad. It's a whole goddamn process. Just be like, no, you can't. You. I would hold my ground on that one. Just say, listen. Over the next year, if you demonstrate that you can actually be around computers without breaking them or losing them, you know, maybe in 12 months I'll let you look over my shoulder.

Speaker 2:          56:20          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          56:22          just tell her that's not how life works. You have to earn things. All right? Most of us do anyways, but you wouldn't know that. Listen to all these fucking feminists out there. I think if you're a guy, you just fucking show up. People give you shit. I'm so hoping it becomes a level playing field. I can't wait. I cannot wait. That's going to be the greatest fucking thing ever. When they realize what a giant shit sandwich, they still have to eat. Oh, it looked appetizing when you were peeking over the fence, didn't it sweetheart? All right, that's it. Everybody. That's the podcast here. Uh, thank you to everybody over here in Ireland. Even before I do the show. Thank you for everybody for a buying tickets to come out to the show. It's an honor and a privilege to be here and you beautiful and reliable.

Speaker 1:          57:11          And uh, I hope we give you monies worth tomorrow night. Uh, go capitols and eight. I also like the Vegas Knights to their coach gave a speech or something, but GM at the beginning of the year and an expansion franchise if you don't watch hockey. And he said, all you guys in this locker room are here for the exact same reason. The last team you played for didn't think you are worth being protected me right there. They got the chip on their shoulder and they'd been fucking mowing every, everybody, everybody down ever since until they ran into the Washington capitals. Um, I'm going to try to find a way to somehow watch that game, although I think tonight comes on at like two in the morning, so I might be fucked.

Speaker 2:          57:50          MMM.

Speaker 1:          57:53          And I dunno if I can't, I can't watch the fucking NBA Huda fuck reviews a charging call. The final few. I've never seen that before. My fuck. Oh my God. You know, but thank God they did. Thank God they did because I was able to, I didn't have to waste time watching the rest of the fucking game. And then I, you know, I, you know, went for a nice brisk walk is good for my hat. Um, that's it. Guess what people were into June, which means we are only two months away from the start of football season preseason just like that. It's coming around again and the God knows the way. There's like four days off between every fucking NBA game. You're probably just going to have to do a, you know, the last week of June and July and then you're going to be right there and you're going to be right there.

Speaker 1:          58:44          Although I've gotten back into baseball, some back corner that giants game and keeping score, eating the peanuts, drinking that pocket course. I liked it. You know, I went down and bought some cigars the other day. Right? Oh, Bill. Yeah. Eat French fries, you smoking cigars and drinking beer, what are you doing? But joy myself, um, I walked into this cigar shop and I can be honest with, and I walked in there, you know, it's also a lounge where people could smoke and shit. And I have never seen anybody smoking a cigar who did not look like they would just totally fucking relaxed. Absolutely. Absolutely. In heaven, you know,

Speaker 1:          59:22          like true cigar smokers. I walk in no time. I walk in, I have to go look at that guy just sitting there because I always have shit to do. So I run in and I buy them and then I run out. But I would see people just sitting there and I think that's what the, that's how you do it. Come down in the middle of the day, honey, I'm going out for a minute. Where are you going? Not your person is. Who is she? Her name is low. Uh, Aurora emeralds. Lao, Aurora, Emerald. All right, that's it. Everybody. I will see you tomorrow night if you're here in Dublin. If not, I'll check it on your, on Thursday.
