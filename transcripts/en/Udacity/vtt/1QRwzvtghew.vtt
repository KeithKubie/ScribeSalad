00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.218
Consciousness is truly an amazing phenomenon. Now think about it, you, as this

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:08.695
collection of atoms, obeying the laws of physics, can be aware. You're aware of

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:11.885
your mental activity, of your emotional state, even of your external

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:13.425
environment.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.656
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right. Have you ever been so involved in a task, such as writing a paper

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:21.849
or playing a game, that you've lost track of time? Or perhaps you've been

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.846
daydreaming at work when you should really be working. Or have you ever

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:29.803
wondered what happens when people take mind altering drugs? These are all

00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:33.642
examples of questions related to the study of consciousness.

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:36.666
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now as you're going to see, consciousness can be measured on a continuum, from

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.148
fully conscious.

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:40.822
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For example when you're awake and aware of your surroundings.

00:00:40.822 --> 00:00:42.215
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; To not conscious at all.

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:45.880
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For example if you were in a coma and unaware of your surroundings. In fact

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.900
Grey has a personal example that he's going to share with us.
