00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.260
- Hello teachers.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.800
I'm Sal Khan, found of the
not for profit Khan Academy

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.480
and I'm here to announce a nationwide

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.409
back to school learning
challenge called LearnStorm.

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.290
LearnStorm is an exciting
way to jump start

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.410
your school year around
learning activities.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.240
It's designed to motivate
your students and to help

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.410
build their growth mindset.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.510
- This year was amazing with LearnStorm.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.310
I had a group of students that couldn't

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.100
add, subtract, multiply
or divide fractions.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.370
They avoided it at all costs.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.180
But since it was an assignment,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.660
they would try it and they
would eventually do much better.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.100
And what was amazing was that
the lower achieving students

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.300
were able to see that they
were part of something huge.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.410
They were able to contribute
and that, I thought,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.580
boosted their self-confidence,
their self-esteem

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.610
and I didn't realize that would happen

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.007
after doing LearnStorm.

00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.590
(upbeat music)

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.070
- LearnStorm is a good
way to differentiate

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.510
and as well as motivate and
with the growth mindset pieces

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.278
you can also educate them about

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.990
why it's important to
learn, how they learn,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.150
how their body is set up to learn,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.470
what strategies help them learn.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.202
It's amazing, it's amazing and it's free.

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:21.310
(chuckling)

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.730
It's free.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.180
- We think this is really
going to motivate your students

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.890
to understand, to
appreciate that they truly

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.770
can learn anything.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.350
The activities have been designed to have

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.390
measurable gains in learning attitudes.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.624
- LearnStorm made everything fun.

00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:39.061
Like learning fun.

00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.989
LearnStorm helped me
build more confidence in

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:45.000
believing in myself that I can do this.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.990
I don't really think I
would go through high school

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.650
without it.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.280
- One thing I learned from
the growth mindset activities

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.780
is that your intelligence can grow

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.100
just like your muscles grow
and that's something that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.969
really stuck with me 'cause
I didn't know that before.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.610
- I did over 300 lessons in one week.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.690
I felt proud of myself
getting all these good grades.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.160
- It helps the students tremendously.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.620
Their confidence is higher,
they're able to do it

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.410
and it warms my heart that
they think that way now

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.540
and they know that they can keep going

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.280
and keep growing and nothing
will stand in their way.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.010
- So together as we jump
start this school year,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.870
I look forward for all of us
living the LearnStorm motto,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.072
to keep going and to keep growing.

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:34.072
- [Students] Run deep, run
deep, run deep, run deep.
