00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149
in cosmology we believe that the

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159
in cosmology we believe that the
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.030
in cosmology we believe that the
universe started off in a Big Bang 13.7

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040
universe started off in a Big Bang 13.7
 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.120
universe started off in a Big Bang 13.7
billion years ago all alternatives have

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
billion years ago all alternatives have
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.100
billion years ago all alternatives have
been pretty much ruled out steady-state

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110
been pretty much ruled out steady-state
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.200
been pretty much ruled out steady-state
theories other alternatives have been

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
theories other alternatives have been
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.930
theories other alternatives have been
ruled out however how will the universe

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
ruled out however how will the universe
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.710
ruled out however how will the universe
end we have several possibilities one

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
end we have several possibilities one
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.260
end we have several possibilities one
possibility is a Big Crunch when the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
possibility is a Big Crunch when the
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.929
possibility is a Big Crunch when the
universe squashes together in a gigantic

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
universe squashes together in a gigantic
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.080
universe squashes together in a gigantic
ball of flame and maybe bangs once again

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
ball of flame and maybe bangs once again
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300
ball of flame and maybe bangs once again
another possibility is the big freeze

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
another possibility is the big freeze
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.970
another possibility is the big freeze
that the universe expands it just keeps

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
that the universe expands it just keeps
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.889
that the universe expands it just keeps
on going and we're all going to freeze

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
on going and we're all going to freeze
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.190
on going and we're all going to freeze
to death and we're all going to die when

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
to death and we're all going to die when
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.220
to death and we're all going to die when
the universe reaches near absolute zero

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230
the universe reaches near absolute zero
 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.299
the universe reaches near absolute zero
then there's something called the big

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
then there's something called the big
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369
then there's something called the big
rip where the universe goes into an

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
rip where the universe goes into an
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.549
rip where the universe goes into an
exponential expansion and expand so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
exponential expansion and expand so
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.330
exponential expansion and expand so
rapidly that the distant galaxies can no

the distant galaxies break the light
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.290
the distant galaxies break the light
barrier and that's called the big rip

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300
barrier and that's called the big rip
 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.580
barrier and that's called the big rip
meaning that the night sky will be

meaning that the night sky will be
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.340
meaning that the night sky will be
totally black except for some of the

alternatives is the fate of the universe
well the short answer is we don't know

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520
well the short answer is we don't know
 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.219
well the short answer is we don't know
however what we do know is that the

however what we do know is that the
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560
however what we do know is that the
universe is undergoing an exponential

every astronomy textbook says that there
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140
every astronomy textbook says that there
was the Big Bang the universe is

says that the universe is mainly made

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
says that the universe is mainly made
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.249
says that the universe is mainly made
out of atoms every textbook says that

which makes up most of the universe is
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.809
which makes up most of the universe is
dark energy and unfortunately we are

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
dark energy and unfortunately we are
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.720
dark energy and unfortunately we are
clueless as to what dark energy is and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
clueless as to what dark energy is and
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.400
clueless as to what dark energy is and
what dark matter is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
what dark matter is
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.520
what dark matter is
in fact if you ever find out what dark

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
in fact if you ever find out what dark
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.160
in fact if you ever find out what dark
energy and dark matter is be sure to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170
energy and dark matter is be sure to
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.700
energy and dark matter is be sure to
tell me first now why is that important

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710
tell me first now why is that important
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.890
tell me first now why is that important
because the amount of matter and energy

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900
because the amount of matter and energy
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.320
because the amount of matter and energy
in the universe determines the rate of

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
in the universe determines the rate of
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.630
in the universe determines the rate of
expansion we now know there's a lot more

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
expansion we now know there's a lot more
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.130
expansion we now know there's a lot more
dark energy that we previously thought

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
dark energy that we previously thought
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.090
dark energy that we previously thought
therefore the universe is undergoing an

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100
therefore the universe is undergoing an
 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.510
therefore the universe is undergoing an
inflationary exponential expansion it is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
inflationary exponential expansion it is
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.000
inflationary exponential expansion it is
in a runaway mode but here's the catch

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
in a runaway mode but here's the catch
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.360
in a runaway mode but here's the catch
we don't know how long that runaway mode

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
we don't know how long that runaway mode
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.640
we don't know how long that runaway mode
is going to last some people say that

itself instead of a red shift will have
a blue shift as the universe collapses

at the present time we simply don't know
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.510
at the present time we simply don't know

bigger than 10 to the 120 so this is a

bigger than 10 to the 120 so this is a
 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.610
bigger than 10 to the 120 so this is a

thoughts are that perhaps we will

thoughts are that perhaps we will
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.510
thoughts are that perhaps we will
continue with this exponential expansion

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520
continue with this exponential expansion
 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.540
continue with this exponential expansion
and perhaps go into a big rip mode and

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550
and perhaps go into a big rip mode and
 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.090
and perhaps go into a big rip mode and
at that point all intelligent life in

at that point all intelligent life in
 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.690
at that point all intelligent life in
the universe will die all the tears and

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700
the universe will die all the tears and

the universe will die all the tears and
all the struggles and all the heartbreak

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740
all the struggles and all the heartbreak
 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.820
all the struggles and all the heartbreak
of humanity since we rose from the swamp

of humanity since we rose from the swamp
it's all for nothing why should you

it's all for nothing why should you
 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.310
it's all for nothing why should you
bother to wake up tomorrow knowing that

we're all going to die billions and
billions of years from now when the

billions of years from now when the

about to die
why not leave the universe trillions of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300
why not leave the universe trillions of
 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.420
why not leave the universe trillions of
years from now we will have the ability

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430
years from now we will have the ability
 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.950
years from now we will have the ability
to bend space and time into a pretzel

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960
to bend space and time into a pretzel
 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.990
to bend space and time into a pretzel
we'll be able to tie space into knots

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000
we'll be able to tie space into knots
 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.930
we'll be able to tie space into knots
we'll be what is called a type 3 maybe a

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940
we'll be what is called a type 3 maybe a
 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.689

type 4 civilization a galactic
 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.119
type 4 civilization a galactic
civilization with the capability of

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129
civilization with the capability of
 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.270
civilization with the capability of
harnessing galactic power at that point

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280
harnessing galactic power at that point
 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.850

us escape the universe go into

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759
us escape the universe go into
 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.190
us escape the universe go into
hyperspace and go to another universe
