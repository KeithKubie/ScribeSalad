00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.900
In today's installment of Collab Week,
I am joined by the brilliant and breezy Louise, 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.210
also known as Sprinkleofglitter, and we'll be
collaborating through the medium of painting. 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.720
LOUSIE: I would like to paint me and
you filming a collab. CHARLIE: Okay. 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.400
LOUISE: So it'll be a collab
in a collab in a collab.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.610
CHARLIE: Okay, I like that a lot.
I'll draw myself. 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.770
LOUISE: No, no. You should
draw me and I'll draw you. 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.380
CHARLIE: Okay, so you just stay there.
LOUISE: Okay. Oh, you're an actual artist, then. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.360
CHARLIE: Well, just a little. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.780
LOUISE: I would have just drawn a circle
and been like, "There's your face." 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.890
CHARLIE: So, one of your
hands on your hip. 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.360
LOUISE: Oh, yeah, yeah,
I like what you're doing there. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.140
CHARLIE: And that's your hand.
Put a paintbrush in your hand. 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.500
LOUISE: Charlie, I can't wait for you to see
what I'm going to paint for you here. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.300
CHARLIE: God, this is going
to take so long to paint.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.440
LOUISE: Here's your face.
CHARLIE: Okay.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.200
LOUISE: And your hair. There we go. 
CHARLIE: Yep, that's about right. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.550
LOUISE: Ahh! I can't draw! Okay. 
CHARLIE: There you go. LOUISE: Very tall. 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.600
CHARLIE: That's lovely.
LOUISE: Done!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.870
CHARLIE: That's the drawing bit.
What do we start with? LOUISE: Painting.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.910
CHARLIE: Yes.
LOUISE: Okay, I've gone outside the lines.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.580
CHARLIE: That's alright.
And the pink bits at the end. 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.400
LOUISE: I feel like I'm letting down
charlieissocoollike, the channel, 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.940
like after you've done
videos on science 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.760
and you get some pink imbecile like
painting this awful picture of you. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.090
CHARLIE: I'm perfectly happy with it.
Anyone else who doesn't like it can deal with it. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.590
That's some thick paint
right there. Oh, Jesus. 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.390
LOUISE: You can really get the
texture of your hair, though. 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.720
CHARLIE: My brain is leaking
or something over here. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.650
LOUISE: Let's see, I want to
do pink for your skin. 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.190
CHARLIE: It's quite hard
to do skin, though. 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.690
LOUISE: I think this whole
project is hard, if I'm honest.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.200
CHARLIE: Wow.
I feel bad for myself.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.400
LOUISE: Ta da!
CHARLIE: I just noticed my mouth. Oh no!

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.620
Why did you put a piece of
poo in my mouth? 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.150
LOUISE: That's your smile.
CHARLIE: That's my smile?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.490
LOUISE: That's your winning smile.
I've given up with the paint brushes. 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.630
Cut out the middleman,
that's what I say, Charlie. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.490
CHARLIE: It's working for you,
clearly. Alright. 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.380
LOUISE: "Clearly." That was
a bit of sass from Charlie. 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.920
What color eyes do you have, blue or green? 
CHARLIE: I have blue eyes. 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.990
LOUISE: Let's say they're green
because I've already done a lot of blue.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.170
Let's say they're a viridian hue. This is what
like...um...what's that one that did those ones? 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.080
CHARLIE: The one that
did those ones? 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.060
LOUISE: Van Gogh, this is what
he did it like. Like textured. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.750
CHARLIE: Like even the fact that he is a painter
and you are painting isn't necessarily 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.760
a link I want to make between
this and Van Gogh. 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.700
LOUISE: I don't think he would mind.
All art is art, isn't it. CHARLIE: I guess so. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.620
LOUISE: Do you want to be
doing yellow shoes today? 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.800
CHARLIE: Yeah, why not?
LOUISE: It's like mustard. 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.930
CHARLIE: So it's sort of like I've got like bloody
poo in my mouth and like mustardy poo. 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.690
Fun fact: did you know that
at this point in the proceedings, 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.700
one of the cameras stopped recording
and we didn't realize? So, skip to the end. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.110
Here we are explaining
everything we did. 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.200
TOGETHER: Ta da! CHARLIE: Okay, so now let's
explain everything that you just missed

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.190
LOUISE: So I did sort of some of
astronomy with our star and the stars.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.980
This is Charlie being very excited
but also maybe...shot. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.650
CHARLIE: So this is my heart just here.
LOUISE: And there's his hands and a cup of tea.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.490
CHARLIE: I heard you say that
you were going to do tea. 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.090
LOUISE: There it is. CHARLIE: I didn't really
realize that that was what-- 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.380
LOUISE: Look it's just right there.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.960
LOUISE: And what my favorite part of
you is is your glasses and eyes. 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.350
Beautiful. If I was a painting girl,
I'd fall in love with you. 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.140
CHARLIE: This is basically exactly what you look.
I've managed to recreate you perfectly. 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.970
LOUISE: It is like looking in
the mirror. Wait, look.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.040
And also, what you missed is we
named it "Collab Attack."

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.510
CHARLIE: I didn't actually notice this when
we were filming: I misspelled "Collab." 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.480
LOUISE: I did notice that
when we were filming, 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.130
but I didn't want to say
because I was like, "Oh, no..." 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.490
CHARLIE: Well, I'm still proud
of it. Collab Attack. 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.630
LOUISE: Me too. It's a master piece.
CHARLIE: I think we did a good job. 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.520
Yay! Collabed together. Woo!
Thank you for watching. 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.670
LOUISE: Thank you, Charlie.
That was fun. I love you. Bye! 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.950
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.770
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.650
Lumbly-jumbly. Thank you
very much for watching, 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.510
and if you'd like to watch the other two
collaboration videos from this week, 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.740
you know what to do.
Goodbye! 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.065
SILENCE
