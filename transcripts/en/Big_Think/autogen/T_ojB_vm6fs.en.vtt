where I envisioned this murder and it
 

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:36.110
where I envisioned this murder and it
made me realize how how desperate human

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120
made me realize how how desperate human
 

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.490
made me realize how how desperate human
beings could become and the best thing I

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500
beings could become and the best thing I
 

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.340
beings could become and the best thing I
could say out of it is that it I was

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:43.350
could say out of it is that it I was
 

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.440
could say out of it is that it I was
able to use it in sort of a therapeutic

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:45.450
able to use it in sort of a therapeutic
 

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.620
able to use it in sort of a therapeutic
way in my in my art to be able to

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:48.630
