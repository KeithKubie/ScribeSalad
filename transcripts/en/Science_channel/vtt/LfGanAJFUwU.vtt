00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.039
Narrator: DIGITAL PROJECTORS.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.374
THEY CREATE DAZZLING IMAGES

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:10.309
WITH INCREDIBLE RESOLUTION.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.145
BUT HOW CAN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.147
PRODUCE ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION
MOVING IMAGES

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:17.083
THAT EVEN FILM CAN'T BEAT?

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.787
AT THE HEART OF THE PROJECTOR,

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:24.556
A HIGH-PRECISION PRISM
SPLITS WHITE LIGHT

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:28.294
INTO PRIMARY COLORS...

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:32.632
AND THEN BEAMS IT
ONTO THREE MICROCHIPS.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.402
ON THEIR SURFACES,
8.8 MILLION MIRRORS

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.338
SMALLER THAN A PINPRICK.

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:43.442
THEY FLICKER
ON MICROSCOPIC HINGES

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:47.746
TO SPLIT UP THE LIGHT BEAM
INTO 8.8 MILLION PIXELS

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:52.251
THAT FORM A MOVING IMAGE.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:55.855
THE PRISM MERGES THE LIGHT
FROM THE 3 CHIPS

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:59.859
TO PRODUCE 281 TRILLION
SHADES OF COLOR.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:06.766
THE PROJECTOR CONSUMES
1,600 WATTS OF POWER

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.635
AND GENERATES INTENSE AREAS
OF HEAT

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:12.138
THAT COULD RUIN
THE PROJECTOR'S IMAGE.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.577
SO, 105 METAL SPIKES

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.047
DRAW HEAT
FROM EACH OF THE CHIPS.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:29.155
THREE FEET OF METAL TUBING PUMPS
FOUR PINTS OF LIQUID COOLANT

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.958
TO CHILL THE BANKS OF LASERS.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:37.763
AND 19 FANS,
SPINNING 3,000 TIMES A MINUTE,

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:42.334
EXPEL ENOUGH HEAT
TO BOIL A POT OF WATER.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:47.373
SO, THIS MACHINE CAN SHOW MOVIES
WITHOUT GOING INTO MELTDOWN.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:56.215
THANKS TO DECADES
OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION,

00:01:56.215 --> 00:02:00.687
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY PRODUCES
THE MOST FAULTLESS IMAGES

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.057
THAT MOVIE THEATERS
HAVE EVER SEEN.
