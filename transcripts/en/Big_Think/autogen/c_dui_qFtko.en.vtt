imaging the earth is something that we
 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.460
imaging the earth is something that we
sometimes call structural seismology but

that stuff move and seismology is really

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320
that stuff move and seismology is really
 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.439
that stuff move and seismology is really
a remote sensing tool for us to try to

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449
a remote sensing tool for us to try to
 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.130
a remote sensing tool for us to try to
understand that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140
 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.600
but one of one of the wonderful things

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610
but one of one of the wonderful things
 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.710
but one of one of the wonderful things
that has happened in the earth sciences

over the last 40 years is what we call
 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.899
over the last 40 years is what we call
the theory of plate tectonics and plate

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909
the theory of plate tectonics and plate
 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.420
the theory of plate tectonics and plate
tectonics really is a very descriptive

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430
tectonics really is a very descriptive
 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.510
tectonics really is a very descriptive
working hypothesis that allows us to

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520
working hypothesis that allows us to
 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.340
working hypothesis that allows us to
take diverse sets of observations and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350
take diverse sets of observations and
 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.810
take diverse sets of observations and
put them together and see if we can

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
put them together and see if we can
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.670

whole works but plate tectonics really

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560
whole works but plate tectonics really
 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.609
whole works but plate tectonics really
is just a kinematic theory what that

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619
is just a kinematic theory what that
 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.219
is just a kinematic theory what that
means is that it really only describes

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
means is that it really only describes
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.800
means is that it really only describes
the motions of the plates how fast they

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810
the motions of the plates how fast they
 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.980
the motions of the plates how fast they
move what their boundaries look like and

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990
move what their boundaries look like and
 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.859
move what their boundaries look like and
so on but we really don't know how they

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869
so on but we really don't know how they
 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.260
so on but we really don't know how they
move or what forces them to move and to

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
move or what forces them to move and to
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.779
move or what forces them to move and to
do that we really have to penetrate into

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789
do that we really have to penetrate into
 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.999
do that we really have to penetrate into
the interior of the earth now in many

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009
the interior of the earth now in many
 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.340
the interior of the earth now in many
ways the earth is like a big bubbling

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350
ways the earth is like a big bubbling
 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.240
ways the earth is like a big bubbling
pot of thick soup on geologic time the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250
pot of thick soup on geologic time the
 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.950
pot of thick soup on geologic time the
earth is really a fluid of course on

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
earth is really a fluid of course on
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.540
earth is really a fluid of course on
human time it's a rock you hit a rock

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550
human time it's a rock you hit a rock
 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.040
human time it's a rock you hit a rock
with a hammer at my crumble and break

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050
with a hammer at my crumble and break
 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.680
with a hammer at my crumble and break
but on geologic time the earth really

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690
but on geologic time the earth really
 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.680
but on geologic time the earth really
behaves like a big melted plastic ball

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690
behaves like a big melted plastic ball
 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.790
behaves like a big melted plastic ball
and it's the movement of that molten

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
and it's the movement of that molten
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.150
and it's the movement of that molten
material that plastic that warm plastic

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
material that plastic that warm plastic
 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.039
material that plastic that warm plastic
material that really drives the plates

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049
material that really drives the plates
 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.620
material that really drives the plates
but we can't observe it directly and so

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630
but we can't observe it directly and so
 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.039
but we can't observe it directly and so
we use earthquakes and and what we call

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049
we use earthquakes and and what we call
 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.970
we use earthquakes and and what we call
structural seismology to image it you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
structural seismology to image it you
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.830
structural seismology to image it you
know if you were taking or if you were

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840
know if you were taking or if you were
 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.940
know if you were taking or if you were
interested in the workings of the human

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950
interested in the workings of the human
 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.080
interested in the workings of the human
body what you would do would be to take

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090
body what you would do would be to take
 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.670
body what you would do would be to take
cat-scans or three-dimensional images

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
cat-scans or three-dimensional images
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.130
cat-scans or three-dimensional images
from time to time to time to get sort of

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140
from time to time to time to get sort of
 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.920
from time to time to time to get sort of
a movie of how the body works well

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
a movie of how the body works well
 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.000
a movie of how the body works well
that's exactly what we're doing with

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010
that's exactly what we're doing with
 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.610
that's exactly what we're doing with
seismology we take cat-scans time time

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620
seismology we take cat-scans time time
 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.150
seismology we take cat-scans time time
time and it gives us some indication of

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160
time and it gives us some indication of
 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.170
time and it gives us some indication of
what's going on of course we can't do

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180
what's going on of course we can't do
 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.360
what's going on of course we can't do
our experiments in geologic time would

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370
our experiments in geologic time would
 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.710
our experiments in geologic time would
just take too long so we use proxies to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720
just take too long so we use proxies to
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.720
just take too long so we use proxies to
let us attain kind of a movie

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
let us attain kind of a movie
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.880
let us attain kind of a movie
representation it's something that we

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890
representation it's something that we
 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.860
representation it's something that we
sometimes call 4d seismology

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870
 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.039
well 40 seismology really means that

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049
well 40 seismology really means that
 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.570
well 40 seismology really means that
we're looking at the earth and three

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580
we're looking at the earth and three
 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.920
we're looking at the earth and three

history geologic time occurs over
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.920
history geologic time occurs over
millions of years so we you know in the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930
millions of years so we you know in the
 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.569
millions of years so we you know in the
lifetime of a single scientist you can't

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579
lifetime of a single scientist you can't
 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.729
lifetime of a single scientist you can't
observe that but over the years we've

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739
observe that but over the years we've
 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.940
observe that but over the years we've
developed proxies to replace that and we

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950
developed proxies to replace that and we
 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.550
developed proxies to replace that and we
can use seismology we can use petrology

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560
can use seismology we can use petrology
 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.190
can use seismology we can use petrology
the study of rocks we can look at the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200
the study of rocks we can look at the
 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.530
the study of rocks we can look at the
ages of rocks and various ways we can

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540
ages of rocks and various ways we can
 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.119
ages of rocks and various ways we can
even use paleontology the study of

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129
even use paleontology the study of
 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.949
even use paleontology the study of
fossils to get some indication of what

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959
fossils to get some indication of what
 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.000
fossils to get some indication of what
the history of the earth looks like but

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010
the history of the earth looks like but
 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.449
the history of the earth looks like but
the you know the real incredible thing

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459
the you know the real incredible thing
 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.809
the you know the real incredible thing
that has happened is that the

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819
that has happened is that the
 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.949
that has happened is that the
three-dimensional aspect of that problem

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959
three-dimensional aspect of that problem
 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.699

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.690
pen that would wiggle every time an
earthquake wave past for example but

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700
earthquake wave past for example but
 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.280
earthquake wave past for example but
right now we've course record that

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290
right now we've course record that
 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.960
right now we've course record that
digitally that's like the move from

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970
digitally that's like the move from
 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.729
digitally that's like the move from
analog tape to two CDs or DVDs so that's

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739
analog tape to two CDs or DVDs so that's
 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.600
analog tape to two CDs or DVDs so that's
one element but the other is that you

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610
one element but the other is that you
 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.070
one element but the other is that you
know we used to have to wait for an

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080
know we used to have to wait for an
 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.409
know we used to have to wait for an
earthquake and we didn't have very many

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419
earthquake and we didn't have very many
 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.540
earthquake and we didn't have very many
instruments in the ground just a couple

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550
instruments in the ground just a couple
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.330
instruments in the ground just a couple
of hundred but now we can put thousands

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340
of hundred but now we can put thousands
 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.219
of hundred but now we can put thousands
of instruments into the ground and so we

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229
of instruments into the ground and so we
 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.409
of instruments into the ground and so we
get a much finer picture much more

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419
get a much finer picture much more
 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.870
get a much finer picture much more
highly result pictures like as if you we

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880
highly result pictures like as if you we
 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.969
highly result pictures like as if you we
had been shooting through cheesecloth or

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979
had been shooting through cheesecloth or
 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.670
had been shooting through cheesecloth or
a gauze or vaseline or something like

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680
a gauze or vaseline or something like
 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.980
a gauze or vaseline or something like
that we we've never been able to really

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990
that we we've never been able to really
 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.810
that we we've never been able to really
see the earth and all its clarity and

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820
see the earth and all its clarity and
 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.080
see the earth and all its clarity and
now we can we're part of a project

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090
now we can we're part of a project
 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.270
now we can we're part of a project
called Earth scope for example which is

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280
called Earth scope for example which is
 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.790
called Earth scope for example which is
like a giant high resolution telescope

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800
like a giant high resolution telescope
 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.520
like a giant high resolution telescope
not pointed to the universe but pointed

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530
not pointed to the universe but pointed
 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.250
not pointed to the universe but pointed
down into the earth we know less about

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260
down into the earth we know less about
 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.469
down into the earth we know less about
the earth really then we know about the

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479
the earth really then we know about the
 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.540
the earth really then we know about the
universe at this point but this

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550
universe at this point but this
 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.460
universe at this point but this
telescope is just giving us fantastic

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470
telescope is just giving us fantastic
 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.839

images we're starting off with the North

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849
images we're starting off with the North
 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.939
images we're starting off with the North
American continent and our hope is that

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949
American continent and our hope is that
 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.860
American continent and our hope is that
over the next decades will be doing that

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870
over the next decades will be doing that
 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.490
over the next decades will be doing that
around the earth as well

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500
 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.710
well earthquakes are a weird kind of

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720
well earthquakes are a weird kind of
 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.680
well earthquakes are a weird kind of
phenomenon in the following sense when

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690
phenomenon in the following sense when
 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.730
phenomenon in the following sense when
we talk about the theory of plate

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740
we talk about the theory of plate
 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.820
we talk about the theory of plate
tectonics the the working hypothesis is

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830
tectonics the the working hypothesis is
 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.300
tectonics the the working hypothesis is
that it's a smooth motion of the plates

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310
that it's a smooth motion of the plates
 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.340
that it's a smooth motion of the plates
that the plates move over geologic time

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350
that the plates move over geologic time
 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.850
that the plates move over geologic time
with predictable rates it's as if

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860
with predictable rates it's as if
 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.520
with predictable rates it's as if
they're kind of a slow movement of

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530
they're kind of a slow movement of
 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.890
they're kind of a slow movement of
traffic if you will everybody sort of

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900
traffic if you will everybody sort of
 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.050

moving at a rate that stays constant in

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060
moving at a rate that stays constant in
 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.750
moving at a rate that stays constant in
time but obviously earthquakes happen

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760
time but obviously earthquakes happen
 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.750
time but obviously earthquakes happen
earthquakes predominantly occur where

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760
earthquakes predominantly occur where
 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.010
earthquakes predominantly occur where
the plates interact with one another

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020
the plates interact with one another
 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.020
the plates interact with one another
along what we call plate boundaries

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030
along what we call plate boundaries
 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.300
along what we call plate boundaries
obviously sometimes those plate

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310
obviously sometimes those plate
 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.250
obviously sometimes those plate
boundaries are sideways like we have in

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260
boundaries are sideways like we have in
 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.350
boundaries are sideways like we have in
the San Andreas Fault or in the

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360
the San Andreas Fault or in the
 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.840
the San Andreas Fault or in the
earthquake that happened in Haiti

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850
earthquake that happened in Haiti
 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.250
earthquake that happened in Haiti
sometimes those boundaries are

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260
sometimes those boundaries are
 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.500
sometimes those boundaries are
compressional like what happened in

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510
compressional like what happened in
 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.050
compressional like what happened in
Chile or what might happen off the coast

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060
Chile or what might happen off the coast
 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.960
Chile or what might happen off the coast
of Seattle and sometimes those

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970
of Seattle and sometimes those
 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.170
of Seattle and sometimes those
boundaries are what we call extensional

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180
boundaries are what we call extensional
 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.700
boundaries are what we call extensional
the best example of this would be the

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710
the best example of this would be the
 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.500
the best example of this would be the
Basin and Range in the western united

Sierra so those three type of boundaries

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770
Sierra so those three type of boundaries
 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.760
Sierra so those three type of boundaries
or describe what how the plates inter

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770
or describe what how the plates inter
 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.219
or describe what how the plates inter
interact but earthquakes of course not a

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229
interact but earthquakes of course not a
 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.040
interact but earthquakes of course not a
continuous process by any means they're

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050
continuous process by any means they're
 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.960
continuous process by any means they're
really what we call a stick slip process

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970
really what we call a stick slip process
 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.500
really what we call a stick slip process
so while the hypothesis of plate

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510
so while the hypothesis of plate
 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.360
so while the hypothesis of plate
tectonics so the working model is that

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370
tectonics so the working model is that
 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.780
tectonics so the working model is that
the plates move at a relatively constant

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790
the plates move at a relatively constant
 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.540
the plates move at a relatively constant
rate at the boundaries they stick and

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550
rate at the boundaries they stick and
 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.210
rate at the boundaries they stick and
they slip the boundaries don't move at a

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220
they slip the boundaries don't move at a
 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.000
they slip the boundaries don't move at a
relatively constant rate instead the

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010
relatively constant rate instead the
 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.270
relatively constant rate instead the
boundary stick and when they stick the

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280
boundary stick and when they stick the
 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.219
boundary stick and when they stick the
movement of the plates stresses that

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229
movement of the plates stresses that
 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.530
movement of the plates stresses that
boundary and eventually that stress

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540
boundary and eventually that stress
 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.810
boundary and eventually that stress
overcomes the strength of that boundary

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820
overcomes the strength of that boundary
 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.909
overcomes the strength of that boundary
and it breaks and that breakage is an

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919
and it breaks and that breakage is an
 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.980
and it breaks and that breakage is an
earthquake that's sort of our what we

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990
earthquake that's sort of our what we
 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.770
earthquake that's sort of our what we
call a stick slip model or we have other

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780
call a stick slip model or we have other
 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.120
call a stick slip model or we have other
names for it but that's basically what

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130
names for it but that's basically what
 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.780
names for it but that's basically what
happens the problem that we face as

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790
happens the problem that we face as
 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.520
happens the problem that we face as
earthquakes seismologists is that

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530
earthquakes seismologists is that
 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.310
earthquakes seismologists is that
sticking and slipping is almost a

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320
sticking and slipping is almost a
 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.650
sticking and slipping is almost a
chaotic process not quite but almost and

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660
chaotic process not quite but almost and
 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.750
chaotic process not quite but almost and
so it's very difficult to predict on a

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760
so it's very difficult to predict on a
 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.600
so it's very difficult to predict on a
day to day basis over geologic time of

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610
day to day basis over geologic time of
 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.529
day to day basis over geologic time of
course it's very predictable we can get

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539
course it's very predictable we can get
 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:29.270
course it's very predictable we can get
an idea of where the active plate

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280
an idea of where the active plate
 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.260
an idea of where the active plate
boundaries are

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270
boundaries are
 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.480
boundaries are
those plate boundaries of course are

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490
those plate boundaries of course are
 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.410
those plate boundaries of course are
major faults in the earth and we know

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:36.420
major faults in the earth and we know
 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.000
major faults in the earth and we know
where the earthquakes will occur but

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.010
where the earthquakes will occur but
 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.340
where the earthquakes will occur but
because we can't predict the stick and

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.350
because we can't predict the stick and
 

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.430
because we can't predict the stick and
slip cycle very well of certainly over

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440
slip cycle very well of certainly over
 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.800
slip cycle very well of certainly over
human timescales we can't really get

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810
human timescales we can't really get
 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.950
human timescales we can't really get
what we call a prediction but there's a

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960
what we call a prediction but there's a
 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.600
what we call a prediction but there's a
deeper understanding of it that that

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610
deeper understanding of it that that
 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.120
deeper understanding of it that that
allows us to forecast instead of predict

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.130
allows us to forecast instead of predict
 

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.790
allows us to forecast instead of predict
and by forecast I mean well first of all

what the plate boundaries are but we can

00:07:59.690 --> 00:07:59.700
what the plate boundaries are but we can
 

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.880
what the plate boundaries are but we can
get a sense of what the probability of

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:01.890
get a sense of what the probability of
 

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.000

an earthquake might be in two ways one
 

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.820

by looking at the past history and if we
 

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.470
by looking at the past history and if we
have enough earthquakes we can sort of

have enough earthquakes we can sort of
 

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.290
have enough earthquakes we can sort of
get a statistical model of when and

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300
get a statistical model of when and
 

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.690
get a statistical model of when and
earthquakes might occur that gives us

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:14.700
earthquakes might occur that gives us
 

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.970
earthquakes might occur that gives us
some probability and the other is to

didn't have instruments going back more
 

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:09.670
didn't have instruments going back more
than about 100 years or so so we don't

than about 100 years or so so we don't
 

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.740
than about 100 years or so so we don't
have an instrumental record but we have

calculate the magnitude that then allows
 

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.970
calculate the magnitude that then allows
us to calculate the repeat interval say

will cause a building to fall down we
even have a reasonable estimates of the

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:29.530
even have a reasonable estimates of the
 

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.760
even have a reasonable estimates of the
casualties that might arise and the

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:32.770
casualties that might arise and the
 

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.190
casualties that might arise and the
economic damage as well so we're getting

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:35.200
economic damage as well so we're getting
 

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.650
economic damage as well so we're getting
very good at predicting to damage and

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:37.660
very good at predicting to damage and
 

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.630
very good at predicting to damage and
we've constructed such a scenario for

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:39.640
we've constructed such a scenario for
 

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.970
we've constructed such a scenario for
California and the reason for that is

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:41.980
California and the reason for that is
 

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.820
California and the reason for that is
that over the next few decades 30 to 50

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:44.830
that over the next few decades 30 to 50
 

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.010
that over the next few decades 30 to 50
years the chance of having a major

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:47.020
years the chance of having a major
 

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.040
years the chance of having a major
earthquake in California is pretty close

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.050
earthquake in California is pretty close
 

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:54.870
earthquake in California is pretty close
to one pretty close to unity in some

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880
to one pretty close to unity in some
 

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.160
to one pretty close to unity in some
sense it's really safe for a

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:56.170
sense it's really safe for a
 

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.020
sense it's really safe for a

earthquake is going to happen in
 

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.880
earthquake is going to happen in
California so I'm you know I'm not

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:05.890
California so I'm you know I'm not
 

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.440

sticking my neck out by saying there's a

sticking my neck out by saying there's a
 

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.640
sticking my neck out by saying there's a
good chance of an earthquake happening

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:08.650
good chance of an earthquake happening
 

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.620
good chance of an earthquake happening
but the question is how where it'll be

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:10.630
but the question is how where it'll be
 

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.590
but the question is how where it'll be
and how big it will be and that we base

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600
and how big it will be and that we base
 

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.130
and how big it will be and that we base
on trenching we base on base it on very

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:17.140
on trenching we base on base it on very
 

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.220

fine measurements of the crust movie we

fine measurements of the crust movie we
 

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.840
fine measurements of the crust movie we
have better calibrated models of the

other steps we can take as well now we

warning systems and this is something

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:21.670
warning systems and this is something
 

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:26.310
warning systems and this is something
that has taken a while to develop but

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320
that has taken a while to develop but
 

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.750
that has taken a while to develop but
when you think about it is kind of

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760
when you think about it is kind of
 

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.700
when you think about it is kind of
obvious and let me start with the

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:29.710
obvious and let me start with the
 

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:34.890
obvious and let me start with the
following analogy earthquake waves that

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.870
following analogy earthquake waves that
it I earthquake occurs it generates

it I earthquake occurs it generates
 

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.760
it I earthquake occurs it generates
ground motion that ground motion leaves

the earthquake so on the rupture zone in

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:40.990
the earthquake so on the rupture zone in
 

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.020
the earthquake so on the rupture zone in
a series of waves and there are several

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.030
a series of waves and there are several
 

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.550
a series of waves and there are several
types of waves and they will move at

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:44.560
types of waves and they will move at
 

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.800
types of waves and they will move at
different speeds we've you know some of

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:46.810
different speeds we've you know some of
 

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.510
different speeds we've you know some of
our students learn that these are

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520
our students learn that these are
 

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.730
our students learn that these are
primary secondary surface waves and so

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:50.740
primary secondary surface waves and so
 

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.860
primary secondary surface waves and so
on and the primary words are very fast

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:52.870
on and the primary words are very fast
 

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.050
on and the primary words are very fast
secondary waves or slower and the

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:55.060
secondary waves or slower and the
 

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.600
secondary waves or slower and the
surface waves are slower still what's

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:57.610
surface waves are slower still what's
 

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.580
surface waves are slower still what's
interesting about that that progression

00:18:59.580 --> 00:18:59.590
interesting about that that progression
 

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.420
interesting about that that progression
is that the primary waves though fast

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:02.430
is that the primary waves though fast
 

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.640
is that the primary waves though fast
aren't very large the secondary waves

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:05.650
aren't very large the secondary waves
 

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.130
aren't very large the secondary waves
are slower but larger and the surface

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:08.140
are slower but larger and the surface
 

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.160
are slower but larger and the surface
waves slower still our largest ill and

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.170
waves slower still our largest ill and
 

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.200
waves slower still our largest ill and
so it's large ways to do most of the

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.210
so it's large ways to do most of the
 

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:13.990
so it's large ways to do most of the
damage

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000
damage
 

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.360
damage
so the theory is that if you could

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:16.370
so the theory is that if you could
 

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.520
so the theory is that if you could
detect that little bit of a p-wave

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.530
detect that little bit of a p-wave
 

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.050
detect that little bit of a p-wave
coming along it's not going to do a lot

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:20.060
coming along it's not going to do a lot
 

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.170
coming along it's not going to do a lot
of damage but it might give you enough

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:23.180
of damage but it might give you enough
 

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.200
of damage but it might give you enough
time ranging from a few seconds few tens

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.210
time ranging from a few seconds few tens
 

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.980
time ranging from a few seconds few tens
of seconds to maybe even close to a

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:29.990
of seconds to maybe even close to a
 

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.530
of seconds to maybe even close to a
minute or so or more it might give you

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:32.540
minute or so or more it might give you
 

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.060
minute or so or more it might give you
enough time to do the sort of things

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:34.070
enough time to do the sort of things
 

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.610
enough time to do the sort of things
that would save people save structures

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:36.620
that would save people save structures
 

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.480
that would save people save structures
you can stop trains you can shut off gas

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:39.490
you can stop trains you can shut off gas
 

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.960
you can stop trains you can shut off gas
you could get people to find safe haven

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:43.970
you could get people to find safe haven
 

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.660
you could get people to find safe haven
inside the buildings for example if you

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:46.670
inside the buildings for example if you
 

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.060
inside the buildings for example if you
could do that that would constitute a

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.070
could do that that would constitute a
 

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.850
could do that that would constitute a
pretty decent early warning system and

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:51.860
pretty decent early warning system and
 

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.110
pretty decent early warning system and
so there are experiments I'm trying to

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120
so there are experiments I'm trying to
 

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.640
so there are experiments I'm trying to
do that it's been implemented in Japan

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:54.650
do that it's been implemented in Japan
 

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.630
do that it's been implemented in Japan
it's been implemented in Taiwan and

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640
it's been implemented in Taiwan and
 

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.460
it's been implemented in Taiwan and
there are other countries around trying

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:00.470
there are other countries around trying
 

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.510
there are other countries around trying
to to investigate these systems

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520
 

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.120
you know preparing for

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.130
you know preparing for
 

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.960

quake is multi-faceted multi-dimensional

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:09.970
quake is multi-faceted multi-dimensional
 

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.210
quake is multi-faceted multi-dimensional
and the first thing really is being

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:13.220
and the first thing really is being
 

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.230
and the first thing really is being
aware yes I said that earthquakes occur

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240
aware yes I said that earthquakes occur
 

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.360
aware yes I said that earthquakes occur
anywhere but they're more likely some

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:19.370
anywhere but they're more likely some
 

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.910
anywhere but they're more likely some
places than others so you know basic

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:21.920
places than others so you know basic
 

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.400
places than others so you know basic
awareness of where your house where you

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.410
awareness of where your house where you
 

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.750
awareness of where your house where you
work where you are relative to the

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760
work where you are relative to the
 

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.040
work where you are relative to the
faults that might cause an earthquake

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.050
faults that might cause an earthquake
 

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.700
faults that might cause an earthquake
that's a matter of public education but

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.710
that's a matter of public education but
 

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.980
that's a matter of public education but
once you know what your risk might be

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:37.990
once you know what your risk might be
 

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.780
once you know what your risk might be
you have to make some sort of personal

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:40.790
you have to make some sort of personal
 

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.000
you have to make some sort of personal
judgment or if you're a government some

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.010
judgment or if you're a government some
 

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.740
judgment or if you're a government some
sort of social judgment about the level

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:44.750
sort of social judgment about the level
 

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.050
sort of social judgment about the level
of risk that you're willing to accept it

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.060
of risk that you're willing to accept it
 

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.450
of risk that you're willing to accept it
is going to be and if you're willing to

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:49.460
is going to be and if you're willing to
 

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.610

accept or only willing to accept a low
 

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.620
accept or only willing to accept a low
level of risk then there are number of

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:53.630
level of risk then there are number of
 

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.210

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:58.830
in Chile of course for a long time and
 

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.889
in Chile of course for a long time and
of course the chileans who have an

00:27:00.889 --> 00:27:00.899
of course the chileans who have an
 

00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:03.730
of course the chileans who have an

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:03.740
extraordinarily advanced in professional
 

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.440
extraordinarily advanced in professional
capacity to deal with earthquakes knew

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:06.450
capacity to deal with earthquakes knew
 

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.499
capacity to deal with earthquakes knew
about this as well but 20 or 30 years

00:27:09.499 --> 00:27:09.509
about this as well but 20 or 30 years
 

00:27:09.509 --> 00:27:12.859
about this as well but 20 or 30 years
ago using very simple components of the

ago using very simple components of the
 

00:27:12.869 --> 00:27:15.350
ago using very simple components of the
plate tectonic theory this particular

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360
plate tectonic theory this particular
 

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.820
plate tectonic theory this particular
area was identified as a so called

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:16.830
area was identified as a so called
 

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.149
area was identified as a so called
seismic gap a place where an earthquake

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159
seismic gap a place where an earthquake
 

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.690
seismic gap a place where an earthquake
was basically overdue couldn't predict

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700
was basically overdue couldn't predict
 

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.190
was basically overdue couldn't predict
it but we could forecast it and that's

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200
it but we could forecast it and that's
 

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.800
it but we could forecast it and that's
what in some sense saved Chile

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:30.810
 

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.840
now a large earthquakes do strange

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:33.850
now a large earthquakes do strange
 

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.710
now a large earthquakes do strange
things of course what an earthquake does

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720
things of course what an earthquake does
 

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.340
things of course what an earthquake does
is in addition to breaking the ground it

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:41.350
is in addition to breaking the ground it
 

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.560
is in addition to breaking the ground it
actually moves big crustal blocks around

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:43.570
actually moves big crustal blocks around
 

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.380
actually moves big crustal blocks around
and when it does that it shifts the

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:46.390
and when it does that it shifts the
 

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:50.630
and when it does that it shifts the
distribution of mass of the earth now

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640
distribution of mass of the earth now
 

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.010
distribution of mass of the earth now
because this wasn't an asteroid or a

because this wasn't an asteroid or a
 

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.170
because this wasn't an asteroid or a
comet hitting the earth and causing all

comet hitting the earth and causing all
these vibrations the earth has to

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:57.490
these vibrations the earth has to
 

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.270
these vibrations the earth has to
conserve its angular momentum and the

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:00.280
conserve its angular momentum and the
 

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.680

way the earth conserves its angular

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:01.690
way the earth conserves its angular
 

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.470
way the earth conserves its angular

that is to change the rate of rotation

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:06.700
that is to change the rate of rotation
 

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.720
that is to change the rate of rotation
and to slightly shift the axis of

and to slightly shift the axis of
 

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.920
and to slightly shift the axis of
rotation it can be calculated but it

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:13.930
rotation it can be calculated but it
 

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.020
rotation it can be calculated but it
really isn't measurable on the other

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:16.030
really isn't measurable on the other
 

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.520

second maybe it's something that you

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:18.790
second maybe it's something that you
 

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.140
second maybe it's something that you
might worry about but the interesting

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.150
might worry about but the interesting
 

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.390
might worry about but the interesting
thing is that we can calculate it not

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:24.400
thing is that we can calculate it not
 

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.040
thing is that we can calculate it not
that it is in fact something we ought to

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.050
that it is in fact something we ought to
 

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:30.380
that it is in fact something we ought to
worry about

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:30.390
 

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.540
now haiti is a different kind of an

now haiti is a different kind of an
 

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.080
now haiti is a different kind of an
animal but it pays to think about what's

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.090
animal but it pays to think about what's
 

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.500
animal but it pays to think about what's
really happening around South America

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:38.510
really happening around South America
 

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:44.480

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.350
anyway that wasn't a subduction
earthquake that was a sliding earthquake

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360
earthquake that was a sliding earthquake
 

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.640
earthquake that was a sliding earthquake
and sliding the earthquakes will strike

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:01.650
and sliding the earthquakes will strike
 

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.430
and sliding the earthquakes will strike
slip earthquakes are dangerous also for

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440
slip earthquakes are dangerous also for
 

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.560
slip earthquakes are dangerous also for
a number of reasons first of all they

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:06.570
a number of reasons first of all they
 

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.890
a number of reasons first of all they
tend not to be as large as a subduction

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:09.900
tend not to be as large as a subduction
 

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.070
tend not to be as large as a subduction
earthquake but can be large enough they

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080
earthquake but can be large enough they
 

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.480
earthquake but can be large enough they
also in this particular case they

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:14.490
also in this particular case they
 

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.450
also in this particular case they
occurred on land and unfortunately they

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460
occurred on land and unfortunately they
 

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.340
occurred on land and unfortunately they
it was almost a direct hit on

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:19.350
it was almost a direct hit on
 

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:22.340
it was almost a direct hit on
port-au-prince the earthquake itself was

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:22.350
port-au-prince the earthquake itself was
 

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.520
port-au-prince the earthquake itself was
shallow which increases the amount of

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:25.530
shallow which increases the amount of
 

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.470
shallow which increases the amount of
vibration that people on the surface

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480
vibration that people on the surface
 

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.100
vibration that people on the surface
feel and was very close to major

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:31.110
feel and was very close to major
 

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.920
feel and was very close to major
population centers so if you will it was

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:33.930
population centers so if you will it was
 

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:37.750
population centers so if you will it was
sort of the perfect storm of bad effect

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760
sort of the perfect storm of bad effect
 

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.430
sort of the perfect storm of bad effect
even if Chile had good building codes

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440
even if Chile had good building codes
 

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.440
even if Chile had good building codes
and good construction I think we would

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:42.450
and good construction I think we would
 

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:43.640
and good construction I think we would
have seen tens of thousands of

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:43.650
have seen tens of thousands of
 

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.640
have seen tens of thousands of
casualties anyway very difficult to deal

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:46.650
casualties anyway very difficult to deal
 

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.560
casualties anyway very difficult to deal
with an earthquake of that sort but it

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:48.570
with an earthquake of that sort but it
 

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.560
with an earthquake of that sort but it
was a different kind of an animal we've

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:51.570
was a different kind of an animal we've
 

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.880
was a different kind of an animal we've
looked at the chile earthquake in many

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:52.890
looked at the chile earthquake in many
 

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.800
looked at the chile earthquake in many
ways and we continue to do so in fact

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:54.810
ways and we continue to do so in fact
 

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.630
ways and we continue to do so in fact
there are a number of conferences coming

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640
there are a number of conferences coming
 

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.080
there are a number of conferences coming
up in the next few days to try to move

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.090
up in the next few days to try to move
 

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.820
up in the next few days to try to move
to the next phase of chile rebuilding

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:01.830
to the next phase of chile rebuilding
 

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.490
to the next phase of chile rebuilding
and sort of essentially make the

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:03.500
and sort of essentially make the
 

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.170
and sort of essentially make the
rebuilding of chile more risk conscious

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:06.180
rebuilding of chile more risk conscious
 

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.700
rebuilding of chile more risk conscious
not just for earthquakes but for the

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:07.710
not just for earthquakes but for the
 

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.250
not just for earthquakes but for the
storms coming up and the annual storm

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260
storms coming up and the annual storm
 

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.640
storms coming up and the annual storm
season the annual hurricane season and

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:12.650
season the annual hurricane season and
 

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:16.490
season the annual hurricane season and
concomitant landslides and other natural

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500
concomitant landslides and other natural
 

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.860
concomitant landslides and other natural
hazards but you know trying to

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:20.870
hazards but you know trying to
 

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:25.130
hazards but you know trying to
understand these earthquakes on land

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140
understand these earthquakes on land
 

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.750
understand these earthquakes on land
these strike-slip earthquakes it's a

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760
these strike-slip earthquakes it's a
 

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.830
these strike-slip earthquakes it's a
very complex problem and one of the

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840
very complex problem and one of the
 

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.050
very complex problem and one of the
things that were very worried about in

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:33.060
things that were very worried about in
 

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.730
things that were very worried about in
haiti is that this earthquake may have

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740
haiti is that this earthquake may have
 

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.760
haiti is that this earthquake may have
stressed parts of the fault that did not

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:40.770
stressed parts of the fault that did not
 

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:45.500
stressed parts of the fault that did not
rupture on january 12th you know when an

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:45.510
rupture on january 12th you know when an
 

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.150
rupture on january 12th you know when an
earthquake happens it doesn't zip open

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:47.160
earthquake happens it doesn't zip open
 

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.980
earthquake happens it doesn't zip open
the whole fault and only zips open in

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:48.990
the whole fault and only zips open in
 

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:51.710
the whole fault and only zips open in
this case about a 40 kilometers segment

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720
this case about a 40 kilometers segment
 

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.900
this case about a 40 kilometers segment
of it there's still stuff on either side

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:53.910
of it there's still stuff on either side
 

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.720
of it there's still stuff on either side
that did not rupture well

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:56.730
that did not rupture well
 

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.159
that did not rupture well
that stuff may have been over stressed

00:32:58.159 --> 00:32:58.169
that stuff may have been over stressed
 

00:32:58.169 --> 00:32:59.510
that stuff may have been over stressed
that piece of the fault may have been

00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520
that piece of the fault may have been
 

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.330
that piece of the fault may have been
over stressed and so the potential for

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340
over stressed and so the potential for
 

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.250
over stressed and so the potential for
an earthquake on those segments may

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260
an earthquake on those segments may
 

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.310
an earthquake on those segments may
actually have increased that again is a

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320
actually have increased that again is a
 

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.049
actually have increased that again is a
computer model it's something that we're

00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059
computer model it's something that we're
 

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:13.610
computer model it's something that we're
working on it is hard to predict but it

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620
working on it is hard to predict but it
 

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.539
working on it is hard to predict but it
is something that as a forecast ought to

00:33:17.539 --> 00:33:17.549
is something that as a forecast ought to
 

00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:21.250
is something that as a forecast ought to
play into the way Haiti is being rebuilt

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:21.260
play into the way Haiti is being rebuilt
 

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.200
play into the way Haiti is being rebuilt
Chile we could do the same thing but to

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:24.210
Chile we could do the same thing but to
 

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.799
Chile we could do the same thing but to
be honest Chile apart from the economic

00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:27.809
be honest Chile apart from the economic
 

00:33:27.809 --> 00:33:30.320
be honest Chile apart from the economic
damage in the economic recovery Chile

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:30.330
damage in the economic recovery Chile
 

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:34.100
damage in the economic recovery Chile
has a good capacity to deal with future

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:34.110
has a good capacity to deal with future
 

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.539
has a good capacity to deal with future
earthquakes and the outcomes of this

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:35.549
earthquakes and the outcomes of this
 

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:39.919
earthquakes and the outcomes of this
earthquake with Haiti I hope that the

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:39.929
earthquake with Haiti I hope that the
 

00:33:39.929 --> 00:33:41.419
earthquake with Haiti I hope that the
international community will work with

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:41.429
international community will work with
 

00:33:41.429 --> 00:33:43.430
international community will work with
the Haitians to build that capacity so

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440
the Haitians to build that capacity so
 

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.710
the Haitians to build that capacity so
that they can monitor the potential for

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720
that they can monitor the potential for
 

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.380
that they can monitor the potential for
these future earthquakes

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:50.390
 

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.690
well you know I'll be

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:52.700
well you know I'll be
 

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.280
well you know I'll be
interest when the earthquake happens and

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:54.290
interest when the earthquake happens and
 

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.400
interest when the earthquake happens and
so we do our best best we can the

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:57.410
so we do our best best we can the
 

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.250
so we do our best best we can the
questions tend to be repetitive almost

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:00.260
questions tend to be repetitive almost
 

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.440
questions tend to be repetitive almost
always we get a question from somebody

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.450
always we get a question from somebody
 

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.020
always we get a question from somebody
about whether they can come see the

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.030
about whether they can come see the
 

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.970
about whether they can come see the
Richter scale do we have an example of

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:06.980
Richter scale do we have an example of
 

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.520
Richter scale do we have an example of
the Richter scale the Richter scale is

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:09.530
the Richter scale the Richter scale is
 

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.320
the Richter scale the Richter scale is
of mathematical calculation in fact

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:11.330
of mathematical calculation in fact
 

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:12.910
of mathematical calculation in fact
seismologist don't use it anymore the

00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:12.920
seismologist don't use it anymore the
 

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.640
seismologist don't use it anymore the
only reason we give a Richter magnitude

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:14.650
only reason we give a Richter magnitude
 

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.600
only reason we give a Richter magnitude
frankly is for the press and the media

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:16.610
frankly is for the press and the media
 

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.130
frankly is for the press and the media
but we have much better ways of

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:18.140
but we have much better ways of
 

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.270
but we have much better ways of
measuring the energy of an earthquake

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280
measuring the energy of an earthquake
 

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.730
measuring the energy of an earthquake
now but the second question that's

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:21.740
now but the second question that's
 

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.850
now but the second question that's
cropped up and it's fascinating in its

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:24.860
cropped up and it's fascinating in its
 

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.850
cropped up and it's fascinating in its
own right is that the first time I heard

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:27.860
own right is that the first time I heard
 

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.880
own right is that the first time I heard
it I thought it was a fluke but I've

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:30.890
it I thought it was a fluke but I've
 

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.190
it I thought it was a fluke but I've
heard it so many times since Haiti that

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200
heard it so many times since Haiti that
 

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.290
heard it so many times since Haiti that
I wonder what's going on that is are

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:35.300
I wonder what's going on that is are
 

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.690
I wonder what's going on that is are
these earthquakes related to global

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:37.700
these earthquakes related to global
 

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:42.550
these earthquakes related to global
warming I'm serious about that I'd say

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560
warming I'm serious about that I'd say
 

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.610
warming I'm serious about that I'd say
that most of the press and most of the

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:45.620
that most of the press and most of the
 

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.830
that most of the press and most of the
public that have called in that that

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:47.840
public that have called in that that
 

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.740
public that have called in that that
didn't have specific domain knowledge

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:49.750
didn't have specific domain knowledge

didn't have specific domain knowledge
has asked us that question we also got

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480
has asked us that question we also got
 

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.530
has asked us that question we also got
questions whether you know 2012 is

questions whether you know 2012 is
 

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.570
questions whether you know 2012 is
coming a couple years early we get that

00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:58.580
coming a couple years early we get that
 

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.600
coming a couple years early we get that
sort of thing it's just the end of days

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:00.610
sort of thing it's just the end of days
 

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.950
sort of thing it's just the end of days
but I think it speaks to something more

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960
but I think it speaks to something more
 

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.310
but I think it speaks to something more
interesting which is that earthquakes

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320
interesting which is that earthquakes
 

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.680
interesting which is that earthquakes
and major disasters I have a certain

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:11.690
and major disasters I have a certain
 

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.050
and major disasters I have a certain
impact on the public consciousness and I

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:14.060
impact on the public consciousness and I
 

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.640
impact on the public consciousness and I
think earthquakes more so or even

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:15.650
think earthquakes more so or even
 

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.560
think earthquakes more so or even
volcanic eruptions more so than than

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:17.570
volcanic eruptions more so than than
 

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.110
volcanic eruptions more so than than
anything else you know we get a major

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:20.120
anything else you know we get a major
 

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.880
anything else you know we get a major
hurricane a few major hurricanes every

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:21.890
hurricane a few major hurricanes every
 

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.970
hurricane a few major hurricanes every
year we get floods every year there are

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:24.980
year we get floods every year there are
 

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.490
year we get floods every year there are
major disasters that caused an enormous

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:27.500
major disasters that caused an enormous
 

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.960
major disasters that caused an enormous
amount of economic damage and casualties

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:30.970
amount of economic damage and casualties
 

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.900
amount of economic damage and casualties
but yet we hear about them relatively

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:34.910
but yet we hear about them relatively
 

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.150
but yet we hear about them relatively
often and so we kind of think of that as

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160
often and so we kind of think of that as
 

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.100
often and so we kind of think of that as
kind of background this is what the

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:39.110
kind of background this is what the
 

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.220
kind of background this is what the
earth is doing to us but earthquakes

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:41.230
earth is doing to us but earthquakes
 

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.300
earth is doing to us but earthquakes
especially major ones are relatively

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:43.310
especially major ones are relatively
 

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.350
especially major ones are relatively
rare we get a few major ones a decade

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:46.360
rare we get a few major ones a decade
 

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.220
rare we get a few major ones a decade
particularly ones with huge numbers of

blink of an eye and that it is
 

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.910
blink of an eye and that it is
unpredictable that it just happens

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920
unpredictable that it just happens

we've got to look at this as well as we

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:32.110
we've got to look at this as well as we
 

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.600
we've got to look at this as well as we
can because we only get a couple of

can because we only get a couple of
 

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.700

there are teams of scientists and lots
 

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.790
there are teams of scientists and lots

the ground motion we have we have
 

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.750

in a very quantitative scientific way

00:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.410
in a very quantitative scientific way
 

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.870
in a very quantitative scientific way
but how do you how do you approach that

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880
but how do you how do you approach that
 

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.660
but how do you how do you approach that
person how do you assure them that the

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:03.670
person how do you assure them that the
 

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:07.740
person how do you assure them that the
situation has a rational response now I

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:07.750
situation has a rational response now I

don't think we have a good way to deal
 

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.790
don't think we have a good way to deal
with that so a lot of the questions we

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800
with that so a lot of the questions we
 

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.540
with that so a lot of the questions we
were getting and a lot of the thinking

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:15.550
were getting and a lot of the thinking
 

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.200
were getting and a lot of the thinking
that generated

I had to do with the central questions
 

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.380
I had to do with the central questions
of what does this mean particularly for

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:23.390
of what does this mean particularly for
 

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:24.940
of what does this mean particularly for
the future of Haiti but what does this

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:24.950
the future of Haiti but what does this
 

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:28.330
the future of Haiti but what does this
mean when we talk about taking steps to

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:28.340
mean when we talk about taking steps to
 

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.160
mean when we talk about taking steps to
mitigate against future tragedy future

thought about this before but it seems

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:45.020
thought about this before but it seems
 

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.700

there's a conversation that scientists

there's a conversation that scientists
have to have with the public that the

which means
 

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.440

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:40.780
some other mechanism and in my view I

universities have that kind of role to
 

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.110
universities have that kind of role to
play beyond the roles that governments

play beyond the roles that governments

00:41:03.849 --> 00:41:03.859
 

00:41:03.859 --> 00:41:06.579
yeah I did you know it's the rare

yeah I did you know it's the rare
 

00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:08.680

the way but yeah I've experienced
 

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.430
the way but yeah I've experienced
earthquakes nothing larger than about a

earthquakes nothing larger than about a
 

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.789
earthquakes nothing larger than about a
magnitude 6 and of course I've been in

00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:18.799
magnitude 6 and of course I've been in
 

00:41:18.799 --> 00:41:20.589
magnitude 6 and of course I've been in
aftershock zones where magnitude fours

aftershock zones where magnitude fours
 

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:23.400

and fives are fairly fairly frequent I

and you take steps to deal with it but

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.130
and you take steps to deal with it but
 

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.589
and you take steps to deal with it but
it's very difficult for me to imagine

it's very difficult for me to imagine
 

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:32.140
it's very difficult for me to imagine
what it would be like in an 8.8 I mean

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:32.150
what it would be like in an 8.8 I mean
 

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.329
what it would be like in an 8.8 I mean
we or even a seven-point oh that was a

direct hit I personally feel fortunate
that I haven't been in that and I

00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:40.549
that I haven't been in that and I
 

00:41:40.549 --> 00:41:42.220
that I haven't been in that and I
sometimes joke with my colleagues that's

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:42.230
sometimes joke with my colleagues that's

sometimes joke with my colleagues that's
why I work in New York and not in

why I work in New York and not in
 

00:41:43.549 --> 00:41:48.549
why I work in New York and not in
California but on the other hand you

know at we understand earthquakes in the

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:51.380
know at we understand earthquakes in the
 

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.789
know at we understand earthquakes in the
abstract and the visceral feel of an

00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:54.799
abstract and the visceral feel of an
 

00:41:54.799 --> 00:41:56.249
abstract and the visceral feel of an
earthquake is something that perhaps

00:41:56.249 --> 00:41:56.259
earthquake is something that perhaps
 

00:41:56.259 --> 00:41:59.950
earthquake is something that perhaps
might contribute to the conversation we

00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960
might contribute to the conversation we
 

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.739
might contribute to the conversation we
need to have with the public and maybe

00:42:02.739 --> 00:42:02.749
need to have with the public and maybe
 

00:42:02.749 --> 00:42:04.720
need to have with the public and maybe
there ought to be a program to get a lot

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:04.730
there ought to be a program to get a lot
 

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.609
there ought to be a program to get a lot
of seismologists into earthquake zone so

00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:06.619
of seismologists into earthquake zone so
 

00:42:06.619 --> 00:42:07.779
of seismologists into earthquake zone so
that they can understand what it's like

00:42:07.779 --> 00:42:07.789
that they can understand what it's like
 

00:42:07.789 --> 00:42:12.700
that they can understand what it's like
I'm only half of CSIS there but to

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:12.710
I'm only half of CSIS there but to
 

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.440
I'm only half of CSIS there but to
experience an earthquake is to know what

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:14.450
experience an earthquake is to know what
 

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.630
experience an earthquake is to know what
it means to somebody who may not be a

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640
it means to somebody who may not be a
 

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.150
it means to somebody who may not be a
seismologist who has a house that's just

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160
seismologist who has a house that's just
 

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.059
seismologist who has a house that's just
been destroyed who has a livelihood that

00:42:22.059 --> 00:42:22.069
been destroyed who has a livelihood that
 

00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:25.059
been destroyed who has a livelihood that
has disappeared and has a government

00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:25.069
has disappeared and has a government
 

00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:28.749
has disappeared and has a government
that's in shambles and maybe all we can

00:42:28.749 --> 00:42:28.759
that's in shambles and maybe all we can
 

00:42:28.759 --> 00:42:31.509
that's in shambles and maybe all we can
do is extrapolate but i think it's it's

00:42:31.509 --> 00:42:31.519
do is extrapolate but i think it's it's
 

00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:35.349
do is extrapolate but i think it's it's
something necessary to think about
