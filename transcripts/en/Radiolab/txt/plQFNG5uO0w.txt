Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich and this is Radiolab, the podcast Jad Abumrad who's normally at my side is still at home, eking out the very end of his paternity leave with his brand new baby. So I've been very careful not to disturb him, which means though I do have to find somebody else to fight with. And I did manage to get into a nice little tussle with Richard Dawkins, uh, one of the great defenders of Charles Darwin. He's the Charles Simoni professor of public understanding of science at Oxford. He also comes from a long line of Combative Englishman, including a guy who tried to burn down an Ivy League college in the United States. In fact, why don't we begin with a little biographical sketch of Richard Dawkins that I used to introduce him to an audience at the 92nd street y in New York City. And then we'll get onto the discussion. I told them the Dawkins is Greek, Greek, Greek. Great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather. Going back to the 17 hundreds

Speaker 2:          00:48          was the major commander of the British forces who fought George Washington here in the American revolution. And it was Richard Doxins Dawkins' his great, great, great, great, great, great. Whatever. Sure. Henry Clinton who hired Benedict Arnold to be the British spy who almost captured west point, which is Washington stronghold. Didn't do it though, cause they cut the spies and so forth. It was Dawkins. Great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather who commanded the British occupation forces here in New York City in 1777 78 it was his Greek, Greek, Greek, a Greek big man, father who authorized rating parties on a variety of seashore communities. If you live in them, please hold your fire egg harbor in New Jersey, attacked by his great, great grandfather, new Bedford, Massachusetts, a part of Martha's vineyard called Vineyard Haven. Most insidiously, he okayed and attack on new haven, Connecticut with the plan to burn down Gail College. Fortunately, his forces as they often were, were repulsed. Ultimately, Sir Henry Clinton lost the war and went home.

Speaker 1:          01:43          But sir, Henry's great, great, great, great grand son Richard Dawkins has been back to America over and over and over again to do battle with more modern Americans when he calls the most scientifically illiterate populace outside the third world. So Richard Dawkins does not mince words. And when we began our conversation, which was about evolution in Charles Darwin, he opened with a surprisingly forceful statement.

Speaker 3:          02:08          As an academic scientist, I am a passionate Darwinian believing that natural selection is, if not the only driving force in evolution, certainly the only known force capable of producing the illusion of purpose, which so strikes all who contemplate nature bopped at the same time as I support Darwinism as a scientist, I am a passionate anti Darwinian when it comes to politics and how we should conduct our human affairs.

Speaker 1:          02:36          So He's, he's given us something of a riddle. I mean, he loves Darwin, but he also loads the styling. And then for extra spice, he wants you to know that anybody who thinks there's a purpose, a reason why we live and look and behave the way we do is under a terrible illusion. There is no purpose to our existence. No reason why we're here. That's basic. Darwin, he's has, sorry, I thought, okay, I'll let's do the purpose

Speaker 2:          03:00          thing first. This the Darwin's theory I think does a very good job on, because it can tell you why something is shaped the way it is or as the color it is or does the function is because, because, because, but if you step back and you ask the bigger question, what's it all for? This happens involves your daughter. Your daughter is driving around with you and you're looking, she sees us. She's six years old. She sees a, a field of flowers. You say to her, well, what do you think they're for? She says, well, to make the world pretty and to help bees make honey for us, you think, well, I was sorry to tell him that this wasn't true. And I explained to her that the flowers are not there to make the world beautiful and they are not there to delight bees or anything else. They're in the world to copy their DNA. So a six year old.

Speaker 4:          03:45          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:48          But essentially what you're doing there is furious addressing. You're opening the eye notion to her that the world is a purposeless in different machine where the meaning of things is not clear if it exists at all. You found that, I think kind of brave to say to your daughter, look,

Speaker 3:          04:03          step by step into the wind of exciting, exciting. I mean it's a far more exciting view of LAUSD to understand what they're, what they're really doing and, and a six year old, she had no problem understanding that. I explained it to her,

Speaker 4:          04:22          but,

Speaker 3:          04:22          but to come to your, what, what's it for question it, it's a piece of massive presumption to think that the, what is for question deserves an answer. There's, there's no reason at all why something should have a fall about it. If I said to you, what is the Sun for? Or what is Mount Everest for, you would say then because silly it's not, it's not the, it's not inappropriate question, but because it's flowers, um, you, you sort of feel that there ought to be or what is it for question? No, actually I think it's a harder question than that. I think human beings, I think most human beings have some deep impulse to explain their being here to wonder about the origins of here and the destiny of them and here and that question, the meaning of it all is not a silly question. It's not, that's not a silly question and it has a perfectly good answer.

Speaker 3:          05:21          Uh, which is not an answer to be couched in the language of purpose. It's an answer to be couched in the language of scientific causation. What brought us all to be here? What is the, the explanation for our existence that has a perfectly good scientific answer. Uh, and you go back in evolutionary time to the origin of life and then you go back before the origin of life to the origin of the world, the origin of the solar system, the origin of the universe, and that, that it becomes deeply mysterious. Needless to say, it's not, it's not a question I could even begin to answer. And I, I don't think that at the present stage physics can either, but to the extent that there's going to be an answer, it's going to come from science and that is a deeply satisfying kind of answer to the question, why are we here?

Speaker 3:          06:11          We already have in principle the answer to that question and it is not an answer of the form. We are here in order to achieve some purpose. It's an answer of the form we are here because something happened which led to something else that happened, which led to something else that happened. Uh, um, are you, uh, let me just ask you the harder question. Is this hard looking in this telling your six year old, this leads to, this leads to this, this kind of reduction is way of thinking about everything. Does that seem to you to be less than joyously imaginative? No, I, I know, um, I think that's kind of super romantic, um, to, to actually understand that flowers, uh, devices, beautiful devices, elegant devices which are shaped precisely to attract insects and hummingbirds, uh, and bats to take pollen from one to another. That is such a mind blowing thought compared to the team sort of washed out view that flowers are just sort of nice things to have around.

Speaker 4:          07:24          Um,

Speaker 1:          07:27          don't encourage him. So I lost that round, at least with the New York audience. And I know there are a lot of you listening who kind of agree with those New Yorkers that, you know, this is, this is the name of the game. If, if, if you know the details of the glorious, beautiful details, that's enough. If you've been listening to this podcast long enough, you know that for some of us it's not quite enough. But anyway, um, I then asked about the second proposition. I asked him, well, what does it mean when you say that you're a passionate Darwinian? And at the same time a passionate NT Darwinian

Speaker 3:          08:00          as an academic scientist, I believe that Darwinism not only is the true explanation for why evolution happened in particular, why evolution led to the spectacularly elegant, beautiful, complicated and apparently designed structures that we see. It's therefore a theory of immense elegance, of immense power, of immense scientific beauty. But if you try to apply the lesson of Darwinism as the social Darwinists did to human society, then you end up with a kind of super Thatcherism you end up with, or it, or even Hitler,

Speaker 1:          08:49          for example, he said there are people who love die. When he mentioned the science fiction writer, wells

Speaker 3:          08:56          wells assume that survival of the fittest means that only the fittest and the best creatures get to survive. But Darwin didn't say that. He didn't use the phrase survival of the fittest and his book. And he didn't ever say that evolution is there to make better and better creatures. As you just heard Richard Dawkins say, evolution isn't for anything. But when hg wells red dye, when he decided Darwin was teaching us to get rid of our less fit brothers and sisters, the new republic where wells outlines his Darwinian utopia contained some blood chilling lines so unpleasant that I find it hard to read them aloud perhaps. I mean, it's such a striking thing I bring myself to. It's pretty bad. I'm sorry, I'm having trouble if I [inaudible]. Here we are. Um, and how will the new republic treat the inferior races? How will it deal with the black, the Yellow Man, the Jew, those swarms of black and brown and dirty white and yellow people who do not come into the new needs of efficiency?

Speaker 3:          09:58          Well, the world is a world and not a charitable institution and I take it they will have to go. And the ethical system of these men, of the new republic, the ethical system which will dominate the world state will be shaped primarily to favor the procreation of what is fine and efficient and beautiful in humanity, beautiful and strong bodies, clear and powerful minds. And the method that nature has followed here, the two in the shaping of the world whereby weakness was prevented from propagating weakness is death. The man of the new republic will have an ideal that will make the killing worth the while. That was hg wells in something like 1,902, I forget exactly when it was published, but, um, I understand this,

Speaker 2:          10:48          you mean your notion about Auntie Darwinian is that in our brains we have these tendencies to make war against people who are not like us to assign different roles to men and women to perhaps favor our biological children over his stepchildren. And in our brains we have the other places where we might make war against the tendencies that we've in here against that.

Speaker 3:          11:13          Um, I think that's right. I mean, you put the dilemma rather well that, um, here we do have our evolved tendencies which have these unpleasant features and it must be in some sense elsewhere in our brain that we have the desire to fight them. And I think it comes after a long period of education. Uh, we have moved away from the mores of our wild ancestors and, uh, thank goodness we have, I'm not quite sure it's a very difficult historical process to wonder quite how that's happened, but it very clearly has, I mean like contraception in itself is good enough evidence that, um, that we do go against Darwinian principles. Um, so it can be done. And the fact that most of us spend most of our lives striving for purposes, striving for goals which have nothing to do with propagating ourself as genes is further evidence that it can be done. So

Speaker 2:          12:14          notion then is that we are, we live in a world carved by these forces, but our job in part is to recognize the good from the bed, choose and fight for the good. Well, as we understand it, this is

Speaker 3:          12:27          my suggestion. I mean, you obviously that's a matter of taste whether you want to do that, but most people who live in, in civilized society do, do want to do that. And, uh, I would, I would like to live in the sort of society which is not run on Darwinian principles while fully acknowledging that the brains and bodies that we possess were put there by Darwinian principles in the first place. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:52          You mentioned in the reading, there's something about this unique gift of foresight. Now as I understand how how normal evolution works is you're in a particular place, a specific environment. It gets cold say and you got a few more feathers than the other bird. So you have that advantage of having a few more feathers. So he should be shivers, shivers and dies and you go out and have a baby. Now cause I this idea, whoever is [inaudible] it's based in time in this moment. Yeah. Now you said something about how human beings have the unique gift of foresight. How does that, well, the, the, the example you [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          13:30          give of the bird with the most feathers surviving and laying the most eggs, that's exactly how it would work. And there is no foresight there, but human beings can look ahead and say, well, in a few decades time it's going to get cold as an ice age forecast. So let's develop some new technology that will coach. We could do, Oh yes. Um, that, that's foresight and foresight has literally never happened before in the whole history of life. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:01          But if people with this foresight decide, okay, let's breed a, a set of flying horses so that we can leave the cold places and gallop off to the warm places at that point. Is Evolution as you understand it over they, in other words, does that new ingredient adding foresight to the mix take away one of the essential bits of this that somehow it happens without a plan. Now there was a plan. Yeah. Um, I presume, I don't need to say to this sophisticated audience that you're an example of that making horses that flies a hypothetical and, and um, um, well I have a horse that flies in the second row, but he's quiet at the moment.

Speaker 3:          14:39          Um, yes. Um, it, it does suggest that theoretically in future centuries perhaps evolution could take an entirely new human guided term and you really could plan for the future of evolution. Well, let me ask you the tougher question. If you know, and I know that we as a group, as a species are capable of creating flying horses or whatever, does that then take us above all the other animals and above all the other plants and give us back our special place that Darwin sort of made thought tumbled us from? Yes. I think that there are lots of big differences between humans and other species and lots of big differences between each species and each other species, but humans are especially differently different. And one of the respects in which that's true is exactly what you've said. I think there are others too.

Speaker 1:          15:32          But the big, big, big difference as Professor Dawkins and when we finished our conversation at the y, he and his wife, the actress Lala Ward, kind of gave her the final dramatic flourish. They did a reading from his book, a devil's chaplain, but he insists that our great advantage as a species is we finally have the brainpower to make our own future for ourselves.

Speaker 3:          15:54          For Good Darwinian reasons. Evolution gave us a brain whose size increased to the point where it became capable of understanding its own provenance of deploring, the moral implications, and to fighting against them. The Shark may out swim you the Cheetah out run you the swift out fly you the kappa, not climb you the elephant out power you, the redwoods,

Speaker 1:          17:34          and speaking about gifts. When it comes to internalizing the very cosmos, we turn to the Alfred p Sloan Foundation and to the National Science Foundation and of course to the corporation for public broadcasting. I'm Robert Krulwich. Chad, we'll be back with the very soon. I'm thinking you better be so long. For now.
