yeah<00:07:35.310><c> I</c><00:07:35.340><c> think</c><00:07:35.520><c> with</c><00:07:35.610><c> Maguire</c><00:07:36.000><c> when</c><00:07:36.360><c> he</c><00:07:36.480><c> was</c>

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think with Maguire when he was
 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.930 align:start position:0%
yeah I think with Maguire when he was
outside<00:07:36.750><c> the</c><00:07:37.320><c> the</c><00:07:37.350><c> mask</c><00:07:37.830><c> he</c><00:07:38.310><c> was</c><00:07:38.460><c> the</c><00:07:38.640><c> certain</c>

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
outside the the mask he was the certain
 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.430 align:start position:0%
outside the the mask he was the certain
character<00:07:39.270><c> and</c><00:07:39.420><c> then</c><00:07:39.510><c> was</c><00:07:39.630><c> in</c><00:07:39.780><c> the</c><00:07:39.870><c> mask</c><00:07:40.080><c> like</c>

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
character and then was in the mask like
 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.900 align:start position:0%
character and then was in the mask like
if<00:07:40.620><c> there</c><00:07:40.800><c> was</c><00:07:40.920><c> no</c><00:07:41.160><c> connection</c><00:07:41.520><c> whatsoever</c>

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910 align:start position:0%
if there was no connection whatsoever
 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.750 align:start position:0%
if there was no connection whatsoever
and<00:07:42.560><c> yeah</c><00:07:43.560><c> I</c><00:07:43.590><c> thought</c><00:07:43.740><c> that</c><00:07:43.800><c> was</c><00:07:43.980><c> a</c><00:07:44.460><c> weakness</c>

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
and yeah I thought that was a weakness
 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.700 align:start position:0%
and yeah I thought that was a weakness
in<00:07:45.000><c> his</c><00:07:45.090><c> performance</c><00:07:45.510><c> where</c><00:07:45.630><c> Garfield</c><00:07:46.050><c> I</c><00:07:46.290><c> mean</c>

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.710 align:start position:0%
in his performance where Garfield I mean
 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
in his performance where Garfield I mean
he<00:07:46.830><c> is</c><00:07:47.070><c> kind</c><00:07:47.280><c> of</c><00:07:47.370><c> a</c><00:07:47.460><c> smartass</c><00:07:47.790><c> as</c><00:07:47.940><c> Peter</c><00:07:48.120><c> Parker</c>

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330 align:start position:0%
he is kind of a smartass as Peter Parker
 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.210 align:start position:0%
he is kind of a smartass as Peter Parker
so<00:07:48.690><c> when</c><00:07:48.870><c> he</c><00:07:48.960><c> was</c><00:07:49.020><c> a</c><00:07:49.110><c> jerk</c><00:07:49.620><c> he's</c><00:07:49.860><c> kind</c><00:07:50.070><c> of</c><00:07:50.100><c> a</c>

so yeah he definitely took some
 

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah he definitely took some

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:17.770 align:start position:0%
liberties with the character but he made
 

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%

it<00:08:17.860><c> his</c><00:08:18.039><c> own</c><00:08:18.160><c> and</c><00:08:18.520><c> I</c><00:08:18.610><c> think</c><00:08:18.639><c> that's</c><00:08:19.060><c> you</c><00:08:19.660><c> know</c>

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:19.690 align:start position:0%
it his own and I think that's you know
 

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.890 align:start position:0%
it his own and I think that's you know
more<00:08:20.199><c> than</c><00:08:20.379><c> what</c><00:08:20.590><c> McGuire</c><00:08:20.949><c> did</c><00:08:21.280><c> I</c><00:08:22.210><c> think</c><00:08:22.720><c> that</c>

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:22.900 align:start position:0%
more than what McGuire did I think that
 

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
more than what McGuire did I think that
he<00:08:23.430><c> tailored</c><00:08:24.430><c> it</c><00:08:24.550><c> more</c><00:08:24.729><c> to</c><00:08:24.849><c> his</c><00:08:24.970><c> personality</c>

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:25.449 align:start position:0%
he tailored it more to his personality
 

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.330 align:start position:0%
he tailored it more to his personality
and<00:08:25.840><c> I</c><00:08:26.020><c> think</c><00:08:26.229><c> that</c><00:08:26.379><c> shows</c><00:08:26.710><c> in</c><00:08:27.099><c> his</c>

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:27.340 align:start position:0%
and I think that shows in his
 

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
and I think that shows in his
interactions<00:08:27.909><c> with</c><00:08:27.970><c> the</c><00:08:28.150><c> other</c><00:08:28.270><c> characters</c>
