00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.830 align:start position:0%
did that it worked well I wrote some

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
pieces for yo-yo he played them and so
 

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
pieces for yo-yo he played them and so
that<00:12:13.050><c> kind</c><00:12:13.080><c> of</c><00:12:13.260><c> hyper</c><00:12:13.470><c> cello</c><00:12:13.770><c> started</c><00:12:14.250><c> taking</c>

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.490 align:start position:0%
that kind of hyper cello started taking
 

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.260 align:start position:0%
that kind of hyper cello started taking
off<00:12:14.670><c> at</c><00:12:15.150><c> the</c><00:12:15.240><c> same</c><00:12:15.450><c> time</c><00:12:15.660><c> we</c><00:12:16.380><c> were</c><00:12:16.470><c> rehearsing</c>

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:17.270 align:start position:0%
off at the same time we were rehearsing
 

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.500 align:start position:0%
off at the same time we were rehearsing
and<00:12:18.270><c> we</c><00:12:18.720><c> found</c><00:12:18.870><c> that</c><00:12:19.020><c> when</c><00:12:19.200><c> yo-yos</c><00:12:19.890><c> bow</c><00:12:20.510><c> got</c>

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:21.510 align:start position:0%
and we found that when yo-yos bow got
 

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.930 align:start position:0%
and we found that when yo-yos bow got
close<00:12:21.870><c> to</c><00:12:22.050><c> the</c><00:12:22.230><c> cello</c><00:12:22.800><c> when</c><00:12:23.250><c> his</c><00:12:23.370><c> hand</c><00:12:23.610><c> got</c>

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
close to the cello when his hand got
 

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
close to the cello when his hand got
close<00:12:24.180><c> to</c><00:12:24.330><c> the</c><00:12:24.420><c> cello</c><00:12:24.660><c> the</c><00:12:25.560><c> measurement</c><00:12:26.040><c> went</c>

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.250 align:start position:0%
close to the cello the measurement went
 

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.340 align:start position:0%
close to the cello the measurement went
all<00:12:26.400><c> wacky</c><00:12:27.060><c> it</c><00:12:27.540><c> wasn't</c><00:12:27.870><c> supposed</c><00:12:28.110><c> to</c><00:12:28.200><c> do</c><00:12:28.320><c> that</c>

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:28.350 align:start position:0%
all wacky it wasn't supposed to do that
 

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.770 align:start position:0%
all wacky it wasn't supposed to do that
so<00:12:28.950><c> we</c><00:12:29.040><c> went</c><00:12:29.160><c> back</c><00:12:29.370><c> to</c><00:12:29.400><c> the</c><00:12:29.550><c> lab</c><00:12:29.790><c> we</c><00:12:30.450><c> found</c><00:12:30.480><c> out</c>

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
so we went back to the lab we found out
 

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
so we went back to the lab we found out
that<00:12:30.810><c> sure</c><00:12:31.080><c> enough</c><00:12:31.200><c> his</c><00:12:31.530><c> body</c><00:12:31.920><c> was</c><00:12:32.760><c> absorbing</c>

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.210 align:start position:0%
that sure enough his body was absorbing
 

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.100 align:start position:0%
that sure enough his body was absorbing
electricity<00:12:33.810><c> from</c>

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.110 align:start position:0%
electricity from
 

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.050 align:start position:0%
electricity from
this<00:12:34.230><c> circuit</c><00:12:34.620><c> which</c><00:12:35.430><c> is</c><00:12:35.550><c> kind</c><00:12:35.700><c> of</c><00:12:35.760><c> a</c><00:12:35.820><c> drag</c>

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
this circuit which is kind of a drag
 

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.449 align:start position:0%
this circuit which is kind of a drag
because<00:12:36.390><c> you</c><00:12:36.810><c> know</c><00:12:36.899><c> it</c><00:12:37.190><c> became</c><00:12:38.190><c> unpredictable</c>

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
because you know it became unpredictable
 

00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:41.180 align:start position:0%
because you know it became unpredictable
so<00:12:39.060><c> first</c><00:12:39.390><c> we</c><00:12:39.540><c> figured</c><00:12:39.810><c> out</c><00:12:39.930><c> how</c><00:12:40.079><c> to</c><00:12:40.140><c> modify</c><00:12:41.010><c> it</c>

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:41.190 align:start position:0%
so first we figured out how to modify it
 

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.790 align:start position:0%
so first we figured out how to modify it
so<00:12:41.459><c> you</c><00:12:41.519><c> could</c><00:12:41.779><c> predict</c><00:12:42.779><c> it</c><00:12:42.899><c> but</c><00:12:43.500><c> then</c><00:12:43.680><c> I</c>

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
so you could predict it but then I
 

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
so you could predict it but then I
started<00:12:44.130><c> thinking</c><00:12:44.430><c> oh</c><00:12:44.579><c> gee</c><00:12:45.060><c> if</c><00:12:46.700><c> this</c><00:12:47.700><c> electric</c>

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
started thinking oh gee if this electric
 

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.710 align:start position:0%
started thinking oh gee if this electric
circuit<00:12:49.050><c> is</c><00:12:49.200><c> is</c><00:12:50.120><c> measuring</c><00:12:51.120><c> where</c><00:12:51.300><c> you</c><00:12:51.630><c> know</c>

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
circuit is is measuring where you know
 

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:53.370 align:start position:0%
how much electricity is hand is
 

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.460 align:start position:0%
how much electricity is hand is
absorbing<00:12:53.910><c> it</c><00:12:54.360><c> actually</c><00:12:54.660><c> knows</c><00:12:54.839><c> what</c><00:12:55.140><c> I</c><00:12:55.260><c> could</c>

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:55.470 align:start position:0%
absorbing it actually knows what I could
 

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.470 align:start position:0%
absorbing it actually knows what I could

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
tell where his hand is and if I could do
 

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
tell where his hand is and if I could do
that<00:12:57.630><c> I</c><00:12:57.959><c> can</c><00:12:58.769><c> actually</c><00:12:58.980><c> throw</c><00:12:59.130><c> away</c><00:12:59.370><c> the</c><00:12:59.490><c> cello</c>

00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that I can actually throw away the cello
 

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.060 align:start position:0%
that I can actually throw away the cello
and<00:13:00.029><c> throw</c><00:13:00.240><c> away</c><00:13:00.269><c> the</c><00:13:00.420><c> bow</c><00:13:00.720><c> and</c><00:13:01.079><c> just</c><00:13:01.110><c> make</c><00:13:01.950><c> an</c>

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.070 align:start position:0%
and throw away the bow and just make an
 

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
and throw away the bow and just make an
