00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
know I'm a mathematician I can do the
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.520
know I'm a mathematician I can do the
calculation and I know that this is not

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
calculation and I know that this is not
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170
calculation and I know that this is not
a great idea gonna be costing a lot of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
a great idea gonna be costing a lot of
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.520
a great idea gonna be costing a lot of
money but I kind of want to think about

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530
money but I kind of want to think about
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.990
money but I kind of want to think about
how much is it gonna cost the sticker

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
how much is it gonna cost the sticker
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.830
how much is it gonna cost the sticker
album this year has 682 stickers

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
album this year has 682 stickers
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.469
album this year has 682 stickers
the last one is 681 but for some reason

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
the last one is 681 but for some reason
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.580
the last one is 681 but for some reason
they decided that the first one should

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
they decided that the first one should
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039
they decided that the first one should
have number 0 so there's 682 stickers

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
have number 0 so there's 682 stickers
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990
have number 0 so there's 682 stickers
each one of these packs cost $1.00

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
each one of these packs cost $1.00
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149
each one of these packs cost $1.00
there's 5 stickers in each one and so

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
there's 5 stickers in each one and so
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.100
there's 5 stickers in each one and so
that means that each sticker is 20 cents

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
that means that each sticker is 20 cents
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.810
that means that each sticker is 20 cents
the difficult thing is that I don't get

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
the difficult thing is that I don't get
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.789
the difficult thing is that I don't get
to choose what's what's in here so you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
to choose what's what's in here so you
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.330
to choose what's what's in here so you
know if I got super lucky and I got all

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
know if I got super lucky and I got all
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.560
know if I got super lucky and I got all
the stickers that I wanted with no

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
the stickers that I wanted with no
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.120
the stickers that I wanted with no
repeats then there would be 682 stickers

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
repeats then there would be 682 stickers
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280
repeats then there would be 682 stickers
so when I multiply this this would be

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
so when I multiply this this would be
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.130
so when I multiply this this would be
the cost of filling the album 136

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
the cost of filling the album 136
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899
the cost of filling the album 136
dollars and 40 cents but of course

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
dollars and 40 cents but of course
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.370
dollars and 40 cents but of course
there's no way that I'm ever gonna get

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
there's no way that I'm ever gonna get
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.850
there's no way that I'm ever gonna get
that lucky

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
that lucky
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.160
that lucky
okay I'm gonna you know if anybody has

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
okay I'm gonna you know if anybody has
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.389
okay I'm gonna you know if anybody has
done this before they know that you keep

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
done this before they know that you keep
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.649
done this before they know that you keep
getting repeats and repeats and repeats

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
getting repeats and repeats and repeats
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.980
getting repeats and repeats and repeats
and so what I'm asking myself is how

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
and so what I'm asking myself is how
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.260
and so what I'm asking myself is how
many stickers will I need to buy until I

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
many stickers will I need to buy until I
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.490
many stickers will I need to buy until I
get all of them actually this is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
get all of them actually this is
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.479
get all of them actually this is
something that people have tried to do

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
something that people have tried to do
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830
something that people have tried to do
before so the most recent story that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
before so the most recent story that
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.700
before so the most recent story that
came out talked about how it would cut

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710
came out talked about how it would cut
 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.890
came out talked about how it would cut
about $1,000 to fill the album and I see

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
about $1,000 to fill the album and I see
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.380
about $1,000 to fill the album and I see
where they get that but I want to I want

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
where they get that but I want to I want
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.670
where they get that but I want to I want
to give us a different way of thinking

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680
to give us a different way of thinking
 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.140
to give us a different way of thinking
about this because the the problem is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
about this because the the problem is
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.610
about this because the the problem is
that that estimated with a thousand

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
that that estimated with a thousand
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.960
that that estimated with a thousand
dollars assumes that you're just buying

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
dollars assumes that you're just buying
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.040
dollars assumes that you're just buying
and buying and buying and buying

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050
and buying and buying and buying
 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.990
and buying and buying and buying
stickers and that's not really how it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000
stickers and that's not really how it
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.500
stickers and that's not really how it
works how it works is that many people

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
works how it works is that many people
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.000
works how it works is that many people
around around you are buying stickers

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
around around you are buying stickers
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.880
around around you are buying stickers
and so whenever you get repeats and they

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
and so whenever you get repeats and they
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.500
and so whenever you get repeats and they
get repeats then you're able to swap

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510
get repeats then you're able to swap
 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.790
get repeats then you're able to swap
with each other and that way you were

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800
with each other and that way you were
 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.440
with each other and that way you were
able to lower the costs let's say that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
able to lower the costs let's say that
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.940
able to lower the costs let's say that
we're trying to find this number n which

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
we're trying to find this number n which
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.180
we're trying to find this number n which
is the number of stickers I expect to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
is the number of stickers I expect to
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.270
is the number of stickers I expect to
buy before I get every sticker at least

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
buy before I get every sticker at least
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.220
buy before I get every sticker at least
once this is the lonely sticker

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
once this is the lonely sticker
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.990
once this is the lonely sticker
collector version I mean I'm I'm in the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000
collector version I mean I'm I'm in the
 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.880

u.s. I have nobody to trade with and so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
u.s. I have nobody to trade with and so
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.350
u.s. I have nobody to trade with and so
I'm just going to imagine that I'm that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360
I'm just going to imagine that I'm that
 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.760
I'm just going to imagine that I'm that
I'm buying and buying stickers until I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770
I'm buying and buying stickers until I
 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.550
I'm buying and buying stickers until I
get them let me try to define and I to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560
get them let me try to define and I to
 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.220
get them let me try to define and I to
be how many stickers it took me to get

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230
be how many stickers it took me to get
 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.500
be how many stickers it took me to get
between the eyes new sticker and the I

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510
between the eyes new sticker and the I
 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.210
between the eyes new sticker and the I
plus one new sticker okay so for example

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
plus one new sticker okay so for example
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.670
plus one new sticker okay so for example
and zero will be how many stickers until

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
and zero will be how many stickers until
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.030
and zero will be how many stickers until
I get the first new one and one will be

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
I get the first new one and one will be
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.510
I get the first new one and one will be
how many times until I get the second so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520
how many times until I get the second so
 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.040
how many times until I get the second so
you can imagine for example what is n

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050
you can imagine for example what is n
 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.930
you can imagine for example what is n
200 that means that I've bought a lot of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940
200 that means that I've bought a lot of
 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.870

long did it take me to get the first new
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.970
long did it take me to get the first new
one Plus how long did it take me to get

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980
one Plus how long did it take me to get
 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.390
one Plus how long did it take me to get
the second new one and so on until I get

the second new one and so on until I get
 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.060
the second new one and so on until I get
the last new one this is how long it's

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070
the last new one this is how long it's
 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.950
the last new one this is how long it's
going to take me to find the very last

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960
going to take me to find the very last
 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.200
going to take me to find the very last
one and so if I want to find this number

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210
one and so if I want to find this number
 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.300
one and so if I want to find this number
n how many stickers I need to buy what

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310
n how many stickers I need to buy what
 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.350
n how many stickers I need to buy what
I'm going to do is I'm going to actually

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360
I'm going to do is I'm going to actually
 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.640
I'm going to do is I'm going to actually
try to find each one of these numbers

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650
try to find each one of these numbers
 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.350
try to find each one of these numbers
and let's just say we want to compute

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360
and let's just say we want to compute
 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.840
and let's just say we want to compute
and 200 for an example what I want you

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850
and 200 for an example what I want you
 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.030
and 200 for an example what I want you
to imagine is this I have 200 stickers

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
to imagine is this I have 200 stickers
 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.010
to imagine is this I have 200 stickers
and now I'm going to buy a new one so

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020
and now I'm going to buy a new one so
 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.380
and now I'm going to buy a new one so
you can imagine I I open a pack I grab

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390
you can imagine I I open a pack I grab
 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.360
you can imagine I I open a pack I grab
one of them and this is this is what I

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370
one of them and this is this is what I
 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.070
one of them and this is this is what I
get I don't know 10 dos Santos from

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080
get I don't know 10 dos Santos from
 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.140
get I don't know 10 dos Santos from
Mexico and then what I do is that I I

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150
Mexico and then what I do is that I I
 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.060
Mexico and then what I do is that I I
have to look and see do I already have

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070
have to look and see do I already have
 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.580
have to look and see do I already have
Jonathan dos Santos is he one of the 200

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590
Jonathan dos Santos is he one of the 200
 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.010
Jonathan dos Santos is he one of the 200
that I already have or do I not have it

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020
that I already have or do I not have it
 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.380
that I already have or do I not have it
yet and of course there's there's 682

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390
yet and of course there's there's 682
 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.150
yet and of course there's there's 682
possibilities of which one this could be

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160
possibilities of which one this could be
 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.170
possibilities of which one this could be
this is number

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180
 
 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.920
 
1 681 let's imagine that I put a circle

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930
1 681 let's imagine that I put a circle
 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.140
1 681 let's imagine that I put a circle
around the ones that I already had so

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150
around the ones that I already had so
 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.460
around the ones that I already had so
let's say that I already found sticker

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470
let's say that I already found sticker
 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.030
let's say that I already found sticker
number 1

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040
number 1
 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.430
number 1
I haven't found 0 I haven't found 2

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440
I haven't found 0 I haven't found 2
 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.580
I haven't found 0 I haven't found 2
let's say that I did find 461 already

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590
let's say that I did find 461 already
 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.100
let's say that I did find 461 already
and I haven't found 681 so I pulled

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110
and I haven't found 681 so I pulled
 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.870
and I haven't found 681 so I pulled
another sticker out and I want you to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880
another sticker out and I want you to
 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.939
another sticker out and I want you to
imagine that this is andreas

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949
imagine that this is andreas
 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.800
imagine that this is andreas
Christiansen from Denmark number 257 and

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810
Christiansen from Denmark number 257 and
 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.189
Christiansen from Denmark number 257 and
now imagine that I open my album and I

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199
now imagine that I open my album and I
 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.170
now imagine that I open my album and I
find that undress Christiansen is not

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180
find that undress Christiansen is not
 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.300
find that undress Christiansen is not
one that I have already so I get I get

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310
one that I have already so I get I get
 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.460
one that I have already so I get I get
to stick him right away and so it only

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470
to stick him right away and so it only
 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.870
to stick him right away and so it only
took me one new sticker to get a one new

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880
took me one new sticker to get a one new
 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.750
took me one new sticker to get a one new
player okay so if this was the first one

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760
player okay so if this was the first one
 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.770
player okay so if this was the first one
that I drew then it would take me one

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780
that I drew then it would take me one
 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.820
that I drew then it would take me one
new sticker you know if I happen to draw

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830
new sticker you know if I happen to draw
 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.950
new sticker you know if I happen to draw
this one out then it takes me one

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960
this one out then it takes me one
 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.810
this one out then it takes me one
sticker to get a new one here it takes

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820
sticker to get a new one here it takes
 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.700
sticker to get a new one here it takes
me one sticker to get a new one but now

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710
me one sticker to get a new one but now
 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.650
me one sticker to get a new one but now
let's just go back to the reality where

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660
let's just go back to the reality where
 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.450
let's just go back to the reality where
I actually pull Jonathan dos Santos and

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460
I actually pull Jonathan dos Santos and
 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.850
I actually pull Jonathan dos Santos and
I did have Jonathan dos Santos already

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860
I did have Jonathan dos Santos already
 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.409
I did have Jonathan dos Santos already
and so now the question is how many

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419
and so now the question is how many
 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.540
and so now the question is how many
stickers is it going to take me from now

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550
stickers is it going to take me from now
 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.930
stickers is it going to take me from now
on well this was a waste you know I

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940
on well this was a waste you know I
 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.810
on well this was a waste you know I
already had Jonathan dos Santos he's not

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820
already had Jonathan dos Santos he's not
 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.240
already had Jonathan dos Santos he's not
useful to me so I need to draw again how

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250
useful to me so I need to draw again how
 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.219
useful to me so I need to draw again how
many new steps is it going to take me to

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229
many new steps is it going to take me to
 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.469
many new steps is it going to take me to
get the next one well this is precisely

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479
get the next one well this is precisely
 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.899
get the next one well this is precisely
the definition of the number and 200 so

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909
the definition of the number and 200 so
 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.850
the definition of the number and 200 so
I wasted this step and and it's like I

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860
I wasted this step and and it's like I
 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.110
I wasted this step and and it's like I
have to start over and it's still going

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120
have to start over and it's still going
 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.820
have to start over and it's still going
to take me and 200 steps because that's

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830
to take me and 200 steps because that's
 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.589
to take me and 200 steps because that's
what that number means so if I draw

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599
what that number means so if I draw
 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.779
what that number means so if I draw
Jonathan dos Santos it's actually gonna

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789
Jonathan dos Santos it's actually gonna
 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.330
Jonathan dos Santos it's actually gonna
take me 1 plus and 200 stickers before I

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340
take me 1 plus and 200 stickers before I
 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.860
take me 1 plus and 200 stickers before I
get into the same for example if I draw

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870
get into the same for example if I draw
 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.930
get into the same for example if I draw
number 1 it's going to take me one plus

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940
number 1 it's going to take me one plus
 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.580
number 1 it's going to take me one plus
M two hundred so basically depending on

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590
M two hundred so basically depending on
 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.439
M two hundred so basically depending on
what I draw here it's either gonna work

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449
what I draw here it's either gonna work
 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.540
what I draw here it's either gonna work
right away I just draw one sticker and

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550
right away I just draw one sticker and
 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.460
right away I just draw one sticker and
it's a new one or if I already had it

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470
it's a new one or if I already had it
 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.200
it's a new one or if I already had it
then it's going to take me 1 plus and

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210
then it's going to take me 1 plus and
 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.589
then it's going to take me 1 plus and
200 stickers how many stickers did I

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599
200 stickers how many stickers did I
 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.649
200 stickers how many stickers did I
already have I had 200 stickers already

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659
already have I had 200 stickers already
 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.589
already have I had 200 stickers already
so in 200 of the draws is going to take

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599
so in 200 of the draws is going to take
 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.420
so in 200 of the draws is going to take
me there's many steps to get the next

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430
me there's many steps to get the next
 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.750
me there's many steps to get the next
one whereas for the stickers that I'm

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760
one whereas for the stickers that I'm
 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.490
one whereas for the stickers that I'm
missing which is a lot I'm missing four

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500
missing which is a lot I'm missing four
 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.230
missing which is a lot I'm missing four
hundred and eighty two of them is going

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240
hundred and eighty two of them is going
 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.450
hundred and eighty two of them is going
to go right away and so when I average

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460
to go right away and so when I average
 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.170
to go right away and so when I average
these numbers over the total number

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180
these numbers over the total number
 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.350
these numbers over the total number
which is 680 to

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360
which is 680 to
 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.119
which is 680 to
well that average is going to be how

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129
well that average is going to be how
 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.550
well that average is going to be how
long it takes me to get statistic so I

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560
long it takes me to get statistic so I
 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.219
long it takes me to get statistic so I
get this nice equation and now if you

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229
get this nice equation and now if you
 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:44.420
get this nice equation and now if you
look at this equation you're going to

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430
look at this equation you're going to
 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.119
look at this equation you're going to
find it 200 plus 480 2 is equal to 682

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129
find it 200 plus 480 2 is equal to 682
 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.670
find it 200 plus 480 2 is equal to 682
so this equation is just saying this is

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680
so this equation is just saying this is
 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.209
so this equation is just saying this is
equal to 1 plus 200 over 682 times n is

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:56.219
equal to 1 plus 200 over 682 times n is
 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.209
equal to 1 plus 200 over 682 times n is
200 what I get is that the number of

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219
200 what I get is that the number of
 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.040
200 what I get is that the number of
stickers that I should expect to buy

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050
stickers that I should expect to buy
 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.559
stickers that I should expect to buy
before I get the 200 and first no one is

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569
before I get the 200 and first no one is
 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:04.939
before I get the 200 and first no one is
going to be this so that's one

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:04.949
going to be this so that's one
 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.189
going to be this so that's one
computation now as you can imagine the

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199
computation now as you can imagine the
 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.719
computation now as you can imagine the
same argument will work for any one of

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729
same argument will work for any one of
 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.059
same argument will work for any one of
these numbers okay and so what I want to

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:11.069
these numbers okay and so what I want to
 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.170
these numbers okay and so what I want to
do now is generalize and do this for any

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180
do now is generalize and do this for any
 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.209
do now is generalize and do this for any
one of these numbers and I think the key

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:17.219
one of these numbers and I think the key
 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.490
one of these numbers and I think the key
thing that we should realize here is

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500
thing that we should realize here is
 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.680
thing that we should realize here is
where did this 482 come from well you

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690
where did this 482 come from well you
 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.110
where did this 482 come from well you
saw what happened it was 680 to minus

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120
saw what happened it was 680 to minus
 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.170
saw what happened it was 680 to minus
200 and I which is how many stickers I

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180
200 and I which is how many stickers I
 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.689
200 and I which is how many stickers I
need to buy between the new sticker and

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:29.699
need to buy between the new sticker and
 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.490
need to buy between the new sticker and
the I plus first new sticker is going to

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500
the I plus first new sticker is going to
 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.740
the I plus first new sticker is going to
be 682 divided by 682 minus I and so if

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750
be 682 divided by 682 minus I and so if
 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.450
be 682 divided by 682 minus I and so if
I combine these two what I'm gonna get

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460
I combine these two what I'm gonna get
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:44.170
I combine these two what I'm gonna get
is that n is equal to 682 over 682 plus

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.180
is that n is equal to 682 over 682 plus
 

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.149
is that n is equal to 682 over 682 plus
682 over 681 682 over 680 you can say

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159
682 over 681 682 over 680 you can say
 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.189
682 over 681 682 over 680 you can say
when you open your first pack you were

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199
when you open your first pack you were
 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.140
when you open your first pack you were
definitely gonna get a sticker you

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.150
definitely gonna get a sticker you
 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.300
definitely gonna get a sticker you
didn't have exactly so this is this is

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.310
didn't have exactly so this is this is
 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.990
didn't have exactly so this is this is
the number n sub 0 how long is it gonna

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000
the number n sub 0 how long is it gonna
 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.879
the number n sub 0 how long is it gonna
take me to get the first new sticker for

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:01.889
take me to get the first new sticker for
 

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.320
take me to get the first new sticker for
sure no matter what the first one I get

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:03.330
sure no matter what the first one I get
 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.760
sure no matter what the first one I get
is that's gonna just gonna come right

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:04.770
is that's gonna just gonna come right
 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.149
is that's gonna just gonna come right
away and as you go on it gets harder and

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159
away and as you go on it gets harder and
 

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:09.769
away and as you go on it gets harder and
harder and harder and harder to get a

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:09.779
harder and harder and harder to get a
 

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:11.749
harder and harder and harder to get a
new one what is the last one and so I

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759
new one what is the last one and so I
 

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.930
new one what is the last one and so I
get 682 divided by 682 minus 681 which

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940
get 682 divided by 682 minus 681 which
 

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.209
get 682 divided by 682 minus 681 which
is equal to 1 that makes sense as well

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:17.219
is equal to 1 that makes sense as well
 

00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:19.040
is equal to 1 that makes sense as well
because when you win there's one sticker

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.050
because when you win there's one sticker
 

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.100
because when you win there's one sticker
you need you've got a 1 in 682 chance of

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.110
you need you've got a 1 in 682 chance of
 

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.360
you need you've got a 1 in 682 chance of
getting it and it's so hard to get it

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:23.370
getting it and it's so hard to get it
 

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.469
getting it and it's so hard to get it
and I think it's worth dumping on this

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479
and I think it's worth dumping on this
 

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:29.749
and I think it's worth dumping on this
point a little bit this is how long it

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759
point a little bit this is how long it
 

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.079
point a little bit this is how long it
takes you to get the very last sticker

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:33.089
takes you to get the very last sticker
 

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:35.329
takes you to get the very last sticker
okay and anybody who's collected this

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:35.339
okay and anybody who's collected this
 

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:38.180
okay and anybody who's collected this
who's collected anything knows that this

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:38.190
who's collected anything knows that this
 

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.040
who's collected anything knows that this
gets so much harder and at the very end

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.050
gets so much harder and at the very end
 

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.870
gets so much harder and at the very end
if I already got every single sticker

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880
if I already got every single sticker
 

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.120
if I already got every single sticker
and I'm only missing one and I asked

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.130
and I'm only missing one and I asked
 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.519
and I'm only missing one and I asked
myself how many should I buy until I get

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:46.529
myself how many should I buy until I get
 

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:48.290
myself how many should I buy until I get
that no one is gonna take me a whole

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300
that no one is gonna take me a whole
 

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.759
that no one is gonna take me a whole
albums worth

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:49.769
albums worth
 

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:51.679
albums worth
just to get that last sticker so I think

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:51.689
just to get that last sticker so I think
 

00:08:51.689 --> 00:08:52.759
just to get that last sticker so I think
at this point there's two kinds of

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:52.769
at this point there's two kinds of
 

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:54.439
at this point there's two kinds of
people there's one kind of people who

00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:54.449
people there's one kind of people who
 

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:56.059
people there's one kind of people who
will be like oh this is so beautiful

00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:56.069
will be like oh this is so beautiful
 

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:58.040
will be like oh this is so beautiful
let's explore the mathematics of this

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.050
let's explore the mathematics of this
 

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.809
let's explore the mathematics of this
and there's other people that will say

00:08:59.809 --> 00:08:59.819
and there's other people that will say
 

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:01.249
and there's other people that will say
what was the answer let's talk about

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:01.259
what was the answer let's talk about
 

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:02.720
what was the answer let's talk about
what the answer is first and then we'll

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:02.730
what the answer is first and then we'll
 

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.009
what the answer is first and then we'll
come back to the beautiful mathematics

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019
come back to the beautiful mathematics
 

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:05.689
come back to the beautiful mathematics
behind this what is this number I

00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:05.699
behind this what is this number I
 

00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:07.639
behind this what is this number I
compute I computed I went to a computer

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:07.649
compute I computed I went to a computer
 

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:09.739
compute I computed I went to a computer
I worked it out that this number is

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:09.749
I worked it out that this number is
 

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:13.150
I worked it out that this number is
about four thousand eight hundred and

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160
about four thousand eight hundred and
 

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.739
about four thousand eight hundred and
forty four so this is the number of

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:15.749
forty four so this is the number of
 

00:09:15.749 --> 00:09:17.749
forty four so this is the number of
stickers that I should expect to buy

00:09:17.749 --> 00:09:17.759
stickers that I should expect to buy
 

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:19.460
stickers that I should expect to buy
that's a lot of money I'm not about to

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:19.470
that's a lot of money I'm not about to
 

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.929
that's a lot of money I'm not about to
do that I don't have that kind of

00:09:20.929 --> 00:09:20.939
do that I don't have that kind of
 

00:09:20.939 --> 00:09:22.519
do that I don't have that kind of
paycheck what if you use the service

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:22.529
paycheck what if you use the service
 

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:24.799
paycheck what if you use the service
that panini offers which is that once

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:24.809
that panini offers which is that once
 

00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:26.900
that panini offers which is that once
you have 50 stickers that you're missing

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:26.910
you have 50 stickers that you're missing
 

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.609
you have 50 stickers that you're missing
then you can just order them from them

00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:28.619
then you can just order them from them
 

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:31.069
then you can just order them from them
just send me those and then I'll fill my

just send me those and then I'll fill my
 

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:32.210
just send me those and then I'll fill my
album and I don't have to trade it with

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220
album and I don't have to trade it with
 

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.650
album and I don't have to trade it with
anybody I basically have to do this

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660
anybody I basically have to do this
 

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.600
anybody I basically have to do this
computation except that instead of going

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:35.610
computation except that instead of going
 

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.900
computation except that instead of going
all the way from zero to 682 I want to

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:38.910
all the way from zero to 682 I want to
 

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.660
all the way from zero to 682 I want to
do it from zero to 632

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:41.670
do it from zero to 632
 

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.220
do it from zero to 632
it's about 1775 stickers okay siding so

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:46.230
it's about 1775 stickers okay siding so
 

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.919

we're coming down from a thousand to 355

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:48.929
we're coming down from a thousand to 355
 

00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:50.090
we're coming down from a thousand to 355
and I think that's pretty shocking that

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100
and I think that's pretty shocking that
 

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.239
and I think that's pretty shocking that
to get the first 632 stickers cost you

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:53.249
to get the first 632 stickers cost you
 

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:56.689
to get the first 632 stickers cost you
355 and to get the last fifty it's like

00:09:56.689 --> 00:09:56.699
355 and to get the last fifty it's like
 

00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:58.579
355 and to get the last fifty it's like
over six hundred dollars do we have to

00:09:58.579 --> 00:09:58.589
over six hundred dollars do we have to
 

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:01.009
over six hundred dollars do we have to
pay panini for those fifty though we do

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019
pay panini for those fifty though we do
 

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:02.869
pay panini for those fifty though we do
and I have to be honest that I I think

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:02.879
and I have to be honest that I I think
 

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:04.519
and I have to be honest that I I think
they do it at face value but I'm not

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:04.529
they do it at face value but I'm not
 

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:06.049
they do it at face value but I'm not
totally sure but that's not fun I mean

00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:06.059
totally sure but that's not fun I mean
 

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:07.579
totally sure but that's not fun I mean
the whole point of this is to buy

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:07.589
the whole point of this is to buy
 

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:08.780
the whole point of this is to buy
stickers and trade it with other people

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:08.790
stickers and trade it with other people
 

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.030
stickers and trade it with other people
and so on and so I think we should go

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040
and so on and so I think we should go
 

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.079
and so on and so I think we should go
for a little bit of a more realistic

it's an integral from zero to infinity

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360
it's an integral from zero to infinity
 

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.960
it's an integral from zero to infinity
or some very big expression it looks

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:08.970
or some very big expression it looks
 

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.010

like this one - and big parentheses one

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:13.020
like this one - and big parentheses one
 

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.080
like this one - and big parentheses one
- it's a quotient here here I get 1 plus

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.090
- it's a quotient here here I get 1 plus
 

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.980
- it's a quotient here here I get 1 plus
X plus x squared let's say x over 1 x

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:21.990
X plus x squared let's say x over 1 x
 

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.430
X plus x squared let's say x over 1 x
squared over 1 times 2x cubed over 1

number of friends minus 1 and I take all

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600
number of friends minus 1 and I take all
 

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.960
number of friends minus 1 and I take all
of that and I divide it by e to the X I

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:35.970
of that and I divide it by e to the X I
 

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.580

want you this is messy

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:37.590
want you this is messy
 

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.900
want you this is messy
now you take a parenthesis here and you

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:41.910
now you take a parenthesis here and you
 

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.730
now you take a parenthesis here and you
take this whole thing and raise it to

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740
take this whole thing and raise it to
 

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.040
take this whole thing and raise it to
the N which is the number of stickers

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.050
the N which is the number of stickers
 

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.350
the N which is the number of stickers
and then you close the parentheses and

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360
and then you close the parentheses and
 

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.360
and then you close the parentheses and
then this is a Nega integral with

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.370
then this is a Nega integral with
 

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.870
then this is a Nega integral with
variable X and so it's integral here DX

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880
variable X and so it's integral here DX
 

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.910
variable X and so it's integral here DX
it's a monster it's a monster

what I think is beautiful is that I just

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920
what I think is beautiful is that I just
 

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.830
what I think is beautiful is that I just
need a plug in and for the number of

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:06.840
need a plug in and for the number of
 

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.510
need a plug in and for the number of
stickers as for the number of people and

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:08.520
stickers as for the number of people and
 

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.190
stickers as for the number of people and
I'm gonna get the answer for how many

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200
I'm gonna get the answer for how many
 

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.410
I'm gonna get the answer for how many
stickers per person we expect to be how

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420
stickers per person we expect to be how
 

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.540
stickers per person we expect to be how
much of a saving is it to be a sticker

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:14.550
much of a saving is it to be a sticker
 

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.240
much of a saving is it to be a sticker
swap so what we need to do is figure out

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:17.250
swap so what we need to do is figure out
 

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.180
swap so what we need to do is figure out
how to plug in this thing one thing I

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:20.190
how to plug in this thing one thing I
 

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.579
how to plug in this thing one thing I
will say is that if if the number N and

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:22.589
will say is that if if the number N and
 

00:12:22.589 --> 00:12:26.329
will say is that if if the number N and
the number F are pretty small then this

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339
the number F are pretty small then this
 

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:28.070
the number F are pretty small then this
expression is actually not too bad and

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:28.080
expression is actually not too bad and
 

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.329
expression is actually not too bad and
if you've taken a course in integral

00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339
if you've taken a course in integral
 

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:31.550
if you've taken a course in integral
calculus you will have the tools to

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560
calculus you will have the tools to
 

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.130
calculus you will have the tools to
compute this for N and F small but the

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140
compute this for N and F small but the
 

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.390
compute this for N and F small but the
problem is that we're looking at n is

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:35.400
problem is that we're looking at n is
 

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.030
problem is that we're looking at n is
equal to 682 we want to do this for

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040
equal to 682 we want to do this for
 

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.360
equal to 682 we want to do this for
various values of F and so really we're

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:41.370
various values of F and so really we're
 

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.800
various values of F and so really we're
going to have to ask a computer for help

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:42.810
going to have to ask a computer for help
 

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.570
going to have to ask a computer for help
here and so we're just going to plug

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:44.580
here and so we're just going to plug
 

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.280
here and so we're just going to plug
into a computer and we I did this ahead

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:46.290
into a computer and we I did this ahead
 

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.750
into a computer and we I did this ahead
of time and I'll show you some of the

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760
of time and I'll show you some of the
 

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.360
of time and I'll show you some of the
results so for example for F equal to 1

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.370
results so for example for F equal to 1
 

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.860
results so for example for F equal to 1
I got no friends I'm doing it by myself

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:51.870
I got no friends I'm doing it by myself
 

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.480
I got no friends I'm doing it by myself
then we should get the old answer that

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:53.490
then we should get the old answer that
 

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.310
then we should get the old answer that
we got when when we were just buying and

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320
we got when when we were just buying and
 

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.920
we got when when we were just buying and
not trading and you find that the answer

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:57.930
not trading and you find that the answer
 

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:03.920
not trading and you find that the answer
is 4844 960 and $69 now let's say that

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:03.930
is 4844 960 and $69 now let's say that
 

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.240
is 4844 960 and $69 now let's say that
it's just you and me Brady and we're

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:05.250
it's just you and me Brady and we're
 

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.680
it's just you and me Brady and we're
gonna we're gonna do this together and

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:06.690
gonna we're gonna do this together and
 

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.380
gonna we're gonna do this together and
so now we have two friends and as you

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:09.390
so now we have two friends and as you
 

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.640
so now we have two friends and as you
can imagine is going to be a little a

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:10.650
can imagine is going to be a little a
 

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.350
can imagine is going to be a little a
little bit cheaper then the answer that

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360
little bit cheaper then the answer that
 

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.920
little bit cheaper then the answer that
you get is 3 2 1 9 so in total we're

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:15.930
you get is 3 2 1 9 so in total we're
 

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.450
you get is 3 2 1 9 so in total we're
gonna buy like 6,400 steak

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:17.460
gonna buy like 6,400 steak
 

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.670
gonna buy like 6,400 steak
but it's 3,200 each so this is not what

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680
but it's 3,200 each so this is not what
 

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.960
but it's 3,200 each so this is not what
we want to do either we should probably

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:20.970
we want to do either we should probably
 

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.430
we want to do either we should probably
find some more friends because I don't

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440
find some more friends because I don't
 

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.360
find some more friends because I don't
know about you but I'm not about to

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:23.370
know about you but I'm not about to
 

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.769
know about you but I'm not about to
spend six hundred and forty five four

00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779
spend six hundred and forty five four
 

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:29.300
spend six hundred and forty five four
dollars in this okay no I'm not I'm not

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.310
dollars in this okay no I'm not I'm not
 

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.620

so if we have five friends the car
 

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:36.170
so if we have five friends the car
starts getting quite a bit lower so now

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180
starts getting quite a bit lower so now
 

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.430
starts getting quite a bit lower so now
it's going to be two hundred two

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440
it's going to be two hundred two
 

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.840

thousand and fifty stickers per person
 

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.150
thousand and fifty stickers per person
which is about four hundred and ten

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160
which is about four hundred and ten
 

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.130
which is about four hundred and ten

trading with four other people I'll have

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:45.690
trading with four other people I'll have
 

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.290
trading with four other people I'll have
one better than half why I have to cause

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.300
one better than half why I have to cause
 

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.690
one better than half why I have to cause
yeah that's right and are you can

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700
yeah that's right and are you can
 

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.710
yeah that's right and are you can
imagine repolish shouldn't stop there

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720
imagine repolish shouldn't stop there
 

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.019

this is gonna keep going down lower and

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:55.890
this is gonna keep going down lower and
 

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.740
this is gonna keep going down lower and
lower and lower okay and so I actually

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:57.750
lower and lower okay and so I actually
 

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.579
lower and lower okay and so I actually
just ran this for ten friends twenty

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:01.589
just ran this for ten friends twenty
 

00:14:01.589 --> 00:14:03.050
just ran this for ten friends twenty
friends and fifty friends I should say

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060
friends and fifty friends I should say
 

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.910
friends and fifty friends I should say
that it wasn't me running this so I got

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920
that it wasn't me running this so I got

Marcos and I want to give her credit

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860
Marcos and I want to give her credit
 

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.980
Marcos and I want to give her credit
because she's much better with computers

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:09.990
because she's much better with computers
 

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.180
because she's much better with computers
than me so that's looking much better I

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.190
than me so that's looking much better I
 

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:11.510
than me so that's looking much better I
think

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:11.520
think
 

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.040
think
where's this heading towards you know if

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.050
where's this heading towards you know if
 

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.630
where's this heading towards you know if
I live in Colombia where everyone's

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:14.640
I live in Colombia where everyone's
 

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.070
I live in Colombia where everyone's
obsessed with these stickers and there's

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:16.080
obsessed with these stickers and there's
 

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.560
obsessed with these stickers and there's
a population in the millions like how

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:18.570
a population in the millions like how
 

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.750
a population in the millions like how
low can this go just bottomed out

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760
low can this go just bottomed out
 

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.240
low can this go just bottomed out
anywhere so so there's something called

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.250
anywhere so so there's something called
 

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.500
anywhere so so there's something called
the law of large numbers which says that

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:24.510
the law of large numbers which says that
 

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.840
the law of large numbers which says that
basically once we once we have enough

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:26.850
basically once we once we have enough
 

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.030
basically once we once we have enough
people then it kind of cuts teacher was

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040
people then it kind of cuts teacher was
 

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.960
people then it kind of cuts teacher was
essentially the cost of an album 682 so

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:32.970
essentially the cost of an album 682 so
 

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.390
essentially the cost of an album 682 so
if I multiply that by 20 cents I get 136

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:37.400
if I multiply that by 20 cents I get 136
 

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.740
if I multiply that by 20 cents I get 136
of course it can't be lower than that

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:39.750
of course it can't be lower than that
 

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.090
of course it can't be lower than that
because I need to buy all the stickers

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100
because I need to buy all the stickers
 

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.030
because I need to buy all the stickers
and so you know basically however

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040
and so you know basically however
 

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.590
and so you know basically however
whatever price you're willing to pay

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600
whatever price you're willing to pay
 

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.329
whatever price you're willing to pay
that's kind of how you need to figure

00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339
that's kind of how you need to figure
 

00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:48.949
that's kind of how you need to figure
out how much you need to trade and I

00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959
out how much you need to trade and I
 

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:50.680
out how much you need to trade and I
think this is a good argument for really

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:50.690
think this is a good argument for really
 

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.790
think this is a good argument for really
using the panini as the social

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800
using the panini as the social
 

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.380
using the panini as the social
experience that it is and actually going

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:54.390
experience that it is and actually going
 

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.480
experience that it is and actually going
out and seeking our friends and and the

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.490
out and seeking our friends and and the
 

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.530
out and seeking our friends and and the
more that you do it the lower that the

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540
more that you do it the lower that the
 

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.360
more that you do it the lower that the
price can be and it can be down to

00:14:59.360 --> 00:14:59.370
price can be and it can be down to
 

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.550
price can be and it can be down to
pretty close to that 136 one thing that

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560
pretty close to that 136 one thing that
 

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.199
pretty close to that 136 one thing that
I wanted to do is that I don't know

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:03.209
I wanted to do is that I don't know
 

00:15:03.209 --> 00:15:04.699
I wanted to do is that I don't know
about you Brady but I I find this

00:15:04.699 --> 00:15:04.709
about you Brady but I I find this
 

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:07.340
about you Brady but I I find this
formula absolutely amazing you know I

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:07.350
formula absolutely amazing you know I
 

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.079
formula absolutely amazing you know I
sat down and I understood it and I read

00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:09.089
sat down and I understood it and I read
 

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:10.790
sat down and I understood it and I read
the proof and I and it makes sense to me

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800
the proof and I and it makes sense to me
 

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.040
the proof and I and it makes sense to me
and yet I have trouble believing it it's

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.050
and yet I have trouble believing it it's
 

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.519
and yet I have trouble believing it it's
so magical and so one thing that I did

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:16.529
so magical and so one thing that I did
 

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:18.500
so magical and so one thing that I did
is that I reached out to Viviana Marcos

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:18.510
is that I reached out to Viviana Marcos
 

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.389
is that I reached out to Viviana Marcos
again and I asked her hey you're amazing

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399
again and I asked her hey you're amazing
 

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.860
again and I asked her hey you're amazing
with programming can you just run some

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:21.870
with programming can you just run some
 

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.780
with programming can you just run some
simulations that will take ten friends

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:23.790
simulations that will take ten friends
 

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:24.949
simulations that will take ten friends
and will buy stickers for ten friends

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959
and will buy stickers for ten friends
 

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:26.960
and will buy stickers for ten friends
and figure out how many stickers they

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:26.970
and figure out how many stickers they
 

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.090
and figure out how many stickers they
spent and run it a hundred times so that

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100
spent and run it a hundred times so that
 

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.330
spent and run it a hundred times so that
we can get some kind of average

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:30.340
we can get some kind of average
 

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.750
we can get some kind of average
of where it'll be and so I'll show you

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:33.760
of where it'll be and so I'll show you
 

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.700
of where it'll be and so I'll show you
Viviana's numbers I think that's good

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:35.710
Viviana's numbers I think that's good
 

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.680
Viviana's numbers I think that's good
that not only do we have a proof of this

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:37.690
that not only do we have a proof of this
 

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.230
that not only do we have a proof of this
that I that we understand I think

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240
that I that we understand I think
 

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.460
that I that we understand I think
