00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.175
ANNOUNCER: All right.

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:05.300
So please give me a hand in
welcoming to the stage Jenn

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.212
Lederer.

00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:08.626
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.370
JENN LEDERER: Hi.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.759
I am Jenn Lederer,
and you are a unicorn.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.300
Now, what just went
through your mind

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.690
when you heard me say that?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.580
When you heard "I
am a unicorn," were

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.940
you closer to the side
of yes, I am a unicorn.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.350
Thank you for finally
recognizing me.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.180
Or were you to the side of
at best, you're skeptical.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.430
Now, for the unicorns in the
room-- those of you who are

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.620
like totally embodying,
already knowing-- welcome.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.630
Really excited to have you.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.950
But the others, the
skeptics, the ones

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.470
who question what in the
world I could possibly

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.900
be getting at with that,
the ones who maybe rolled

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.274
their eyes a little bit when
you heard it, even if it was

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:11.405
an internal roll-- you are
the ones that I'm really

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.620
excited to be with today.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.418
Because I have learned that
one of the fastest ways to grow

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:23.320
is by learning to ask
the right question,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.290
by having a critical
mind, and by embracing

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.328
that skeptic that kind of
likes to talk a lot of game

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:33.470
in the back of your mind.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.150
So don't shy away from the
questions that might come up

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.130
today, because
everything I'm here

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.432
to share with you
was actually born out

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:52.100
of my own skepticism, my
own questions and doubts

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.670
about what is being taught
in regards to leadership.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.858
There's all of these buzzwords
around leadership, right?

00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:03.842
Be authentic.

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:06.818
Just own your power.

00:02:06.818 --> 00:02:08.306
Be vulnerable.

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:11.280
Lean in, right?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.810
Just own your shadows.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.160
And here's the thing-- I
agree with all if it, OK?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.380
I think it's great.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.252
Authenticity rocks.

00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:28.260
But the way I see it being
talked about can a lot of times

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.810
lead to misunderstanding,
pressure

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.520
to be a certain way--
which when you're thinking

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.520
about being authentic
just seems ridiculous--

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.180
and it can lead to pain.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.110
So here's an example of a
scenario, a conversation,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.900
that I have seen play
out multiple times.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.860
So someone says, hey, I'm really
ready to step into my power

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.450
and own my greatness
and be a leader.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.660
Where do I start?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.420
So all you have to
do is be authentic.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.030
Really, just be yourself.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.310
Um, OK.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.950
I got that.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.010
Really appreciating that.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.760
Thank you so much.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.980
But a quick follow-up
question-- what do you mean?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.900
So like you just
need to be yourself.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.150
Own your vulnerabilities.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.720
Put your shadows into the world.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.470
Really show people that you have
overcome all of your battles,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.020
and you are stronger.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.850
Um, again.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.660
Really appreciating that advice.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.120
One last follow-up question,
though-- if, let's say,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.380
I'm not 100% confident
with what I have to say,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.120
or I'm actually not even sure
I'm worthy of being a leader.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.660
And then I don't even
know what to say.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.350
What then?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.400
So it sounds like you
just need to believe

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.855
in yourself a little more.

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:06.580
Like have you tried
positive affirmations?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.620
Because I feel
like once I really

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.410
started to believe in myself,
it was all good from there.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.620
Thank you.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.510
Again so much for
that amazing advice.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.240
And then you're left
with OK, I get it.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.500
I get it.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.440
The key to my
success lies within.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.643
I get it.

00:04:32.643 --> 00:04:36.660
But there's all this talk
about what you have to do.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.850
Be authentic.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.850
Be vulnerable.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.160
But there's not a lot of talk
about how you are supposed

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.974
to get there and
what it is really

00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:52.050
supposed to look like for you.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.795
So much pressure on that
vulnerability piece, right?

00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:00.880
And I see this trip
people up a lot.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.650
They will say things
like, Jenn, OK.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.600
So I have a story,
but I'm not really

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.553
sure I'm ready to share
it with the world.

00:05:07.553 --> 00:05:11.500
And is that honestly the
only way I make a difference?

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.466
I have been expose my deepest,
darkest secrets to the world

00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:17.460
to make a difference?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.820
And then there's people who
say Jenn, I don't have a thing.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.810
I have lived a kind
of blessed life.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.700
I don't have this big terrible
thing that happened to me.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.680
So does that mean
that I'm not as

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.210
effective as a leader
as someone who has

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.520
been through hell to get here?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.170
And then there's this
really weird message

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.580
about trying to be grateful for
the things that have happened,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.080
right?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.970
Trying to love the difficult
challenges in your life.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.890
Now, it may sound like I'm
mocking some of that advice,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.600
because I am, kind of.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.210
But again, all that has a place.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.590
You guys all have a
positive affirmation laying

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.190
in front of you right now.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.308
You are limitless.

00:06:05.308 --> 00:06:08.700
I believe in the power
of a lot of this,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.300
but only when it's
used correctly,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.220
not from this place of
pressuring yourself to stretch

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.430
outside of your comfort zone
farther than you're ready for,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.510
or risk the safety of yourself
in honor of leadership.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.625
So what if it's not about
the thing, the story?

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:37.920
What if it's not about
what you're putting out

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.800
into the world, and it's more
about how you are showing up

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.600
in the world, being, not doing?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.640
So to help me kind of explain
this journey of coming

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.500
to conscious leadership
and how you can get there,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.500
I brought some friends.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.850
I brought some
friends along with me.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.900
And these friends
include a unicorn--

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.240
if you didn't see it coming,
this unicorn represents

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.260
you and me, but you as well.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.850
So we have a unicorn.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.710
We also have troll
doll-- a little throwback

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.810
to some of you, I know.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.628
This guy represents your fear,
your self-sabotage, your ego,

00:07:28.628 --> 00:07:32.010
all of the noise that
gets in the way right

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.925
before you go and try
and do something great.

00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:36.870
That's this guy, OK?

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.160
And our stomping
grounds for this journey

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.810
are built out of rose quartz.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:50.080
So this first rose
quartz is intuition.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.880
The second rose quartz-- I feel
like Vanna White at the moment.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.070
Excuse me, let me step
to the other side--

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.580
the second rose
quartz is safety,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.785
the third, authenticity,
and the fourth, impact.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.720
Now, if it's not
about the thing,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.240
if it's not about your
story, if it's not

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.767
about clinging to a specific
identity of something that

00:08:18.767 --> 00:08:20.350
happened or something
you experienced,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.910
or something you
feel that you are,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:28.090
if it's not about that, then
what are we looking for?

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.548
And what we're here to
look for and explore today

00:08:31.548 --> 00:08:36.610
is the lesson, the lesson
you learned because

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.076
of the thing that happened.

00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:39.450
And if you're
someone in here who

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.449
has lived a really blessed
life and you're like,

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:43.179
I feel like I
don't have a thing!

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:43.720
Trust me.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.390
You've picked up some
lessons along the way living

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.890
in this world.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.580
The lessons that
turn into patterns

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:59.400
that turn into beliefs that
turn into a false truth

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:09.360
that you pick up and embody
and carry with you every day.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.855
Your story is not with us today.

00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:14.890
It's in the past.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.750
But your patterns, your
beliefs, the things you feel

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.930
are true about yourself,
those are with us right now.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.815
That's where I want to be.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.546
Big believer of the
power of present moment,

00:09:28.546 --> 00:09:30.570
so that's where
we're gonna stay.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.330
The things that are
with you right now

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.325
are the most powerful tools
to learning about yourself.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.540
So you have to understand--
we're coming in mid-scene here.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.307
We're like turning
on the TV mid-scene,

00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:49.390
back in the day when you
actually turned on the TV

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.190
and didn't just pick
what you wanted to watch.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.880
And the unicorn just had
a thing happen, right?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.500
Something just happened.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.580
And she's having a
conversation with her fear,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.555
and it sounds something
like this-- Oh my God!

00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:06.505
Oh my God!

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:08.430
Something just
happened, and I need

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.450
to make sure that that
thing never happens again.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.360
Oh my God.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.190
And fear is sitting
there saying, I know!

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.500
I told you not to do that!

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.380
I told you not to
be so noticeable.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.260
I told you to stay
under the radar.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.920
What we learned today?

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.720
What have we learned today?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.880
And the unicorn
says, well, I learned

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.681
it's not safe to be seen,
and I'm not lovable.

00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:40.160
Now, these are the
unicorn's false truths

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.330
that she picked up.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.650
You may have your own.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.015
You may be starting to kind
of realize what yours are.

00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:49.860
Or maybe not-- that's OK.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.410
But throughout this
journey, just see

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.620
if you can tune into
what are my truths?

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.700
That's a question that I would
love for you to dance with.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.830
So as the unicorn
realizes it is not

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:13.510
safe to be seen as a
unicorn, but I still

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.630
have things I want to say.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.600
I still have things
I want to do.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.855
Just because it's not
safe to be seen doesn't me

00:11:19.855 --> 00:11:22.350
I have to quit altogether.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.090
So she tells fear first of all,
you stay in the dark, right?

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.590
This is what everyone
tells us about fear.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.080
Put it in the dark.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.400
Don't worry about it.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.340
Don't look at it.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.184
Be fearless, right?

00:11:35.184 --> 00:11:36.850
So let's see how this
works out for her.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.130
We're going to put him back
in the dark, not heard from,

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.990
because she said, I'm
going to be fearless.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.090
I'm going to go out in the
world as a white horse.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:56.430
Now, white horses are still
incredibly powerful creatures.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.780
They can get a lot
done in the world.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.770
So she didn't lose
all her steam, right?

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.360
She just realized, OK.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.790
This is what it is.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.170
This is the card
I've been dealt.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:17.180
So she moves into her first
rose quartz-- intuition.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:27.250
And she gets quiet, and she
hears it's not safe to be seen.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.460
You are not lovable.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.630
Now, you have to
understand that from here

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:37.310
on out in her journey,
her entire being,

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.950
her entire intention, is
always about keeping her

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.640
and her truth safe.

00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:50.460
No one is going
to make her budge.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.850
No one is going to
convince her otherwise,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.670
because she has learned,
she has experienced

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.160
that this is her truth.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.950
But she still has things to say.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.410
So she presses on, leaving
her intuition behind,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.470
because as far as
she's concerned,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.230
the lesson has been learned.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.380
It's not going to change.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.980
So she'll just keep it as is
and know that that's the truth.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.180
Now, in the land
of safety, this is

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.200
where you start to gain
the tools that help

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.150
support your truth.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.530
So in this land,
this is where you

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.870
might start looking for other
white horses, other people who

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:43.180
are playing under the radar,
not rocking the boat too much.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.630
You start to become
very external

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.840
with looking at what
other people are doing,

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.010
being incredibly aware
of the competition.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:58.060
Because listen-- if the
internal conversation is

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.630
you're not lovable,
the external goal

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.620
is I have to at
least be likable.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.830
I have to at least be likable.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.020
Look at me.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:17.072
So there's a lot of pressure
to get people on board

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:20.860
with who you are to
validate your truths,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.883
to validate this new
life as a white horse,

00:14:24.883 --> 00:14:26.815
because you've
got things to say,

00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:30.170
and nothing's going to stop you.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:35.050
Now, in my world,
in this space, I

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.900
was solid with my
white horseness.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.900
No one by this point could
tell me I was a unicorn.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.820
And I just moved to New
York, fresh out of college,

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.660
here to be a dancer.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.110
Now, you can imagine that
the cocktail of not being

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.220
lovable and it's
not safe to be seen

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.290
is a killer cocktail to be
bringing into the entertainment

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.400
industry, right?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.520
So I would go to
auditions and hate it.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.861
I mean, hate it.

00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:08.548
I would have to take
the rest of the day

00:15:08.548 --> 00:15:11.670
off just to bounce back
from the damn experience.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:17.170
And then I would get
called back and not go.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.502
I would not go to dance class
for like months at a time

00:15:22.502 --> 00:15:26.150
but still tell people
I was a dancer.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:31.420
And I didn't realize it at the
time, but all of those patterns

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:37.970
were me supporting my
truths, keeping myself safe

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.451
because I had learned
it's not safe to be seen.

00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:42.397
I'm not lovable.

00:15:42.397 --> 00:15:45.200
So I'm going to go
almost but not quite.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.062
I'm going to go as far
as it is that I'm safe,

00:15:48.062 --> 00:15:51.045
and then I'm going to pull back,
because it's called survival.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.880
Moving a little bit farther,
I accepted that, OK.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.570
The dance is not going
to be where I'm at,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.130
because I don't show up for it.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.360
So I started singing.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.520
I co-wrote an
off-off-Broadway show.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.800
I co-wrote an album.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.700
They did great.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.350
The performances were awesome.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.840
The songs were amazing.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.700
But I did not do one
performance sober.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.450
I was at least three
drinks lubricated

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.640
by the time I stepped on stage.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.450
Not because I so badly wanted to
embody the rock star lifestyle

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.166
and be drunk on stage.

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:36.640
I really didn't even
realize what I was doing.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.860
And again, looking back, I
was fighting for my truth,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.150
saying I am a white horse.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.820
And it might not
be safe to be seen,

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.020
but I'm going to
do as much as I can

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.970
in the limits that
are in my life.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.280
So I danced with that
for a while, with almost,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.060
but not quite.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.755
And then as I moved into being
authentic-- now you guys.

00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:10.076
You have to realize--
I was being as

00:17:10.076 --> 00:17:13.810
authentic as I knew I could be.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.599
By this point, the
fact that I was unicorn

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:21.280
was like a deep
buried memory at best,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.960
if I even had the memory of it.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.460
Now by this point, I had
gotten the opportunity

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.670
to run a talent
management company.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.660
Now, this was like,
oh, I found it!

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.540
I found my sweet spot!

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.728
I can help people get
into the spotlight,

00:17:37.728 --> 00:17:43.190
but I can be an arm's length
distance from it and feel safe.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.680
And I was good at this job.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.630
There was negotiating.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.950
There was power.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.820
I was a decision maker.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.930
I was working with really
high-powered producers.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.100
I was moving and grooving.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.260
Things were good.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.910
Did I mention I was good at it?

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:07.640
So I stayed, because why not?

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.740
I finally found a
nice balance where

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.310
I could work with
artists, I could

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:20.140
be involved in that world, I
could also stay in the shadows,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:26.420
make an impact, be
authentic, and stay safe,

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.670
because I was fighting
for this truth.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.450
You have to understand
that everybody is doing

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.370
the best they can at all times.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.671
It may not seem that way.

00:18:40.671 --> 00:18:46.740
But everybody is fighting
for their truths.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.600
So as I moved into impact,
the company was doing great.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.420
Actors were booking
really amazing things.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.050
I was getting compliments
from producers

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.270
who were watching me how
I ran my company, saying

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.090
you're doing a great job, Jenn.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.940
Keep going.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:11.230
And then just as I felt like
I was hitting my stride,

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.390
I was winning all
the races, right--

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.930
I was the best white
horse-- just when

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:25.800
I got comfortable with that,
the whispers started coming in.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.568
And they whisper asked me, Jenn.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:36.240
If it's safe for all of
these actors to be seen,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.015
might it be safe for you too?

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.950
Nah.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.810
Psh.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.950
Ignore that, right?

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.660
Because why would
I risk everything

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.960
I'd built-- all of my
success, all of the people

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.207
who were counting on me--
to continue on this path?

00:20:01.207 --> 00:20:05.780
Why would I risk that
to follow a whisper?

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.890
No.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.500
Not going to happen.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:16.290
And that is why I so fiercely
believe that you cannot just

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.960
convince yourself
into a new reality.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.220
You cannot just start with the
positive affirmations and think

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.840
that it's actually going to
change what you believe to be

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.740
true.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:37.270
You cannot go to a single mom
of two kids who's up at one AM

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.590
at her kitchen table, crying,
because of an eviction notice.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.070
You can't go to
her and say, just

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.400
believe the universe
is abundant.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.144
What?

00:20:49.144 --> 00:20:50.518
What?

00:20:50.518 --> 00:20:54.970
You think she doesn't
want to believe that?

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.855
You think she
doesn't want so badly

00:20:57.855 --> 00:21:03.540
to experience this abundance
that everyone is talking about?

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:11.086
She wants to, but she's fighting
for a truth, a truth that

00:21:11.086 --> 00:21:17.545
probably sounds something like
every nickel you earn, you've

00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:23.906
gotta bleed for it, and you're
not even worthy of much.

00:21:23.906 --> 00:21:28.650
If that is your embodied
truth and someone says to you,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.190
the universe is abundant, they
might well be looking at you

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.315
and saying, you're a unicorn.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.060
It doesn't resonate
because everything

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:48.920
she has experienced in her life
thus far has proven otherwise.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:55.568
So if it's not about convincing
yourself, what is it?

00:21:55.568 --> 00:22:01.680
What is it that gets you to
switch and say, oh my gosh,

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.920
That might be possible for me?

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:10.356
So in my world, the whole maybe
it's safe in the spotlight--

00:22:10.356 --> 00:22:12.770
that whisper was
not working on me.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.660
The universe was like,
OK, she's stubborn.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.220
She's not going to
react to this one.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.700
We've got to go at her
from another angle.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.340
The universe is persistent.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.830
So it went after
my other belief,

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.050
the you are not lovable.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.755
And at the time, I
was dating someone

00:22:29.755 --> 00:22:34.050
who reveal themselves
to be a narcissist.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.420
And it got to a
point where I had

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.780
to stop painting
the red flags white.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:45.230
I had to look at what was
really happening here--

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.650
the lying, the cheating,
the manipulation,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.150
the emotional abuse-- and I
had to look at it and say,

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.320
is this really all I'm worth?

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:04.730
And the whisper came in and
asked, what if you are lovable?

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:15.990
The questions-- the questions
that get you to wonder what if?

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:24.170
Not the demand to believe that
it is true, the invitation

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:29.512
to ask what if?

00:23:29.512 --> 00:23:34.380
That is the place where
you can begin to have

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.850
somebody release their truth.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:44.900
And that is a really
brave thing to do.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.810
Because you don't know
what's waiting for you

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.030
on the other side.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.400
In hindsight, you look
back and you're like, oh,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.810
that's why I had to let go,
because that was coming in.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.588
And it's all real beautiful
from the back end,

00:23:56.588 --> 00:23:59.510
but when you're
living it and someone

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:04.200
asks you to let go of the
truth that you have been

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.150
living for possibly
multiple decades,

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.718
it's going to take a lot.

00:24:12.718 --> 00:24:16.760
Or it's going to take
one moment, where

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.400
all of a sudden you
realize, wait a minute.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.500
Wait a minute.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.936
The thing I thought was
true might not be true.

00:24:25.936 --> 00:24:28.720
And with that in my
world, when I realized oh,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.140
maybe I am lovable, then the
maybe it's safe to be seen

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.380
came with it.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.710
So I headed back
to the beginning

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.310
of where I came from, because
I had somebody to talk to.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.070
I knew that was going to happen.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.360
All right.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.520
So she went back
and talked to fear,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.884
because she was like, hey.

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:54.280
Remember how we said it
wasn't safe for me to be seen?

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.100
Well, I'm starting to
doubt that and you had

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.790
all this crazy stuff to say.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.690
And fear is like, I'm
so glad you came back.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.810
I've been trying to
get your attention.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.760
You were out there
trying to be fearless.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.220
I'm back here trying
to get your attention

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.230
because I'm not your enemy.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:22.640
And he said, by the way-- do
you know that you're a unicorn?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.220
And she's like, what?

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.630
This whole time
I'm out there-- you

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.800
saw me-- I'm out there trying.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.622
I'm a unicorn?

00:25:31.622 --> 00:25:33.212
Your fear is like, yes.

00:25:33.212 --> 00:25:35.950
This is what I've been
trying to tell you.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.860
Can I come with
you now this time?

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.100
Can we do it again?

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.730
And she's like, yeah.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.720
Hello?

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.700
I'm a unicorn now?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.002
I did all that as white horse?

00:25:46.002 --> 00:25:48.240
Imagine what I can
do as a unicorn.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.620
Now, the fear says,
I'm coming with you.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.970
Let me get my outfit.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.290
Now, yes, I'm going
to put his outfit on.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.950
I promise you it's
worth the wait.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.730
It's totally worth the payoff.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.510
Because look, you guys.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.310
If you were to hire somebody,
a private investigator,

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:11.442
to tell you exactly what's going
on with you, he's your guy.

00:26:11.442 --> 00:26:14.650
Really good news for
everyone-- we all have one,

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.690
and he works pro bono.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:21.145
So this is now a team.

00:26:21.145 --> 00:26:24.890
We're starting to
build our squad goals.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:30.950
So off she goes as a unicorn,
back at her intuition.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.894
Same thing-- she gets quiet.

00:26:34.894 --> 00:26:42.470
The truth is it is safe to
be seen, and you are lovable.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.185
So just like before,
everything from here

00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:51.720
on out is about protecting
her and her truth,

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:57.340
biding to build that truth.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.170
Now, as she moves to safety,
she's learned listen.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.250
You've got to bring
your intuition with you,

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.540
because things change.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.629
Things can change along the way.

00:27:07.629 --> 00:27:09.087
This isn't the only
catalyst that's

00:27:09.087 --> 00:27:10.960
going to happen in her life.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.315
So she brings the
intuition, and, of course,

00:27:14.315 --> 00:27:16.690
you got your man who has your
back, ready to let you know

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.670
if anything weird is going on.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.490
Now, this safety,
you guys-- this

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.090
is a really important place.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:30.060
This is where the positive
affirmations can start to work,

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.320
because they are no longer
debating your truth.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:42.750
They are supporting what you now
are already open to believing.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.960
This is where maybe you
have to stop hanging out

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.105
with some of the white
horses that really used

00:27:48.105 --> 00:27:50.760
to fit kind of who you were.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.620
But now that you're
a unicorn, they're

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.140
kind of intimidated by the whole
thing, and it just gets weird.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:00.470
So you lose some
people in this space.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.210
It can be painful.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.670
This is also the
space where you do

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:11.370
want to explore those stories
and those things that happened,

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.315
those catalysts in your life.

00:28:13.315 --> 00:28:17.512
This is where you get
to own your power,

00:28:17.512 --> 00:28:22.950
and you decide what gets
shared with the world, what

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.590
gets put out there.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:30.810
Because baring your soul does
not equal leadership and power.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.960
Owning your stuff
so you can become

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:42.430
a mirror of what is possible,
that is what we're working on.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.150
So I can't tell you what
authentic leadership

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.575
looks like for you.

00:28:47.575 --> 00:28:50.464
If that means baring your
soul and telling the world

00:28:50.464 --> 00:28:54.610
your story, go for it, right?

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.656
It's all you.

00:28:56.656 --> 00:29:00.650
If Kim Kardashian needs to
strip down every other week

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.010
and get on social media to
feel empowered, hey girl.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.350
Do you.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.770
But there is enough
messaging out there

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:13.616
that is telling people you
have to overcome and prove

00:29:13.616 --> 00:29:17.160
that you're stronger than and
can take on all the judgment

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.390
because you're fearless.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.800
There's enough of that.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.236
I'm here to give voice to the
person who says, you know what?

00:29:25.236 --> 00:29:31.690
There's more to me than one
event that happened in my life.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.580
And this is where
you get to start

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.900
exploring all of who you are.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.680
And then when you move into
authenticity, remember,

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.230
we're bringing
all of your tools.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.170
You're not leaving
these safety tools

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.024
that you just built
behind, because you

00:29:50.024 --> 00:29:55.060
know you're going to keep
building them as you go, right?

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.460
Asking for help.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.570
Working with a coach.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.190
Working with a therapist.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.970
Really allowing yourself to be
supported, not because you're

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:09.640
weak, but because you understand
that when I get this support,

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:15.090
it allows me to be
more of who I am.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:19.944
So in this game,
by this space, I

00:30:19.944 --> 00:30:22.120
started realizing
that number one,

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.450
I want to infuse comedy
into everything that I do,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:26.740
so I'm going to do it.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.040
It's the kind of
authenticity that when

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.460
you book one of the coolest
speaking gigs of your career,

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.740
and they're like, hey, Jenn.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.948
Are you going to have slides?

00:30:37.948 --> 00:30:38.864
And you're like, no.

00:30:38.864 --> 00:30:41.155
But I'm going to bring a
stuffed unicorn, a troll doll,

00:30:41.155 --> 00:30:43.330
and some rose quartz.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.360
Cool?

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.180
Awesome.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.876
That's the kind of
stuff that happens.

00:30:48.876 --> 00:30:50.848
You're not looking
around wondering

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:53.806
what other people are
doing, because it's

00:30:53.806 --> 00:30:57.997
irrelevant to what you
are working on here

00:30:57.997 --> 00:31:01.820
and what you have to offer.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.850
So this final piece, when
she moves into impact

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:12.560
and she has her intuition, her
safety, her real authenticity--

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.230
not the one that
someone told her

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:18.840
she's supposed to have in
order to be authentic--

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:28.020
this kind of self-awareness
is conscious leadership.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.530
Because you start
to become a living,

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:35.360
breathing catalyst for people.

00:31:38.115 --> 00:31:43.750
You're not running around
trying to save them,

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:49.870
because you know that the
catalyst is just the question.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:57.080
The catalyst is that moment
that makes someone go maybe what

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.350
I thought was true isn't true.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:08.970
As a leader, if you can get
people to feel safe enough

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:15.740
to release that truth that
they have been clinging to

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.240
for dear life out
of survival, if you

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:26.230
can get people to release
that, that is leadership.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.850
The rest of their
journey, they have

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.710
to choose to go back
to the beginning

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.080
and talk to their fear about
what the hell went down,

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.960
and am I unicorn, and when
did you choose to not tell me

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.500
I was unicorn?

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.204
That is conscious leadership.

00:32:44.204 --> 00:32:47.298
Really owning.

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:53.540
When people say own your
power, step into the light.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.280
Be seen.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.635
When I hear people say be
seen, the first thing I ask

00:33:00.635 --> 00:33:03.360
is are you seeing yourself?

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.980
So if you don't begin with
positive affirmations,

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.850
if it's not just a leap to
convince yourself of what

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.300
it is, then where do you being?

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.600
You begin by looking
for your truths.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.720
What am I fighting
for right now?

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.854
What do I believe so
much that it's true

00:33:28.854 --> 00:33:32.330
that I will deny everything
else-- someone could

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.970
come in here right now
and tell me I'm a unicorn,

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:43.030
and until I feel that I am,
until I feel that maybe I am,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:43.960
that's all useless.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:55.930
Getting quiet, having the
courage to wonder what if.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.410
There's so many people
that say to me, Jenn.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:06.150
I don't even think
it's responsible for me

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.139
to dream in that way.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:10.846
It's just not responsible.

00:34:10.846 --> 00:34:12.179
I've got a job to take care off.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:12.997
I've got family.

00:34:12.997 --> 00:34:13.580
I have things.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.582
I've got things.

00:34:14.582 --> 00:34:18.219
It's not responsible
to dream, right?

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:21.810
That's a truth people
hold on to a lot.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.000
I have to keep running my race.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.360
I'm a white horse who
wins all the races.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.136
Don't tell me to slow down.

00:34:29.136 --> 00:34:29.719
I'm surviving.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:39.480
And as a conscious leader,
you are the invitation

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:45.149
that it is safe to start that
exploration for yourself.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.480
A good leader does not
judge their success

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:57.600
by how many people they've
been able to convince,

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.410
or how many people are
trying to now be like them.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:08.660
A conscious leader looks
around at their world and says,

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:16.387
I'm here to help all of
you be more of who you are.

00:35:16.387 --> 00:35:19.381
Even if right now
you're a white horse,

00:35:19.381 --> 00:35:22.410
be the best white
horse you can be.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:29.130
So when the question
comes, you hear it,

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:34.857
and you're not afraid of it,
and you're willing to follow it.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.025
So it's not about what you're
putting out into the world.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.580
It's about how you show up.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:59.700
I am Jenn Lederer,
and you are a unicorn.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.600
Thank you.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.150
