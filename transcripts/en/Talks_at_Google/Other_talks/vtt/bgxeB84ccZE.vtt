00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.030
REGINA: Thank you everyone for
joining us here in the room.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.320
And virtually on
the live stream.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.610
I'm super happy to welcome
Susan back to the Bay Area.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.940
I thank her for sharing
her time with us.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.390
She is professor of psychology
at Williams College, where

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.900
she's also the founder and
director of the Williams

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.790
Program in Teaching.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.570
She's also the author of
"The Stories Children Tell,"

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.409
"Context Is Everything,"
"Real Kids," "Red Flags or Red

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.980
Herrings," and what's
available here today,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.490
"The End of the Rainbow."

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.860
SUSAN ENGEL: One other
book. "The Hungry Mind."

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.276
REGINA: Oh, and
"The Hungry Mind."

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.850
See, there's so many books,
I can't keep track of them.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.260
So, some context.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.600
I met Susan at the Common Ground
series talk earlier this year.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.220
And I left that talk uber
hopeful, inspired, and eager

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.370
to put much of what was
learned into practice.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.450
And one of the great
things about working here

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.370
is when we meet people
outside of here,

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.300
then we have the opportunity to
make these talks happen here,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.720
and then share the talks
with our Google family,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.340
and then share it with
the world on YouTube.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.710
So I also wanted to
share just personally

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.930
that as you were
speaking, it reminded me

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.130
of the conversations
that I have with my kids

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.420
at the end of the day.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.340
And oftentimes when they're
very excited about something,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.620
you see this spark
in their eyes,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.200
like they're about to burst.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.120
And they can't wait to share
what's happened in the day.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.390
And I left your
talk, I felt like I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.070
had tools to make that
happen more and more.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.045
SUSAN ENGEL: Great.

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:40.780
REGINA: So welcome, Susan.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.266
And thank you for sharing
more with us today.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.890
So this is going to
be very much a Q&amp;A.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.440
And if folks have any questions,
we don't have a [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.270
but please share them here.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.865
Or Ping a friend that you know
that is attending the talk,

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.110
and we will ask.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.450
But I want to start off with
this picture that some of you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.950
can see, and some of you
may not be able to see.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.720
So I will describe it.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.570
But it is two little
girls really in a moment,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.510
they're sitting
outside and they are

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.260
looking at something intently.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.710
And we start our
literary journey

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.820
as children really
drawn to picture books.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.190
So I thought it would
be nice to start

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.430
our talk with this picture.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.820
Fittingly, you brought
this picture to share.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.380
Can you share more about
the story behind this?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.588
SUSAN ENGEL: I'll tell you
the story of this picture.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.680
So, the smaller blonde
girl holding the dandelion,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.310
that's me when I
was about three.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.120
And the story behind it is
that when I was very little,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.110
I lived in a very small
village called Sagaponack,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.370
on the eastern end
of Long Island.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.210
And my stepdad was
a potato farmer.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.790
And it was incredibly rural.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.340
And I had enormous freedom.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.220
Much more freedom
than children do now.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.275
I basically rode
my little tricycle

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:02.700
around the village
all day by myself.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.151
My mom might say,
watch for a car.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:05.900
That was about it.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.825
Then I went off and
I visited neighbors.

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:10.380
And I wandered around.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.116
And inevitably I'd end
up stopping with my trike

00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:16.990
by the edge of a potato
field, because that's

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.250
what surrounded us.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.690
And I'd get off the
trike, and I'd kneel down.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.590
I just loved the potato fields.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.980
I loved the smell of dirt.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.180
I liked the look of the plants.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.620
And I'd kneel down and
I began to investigate

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.910
what was around me.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.470
And usually I'd see something
called a potato bug.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.360
So they're a terrible
problem for potato farmers,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.320
but a delight for
little girls like me.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.990
And they look a little
bit like ladybugs.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.970
They have a hard
dome-shaped surface.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.467
And they creep along.

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:50.050
And I'd watch.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.810
I'd get closer and closer.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.290
And then typically what
would happen is at some point

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.460
that I could never explain,
two translucent wings

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.740
would come out of their dome.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.660
And they'd fly.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.460
They'd fly from one
to leaf to another.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.520
And just as inevitably as
they'd make that little flight,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.340
I'd reach out and
I'd pick one up.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.240
And I'd bring it close to me.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.120
I'd put it in my mouth.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.019
And I'd bite it.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.200
And the thing about
that is, I wasn't mean.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.100
I certainly wasn't hungry.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.220
I just wanted to know
what was going on inside.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.540
And the reason I tell that
story is because virtually

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.930
every child all over
the world starts life

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.110
with that kind of ravenous
appetite for knowledge,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.080
for finding things out.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.440
It's the engine that
drives learning.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.790
So when you wonder about how
children under the age of five

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.360
can learn as much
as they do, they

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.040
learn more in those
first five years

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.135
than we ever learn
again in our life.

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:54.050
They learn to talk, they learn
to navigate the social world,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.480
they learn an enormous
number of things.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.190
Why?

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.040
Because they're curious
about everything.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.560
They want to explain everything.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.210
They want to
understand everything.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.680
The question that
leads to is why

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.790
is this powerful, robust,
pervasive characteristic

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.930
of early childhood-- why does it
begin to wane as we get older?

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.920
Why does something that's
so sturdy and strong

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.450
you just almost can't tamp
it down in the two-year-old?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.556
So a few of you probably
have had two-year-old,

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:25.930
and some of you
are going to have

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.900
a two-year-old in the audience.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.010
And you will know that
you put a two-year-old

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.970
in the corner of a room,
and wait a few minutes,

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.970
and they'll make their
way around the whole room

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.085
investigating everything.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.390
They're like a
one-person wrecking crew.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.230
And that's because of this
enormous drive to find out.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.090
So the question that I have
spent the last 12 years trying

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.100
to answer is, why it is that
such a sturdy characteristic

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.270
begins to wane, and
in many children,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.750
virtually disappears by the
time they're in middle school.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.720
And that's what
led me to the book

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.230
that Regina mentioned, "They
Hungry Mind-- The Origins

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.530
of Curiosity in Childhood."

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.720
I wanted to understand what
curiosity was, how it develops,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.940
and why, as I said, something
so sturdy becomes so fragile.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.599
REGINA: So what inspired
this latest book?

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.140
Because as you mentioned, you've
written all of these others.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.141
And I'm thinking
there may be a story.

00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.057
SUSAN ENGEL: There is.

00:06:22.057 --> 00:06:24.420
There's a story for everything.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.620
About 12 years ago, I co-founded
an experimental school

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.540
for children.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.940
And that was about 18 years ago.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.350
But about 12 years ago, I
was sitting with the faculty.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.330
And we were talking about what
their goals were for the year.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.130
So I was leading them
and guiding them.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.755
And I said, what is
it you want to have

00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:42.940
happen during the next year?

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.200
What do you think
these kids should

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.000
be able to do at the end of the
year that's different than what

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.610
they can do now?

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.930
And the teachers in
this school kept saying,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.130
it's not how many
words they can spell.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.380
It's not many math facts
they can solve in 30 minutes.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.660
It's not how many
states in the country

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.700
they can locate on a
map on a piece of paper.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.140
And what they were referring
to were standardized tests,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.957
obviously.

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:07.040
It's none of those things.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.730
That doesn't capture
what we're trying

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.294
to educate our students for.

00:07:10.294 --> 00:07:11.210
And I kept saying, OK.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.960
You don't like those things.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.800
What is it you
want your children

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.890
to get out of this experience?

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.670
And they said-- each of
them had a different answer.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.270
But all of the answers ended
up coalescing around the idea

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.200
that they wanted children
to be hungry for knowledge.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.120
They wanted them to want to
find out about the world.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.130
They wanted them
to want to learn.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.750
And I left that
meeting thinking I

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.060
couldn't get it out of my
mind that what they wanted

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.640
was for children not
only to be curious,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.880
to become more curious as a
function of their experience

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.860
in school.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.580
And I thought, you know,
I went to a conference

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.180
actually then on
child development,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.260
which I do all the time.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.660
And I though, we
are a society that

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.780
measures what we value and
values what we measure.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.750
And it's all very well
for teachers or parents

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.277
to embrace curiosity or pay
lip service to curiosity.

00:08:03.277 --> 00:08:05.610
But if they're measuring
something altogether different,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.940
like math facts or
spelling, that's

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.660
what they're going to
emphasize in the classroom.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.240
And my original
idea was, I know.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.700
I'll come up with a
measure of curiosity.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.860
And all will be solved.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.420
And schools will be wonderful.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.480
Children will go on eating bugs
for the rest of their life.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.010
Well, that was 12 years ago.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.100
And easier said than done.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.910
I realized I had to learn a lot
about how curiosity develops,

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.290
what it looks like in the
classroom, how it manifests

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.970
itself.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.340
And that's what really led
me to 12 years of research

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.190
into that book.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.659
REGINA: So the
title of your book--

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:46.090
why do you believe
it's important to teach

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.360
our kids that the
pursuit of happiness

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.174
is greater than the
pursuit of money?

00:08:51.174 --> 00:08:51.840
SUSAN ENGEL: OK.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.480
Good question.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.563
So this is the other book.

00:08:53.563 --> 00:08:54.830
I wrote two books last year.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.030
I don't recommend that.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.450
I was very tired at
the end of the year.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.270
But the book Regina's
talking about,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.780
"The End of the Rainbow,"
came from the fact

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.835
that all during that time that
I was looking at curiosity

00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:11.950
and trying to understand it
and doing experiments about it,

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.190
I was thinking about this
question of how you measure it.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.370
What would be a
good measure of it.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.340
And somewhere along the
way, I thought you know,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.110
I'm like those teachers.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.660
I'm not sure standardized
tests capture

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.240
what we think is important.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.630
And I actually then did
a very careful study

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.480
of all the existing
research, looking

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.440
at what standardized tests
predict about a child later on.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.330
And it turns out they
predict almost nothing.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.600
So they're a good
sorting system,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.640
or good in the
sense that they are

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.260
useful to some people
in some settings.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.660
They don't really
tell you anything

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.820
about what you might wish
your child or your student

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.490
or other people's children to
get out of school experience.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.650
And I began, when I looked
into all those studies, what

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.980
occurred to me is that our
ideas about measurement,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.620
about educational measurement,
are totally linked to our ideas

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.700
about success, which we've
come to define as financial.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.990
So kids go to school.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.510
They're going to
make more money.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.610
And the terrible
effect of that is

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.460
that we've come to
think of schools

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.400
as a training ground for work.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.090
And that's not what
schools should be.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.650
So you started with the
story about your daughters

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.600
and how their eyes
light up when they're

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.210
excited about something.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.290
Very few people
would say that what

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.750
they hope for most for their
child is that they're rich.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.970
And if they do think
that, they should

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.110
read the research which shows
that actually having more money

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.460
doesn't lead to happiness.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.490
You need enough money.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.450
And going to school-- the
fact of going to school--

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.550
ensures that people are more
likely to have enough money,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.350
to have a house, to have food.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.220
So I'm not disparaging
the importance of that.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.440
But that has nothing to do
with what goes on in school.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.400
That has to do with
going to school.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.270
When I began to think
about that I thought,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.269
this is not what people
want for their children.

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:09.060
And it's not good for children
to have the school experience

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.810
shaped by a quest for money,
and more and more money,

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.110
or to have school
be shaped by a quest

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.260
to train people to
be good workers.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.370
What people really want for
their children is to be happy.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.910
And as I began to think about
that, I began to think, OK.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.000
What would that look like?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.010
What would a school look
like that was educating

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.670
for happiness, not money?

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.500
And I came up with
an answer of sorts.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.990
And that's what
the book is about.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.823
What a school would
look like, what children

00:11:35.823 --> 00:11:39.270
would be doing if we thought
of something other than money

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.170
as the goal of education.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.270
REGINA: So if we're
thinking about something

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.820
other than money, and if
we're putting curiosity first,

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.370
how could schools
encourage curiosity more

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.850
in the classroom?

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.920
SUSAN ENGEL: OK.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.010
Can I give a two-part
answer to that?

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.510
REGINA: Yes.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.420
SUSAN ENGEL: OK.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.220
So in the book, "The
End of the Rainbow,"

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.340
one of the things I
talk about is curiosity,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.940
because in fact, inquiry is
at the heart of a full life.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.860
Wanting to know things and
knowing how to find things out

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.850
is essential.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.230
It's not just essential
to be good at your job,

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.690
it's essential to having
a meaningful life.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.384
And when people talk
about lifelong learning,

00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:23.800
that's what they're
talking about.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.640
So curiosity is
one of the things

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.990
I talk about in "The
End of the Rainbow."

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.190
So I'll answer
that part quickly.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.140
What would a curious
classroom look like?

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.900
It would be a place
where children

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.450
have plenty of time and
encouragement to ask questions,

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.460
and then just as
importantly, to seek answers

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.740
to those questions.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.260
And for some children,
that has to do with talk.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.880
So one of the best ways
to express curiosity

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.630
is to ask questions.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.110
In fact, some of
my research, we've

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.270
looked at the questions
kids ask in school.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.094
And it turns out
that while children

00:12:57.094 --> 00:12:58.635
at home, when they're
two and three--

00:12:58.635 --> 00:13:01.990
get ready for
this-- ask anywhere

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.980
between 26 and 100
questions an hour

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.450
to their caregiver,
their mom, their dad.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.190
By the time they get
to school, they're

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.980
more likely to ask about
two questions per hour.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.660
When we looked in schools,
we saw an incredible absence

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.280
of question-asking on
the part of children.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.910
So for many kids, a simple
thing is to make lots of time

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.610
for conversation.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.080
Conversation is the single
most underrated tool

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.740
a classroom can have.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.056
And children who are
privileged to have

00:13:34.056 --> 00:13:38.800
come from educated, rich
family lives-- not money-rich,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.140
intellectually
rich family lives--

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.020
what makes the difference
for them is lots of talk.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.400
So schools, instead
of bypassing that,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.950
should replicate it for kids
who aren't getting a lot of talk

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.900
at home.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.594
But some kids aren't
question askers.

00:13:52.594 --> 00:13:54.260
And so classrooms
need to have all kinds

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.300
of other opportunities
for inquiry.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.780
And I bet there
are a lot of people

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.805
who work here at Google
who were tinkerers

00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:02.000
when they were little.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.570
Liked to take things apart.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.880
Liked to peer at things.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.190
Liked to try things out.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.380
Test the waters.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.500
Try something a little
dangerous and see what happens.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.140
And classrooms
need to have that.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.770
They need time.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.880
Ask any researcher.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.510
Ask people who work here to
learn to find new things out,

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.310
to make discoveries, you
need to get to dead ends.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.720
You need to make mistakes.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.520
You need to try it again.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.860
I needed to eat so
many potato bugs

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.360
when I was little, to figure
out what was going on.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.700
One wasn't enough.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.520
So kids need time.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.110
They need a chance
to pursue things

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.470
they're really interested in.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.170
So we're not all interested
in the same thing.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.120
And each kid needs to be able
to inquire about something

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.770
they really care about.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.100
It's never going to be
that one topic or one set

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.530
of materials that's going
to work for all children.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.360
And finally, they need
curious adults around them.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.880
So in some of our
studies we've manipulated

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.460
how the adult is behaving.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.920
And it turns out
that not only do

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.130
adults need to encourage
curiosity and ask questions

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.460
and answer questions, they
need to be curious themselves.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.570
And our research shows
that when they are,

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.680
it has measurable impact on
children's own curiosity.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.900
And that has all kinds of
interesting implications

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.220
for teacher
preparation, because I

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.660
don't think teachers
get enough chance

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.229
to pursue their own curiosity.

00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:29.770
Then there's some
other things that I

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.760
talk about in "The
End of the Rainbow,"

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.480
other qualities that are key
to happiness besides curiosity.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.140
It's important, but
it's not the only thing.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.480
So I talk about collaboration.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.650
I talk about thoughtfulness.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.850
I talk about the
love of reading.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:50.990
So there's a whole list.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.950
And for each of those there
are-- and one other thing

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.430
I'll say that's key to that,
and related to curiosity,

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.730
engagement.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.320
So I was thinking about this
as I was on my way over here

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.550
today.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.880
We think of engagement
as a tool to get

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.960
kids to learn information or
learn very specific skills.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960
It is a tool.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.370
But it's not just a tool.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.610
It's the goal.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.790
Because a person who is capable
of being deeply engaged in

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.760
things that are
meaningful is going

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.296
to be a well-educated grownup.

00:16:23.296 --> 00:16:25.170
And they're gonna live
a much better life.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.880
And yes, they'll probably
be better at their job.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.470
But that's not the
main reason for that.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.710
So one of the things that's key,
and very related to curiosity,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.609
is giving children opportunities
to get deeply engaged

00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:39.150
in something.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.160
REGINA: Thinking about a
time-- and I'm using again

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.780
the data point of my
children, and as I

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.370
see them go through
the gradee-- they

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.490
have more time to
tinker and explore

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.930
in the preschool
years versus later.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.360
And then I'm just predicting
that later on, they're

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.440
going to have even less time.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.222
So how do we encourage this
with that limiting time

00:17:09.222 --> 00:17:11.180
that they're going to be
facing year over year?

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.930
SUSAN ENGEL: We
should change that.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.220
I mean, you can't do
the things that I'm

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.629
talking about within the
current school setup.

00:17:19.629 --> 00:17:21.420
The idea that you can
do everything-- and I

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.378
hear this all the time.

00:17:22.378 --> 00:17:24.450
I visit schools all
over the country.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.460
Yes, we're going to have curious
children and children who

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.250
are deeply engaged, and
kids who work together.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.310
That's a great example.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.060
Kids who really help each other
and take care of each other.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.860
And we're going to
get high test scores.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.780
And they're gonna
learn three languages.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.260
And they're gonna ace the
SATs, or whatever it is.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.670
And actually,
that's not possible.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.910
You pick something.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.410
And you do it well.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.030
Some of the things that are
currently valued in school,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:58.480
like the ability to argue well
or to do well at your work,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.190
I think would come with
the things I'm suggesting.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.600
I don't think you'd have to give
up all of those aspirations.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.920
But you'd have to give
up the idea that those

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.180
should shape the school day.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.030
So you cannot learn 27 different
things about paper and pencil

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.370
mathematics, which children
currently have to learn--

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:23.000
God knows why-- and also give
children a chance to go deeply

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.580
into something, ask
good questions, tinker.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.230
So it's a question of
shifting what's important.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.720
REGINA: What do you think
about how we-- actually, you've

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.300
been answering this already.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.060
But if you want to
add more to this,

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.789
like how we assess success
in our schools today.

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:47.580
SUSAN ENGEL: Right.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.330
So, you know,
success, as I said,

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.460
I would argue has
come increasingly

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.265
to be defined by money
and sort of relayed power.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.625
You know, I did a study
a few years ago with one

00:19:03.625 --> 00:19:04.750
of my students at Williams.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.790
We sent out a survey
to parents about what

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.000
they hoped for their children.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.940
And the parents of
the younger children

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.350
said things like, I
want my child be happy.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.450
I want them to find love.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.450
Turns out that's
really important.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.490
And I want my child
to have something

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.440
she or he loves to do.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.290
When we asked parents
of older children, kids

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.520
who were like getting near
the end of high school,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.960
fewer and fewer of
them answered that way.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.050
They said-- it's
captured perfectly

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.300
by one person who answered
the survey with two words.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.835
A lot of people gave
along paragraph about what

00:19:39.835 --> 00:19:40.960
they wanted for their kids.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.660
But this one parent
of a 15-year-old

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.090
had two-word answer.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.390
Med school.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.670
So as our children
get older, we get

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.390
more and more focused on certain
ideas about what success is.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.300
And yet the research, not
just from psychologists,

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.770
but from economists as
well, shows pretty clearly

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.550
that in adult life-- those two
things don't sync up perfectly.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.400
So having the best job,
or having the most money,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.710
is not what will make your
life most meaningful, most

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:13.430
fulfilling, most joyous, even.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:18.670
So I think our current
measures of success in school

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.570
are pretty
impoverished, actually.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.110
And they take on a
life of their own.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.250
They seem meaningful
because we treat them

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.525
as if they're meaningful.

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:33.882
But actually, the number a kid
gets on a paper and pencil test

00:20:33.882 --> 00:20:36.090
doesn't have much to do with
what they're getting out

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.410
of the school experience.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.840
And it has very little to
do with what their life will

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.490
be like when they're older.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.079
REGINA: Can you talk about
any of the gender differences

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.495
that you've seen
in your research?

00:20:47.495 --> 00:20:52.420
SUSAN ENGEL: You know, I haven't
seen many gender differences.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.790
Although it would be very
interesting to find out.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.690
There are gender differences
in terms of early language.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.770
So girls tend to--
tend-- to talk more.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.580
And maybe boys tend
in some research

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.300
to sort of be more interested
in tinkering or certain kinds

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.810
of object manipulation.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.000
They are not different in terms
of their level of curiosity.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.090
And that has to do simply with
giving kids an opportunity

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.200
to be curious about the thing
they want to be curious about.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.130
But within that, there
are individual variations.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.440
So that's one of the
interesting things.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.435
Even as adults, I mean, I
bet if you did a survey here

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:34.810
at Google, you'd
find some people

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.250
are more curious than others.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.840
There are important
individual differences

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.130
in levels of curiosity.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.940
I don't think they go by gender.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.640
But I don't really
understand completely

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.760
what they're related to.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.530
There's not a perfect
correlation with intelligence

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.710
either.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.710
Part of it has to do
what they experienced

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.570
when they were young.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:03.070
So in my fantasy
school, curiosity

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.250
would be the goal of
the educational process,

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.760
not a sort of starting point.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.630
But even so, at
the end of the day,

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:17.010
some people would be
more passionate seekers

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.250
of information than others.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.510
I mean that's a good thing that
we're not all the same, so.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:31.710
REGINA: So how do we balance
this curiosity with the things

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.120
that our kids need to know?

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.870
Like, there's always
going to be something

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.690
that oh, I want to spend
more time on subject X.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.050
Because that's what
I'm passionate about.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.590
SUSAN ENGEL: What do you
think kids need to know?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.110
REGINA: It's going to be
a different answer per job

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.700
here, and per interest.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.700
SUSAN ENGEL: I don't think
there are many things

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.330
that all kids need to know.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.750
They need to be able to read.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.100
I think they need to know
how to ask a question.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.760
And they need to
know the difference

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.650
between a good question
and a weak question.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.420
So one of the ideas that
I talk about in both books

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.475
is what it would take
to educate curiosity.

00:23:10.475 --> 00:23:14.470
The same way all these things--
collaboration, engagement--

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.940
they're not just things that
you make a beautiful classroom

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.148
and then those things happen.

00:23:18.148 --> 00:23:20.810
They require good
teachers guiding children

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.670
in skillful ways.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.350
So I mean, I'm a researcher.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.489
So I can spend
years-- I did spend

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.030
years trying to
think of the best way

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.610
to ask my questions
about curiosity.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.100
And that's true for any of you.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.630
You sometimes have to
spend time figuring out

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.110
what your question is.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.680
Kids aren't given much
practice at refining,

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.510
revising, re-asking
their question.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.030
Sometimes you ask the
question and a day, or a year,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.646
or five years later,
you think, oh, I

00:23:48.646 --> 00:23:50.080
have to shift that
question a little,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.288
and I'll get a better answer.

00:23:51.288 --> 00:23:52.890
So that's part of it.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.310
They need to know then
how to go about finding

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.930
the answers they need.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.270
Not all questions will lead
you towards the same path

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.740
to get answers.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.310
Some questions are more
data-bound than others,

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.710
for instance.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.640
And then finally,
kids need to learn

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.870
how to decide when their
question's been answered.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.070
And one of the worst
mistakes we make in school

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.620
is to tell them
all the time when

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.870
they've answered the question.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:18.703
How do we tell them?

00:24:18.703 --> 00:24:20.490
By giving them a score.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:25.320
Instead of asking them,
are you satisfied?

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.905
The beautiful thing
about curiosity

00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:29.280
is, the more you know about
something, if you're actually

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.410
interested in it, the
more you want to know.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.640
Because you become attuned
to ever deeper levels

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.460
of information and subtlety.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.380
So to answer your
question-- I didn't

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.720
mean to put you on
the spot-- but what

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.500
kids need to know,
in my view it's

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.810
a very different
cluster of things

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.730
than we tend to think it is.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.850
There are very few
bodies of knowledge

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:57.060
that all children must have
in order to be well-educated.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.880
I play this game
with my students

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.890
at Williams, who take a
course with me on education.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.990
At some point early
in the semester

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.490
I ask them to think
of somebody they

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.267
know who's really well-educated.

00:25:09.267 --> 00:25:10.100
It could be anybody.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.830
From their family, from their
town, from their summer job,

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:14.930
or at school.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.700
And they describe the person.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.080
And then I say, OK.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.990
What is it about that
person that makes

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.130
them seem well-educated to you?

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.030
And I get all these
wonderful answers.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.100
I get he's wise.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.680
She's eager for knowledge.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.820
She can relate to
many different people.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.620
She's able to collect
information and connect it

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.170
in interesting ways.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.090
Students say all
kinds of things.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.715
I've been doing this
game for about-- I

00:25:40.715 --> 00:25:42.880
don't know-- 18 years.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:51.340
I've never had a student say,
he really knows polynomials.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.100
Or she really can parse the
hell out of any sentence.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.270
It turns out those aren't the
measures of a good education.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.170
And yet, it's not that
knowledge is unimportant.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.480
It's that people get
knowledge if they

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.480
have these other skills.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.960
So you must know in
your job that the things

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.680
you need to know about are
related to the things you

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.530
must do or want to do.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:21.420
And the question is, are you
good at getting that knowledge?

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.910
So when you say, what is
it all kids need to know?

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.790
I'm not sure there are
any bodies of knowledge

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.290
that all kids must know.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.280
And by the way, in
our current system,

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.540
they don't all know it anyway.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:41.130
So even setting it up that
way doesn't actually work.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:46.450
REGINA: So on the current
setup, why do you think

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.110
we test for what we test for?

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.330
SUSAN ENGEL: Oh, boy oh boy.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.700
I wish I knew the
answer to that question.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.325
It's expedient.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.080
And that's, to me,
the worst mistake.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.680
So let me say that
when I started

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.010
talking about these
things in public settings,

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:07.020
everybody who agreed with me
about the problems of testing--

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.510
current system of
testing-- assumed that I

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.110
meant we shouldn't assess.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.540
And I don't mean that at all.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.150
We have to assess children.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.880
And schools have to
be held accountable,

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.505
because we have to know if we're
doing a good job or a bad job.

00:27:18.505 --> 00:27:19.580
I'm all for that.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.360
And here's the great news.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.530
We are good at measuring
a lot of these things.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.380
Psychologists have been
measuring these things forever.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.825
Probably you've
had speakers here

00:27:28.825 --> 00:27:31.640
who've talked about things
like unconscious bias,

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.210
unconscious stereotyping.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.162
Or the impulse to gamble.

00:27:35.162 --> 00:27:36.870
Or what makes us fall
in love with people

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.745
we fall in love with.

00:27:37.745 --> 00:27:40.320
Those are all based--
those findings--

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.250
on our ability to measure the
invisible or the ineffable.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:49.150
So there are ways to measure
what kids are learning,

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.650
or what's going on
in the classroom

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.130
so that we can hold
schools accountable.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.460
Why we use paper
and pencil tests?

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.910
One, they seem easy.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:06.580
And they create an illusion of
hard data, which is a fallacy.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.570
Anybody can make a
number out of anything.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.750
It doesn't mean the
number means anything,

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.640
or tells you anything
about a person.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.420
Honestly, somebody's going
to hate me for saying this,

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.880
but it's turned into
a huge business.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.720
And it's taken on, like I said
before, a life of its own.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.510
I mean, even in my hometown,
everybody says they hate tests,

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.429
but on the day that the
test scores come out,

00:28:30.429 --> 00:28:32.970
everybody looks to see whether
their kids are in the district

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.206
with the high test scores.

00:28:34.206 --> 00:28:35.580
And for that
minute, when they're

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.220
looking at the
newspaper, they've

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.580
forgotten that those
numbers don't necessarily

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.810
tell you anything about what
those students are getting out

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.140
of school.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.960
AUDIENCE: For parents,
if I look at a test,

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.580
and I can tell hopefully-- say,
a math test, I know 2 plus 2

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.660
is 4.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.820
But I hear, your son is not
curious enough or they're not

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.930
having enough fun
in class because

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:03.080
the subjective evaluation
of a professional-- I

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.570
can argue against that a lot
more and say, you're wrong.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.937
My son is curious enough.

00:29:08.937 --> 00:29:09.520
He's learning.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.720
He's connecting the dots.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.340
He's engaged.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.010
And let's talk to the
principal, or I want

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.890
to talk to the superintendent.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.940
I don't believe you.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.980
Whereas a 96 on the
test, or a 40 on the test

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.630
is evidence that I
can't argue with, right.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.410
So even if you
say we can measure

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.110
those things for a lay
person to have a confidence

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:38.750
level at that, it
might be easier for us

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.960
as a parent to understand
and for administration

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.940
to deal with.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.330
SUSAN ENGEL: So I
think, if I understand

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.540
what you're asking about,
it's what-- you might all

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.350
disagree with me and think that
the current tests work well,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.570
and the current school system
works well and I'm wrong.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.080
So then there's not much
discussion about this.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.910
But if you agree with
me, and the question

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.300
is, how do you help a
community of people-- teachers,

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.850
administrators, and parents--
to make this as firm

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.440
and convincing and reliable
as the number on the test.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.405
Is that your question?

00:30:13.405 --> 00:30:14.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:17.252 --> 00:30:18.960
SUSAN ENGEL: But I
think that's where I'm

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.280
suggesting something different.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.460
So in the book, in
the last chapter,

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.340
I talk about very
tangible quantitative ways

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.580
to measure these things.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.790
For instance, I'll give you
one very simple example.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.390
Conversation, I think--
and I've told you this,

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.060
and research supports
this-- is key

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.370
to intellectual development.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.330
And kids who get a
lot of conversation

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:44.150
tend to do better in all kinds
of ways, including learning

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.250
to read better, and all
kinds of other cognitive

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.940
tests than kids who are
deprived that kind of exchange.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.776
And schools would do well to
promote more conversation.

00:30:52.776 --> 00:30:54.650
Well, we could be
measuring the conversations

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.740
that go on in schools.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.330
We could have video cameras
taking random samples.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.180
That's a common
technique in research.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.000
You go in and tape
record at times

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.090
that no one's aware you're
going to tape record.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.230
But everybody knows that
will happen at some point.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.200
And you take those
snippets of conversation.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.420
And you simply count
how many conversations,

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:18.140
how long the conversations are,
how many turns individual kids

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.080
get to take.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.050
These are all
well-established measures

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.110
from developmental research.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.720
They've been around for years.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.009
And they end with a number.

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:28.800
It's just that it's a
number that tells you

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.620
something more important
and probably more

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.510
valuable than some other
things we're currently

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.530
assigning the number to.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.500
So I don't think it
would be adequate

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.590
for teachers, or
anybody, just to say,

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.310
in my gut this kid is
really thriving, or engaged,

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.690
or intellectual, or thoughtful.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.270
I think we do have to measure
those things in a way that

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.770
ultimately can be represented
in a graph or a number.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.010
Partly for the reason
that you're talking about.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.460
Also, people fool themselves.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.150
I had a teacher once say,
I don't need those tests.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.870
I know in my gut
when a kid can read.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.770
Well, I loved that
particular teacher.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.790
But I didn't trust her.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.110
We fool ourselves.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.330
So we do need
objective measures.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.160
We just need measures of the
things we actually value,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.380
rather than something
altogether different.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.398
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:32:20.398 --> 00:32:21.700
AUDIENCE: I agree with this.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.840
The test scores
on math and stuff.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.480
But it's easier, especially
for less educated parents,

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.600
to potentially have a trust
in a math test than video--

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.550
not understanding that we're
going to monitor and capture

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.300
those things.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.080
And do I have to
coach my kid to make

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.090
sure they're in front
of the video engaging

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.590
during those times, or something
like that versus, I know,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.510
I trust that the
scoring on the test.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.950
Even if I don't know
polynomials as a parent,

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.640
that the school graded those.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.750
But the other things
feel more subjective.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.430
And I can argue.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.940
And for the school it's
easier to point to, no.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.490
They failed the
test, rather than

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.400
the squishier things that are
really important versus just

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.439
math mechanics.

00:33:07.439 --> 00:33:08.230
SUSAN ENGEL: Right.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.852
I mean, the trouble
is, those tests

00:33:09.852 --> 00:33:11.060
have been around a long time.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.726
And everyone has
gotten used to the idea

00:33:12.726 --> 00:33:15.040
that they're trustworthy.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.850
And so that partly is
going to take time.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.257
Let's say in my dream
world, a bunch of schools

00:33:20.257 --> 00:33:21.840
said, let's get rid
of these measures.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.250
Let's use these measures.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.980
Let's educate for these goals.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.260
It would take some time.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.260
I'm guessing it wouldn't take
as much time as people think,

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.940
especially if your kids came
home interested and engaged

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.610
and happy, and you had
these measures that said--

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.860
and some of them by the way
aren't even as sort of fuzzy

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.240
sounding as that.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.050
There are very interesting
ways to measure kids' ability

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.560
to ask good questions,
or to follow

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.190
a task from beginning
to end, and be

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.670
thoughtful about something.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.850
Those would quickly take
on the kind of substance

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.940
that we now give over
to these other tests,

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.430
even though they don't merit.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.620
It would take some time.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.200
I had so many calls
from school principals

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.120
after a piece of that book
came out in the "Boston Globe."

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.070
I had so many teachers
and principals

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.260
calling me and
saying, what would it

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.909
take to actually
make this happen?

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.590
And the truth is
all it would take

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.419
is a group of people
deciding to do it.

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:21.510
I mean, nothing
magic about that.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.040
REGINA: Do you see
any groups doing this?

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:28.100
Like, do you see any
experimental schools,

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.790
or whatever.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.011
SUSAN ENGEL: Yeah.

00:34:30.011 --> 00:34:30.719
Yeah so they're--

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.639
REGINA: How do you
see them doing it?

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.340
SUSAN ENGEL: Well, they're doing
it in really interesting ways.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.389
And some of them-- the
saddest part for me,

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:41.770
to be totally candid is that
too many of the schools that

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.754
are brave enough to do this
kind of approach-- it's not just

00:34:44.754 --> 00:34:46.170
the measurement,
it's the approach

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.260
and the measurement--
are private schools.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.690
And the real key is to make
this accessible to all.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.969
So there are some really
interesting public schools

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:59.010
dotted all over the
country that are

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.552
moving towards this approach.

00:35:00.552 --> 00:35:03.010
But it's harder for some of
the reasons you just mentioned.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.910
It's harder for them
to make the leap.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.410
And that's what I would
like to see happening

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.530
in the next few years.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.930
And actually, there's no
reason for them-- well,

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.080
the reason is worry.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.630
But concretely speaking, there's
really nothing to stop them.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.090
For instance, you could say, OK.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.256
We know they have to take
the paper and pencil test,

00:35:26.256 --> 00:35:27.750
but we're not gonna
worry about it.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:32.320
Instead, we're going
to emphasize these ways

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.450
of learning in school.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.060
And we're going to measure
them in these three

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.290
ways for the next five years.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.990
And we'll see what happens.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.910
They have very little to
lose doing that, actually.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.350
But I guess it takes a certain
kind of bravery to start with.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.550
So I'm hoping for that.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.730
Fingers crossed.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:54.580
REGINA: On the bravery
part, I'm uh-- can you

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:59.280
share some insight into how your
approach has panned out for you

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.844
personally with your family?

00:36:00.844 --> 00:36:01.510
SUSAN ENGEL: Oh.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.280
So I'm going to
tell my son's story.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.360
This is funny.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.680
So I started this-- I'll
take you back to curiosity.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.900
I started this talking
to you about how

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.430
young children have
this voracious appetite

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.520
for all kinds of knowledge.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.650
But the truth is,
schools aside, it's

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.340
inevitable that as kids
get a little older,

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.980
their curiosity kind
of narrows down.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.970
And the reason is, when
you're very little--

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.450
so curiosity is
defined as the need

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.990
to resolve uncertainty or
explain the unexpected.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.320
And that's sort of the
psychological definition

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.180
of curiosity.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.180
So you can understand
why when you're

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.790
nine months old or two years
old, everything's unexpected.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:43.970
Everything seems uncertain.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.803
You want to know about
the juice and the bug

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:49.380
and the chair, and the door
opening, and the new face.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.880
So you're curious
about everything.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.710
As you get older, more
and more of everyday life

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.920
gets to be sort of
familiar to you.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.050
So you begin to
narrow your curiosity

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.660
to things that hold great
interest for you, which

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.750
is why even in the best of
environments, by the time

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.050
your kid is five, they'll
be curious about some things

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.220
and not about others.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.080
And the things
they're curious about,

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.800
they're very curious about.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.510
They can't get enough of it.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.680
So I have three sons.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.810
They're grown now.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.394
And we lived also in
a very rural area.

00:37:21.394 --> 00:37:23.310
Not the one I grew up
in, but a different one.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:27.330
And my kids spent a lot of
time outdoors and a lot of time

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.240
with animals and nature.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.260
So one time I took my
four-year-old son, Sam,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.660
to the Central Park
Zoo in New York City.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.760
And we went into this space,
this beautiful exhibit,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.580
the tropical exhibit.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.465
And there were lizards and
there were gorgeous birds,

00:37:43.465 --> 00:37:46.810
and it was steamy, and there
were all these cool-- probably

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:50.870
not as exotic to you--
but palm plants and stuff.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.670
And there were these tortoises
sort of lumbering along

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:54.430
in the exhibit.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.910
And most of the kids in that
room were amazed by everything.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.740
I could see them.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.270
Everything was a
surprise to them.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.510
But not my son, because he
had been to a lot of zoos.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:09.430
He'd spent a lot of time of
time with all kinds of animals.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.610
He'd read a lot of
books about animals.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.260
So almost everything
that they were doing,

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.456
he already was familiar with.

00:38:17.456 --> 00:38:20.820
But one tortoise had lumbered
over and made its way,

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.330
trudged over, and climbed up on
the back of another tortoise,

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.890
and was letting out
these loud, weird noises.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.780
Even my son had not see that.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.140
And suddenly he piped up with
his loud happy little voice.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.840
He said, I know what
they're doing, Mom!

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.790
I know what that is!

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.040
They're fucking, right, Mom?

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.320
Those tortoises are fucking!

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.940
So I tell that story as
a way of pointing out

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.440
that what was exciting
and interesting to my son

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.600
was different than what was
exciting and interesting to all

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.740
the other little kids.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.330
So there's a little-- there
are two final endpoints

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.650
to that story.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.420
My son is 22.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.230
And he's about to start
his PhD in biology.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.956
And so you know,
there's no direct link

00:39:06.956 --> 00:39:07.830
between those things.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:12.010
But it is true that his great
interest in the animal world,

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:15.770
in the natural world,
he already had it then.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.830
It was easy to detect.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.550
And it sustained
itself over time.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.880
He's more curious than ever.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.010
It's just that now his curiosity
is at an ever subtler, deeper

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:27.576
level.

00:39:27.576 --> 00:39:28.950
The only other
funny thing I have

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.735
to tell because it
just happened is

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:35.860
that he recently came-- he goes
to school in another country.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.940
And he recently came home
and brought his girlfriend

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.730
to visit in the Northeast.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.030
And they went to
Central Park Zoo.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.630
And he doesn't remember what
happened when he was four.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.530
That's nothing to him.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.410
And he came home from taking her
to the zoo, and he said, Mom.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.630
There's the coolest
place at the zoo.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.790
It's the tropical area.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.840
And there are these
cool tortoises.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.505
So obviously at some level
it had made a lasting impact

00:39:59.505 --> 00:40:01.459
on him.

00:40:01.459 --> 00:40:02.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.666
My name is Alex.

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.180
I have two questions.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.395
First one is current school is
the result of long evolution.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.560
In general, is it needed
to speak something there?

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.960
Because now it is very formal.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.630
It is set of obligations that
children should be fulfilled

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:29.800
without-- children who
don't have any curiosity

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:37.310
but-- like it covers curious
children and not curious,

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.570
but it works.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.705
But what do you think is needed
to fix it and to improve.

00:40:42.705 --> 00:40:43.950
It works well now.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:49.131
And should be kept as is.

00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:50.630
SUSAN ENGEL: I don't
agree with you.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.875
I don't think our
current system does work.

00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:53.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.320
Right.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.210
SUSAN ENGEL: I think
that, first of all,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:58.170
we have an incredibly
high illiteracy

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.050
rate in this country.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.610
So there are many
children who can't read,

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.680
and most important, don't read.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.300
So one of the
things I talk about

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.175
in "The End of the
Rainbow" is the difference

00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:12.190
between measuring what a
child can do and what they do.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.390
What we now call a disposition.

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.370
And that's much more valuable.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:22.030
So we have kids who-- some
can't demonstrate competence.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.490
But even many of those
who do don't actually

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.440
use those kinds of competence
in their everyday lives.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.510
And I just saw
something in the news

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:35.110
this morning about how
few Americans actually

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:39.500
read about the records of people
they're going to vote for.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.274
And since we have an election
coming up in a year and a half,

00:41:42.274 --> 00:41:43.690
it seems very
relevant, people are

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:48.130
making very uninformed
decisions about who to vote for.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.600
As one example, the
cheating in this country

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.170
is sky high at every level
in school and in business.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:59.100
People cheat one another like
crazy, and cheat on their work.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.490
And that has to do
with not having learned

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.840
how to take care of one
another or collaborate

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.350
when they're in school.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.660
So I would say that
our current system--

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.220
while there are a lot-- I
need to make this clear.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.180
There are many terrific
schools in this country,

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.840
and there are many terrific
individual teachers.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.430
The ideas that I'm
suggesting would

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.430
build on those good
practices that are happening.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.050
I just think that
they're happening

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:30.730
in spite of the current system,
instead of because of it.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.790
I don't think our current
system is working.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:39.350
And the fact that so many
people in their twenties

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.650
and thirties-- maybe not here at
Google, but across the country,

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.160
and even here in
your community--

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.610
are doing work that doesn't
feel meaningful to them,

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:50.540
and don't know how to find
other things in their life that

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:56.485
have meaning, pursuits, is to me
evidence that it's not working.

00:42:56.485 --> 00:42:58.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Google way,

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.070
the possible is it to develop
some application for instance,

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.430
for iPhone, that will measure
how many questions per hour

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:08.490
children ask in the school,
and give some [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:12.860
for parents like, your child
is very interested in math,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.450
but not in language and so on.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.970
How useful would it be?

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.945
SUSAN ENGEL: Well first
of all, I have to say I'm

00:43:20.945 --> 00:43:22.950
an inveterate Googler.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.310
And I think it's actually
really interesting.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.494
People always ask me about
the dangers of technology

00:43:28.494 --> 00:43:29.660
when they talk about school.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.510
Is that going to
stop their curiosity?

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.320
We're just beginning
to gather evidence

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.470
on the impact of
technology on the way

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:37.800
that children think and learn.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.052
But so far-- well,
it's complicated.

00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:42.010
You must all know that.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.590
It's complicated.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.230
Being tied to your
phone or your iPad

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.740
can prevent certain
kinds of experiences,

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.720
social and sensual.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.230
But it can allow for others.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.950
For instance, getting
answers to your questions

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:02.720
is one of the most wonderful
ways to nurture curiosity.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.569
I always liken it to being
hungry or wanting to have sex.

00:44:07.569 --> 00:44:09.985
Those things only feel good
if you're going to have a meal

00:44:09.985 --> 00:44:11.990
or you're about to
hook up with someone.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.490
And the same is
true with curiosity.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.440
It only feels good to
be curious if you're

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.010
gonna get some satisfaction,
some fulfillment,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.180
for your curiosity.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:25.090
And actually, technology is
a wonderful tool for that.

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:28.530
What you asked about is whether
you could turn an iPhone

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.150
into a measurer of that.

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:33.550
I think that would be
a great research tool.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:37.790
And actually, I write about
this in the book about--

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:39.480
and there's some
really cool research

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.770
on tracking people's
habits online

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:45.520
to see what they-- you probably
all know about this better

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.110
than I do.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.190
Do people sort of
look at many things?

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.070
Or do they delve deeper
and deeper into one thing?

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:52.320
There's a great term for that.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.206
Research rapture.

00:44:53.206 --> 00:44:54.580
You know, when
you start looking,

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.186
and then you gotta look at more.

00:44:56.186 --> 00:44:58.060
And you can track that
online when people are

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.990
doing their searching online.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.080
I think that's awesome.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.864
I worry about this
idea that it's

00:45:04.864 --> 00:45:06.780
going to be a new thing
that parents are going

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.730
to start measuring
like crazy and sort

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.130
of encouraging their children.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.000
But you didn't ask
enough questions today.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.140
Give me five more
before you go to sleep.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:16.610
That seems horrible.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.650
So that's not what
I have in mind.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.250
And I don't have the answer
to how we-- you know,

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.060
I wrote a book called "Red
Flags or Red Herrings"

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.110
about parenting a few years ago.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.280
And I found myself saying
to parents everywhere,

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.020
parenting is not a job that
you get A plus or D on.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.630
It's a relationship.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.470
And when I think
about parents who

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:45.170
are trying to make
these perfect children,

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:48.020
I link it all back to
this idea of money.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.690
It has to do with some
obsession with getting your kid

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:52.060
to be the best.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.680
Because if you weren't
trying to do that,

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.930
you would listen to
your child's questions

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.370
and answer them, and
ask your own questions.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:01.900
And you wouldn't be
worried about whether they

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.530
had asked their quota of
questions for the day.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.075
So that does worry me.

00:46:06.075 --> 00:46:09.490
But as a tool for research
or for teachers to use,

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.019
I think it could be awesome.

00:46:11.019 --> 00:46:13.060
AUDIENCE: And my second
question is more general.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.726
SUSAN ENGEL: That was
only one question?

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.000
AUDIENCE: One plus.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.190
Second question is about
overall or total education.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:25.320
When we have it now, but there
is no da Vinci and no Newtons.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.870
And da Vinci was in a
century where less than 1%

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:31.080
was educated.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.070
But now here, as in Google,
we have many scientists

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:35.330
who know how to [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.390
Overall education, it
is achievement of it

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.714
is like, on the background
here now in the world.

00:46:45.714 --> 00:46:46.380
SUSAN ENGEL: OK.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.870
I didn't really understand
the end part of your question.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:53.870
AUDIENCE: Like, with education,
like civilization-- achievement

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.650
of civilization.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.840
Now almost will
people are educated.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.960
But no Beethovens, no
Newtons, no Einsteins now.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.330
SUSAN ENGEL: Who knows?

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.870
There may be some
lurking amongst us.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:10.520
You know, there's
a great study that

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.630
was done 10 years ago by a guy
named Barron called the Teddy

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:16.320
Roosevelt Study, where he
took all these people that

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.950
accomplished great things.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:23.300
And he looked for what they had
in common in their childhood.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.330
And the only thing
that he could find

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:28.160
was all of them had spent
significant portions of time

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.412
out of school.

00:47:29.412 --> 00:47:31.495
Because they had been too
far from school, or they

00:47:31.495 --> 00:47:33.090
had been ill or whatever.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:34.940
And I'm a school lover.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.070
I love schools.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.630
I've spent my
whole life in them.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.720
So I value them deeply.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.320
But I think it's
possible that actually we

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.030
haven't made schools places
where those qualities that

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:53.020
led to Roosevelt or da Vinci
or Newton could emerge.

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.420
And that relates
to my basic idea

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.700
that if schools
were to encourage--

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.374
I mean it's a great example.

00:48:02.374 --> 00:48:04.290
Because most of the
people who've accomplished

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.610
great things had
really single-minded

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:13.110
focus on certain things, and
kind of lapsed at other things.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:19.090
And there's nothing terrible,
nor need everybody be da Vinci.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.600
But there would be
nothing terrible

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.630
in having a little more
of that in our schools.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:33.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.040
So I want go back to
the topic of this talk,

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.770
you know, money
versus happiness.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:44.402
And by the way, I joined Google
just a couple of months ago.

00:48:44.402 --> 00:48:46.360
So it's kind of really
whatever you pointed out

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.750
for children are actually
more applicable to me

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:49.958
right now than to children.

00:48:49.958 --> 00:48:50.624
SUSAN ENGEL: Ah.

00:48:50.624 --> 00:48:51.006
Good.

00:48:51.006 --> 00:48:51.390
I think.

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:52.090
AUDIENCE: You know,
about the curiosity

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.140
versus measurables
and all of that.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.650
But you know, when you compare
money against happiness,

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:03.830
it turns out happiness is
really difficult to pursue.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.480
In many cases, money can
sometimes be easier to pursue.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.595
Or at least you know when
you're making progress.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.980
So as a parent, when I
look at my own experience--

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.090
and at Google, everybody
says, oh, be curious.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.330
This is a different company.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.440
It's not your normal company.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.640
But the way they
let me in here is

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.850
through some pretty
rigorous testing.

00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:33.870
And I worry about
that for my own kid,

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.760
especially now
that I'm at Google.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.450
Oh, be Googly.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:37.430
Have fun.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.930
Do this.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:38.930
Do that.

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:43.640
And you know, that's
not how I grew up.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.400
You know, there were
standardized tests.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.110
And I did well at them.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.780
And you know, I'm at
a point in my life

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.750
where I can be as
Googly as I want.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:55.944
But is that the right
thing to teach my child?

00:49:55.944 --> 00:49:56.610
SUSAN ENGEL: Oh.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:00.030
What a great question.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.110
Well, first of all,
I don't know you.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:04.730
So I don't know
all the qualities

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:10.130
that made you Googly-- a phrase
I never knew until just now.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.670
But this is not everything.

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:16.040
So intelligence is
something important.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.670
And it's something by and
large you're born with.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:23.860
Though without
certain privileges

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.830
like stability and
health and basic needs

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.560
met when you're
little, you don't

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.670
get to fulfill your
intellectual capacity.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.140
That's why we see
big class differences

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.430
in terms of the measure
of intelligence,

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.600
because if you have good
food and a same house

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.930
to go to every night
and conversations,

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:46.620
you will fulfill your
intellectual capacity more

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:47.830
than another kid.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.780
But even so, some
people are going

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.250
to be smarter than others.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.790
And maybe it's true that Google
hires the smartest people.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:57.040
And that's going to
be true-- I mean,

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.570
maybe that's why you got hired.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:00.110
And maybe that's
why you did well

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.650
on some of standardized tests.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:05.770
So I'm not negating that.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.770
But there are also
many people who are not

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.070
going to work at Google.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.220
And it may be wonderful here.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.110
I may be incredible
to be Googly.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.090
But it's not the
only place to work,

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:20.630
and it's not the
only way to be happy.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.760
It would be very
cool-- maybe you've

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:27.960
done it-- to do some measures
of whether people who work here

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.300
are happier in their lives.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.220
That part's going to get
cut out of the video.

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.880
REGINA: I smile because
we look at [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.630
SUSAN ENGEL: Good.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:40.470
I'd love to know more about it.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.349
And you know, when I
use the word "happy"--

00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:44.640
and I take great pains in
the book to talk about this--

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.850
I'm not talking
about having fun.

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.830
So I tell a story in
the book about when

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:53.040
my children were little and a
little kid came over to play.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.110
And his mother went home
and told his mother,

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:57.720
let's play Susan and Jake.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.270
That was my eldest boy.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.475
And she said, how do
you play Susan and Jake?

00:52:01.475 --> 00:52:03.000
And he said, you be Susan.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.070
And you keep saying,
want a lollipop?

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.720
And that's not what I have
in mind for happiness.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.050
I mean finding fulfillment,
finding meaning,

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:13.230
working with others.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.220
Like I said, seeking
knowledge, being

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.180
able to be thoughtful
about things.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:21.740
I think actually if schools
were to seriously focus

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:25.300
on those things, not
just pay lip service,

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.650
I don't know what Googly means.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:27.510
Now I want to know.

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:31.340
But if it's just a
phrase, it's not much.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.110
If it captures something
serious about the way

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:37.170
people do things here, well
I'm thinking of something

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:38.150
similar in schools.

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:41.600
And I'm guessing that if kids
did those things in schools,

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.320
many more of them would
be well-equipped to work

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.291
environments like this.

00:52:47.291 --> 00:52:47.790
Yeah.

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.779
REGINA: That's one more
here in the corner.

00:52:49.779 --> 00:52:51.070
And then I think we're at time.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.100
And I'm going to sneak one
more question in and go over.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.740
First of all, I really
like what you're

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:01.276
talking about as the training
for happiness and curiosity

00:53:01.276 --> 00:53:02.150
and things like that.

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.730
I've seen it in my own children.

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.300
We had to take some out of
school because the way they

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.070
were taught just wasn't--
we teach them from home.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:14.170
And believe me, even if
I've encouraged them, hey,

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:18.620
I want you to go into something
so I can live off of you,

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.240
they're not.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.555
They all seem to be going
art or social type of things.

00:53:23.555 --> 00:53:24.680
SUSAN ENGEL: Good for them.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.810
AUDIENCE: Looking for
things that are happy.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:29.700
And I've also seen how
the curiosity or the love

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.500
of learning is just
[INAUDIBLE] out based

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.110
on a teacher, based
off of a textbook,

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:37.700
and a way it's taught.

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.380
So I see how that cripples them.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.240
My current 16-year-old
loves history,

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.010
but hated social
studies last year,

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:50.090
because the book
was frankly awful.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:55.510
But so I see this as
a positive direction.

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.630
This is what we really need.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:02.390
But how do you do this
and keep the bureaucracy

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:04.160
and the administration
out of it?

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.250
Because I've seen a lot
of good educational ideas.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.920
But then they go
to the government

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.930
and they put all this other
stuff in, and then by the time

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:17.764
it gets back to the schools,
it's just a huge mess.

00:54:17.764 --> 00:54:19.430
And the teachers don't
have any control.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.330
And this sounds
like the teachers'

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.390
got to have complete control.

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:26.580
And you've got to really train
the teachers up very well

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.330
in advance on how
to be doing this.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:29.830
It's not just
something you say, OK.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:30.910
We're going to now do it.

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:31.576
SUSAN ENGEL: No.

00:54:31.576 --> 00:54:32.870
I think that's really true.

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.050
And I think Regina
asked before about

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.730
whether there are any
schools that are doing this.

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:40.587
I think we are not making
use of the great models that

00:54:40.587 --> 00:54:41.170
are out there.

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:44.150
There are schools
that are doing this.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:45.790
And it's not because
they're keeping

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:47.010
administrators out of it.

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:49.120
It's because they have
good administrators.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.010
And we just need
to build on that.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.000
The question about
government is way beyond

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.210
my area of expertise.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:57.290
You know, I'm such an optimist.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:55:00.400
So I'm thinking, oh,
just change their minds.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.170
But ha!

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.922
So E. O. Wilson, who
is sort of famous,

00:55:08.922 --> 00:55:11.490
the most famous
biologist, really, alive,

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:16.020
who really developed
the idea of biodiversity

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.630
and is a powerful
spokesperson for ecology

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:22.220
and for the environment.

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.200
I was once listening
to him speak.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.740
And someone said-- and I
think he's near 90 now--

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:31.590
and they said, faced with all
the problems with the way we

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.450
treat the environment and all
the species that have died off,

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:39.480
and all the problems, how do you
have the courage and the umph

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.580
to go on promoting these
better practices on the Earth.

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:44.670
And he said, what
choice do I have?

00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:45.730
What's the alternative?

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.880
And I feel that way
about education.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.370
So it's been hard to change
the minds of administrators

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:54.319
or to make schools-- that's
a whole other talk about how

00:55:54.319 --> 00:55:55.985
you create the
conditions in the school,

00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:58.120
and good teachers can be good.

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:01.520
And I think there are
clear ways to do that.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.560
I don't get discouraged
or I don't give up

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.500
because what choice do I have?

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.490
So it's just a matter
of sticking with it

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.520
until we make some progress.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.226
And making use of the
really good models

00:56:12.226 --> 00:56:13.350
that are already out there.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:17.885
REGINA: I'm just
going to squeeze

00:56:17.885 --> 00:56:21.020
in the whole-- I'm really
concerned about my kid getting

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.140
into a good school.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:26.230
What about for that
question and concern?

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.481
SUSAN ENGEL: Oh, boy oh boy.

00:56:27.481 --> 00:56:27.980
I have--

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:28.900
REGINA: Especially college.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.340
SUSAN ENGEL: Yeah.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.070
Whoops.

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:30.860
That's a loud one.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.480
That's OK.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.890
So I'm going to quote
another educator about this.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.556
Because he said
something that I thought

00:56:35.556 --> 00:56:39.970
was so beautifully put, that
I've got to borrow from him.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:41.000
His name is Alfie Kohn.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.210
And he has said to groups
of people, how much damage

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:49.870
are you willing to
do to your child

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:53.490
to make sure they get into
a school that only appears

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.900
to be a little bit better
than some other school?

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.720
And what I mean
by that-- and I'm

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.410
guessing it's particularly
relevant for this kind

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:04.290
of a population--
is that this idea

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:08.230
that there's only a few
really good schools is crazy.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:10.510
There are a lot of
really good schools.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:13.530
There are so many good,
bright young people with PhDs

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.030
and they're not all at
Stanford, believe it or not.

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.480
They're all over the country
at all kinds of universities

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.600
and colleges, including
community colleges and state

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.030
universities.

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:27.000
The most important
thing is that your child

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.420
wants to go to school and wants
to go for the right reasons.

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.960
And I teach at a very selective
college-- Williams College.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.160
And I can tell you
that they all benefit

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.840
in the more conventional
ways from having that degree.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.790
But the ones that really
benefit are the ones

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:46.990
that actually are there to be
educated, and take something

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:50.140
out of college more than
just the piece of paper.

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.790
And that's what parents
should be thinking about.

00:57:54.922 --> 00:57:57.380
REGINA: Well, I'm going to end
there just for the recording

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:57.870
standpoint.

00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:59.370
Susan's going to
be available after.

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:02.300
Thank you everyone
for joining us.

00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:05.350
[APPLAUSE]
