00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.929
 Alejandro was the dead man was he who never 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.929
 He got home 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.770
 and he was going to go directly to work 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.470
 I play like when one says what 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.470
 they riddled him because he did nothing 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.730
 and now we feel with this 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.730
 sadness 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.850
 says then we come here to give to give them 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.520
 a news says that alejandro no longer 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.940
 is with us because the police says 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.380
 he killed him says why 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.340
 I was this 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.750
 with a gun a gun says and it 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.750
 they were forced to shoot 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.799
 but all your load 13 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.570
 shot us all and returned to 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.420
 charge and kept shooting 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.860
 the most terrible thing for me was to hear from 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.340
 that the policeman saying that when 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 they turned around he was still alive 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.600
 and he was drowning in his own blood 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.069
 that was that it was really terrible for 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.069
 me to hear true 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.050
 that they should not have killed my son 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.540
 they must have talked like when 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.630
 when they talk to people who do not 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.490
 they are the ones that are not Latinas 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.490
 simply when they are white
