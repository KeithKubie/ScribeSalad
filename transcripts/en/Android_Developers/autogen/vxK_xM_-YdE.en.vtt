00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010
of our first questions we received an
 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.010
of our first questions we received an
hour plus page before and this question

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020
hour plus page before and this question
 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.990
hour plus page before and this question
is coming from Hannah's Dorfman and he's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000
is coming from Hannah's Dorfman and he's
 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.170
is coming from Hannah's Dorfman and he's
asking about transparent action bars so

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180
asking about transparent action bars so
 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.870
asking about transparent action bars so
if I make an action bar transparent

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880
if I make an action bar transparent
 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.609
if I make an action bar transparent
through the content of a component that

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619
through the content of a component that
 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.800
through the content of a component that
has match parent height for instance the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810
has match parent height for instance the
 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.179
has match parent height for instance the
main activity layout set with

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189
main activity layout set with
 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.279
main activity layout set with
setcontentview automatically be

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289
setcontentview automatically be
 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.899
setcontentview automatically be
stretched invisible underneath the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909
stretched invisible underneath the
 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.209
stretched invisible underneath the
action bar and do you think it's

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219
action bar and do you think it's
 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.859
action bar and do you think it's
generally a good idea focusable like

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869
generally a good idea focusable like
 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.480
generally a good idea focusable like
we're doing it in the Google Play Music

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490
we're doing it in the Google Play Music
 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.700
we're doing it in the Google Play Music
app and the Grand Street in the Green

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710
app and the Grand Street in the Green
 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.200
app and the Grand Street in the Green
Street so let's split this question up

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210
Street so let's split this question up
 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.649
Street so let's split this question up
into two the first is about getting an

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659
into two the first is about getting an
 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.330
into two the first is about getting an
action bar that actually floats above

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340
action bar that actually floats above
 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.279
action bar that actually floats above
your content the way you do that is

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289
your content the way you do that is
 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.840
your content the way you do that is
actually by specifying and an XML

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
actually by specifying and an XML
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.289
actually by specifying and an XML
attribute in your layouts called action

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299
attribute in your layouts called action
 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.690
attribute in your layouts called action
bar window overlay so if you set this

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700
bar window overlay so if you set this
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.459
bar window overlay so if you set this
basically what it will do is put the

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469
basically what it will do is put the
 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.380
basically what it will do is put the
action bar on top and the content behind

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390
action bar on top and the content behind
 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.160
action bar on top and the content behind
it with with that content behind it then

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170
it with with that content behind it then
 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.840
it with with that content behind it then
that what that means is that you can

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850
that what that means is that you can
 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.970
that what that means is that you can
take advantages and advantage of things

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980
take advantages and advantage of things
 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.670
take advantages and advantage of things
like the transparent action bar so for

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
like the transparent action bar so for
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.430
like the transparent action bar so for
example Google music we use that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440
example Google music we use that
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.190
example Google music we use that
transparent action bar to show you the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200
transparent action bar to show you the
 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.399
transparent action bar to show you the
the imagery for the artist or the album

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409
the imagery for the artist or the album
 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.200
the imagery for the artist or the album
so what happens is when you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210
so what happens is when you
 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.000
so what happens is when you
you when you see the artist to start

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
you when you see the artist to start
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.010
you when you see the artist to start
with the transparent by the action bar

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020
with the transparent by the action bar
 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.350
with the transparent by the action bar
starts off transparent and then as you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
starts off transparent and then as you
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.650
starts off transparent and then as you
scroll it becomes more opaque that's a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660
scroll it becomes more opaque that's a
 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.270
scroll it becomes more opaque that's a
really nice effect because what it does

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280
really nice effect because what it does
 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.910
really nice effect because what it does
is it actually helps to retain the the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920
is it actually helps to retain the the
 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.550
is it actually helps to retain the the
visual branding that we're trying to get

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560
visual branding that we're trying to get
 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.920
visual branding that we're trying to get
with that orange color of the the Play

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
with that orange color of the the Play
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.500
with that orange color of the the Play
Music app but we're also trying to give

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
Music app but we're also trying to give
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.030
Music app but we're also trying to give
away that screen real estate for that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040
away that screen real estate for that
 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.640
away that screen real estate for that
rich media so as we're at the very top

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
rich media so as we're at the very top
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.980
rich media so as we're at the very top
you can see it and then as you scroll it

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990
you can see it and then as you scroll it
 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.980
you can see it and then as you scroll it
sort of becomes opaque over time so it's

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990
sort of becomes opaque over time so it's
 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.260
sort of becomes opaque over time so it's
a really nice effect so then you think

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270
a really nice effect so then you think
 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.790
a really nice effect so then you think
it would make sense to include this in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800
it would make sense to include this in
 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.920
it would make sense to include this in
your application I think it's typically

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930
your application I think it's typically
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.580
your application I think it's typically
where you need real estate back so

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590
where you need real estate back so
 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.860
where you need real estate back so
you've got a decent amount of content

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870
you've got a decent amount of content
 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.520
you've got a decent amount of content
that you kind of you know you want to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530
that you kind of you know you want to
 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.350
that you kind of you know you want to
take up that space so that that action

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360
take up that space so that that action
 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.180
take up that space so that that action
bar might be using and in particular

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190
bar might be using and in particular
 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.490
bar might be using and in particular
it's actually when you have rich media

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500
it's actually when you have rich media
 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.100
it's actually when you have rich media
like images so we have this this artist

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110
like images so we have this this artist
 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.390
like images so we have this this artist
profile here so in play music now grand

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400
profile here so in play music now grand
 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.680
profile here so in play music now grand
street is interesting because they use

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690
street is interesting because they use
 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.150
street is interesting because they use
the transparent action bus throughout

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160
the transparent action bus throughout
 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.040
the transparent action bus throughout
and again what they're doing is they're

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050
and again what they're doing is they're
 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.620
and again what they're doing is they're
they're sort of taking away the chrome

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630
they're sort of taking away the chrome
 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.260
they're sort of taking away the chrome
or the the UI elements so they're

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270
or the the UI elements so they're
 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.030
or the the UI elements so they're
actually what they do is that you'll see

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040
actually what they do is that you'll see
 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.980
actually what they do is that you'll see
that around their buttons in the action

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990
that around their buttons in the action
 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.840
that around their buttons in the action
bus or their action items they've got

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850
bus or their action items they've got
 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.600
bus or their action items they've got
some sort of translucent borders but the

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610
some sort of translucent borders but the
 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.370
some sort of translucent borders but the
main section of the action bar because

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380
main section of the action bar because
 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.020
main section of the action bar because
they're not actually displaying anything

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030
they're not actually displaying anything
 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.970
they're not actually displaying anything
they're choosing to make that

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980
they're choosing to make that
 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.660
they're choosing to make that
transparent and I mean the question was

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670
transparent and I mean the question was
 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.120
transparent and I mean the question was
do you like the general idea to be

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130
do you like the general idea to be
 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.920
do you like the general idea to be
honest this is more of a design question

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
honest this is more of a design question
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.320
honest this is more of a design question
and it depends on your design if you're

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330
and it depends on your design if you're
 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.270
and it depends on your design if you're
trying to really showcase those

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280
trying to really showcase those
 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.490
trying to really showcase those
beautiful images that you may have may

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500
beautiful images that you may have may
 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.110
beautiful images that you may have may
or may not have in your app then

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120
or may not have in your app then
 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.640
or may not have in your app then
attracts transparent action bar makes

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650
attracts transparent action bar makes
 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.560
attracts transparent action bar makes
sense but if you want to retain that

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570
sense but if you want to retain that
 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.650
sense but if you want to retain that
sort of brand identity then then go

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660
sort of brand identity then then go
 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.070
sort of brand identity then then go
ahead and keep an opaque or opaque color

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080
ahead and keep an opaque or opaque color
 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.770
ahead and keep an opaque or opaque color
or an image there yeah okay so our hands

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780
or an image there yeah okay so our hands
 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.030
or an image there yeah okay so our hands
I think his hands had another question

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040
I think his hands had another question

would like to implement something like

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830
would like to implement something like
 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.810
would like to implement something like
that in my name

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410
adapter that works with different card
 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.100
adapter that works with different card
sizes is it a simple list view that

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110
sizes is it a simple list view that
 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.340
sizes is it a simple list view that
inflates for instance a horizontal

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350
inflates for instance a horizontal
 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.310

big card and to medium cards and for

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290
big card and to medium cards and for
 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.100
big card and to medium cards and for
small cards and he's given us given us

an image there or is it a gridview with

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240
an image there or is it a gridview with
 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.320
an image there or is it a gridview with
a special view adapter can you implement

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330
a special view adapter can you implement
 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.850
a special view adapter can you implement
can you give any hint on how to

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860
can you give any hint on how to
 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.430
can you give any hint on how to
implement something like this well so

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440
implement something like this well so
 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.830
implement something like this well so
rather than focusing them specifically

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840
rather than focusing them specifically
 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.690
rather than focusing them specifically
what that implementation is what I'd be

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700
what that implementation is what I'd be
 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.790
what that implementation is what I'd be
saying is have a look at what works well

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800
saying is have a look at what works well
 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.160
saying is have a look at what works well
with your code so having a list view

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170
with your code so having a list view
 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.500
with your code so having a list view
with a linear layout in it is not a bad

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510
with a linear layout in it is not a bad
 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.500
with a linear layout in it is not a bad
idea not a bad way to do it you do you

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510
idea not a bad way to do it you do you
 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.120
idea not a bad way to do it you do you
don't have to use a linear lat you could

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130
don't have to use a linear lat you could
 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.000
don't have to use a linear lat you could
use a relative layout and in some ways a

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010
use a relative layout and in some ways a
 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.590
use a relative layout and in some ways a
relative layout might be a bit more

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600
relative layout might be a bit more
 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.870
relative layout might be a bit more
flexible for for allowing you to vary

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880
flexible for for allowing you to vary
 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.060
flexible for for allowing you to vary
the number of cards so what I'd be doing

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070
the number of cards so what I'd be doing
 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.070
the number of cards so what I'd be doing
is basically my adapter I'd be keeping

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
is basically my adapter I'd be keeping
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.410
is basically my adapter I'd be keeping
track of do I need to present this as a

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420
track of do I need to present this as a
 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.680
track of do I need to present this as a
big card or well if you have three sizes

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690
big card or well if you have three sizes
 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.880
big card or well if you have three sizes
a small medium large and then

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890
a small medium large and then
 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.410
a small medium large and then
dynamically try and set the proportions

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420
dynamically try and set the proportions
 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.960
dynamically try and set the proportions
accordingly so we don't currently have

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970
accordingly so we don't currently have
 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.060
accordingly so we don't currently have
any real sample code there that shows

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070
any real sample code there that shows
 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.920
any real sample code there that shows
users how to developers how to do this

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930
users how to developers how to do this
 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.530
users how to developers how to do this
but you can envisage that if you're

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540
but you can envisage that if you're
 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.200
but you can envisage that if you're
dynamically loading these creating these

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210
dynamically loading these creating these
 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.690
dynamically loading these creating these
views it shouldn't be too hard once you

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700
views it shouldn't be too hard once you
 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.940
views it shouldn't be too hard once you
know your heuristic to work out with

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950
know your heuristic to work out with
 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.460
know your heuristic to work out with
what size the card should be you can

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470
what size the card should be you can
 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.320
what size the card should be you can
easily just kind of say hey I want it to

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330
easily just kind of say hey I want it to
 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.270
easily just kind of say hey I want it to
be you know double the size of this or

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280
be you know double the size of this or
 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.000
be you know double the size of this or
not so yeah I mean it's all about

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010
not so yeah I mean it's all about
 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.660
not so yeah I mean it's all about
dynamically loading it in okay I hope

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670
dynamically loading it in okay I hope
 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.340
dynamically loading it in okay I hope

you talking about like a search view

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889
 
 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.170
 
yeah I'm trying to do a search view and

yeah I'm trying to do a search view and
 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.379
yeah I'm trying to do a search view and
can't get it to can't seem to get to the

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389
can't get it to can't seem to get to the

can't get it to can't seem to get to the
work and search in my app so are you

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870
work and search in my app so are you
 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.110
work and search in my app so are you
talking about at a presentation level or

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120
talking about at a presentation level or
 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.429
talking about at a presentation level or
are you talking about the integration of

are you talking about the integration of
 

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.980
are you talking about the integration of
like doing the search operation so the

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990
like doing the search operation so the
 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.360
like doing the search operation so the
indexing and the looking up of the

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370
indexing and the looking up of the
 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.379
indexing and the looking up of the
keywords I am adding a search view on

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:31.389

interesting I'll admit that when I look
 

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.530
interesting I'll admit that when I look
at fire up an Android app I'm almost

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:28.540
at fire up an Android app I'm almost
 

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.740
at fire up an Android app I'm almost
immediately able to sense whether this

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:31.750
immediately able to sense whether this
 

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.960
immediately able to sense whether this
is a modern Apple not and i sat down

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:33.970
is a modern Apple not and i sat down
 

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.430
is a modern Apple not and i sat down
when this question came up i said then I

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440
when this question came up i said then I
 

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.590
when this question came up i said then I
thought well what are the cues that give

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600
thought well what are the cues that give
 

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.600
thought well what are the cues that give
it away because it's it's obvious to me

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:39.610
it away because it's it's obvious to me
 

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.940
it away because it's it's obvious to me
but sometimes if you go into the details

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:41.950
but sometimes if you go into the details
 

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.560
but sometimes if you go into the details
it's harder to kind of specify exactly

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:43.570
it's harder to kind of specify exactly
 

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.540
it's harder to kind of specify exactly
what and I actually found that there was

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:45.550
what and I actually found that there was
 

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.120
what and I actually found that there was
a number of things so firstly it's the

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.130
a number of things so firstly it's the
 

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.630
a number of things so firstly it's the
legacy menu button this one's really

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:51.640
legacy menu button this one's really
 

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.240
legacy menu button this one's really
really important because there are tons

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.250
really important because there are tons
 

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.710
really important because there are tons
of phones out there that now have

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:55.720
of phones out there that now have
 

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.510
of phones out there that now have
virtual navigation buttons but in

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:57.520
virtual navigation buttons but in
 

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.490
virtual navigation buttons but in
particular the majority the vast

majority of tablets don't have a

majority of tablets don't have a

physical menu button they have virtual

physical menu button they have virtual
buttons so if you're not targeting the

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:07.900
buttons so if you're not targeting the
 

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.720
buttons so if you're not targeting the
latest SDK or rather if you're not

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:09.730
latest SDK or rather if you're not
 

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.100

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.110

11 and up you're going to start to see

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360
11 and up you're going to start to see
 

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.690
11 and up you're going to start to see
that legacy menu button and often

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:16.700
that legacy menu button and often
 

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.970
that legacy menu button and often
actually it doesn't most people don't

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:18.980
actually it doesn't most people don't
 

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.449
actually it doesn't most people don't
even put a menu in there because we've

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:22.459
even put a menu in there because we've
 

00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:25.300
even put a menu in there because we've
kind of you know when when Android first

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.310
kind of you know when when Android first
 

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.040
kind of you know when when Android first
came about we had these user interfaces

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.050
came about we had these user interfaces
 

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.110
came about we had these user interfaces
that were designed around having a menu

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120
that were designed around having a menu
 

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.480
that were designed around having a menu
that wasn't necessarily visible the

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:31.490
that wasn't necessarily visible the
 

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.280
that wasn't necessarily visible the
action bar and the action overflowed

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.290
action bar and the action overflowed
 

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.350
action bar and the action overflowed
basically improved that so that you

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360
basically improved that so that you
 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.900
basically improved that so that you
could see when you had actions available

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:37.910
could see when you had actions available
 

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.900
could see when you had actions available
to you and in that way it replaced what

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:40.910
to you and in that way it replaced what
 

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.210
to you and in that way it replaced what
the menu button did but in a more

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:43.220
the menu button did but in a more
 

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.370
the menu button did but in a more
powerful manner because you could choose

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:45.380
powerful manner because you could choose
 

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.000
powerful manner because you could choose
what to show give things priority have

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.010
what to show give things priority have
 

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.540
what to show give things priority have
it automatically stack or split so that

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:52.550
it automatically stack or split so that
 

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.970
it automatically stack or split so that
there were a lot of advantages that came

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:54.980
there were a lot of advantages that came
 

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.730
there were a lot of advantages that came
with that so if I'm seeing a legacy menu

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:57.740
with that so if I'm seeing a legacy menu
 

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.440
with that so if I'm seeing a legacy menu
button usually to me that's a sign that

00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.450
button usually to me that's a sign that
 

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.530
button usually to me that's a sign that

the menu button actually so we covered

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:11.540
the menu button actually so we covered

necessarily break backward compatibility
 

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.579
necessarily break backward compatibility
because you have the min SDK version

00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:21.589
because you have the min SDK version
 

00:12:21.589 --> 00:12:23.590

and by that we don't mean that every

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.100
and by that we don't mean that every
 

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.980
and by that we don't mean that every
single app needs to look the same or

using a modern theme is a good thing and
 

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.490
using a modern theme is a good thing and
especially if you have an app that

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:06.500
especially if you have an app that
 

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.960
especially if you have an app that
you've tested on something more modern

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:07.970
you've tested on something more modern
 

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.670
you've tested on something more modern
it's just really easy to specify a

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680
it's just really easy to specify a
 

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.319
it's just really easy to specify a
different theme for you know ice cream

00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:11.329

you're getting the whole thing with

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120
you're getting the whole thing with
 

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.780
you're getting the whole thing with
dialogues and you know the other input

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:16.790
dialogues and you know the other input
 

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.300
dialogues and you know the other input
UI elements as well so it's really easy

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:19.310
UI elements as well so it's really easy
 

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.769
UI elements as well so it's really easy
to actually you know get off man it's so

00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:20.779
to actually you know get off man it's so
 

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:22.809
to actually you know get off man it's so
obvious so if you get a dialogue that

00:13:22.809 --> 00:13:22.819
obvious so if you get a dialogue that
 

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:24.519
obvious so if you get a dialogue that
doesn't look like a whole lotta log it's

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:24.529
doesn't look like a whole lotta log it's
 

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:25.420
doesn't look like a whole lotta log it's
just yeah

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:25.430
just yeah

so so legacy menu button on Halloween
the third one for me is the action bar

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:30.410
the third one for me is the action bar
 

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.710
the third one for me is the action bar
so the lack of an action bar tells me

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720
so the lack of an action bar tells me
 

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.800
so the lack of an action bar tells me
that you're either very you're paying a

lot of attention to detail and you're
 

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.220
lot of attention to detail and you're
you're building a really custom

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.230
you're building a really custom

experience that you feel is better than
the action bar and that's ok that's an

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:44.209
the action bar and that's ok that's an
 

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:46.000
the action bar and that's ok that's an
endeavor that we we encourage innovation

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.010
endeavor that we we encourage innovation
 

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.370
endeavor that we we encourage innovation
is always a good thing but often what I

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.380
is always a good thing but often what I
 

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.829
is always a good thing but often what I
find is apps that aren't using an action

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839
find is apps that aren't using an action
 

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:54.190
find is apps that aren't using an action

because you truly are building an

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:22.940
because you truly are building an
 

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.400
because you truly are building an
experience that you that that is

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:24.410
experience that you that that is
 

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.850
experience that you that that is
superior to the default one so yeah

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:27.860
superior to the default one so yeah
 

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.190
superior to the default one so yeah
three things yeah so the action bar is

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:30.200
three things yeah so the action bar is
 

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.900
three things yeah so the action bar is
an interesting one it always tends to

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:31.910
an interesting one it always tends to
 

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.370
an interesting one it always tends to
come up so let's talk about in a bit

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:33.380
come up so let's talk about in a bit
 

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.650
come up so let's talk about in a bit
more more details so let's say you

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:35.660
more more details so let's say you
 

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.570
more more details so let's say you
already have an established branding

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:37.580
already have an established branding
 

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.010
already have an established branding
like you know you have some some logos

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:39.020
like you know you have some some logos
 

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.960

are using some colors or something how

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:40.970
are using some colors or something how
 

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.490

would you include that with your action

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:42.500
would you include that with your action
 

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.110
would you include that with your action
bar because they actually would be at

bar because they actually would be at
 

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.730
bar because they actually would be at
the top and people tend to put logos

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:45.740
the top and people tend to put logos
 

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.870
the top and people tend to put logos
there or something similar and some

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880
there or something similar and some
 

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.870
there or something similar and some
other apps yeah i mean the action bar is

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880
other apps yeah i mean the action bar is
 

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.660

what region you've you've you interacted
 

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.250

a great way to go so we've actually
 

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.070
a great way to go so we've actually
talked a lot about the action bar and I

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080
talked a lot about the action bar and I
 

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.900
talked a lot about the action bar and I
hope we can start to see the importance

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:38.910
hope we can start to see the importance
 

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.350
hope we can start to see the importance
of it at least from a modernizing point

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360
of it at least from a modernizing point
 

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.660
of it at least from a modernizing point
of view let's see if do we have any

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:44.670
of view let's see if do we have any
 

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.000

action bars and and you're talking about

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160
action bars and and you're talking about
 

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.220
action bars and and you're talking about
touch feedback as well so one

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:07.230
touch feedback as well so one
 

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.450
touch feedback as well so one
interesting interesting thing that

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460
interesting interesting thing that
 

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.010
interesting interesting thing that
always comes out of spacing I find

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020
always comes out of spacing I find
 

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.140
always comes out of spacing I find
because some of your buttons are too

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.150
because some of your buttons are too
 

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.630
because some of your buttons are too
close together or text there's just too

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640
close together or text there's just too
 

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.910
close together or text there's just too
narrow doesn't look right and I know we

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:16.920
narrow doesn't look right and I know we
 

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.790
narrow doesn't look right and I know we
talked a bit about spacing in in our in

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:19.800
talked a bit about spacing in in our in
 

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.370
talked a bit about spacing in in our in
our deaf bites um let's talk about that

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380
our deaf bites um let's talk about that
 

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.900
our deaf bites um let's talk about that
a bit more so what would be the

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:23.910
a bit more so what would be the
 

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.370
a bit more so what would be the
recommended spacing if you want to have

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380
recommended spacing if you want to have
 

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.690
recommended spacing if you want to have
more fun to put a button on your screen

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700
more fun to put a button on your screen
 

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.550
more fun to put a button on your screen
for example well the good thing is we've

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:28.560
for example well the good thing is we've
 

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.110
for example well the good thing is we've
actually documented this on the Android

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120
actually documented this on the Android
 

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.740
actually documented this on the Android
design guidelines site and again there's

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:33.750
design guidelines site and again there's
 

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.210
design guidelines site and again there's
a section called metrics and grids that

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.220
a section called metrics and grids that
 

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.370
a section called metrics and grids that
actually tells you all about this but

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380
actually tells you all about this but
 

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.800
actually tells you all about this but
there's a couple of really sort of key

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:39.810
there's a couple of really sort of key
 

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.720
there's a couple of really sort of key
points that we should get across one is

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:41.730
points that we should get across one is
 

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.040
points that we should get across one is
that if you've got something like a list

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.050
that if you've got something like a list
 

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.670
that if you've got something like a list
you have a minimum of 48 dips so that's

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:46.680
you have a minimum of 48 dips so that's
 

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.030
you have a minimum of 48 dips so that's
density-independent pixels in height

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:49.040
density-independent pixels in height
 

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.320
density-independent pixels in height
because we feel that that's a that's a

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:51.330
because we feel that that's a that's a
 

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.690
because we feel that that's a that's a
comfortable sort of patch region but

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700
comfortable sort of patch region but
 

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.510
comfortable sort of patch region but
even within those that 48 dip reason

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520
even within those that 48 dip reason
 

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.670
even within those that 48 dip reason
that you have in the list view item you

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:58.680
that you have in the list view item you
 

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.440
that you have in the list view item you
want to have some padding within that

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:00.450
want to have some padding within that
 

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.020
want to have some padding within that
for their dip so that you've got roughly

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.030
for their dip so that you've got roughly
 

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.669
for their dip so that you've got roughly
about four depths of

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679
about four depths of
 

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:07.789
about four depths of
padding above a button for example and

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799
padding above a button for example and
 

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:09.739
padding above a button for example and
below it so that you don't get two

00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:09.749
below it so that you don't get two
 

00:20:09.749 --> 00:20:11.419
below it so that you don't get two
buttons that are so close to one another

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:11.429
buttons that are so close to one another
 

00:20:11.429 --> 00:20:13.970
buttons that are so close to one another
that if a user happens to hit somewhere

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980
that if a user happens to hit somewhere
 

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.450
that if a user happens to hit somewhere
in that unknown region they might end up

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460
in that unknown region they might end up
 

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.119
in that unknown region they might end up
triggering the wrong event or the wrong

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:20.129
triggering the wrong event or the wrong
 

00:20:20.129 --> 00:20:22.759
triggering the wrong event or the wrong
button so you know that metrics in grid

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:22.769
button so you know that metrics in grid
 

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:24.649
button so you know that metrics in grid
page there's a lot of measurements on

00:20:24.649 --> 00:20:24.659
page there's a lot of measurements on
 

00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:27.019
page there's a lot of measurements on
there but the ones that I love to that I

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:27.029
there but the ones that I love to that I
 

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:29.090
there but the ones that I love to that I
particularly pay attention to is the 48

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100
particularly pay attention to is the 48
 

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.060
particularly pay attention to is the 48
dip rhythm some of the padding numbers

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.070
dip rhythm some of the padding numbers
 

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.669
dip rhythm some of the padding numbers
there around items within list views and

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679
there around items within list views and
 

00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:38.600
there around items within list views and
the one that I wish more developers paid

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:38.610
the one that I wish more developers paid
 

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.119
the one that I wish more developers paid
attention to is the 16 dips of padding

00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:41.129
attention to is the 16 dips of padding
 

00:20:41.129 --> 00:20:43.220
attention to is the 16 dips of padding
on on the sides and the reason for that

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.230
on on the sides and the reason for that
 

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.889
on on the sides and the reason for that
is as we hold our sort of devices you

00:20:45.889 --> 00:20:45.899
is as we hold our sort of devices you
 

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:47.779
is as we hold our sort of devices you
know you kind of hold it with you with

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:47.789
know you kind of hold it with you with
 

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.220
know you kind of hold it with you with
your hand and you'll find that your

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:49.230
your hand and you'll find that your
 

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.470
your hand and you'll find that your
fingers may end up sort of interacting

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480
fingers may end up sort of interacting
 

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.139
fingers may end up sort of interacting
with the screen now if you've got a UI

00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:54.149
with the screen now if you've got a UI
 

00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:56.899
with the screen now if you've got a UI
that that touches just all the way up

00:20:56.899 --> 00:20:56.909
that that touches just all the way up
 

00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:58.549
that that touches just all the way up
against the edge you can end up in a

00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559
against the edge you can end up in a
 

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.529
against the edge you can end up in a
situation where the user is accidentally

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539
situation where the user is accidentally
 

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:03.080
situation where the user is accidentally
triggering those items when they don't

triggering those items when they don't
 

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.600
triggering those items when they don't
mean to so having those that spacing on

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:05.610
mean to so having those that spacing on
 

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.019
mean to so having those that spacing on
either side very important how about

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:09.029
either side very important how about
 

00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:10.850
either side very important how about
yourself I mean do you have any sort of

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860
yourself I mean do you have any sort of
 

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.850
yourself I mean do you have any sort of
words of advice there so I find a myth a

tablet layout so even if you don't guess

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:15.809
tablet layout so even if you don't guess
 

00:21:15.809 --> 00:21:17.330
tablet layout so even if you don't guess
only have time to implement a full

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340
only have time to implement a full
 

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.919
only have time to implement a full
tablet layout just adding a bit more

you think I really help it goes a long

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.110
you think I really help it goes a long

have a long list of textable to scroll

00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279
have a long list of textable to scroll
 

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:27.980
have a long list of textable to scroll

you've got some text on a tablet whether

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:37.289
you've got some text on a tablet whether
 

00:21:37.289 --> 00:21:41.210
you've got some text on a tablet whether
you've got a multi multi pane layout or

not it's important to know that you kind
of want to have a horizontal scan which

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:47.249
of want to have a horizontal scan which
 

00:21:47.249 --> 00:21:49.039
of want to have a horizontal scan which
is actually comfortable so what we mean

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:49.049
is actually comfortable so what we mean
 

00:21:49.049 --> 00:21:51.409
is actually comfortable so what we mean
by that is if you've got text that that

00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419
by that is if you've got text that that
 

00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:53.239
by that is if you've got text that that
you're presenting don't have it going

from edge to edge have it sort of you
 

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:59.539
from edge to edge have it sort of you
use a certain horizontal scan that that

00:21:59.539 --> 00:21:59.549
use a certain horizontal scan that that
 

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:01.519
use a certain horizontal scan that that
allows users to go left and right very

00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:01.529
allows users to go left and right very
 

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.259
allows users to go left and right very
quickly through the text even if that

quickly through the text even if that
means adding padding on the side and we

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:04.950
means adding padding on the side and we
 

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.009
means adding padding on the side and we
did this in bacon reader actually in in

series of making apps beautiful you

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980
series of making apps beautiful you
 

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.070
series of making apps beautiful you
looked at that that detailed view that

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080
looked at that that detailed view that
 

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.860
looked at that that detailed view that
we had

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:16.870
we had
 

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.690
we had
added this padding on the side so that

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:18.700
added this padding on the side so that
 

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.880
added this padding on the side so that
that horizontal scan is comfortable it's

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:20.890
that horizontal scan is comfortable it's
 

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.799
that horizontal scan is comfortable it's
all surprising how how little we have to

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:22.809
all surprising how how little we have to
 

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:24.720
all surprising how how little we have to
do to get this working but has a huge

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:24.730
do to get this working but has a huge
 

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.370
do to get this working but has a huge
impact on this ability and the actual

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:26.380
impact on this ability and the actual
 

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.250
impact on this ability and the actual
design right all right that's exactly so

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:29.260
design right all right that's exactly so
 

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.090
design right all right that's exactly so
I speaking of text hmm font now one of

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:33.100
I speaking of text hmm font now one of
 

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.470
I speaking of text hmm font now one of
the things we've been talking so far

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480
the things we've been talking so far
 

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.230
the things we've been talking so far
about measuring our layouts in dips but

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240
about measuring our layouts in dips but
 

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.170
about measuring our layouts in dips but
fonts have a kind of special metric that

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:40.180
fonts have a kind of special metric that
 

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.600
fonts have a kind of special metric that
usually is right yeah so f of functions

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:42.610
usually is right yeah so f of functions
 

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.170
usually is right yeah so f of functions
SP and the the idea is that if um

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:46.180
SP and the the idea is that if um
 

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.610
SP and the the idea is that if um
basically should look at accessibility

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:47.620
basically should look at accessibility
 

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.280
basically should look at accessibility
and in your Android device settings you

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:50.290
and in your Android device settings you
 

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.840
and in your Android device settings you
can actually change the font size some

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:51.850
can actually change the font size some
 

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.040
can actually change the font size some
of you might have seen it already so you

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.050
of you might have seen it already so you
 

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.840
of you might have seen it already so you
can but now it's set to normal have a

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:54.850
can but now it's set to normal have a
 

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.010
can but now it's set to normal have a
percent from but you can make it large

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.020
percent from but you can make it large
 

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.840
percent from but you can make it large
or small if you wanted to do that and if

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:57.850
or small if you wanted to do that and if
 

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.210
or small if you wanted to do that and if
you stick with the SP measurement it's

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:00.220
you stick with the SP measurement it's
 

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.220
you stick with the SP measurement it's
actually a relative based on that as

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:02.230
actually a relative based on that as
 

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.930
actually a relative based on that as
well so if somebody has enabled a highly

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:03.940
well so if somebody has enabled a highly
 

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.930
well so if somebody has enabled a highly
fifty percent font size for example you

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:06.940
fifty percent font size for example you
 

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.490
fifty percent font size for example you
happen automatically scale up for that

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:08.500
happen automatically scale up for that
 

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.160
happen automatically scale up for that
and the text automatically get bigger so

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.170
and the text automatically get bigger so
 

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.540
and the text automatically get bigger so
specifying fonts that I space definitely

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:12.550
specifying fonts that I space definitely
 

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.760
specifying fonts that I space definitely
the way forward yeah it's particularly

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:14.770
the way forward yeah it's particularly
 

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.220
the way forward yeah it's particularly
useful for accessibility right like in

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.230
useful for accessibility right like in
 

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.600
useful for accessibility right like in
accessibility settings you can set a

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:18.610
accessibility settings you can set a
 

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.180
accessibility settings you can set a
minimum font size and SP basically

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:23.190
minimum font size and SP basically
 

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.460
minimum font size and SP basically
acknowledges that and applies it the

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:26.470
acknowledges that and applies it the
 

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.750
acknowledges that and applies it the
other thing that's really important in

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760
other thing that's really important in
 

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.820
other thing that's really important in
fonts and it's one that we haven't

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:29.830
fonts and it's one that we haven't
 

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.500
fonts and it's one that we haven't
actually covered in this particular

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:31.510
actually covered in this particular
 

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:36.299
actually covered in this particular
series is localization yeah now a lot of

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:36.309
series is localization yeah now a lot of
 

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:38.340
series is localization yeah now a lot of
people think that localization just

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:38.350
people think that localization just
 

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.770
people think that localization just
means translating strings often that's

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:40.780
means translating strings often that's
 

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.040
means translating strings often that's
not the case often you actually need to

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.050
not the case often you actually need to
 

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.230
not the case often you actually need to
also consider things that might be

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240
also consider things that might be
 

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.620
also consider things that might be
culturally insensitive as well in the

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:49.630
culturally insensitive as well in the
 

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.049
culturally insensitive as well in the
content of your of your app often

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:52.059
content of your of your app often
 

00:23:52.059 --> 00:23:54.090
content of your of your app often
actually for in most cases that sort of

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.100
actually for in most cases that sort of
 

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.310
actually for in most cases that sort of
sensitivity is more towards games then

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320
sensitivity is more towards games then
 

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.770
sensitivity is more towards games then
it then it may be towards just a

00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:58.780
it then it may be towards just a
 

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.990
it then it may be towards just a
standard non game app but it's something

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000
standard non game app but it's something
 

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.030
standard non game app but it's something
that's worth considering but the big

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:03.040
that's worth considering but the big
 

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.650
that's worth considering but the big
thing that happens from localization is

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:04.660
thing that happens from localization is
 

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.090
thing that happens from localization is
when you translate some of these strings

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:06.100
when you translate some of these strings
 

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.430
when you translate some of these strings
depending on the language you use you

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440
depending on the language you use you
 

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.100
depending on the language you use you
you can end up with much longer strings

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:11.110
you can end up with much longer strings
 

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.530
you can end up with much longer strings
and then it's possible I know when we

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:13.540
and then it's possible I know when we
 

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.150
and then it's possible I know when we
did Santa tracker our German

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:15.160
did Santa tracker our German
 

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.450
did Santa tracker our German
translations are significantly longer

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460
translations are significantly longer
 

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.760
translations are significantly longer
broader than than the English ones for

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:20.770
broader than than the English ones for
 

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.950
broader than than the English ones for
example so so what one one good tip I

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960
example so so what one one good tip I
 

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.810
example so so what one one good tip I
can give you here is to load up the

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:24.820
can give you here is to load up the
 

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.880
can give you here is to load up the
application Android studio and there we

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:26.890
application Android studio and there we
 

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.169
application Android studio and there we
actually have a view they can see all

00:24:28.169 --> 00:24:28.179
actually have a view they can see all
 

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:30.030
actually have a view they can see all
the translations and all the languages

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.040
the translations and all the languages
 

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.410
the translations and all the languages
you have available in your application

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:31.420
you have available in your application
 

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.330
you have available in your application
they get a fantastic over you know the

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:33.340
they get a fantastic over you know the
 

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.820
they get a fantastic over you know the
same layout the same screen in different

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:35.830
same layout the same screen in different
 

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.710
same layout the same screen in different
in different languages so you can easily

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720
in different languages so you can easily
 

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.600
in different languages so you can easily
spot the Texas cut off or doesn't quite

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:39.610
spot the Texas cut off or doesn't quite
 

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.070

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.080
look right without having to click all
 

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.810
look right without having to click all
over the place it's a really really good

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:42.820
over the place it's a really really good
 

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.840
over the place it's a really really good
way to test it out yeah yeah definitely

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:45.850
way to test it out yeah yeah definitely
 

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.210
way to test it out yeah yeah definitely
so in localization make sure you just

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:48.220
so in localization make sure you just
 

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.240
so in localization make sure you just
give you test it out on you users

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:50.250

it's really really important often it's

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:56.980
it's really really important often it's

it's really really important often it's
it's not easy to necessarily have a

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.250
it's not easy to necessarily have a
 

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.640
it's not easy to necessarily have a
magic bullet for it sometimes you are

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:02.650
magic bullet for it sometimes you are
 

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.770
magic bullet for it sometimes you are
going to get text which is just really

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:04.780
going to get text which is just really
 

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.090
going to get text which is just really
long for your button and you need to

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:06.100
long for your button and you need to
 

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.720
long for your button and you need to
consider rephrasing that that button so

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:09.730
consider rephrasing that that button so
 

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.730
consider rephrasing that that button so
that you know text doesn't get truncated

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:11.740
that you know text doesn't get truncated
 

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.200
that you know text doesn't get truncated
or doesn't wrap and you end up with this

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.210
or doesn't wrap and you end up with this
 

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.780
or doesn't wrap and you end up with this
massive button so it is something that's

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:15.790
massive button so it is something that's
 

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.750
massive button so it is something that's
important but localization is probably

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760
important but localization is probably
 

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.550
important but localization is probably
one of the best ways to grow your user

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:20.560
one of the best ways to grow your user
 

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.490
one of the best ways to grow your user
base because you're suddenly making your

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:23.500
base because you're suddenly making your
 

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:29.100

app available to a halt to a whole group

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.110
app available to a halt to a whole group

been able to consume that app or may not

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:33.820
been able to consume that app or may not

been able to consume that app or may not
have felt it was comfortable enough but

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.130
have felt it was comfortable enough but
 

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.910
have felt it was comfortable enough but
looks like we have a couple of questions

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:38.920
looks like we have a couple of questions
 

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:46.380
looks like we have a couple of questions
on us yeah from URI yuly Laguna so what

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:46.390
on us yeah from URI yuly Laguna so what
 

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.130
on us yeah from URI yuly Laguna so what
is the best way to have action overflow

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140
is the best way to have action overflow
 

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.050
is the best way to have action overflow
button on devices with the menu buttons

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.060
button on devices with the menu buttons
 

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.870
button on devices with the menu buttons
such as s3 that's a that's a really good

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880
such as s3 that's a that's a really good
 

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.470
such as s3 that's a that's a really good
question so yep they're still devices

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480
question so yep they're still devices
 

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.840
question so yep they're still devices
that ship with menu buttons as well as

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:00.850
that ship with menu buttons as well as
 

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.660
that ship with menu buttons as well as
those that ship with virtual navigation

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:02.670
those that ship with virtual navigation
 

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.810
those that ship with virtual navigation
sort of virtual buttons rather and I

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820
sort of virtual buttons rather and I
 

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.660
sort of virtual buttons rather and I
think to me this this is a bit of a

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:09.670
think to me this this is a bit of a
 

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.810
think to me this this is a bit of a
choice that you have as a developer you

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:12.820
choice that you have as a developer you
 

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.740
choice that you have as a developer you
could the action overflow typically what

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:16.750
could the action overflow typically what
 

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.270
could the action overflow typically what
would happen is that it would disappear

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:18.280
would happen is that it would disappear
 

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.600
would happen is that it would disappear
on the on the standard action bar and it

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:21.610
on the on the standard action bar and it
 

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.660
on the on the standard action bar and it
would show up as a menu I think that's

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:24.670
would show up as a menu I think that's
 

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.760
would show up as a menu I think that's
that's a that's a fine way of using it

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:26.770
that's a that's a fine way of using it
 

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:28.170
that's a that's a fine way of using it
because that's again if you think about

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:28.180
because that's again if you think about
 

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.090
because that's again if you think about
the consistency of the user experience

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.100
the consistency of the user experience
 

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:35.400
the consistency of the user experience
for people on that device they will be

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.410
for people on that device they will be
 

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.350
for people on that device they will be
used to using the menu button on the

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360
used to using the menu button on the
 

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.090
used to using the menu button on the
other hand if you strip feel strongly

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:39.100
other hand if you strip feel strongly
 

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.240
other hand if you strip feel strongly
about having that that overflow there

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.250
about having that that overflow there
 

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.010
about having that that overflow there
something you can do there as well I I

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.020
something you can do there as well I I
 

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.450
something you can do there as well I I
don't think there's a right or wrong

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:45.460
don't think there's a right or wrong
 

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.120
don't think there's a right or wrong
here but more of a preference that you

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.130
here but more of a preference that you
 

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.490
here but more of a preference that you
can have and you know what with some of

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:50.500
can have and you know what with some of
 

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.290
can have and you know what with some of
these things depending on the app it can

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:52.300
these things depending on the app it can
 

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.800
these things depending on the app it can
also differ so there's no harm in sort

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:55.810
also differ so there's no harm in sort
 

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.320
also differ so there's no harm in sort
of doing some experiments you know

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:58.330
of doing some experiments you know
 

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.060
of doing some experiments you know
things like the staged rollout feature

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.070
things like the staged rollout feature
 

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.220
things like the staged rollout feature
that we've now enabled or alpha beta

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:02.230
that we've now enabled or alpha beta
 

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.170
that we've now enabled or alpha beta
testing channels on Google Play allow

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.180
testing channels on Google Play allow
 

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.970
testing channels on Google Play allow
you to actually experiment with a small

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:05.980
you to actually experiment with a small
 

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.430
you to actually experiment with a small
subset of users and see yeah you know

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440
subset of users and see yeah you know
 

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.720
subset of users and see yeah you know
collect some analytics and see what's

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:09.730
collect some analytics and see what's
 

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.090
collect some analytics and see what's
working best I think you'll find that

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:12.100
working best I think you'll find that
 

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.040
working best I think you'll find that
again there's not just one right answer

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.050
again there's not just one right answer
 

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.960
again there's not just one right answer
for that sort of question yeah that's

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:15.970
for that sort of question yeah that's
 

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.980
for that sort of question yeah that's
right well I hope okay he said is it

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:19.990
right well I hope okay he said is it
 

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.330
right well I hope okay he said is it
okay in your opinion to have the

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:21.340
okay in your opinion to have the
 

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.730
okay in your opinion to have the
navigation drawer and sliding pane

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:23.740
navigation drawer and sliding pane
 

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.290
navigation drawer and sliding pane
layout even so that they both don't use

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.300
layout even so that they both don't use
 

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.750
layout even so that they both don't use
the same gestures it seems quite similar

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760
the same gestures it seems quite similar
 

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.890
the same gestures it seems quite similar
yeah so that's that's always a problem

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:34.900
yeah so that's that's always a problem
 

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.990
yeah so that's that's always a problem
if you have touch interactions in your

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000
if you have touch interactions in your
 

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.580
if you have touch interactions in your
application whether it's a it's a

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:38.590
application whether it's a it's a
 

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.350
application whether it's a it's a
sliding sliding pane layout or whether

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360
sliding sliding pane layout or whether
 

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.470
sliding sliding pane layout or whether
it's a map or something so it's it's you

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480
it's a map or something so it's it's you
 

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.760
it's a map or something so it's it's you
have to be desperate for trade off I'd

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:44.770
have to be desperate for trade off I'd
 

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:45.960
have to be desperate for trade off I'd
you have to make the right decision say

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:45.970
you have to make the right decision say
 

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.120
you have to make the right decision say
it can you accidentally trigger the

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.130
it can you accidentally trigger the
 

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.470
it can you accidentally trigger the
navigation role for example when you

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480
navigation role for example when you
 

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.750
navigation role for example when you
actually want to slide your layout so

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760
actually want to slide your layout so
 

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.250
actually want to slide your layout so
it's kind of the pencil application how

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:53.260
it's kind of the pencil application how
 

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.820
it's kind of the pencil application how
you have how use interact with it so in

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:56.830
you have how use interact with it so in
 

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.790
you have how use interact with it so in
in some ways overloading gesture it's

00:27:59.790 --> 00:27:59.800
in some ways overloading gesture it's
 

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.260
in some ways overloading gesture it's
not a good idea yeah really wouldn't

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:01.270
not a good idea yeah really wouldn't
 

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.270
not a good idea yeah really wouldn't
recommend that it's especially something

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:03.280
recommend that it's especially something
 

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.980
recommend that it's especially something
you know like an edge smart folks and we

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:04.990
you know like an edge smart folks and we
 

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.300
you know like an edge smart folks and we
wouldn't wouldn't recommend that but

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:06.310
wouldn't wouldn't recommend that but
 

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.830
wouldn't wouldn't recommend that but
I've seen some applications where the

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840
I've seen some applications where the
 

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.970
I've seen some applications where the
navigation drawer has actually been

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:08.980
navigation drawer has actually been
 

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.290
navigation drawer has actually been
quite successfully implemented med

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:10.300
quite successfully implemented med
 

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.030
quite successfully implemented med
actually goes on top of the rest of the

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.040
actually goes on top of the rest of the
 

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.230
actually goes on top of the rest of the
application so in this case of also a

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240
application so in this case of also a
 

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.390
application so in this case of also a
map and you can pan a map but you can

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:15.400
map and you can pan a map but you can
 

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.640
map and you can pan a map but you can
still pull in the navigation drawer from

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:17.650
still pull in the navigation drawer from
 

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.170
still pull in the navigation drawer from
the side and that actually worked quite

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:19.180
the side and that actually worked quite
 

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.670
the side and that actually worked quite
well because was just triggered from the

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:20.680
well because was just triggered from the
 

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.480
well because was just triggered from the
edge yeah so the edge swipe or the the

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:23.490
edge yeah so the edge swipe or the the
 

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.940
edge yeah so the edge swipe or the the
bezel swipe that that that's become

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:26.950
bezel swipe that that that's become
 

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.800
bezel swipe that that that's become
quite popular I mean that's a sign of

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:28.810
quite popular I mean that's a sign of
 

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.930
quite popular I mean that's a sign of
time changing right because people are
