00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.050
Pedro is supposed
to practice piano

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.780
for 3/4 of an hour every day.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.980
Today, he has practiced
for 1/4 of an hour.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.900
What fraction of an hour
does he need to practice?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.239
So let's visualize 3/4.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.480
So he needs to practice
3/4 of an hour.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.300
So if this represents
an entire hour,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.270
so let's divide it into fourths.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.547
So now, divide it into halves.

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.380
Now, let's make it into
four equal sections.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.870
Now, it's into fourths.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.730
So he needs to practice
3/4 of an hour.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.110
That was my attempt
at drawing an arrow.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.040
So let me shade it in.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.930
So he needs to practice
3/4 of an hour.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.180
This gets us to 3/4
right over here.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.640
So he needs to practice 3 out
of the fourths of an hour.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.060
So this is 3/4.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.460
Now, it says he has already
practiced for 1/4 of an hour.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.490
So he's already
practiced for 1/4.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.965
So how much more does
he need to practice?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.650
Well, he needs to
practice this much more.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.630
And you might already
see the answer visually.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.710
But let's think about
how to represent it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.190
as a fraction expression.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.550
So let me write it like this.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.130
So this is how much
he needs to go.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.160
How much does he
need to practice?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.510
So he needs to do
a total of 3/4.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.110
He's already done 1/4.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.331
So if you subtract
1/4 from the 3/4,

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.330
you're going to get this
amount right over here.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.260
You're going to get the amount
that he needs to practice.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.740
Now, this already has
the same denominator.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.850
So this is going to be
equal to 3 minus 1 over 4,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.814
which is equal to 2/4.

00:01:58.814 --> 00:02:00.230
And you see that
right over there.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.580
He still needs to practice 1
and 2 out of the fourths, 2/4.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.759
Now, 2/4, we know, is
the same thing as 1/2.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.595
There's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:12.970
You could say,
hey, look, this is

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.820
half of the length
of this entire thing.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.350
It has a little bit on
this end and that end.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:27.890
Or if you make 4 equal
blocks, and if you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.640
were to shade in
2 of them, you see

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.160
that you have shaded
in 1/2 of the blocks.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.990
This is the exact same
amount as if I just divide it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.140
into 2 sections and I
shaded in only 1 of them.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.160
2/4 is the same thing as 1/2.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.160
And if you wanted to work
it out mathematically,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.180
you just have to
do the same thing

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.790
to the numerator
and the denominator.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.540
So let's divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.576
by 2, because they are
both divisible by 2.

00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:54.450
That's actually their
greatest common factor.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.560
So 2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.472
4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:00.680
So what fraction of an hour
does he need to practice?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.440
He's got to practice
1/2 an hour.
