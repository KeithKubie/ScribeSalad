00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.270
In every cell in your body, you have almost

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.870
2 meters worth of DNA that fits inside the nucleus.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.240
Cells are very small, they're not measured in meters, they're

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.160
measured in micrometers. So how in the world, is 2

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.970
meters of DNA going to fit into such a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.960
small space. I want you to think about this question,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.710
how does so much DNA fit into such small space?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.750
And I want you to write any ideas that you

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.530
have in this text box here. Don't worry about

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.950
getting this question right or wrong. I really just want

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.970
you to think about how so much DNA can

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.690
fit, and write your ideas in this text box here.
