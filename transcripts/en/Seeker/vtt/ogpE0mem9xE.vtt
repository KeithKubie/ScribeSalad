00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.260
Crossing the Pacific
to raise awareness for ocean health

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.080
may have more in common with a long-term space mission than you'd think.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.640
BEN: Even if it's high seas and lots of 
waves in the water,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.500
I'm just bobbing up and down like a little cork,
and I don't feel the motion of the ocean, really.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
I can imagine that it's close to what
they would feel in space.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.620
Long-distance swimmer Ben Lecomte is spending
eight hours a day in the water,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.620
meaning his body will likely experience similar effects
to an astronaut in spaceflight–

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.080
particularly, the rapid atrophy of his bones.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.140
ADRIAN: If you put somebody in the water and they're just buoyant, that's just like being in space.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.220
The body, in both cases, has almost zero

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.340
gravity effects on the musculoskeletal system.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.780
And the normal response of the skeleton is, when you put it in disuse, it begins to remodel and get rid of it.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.260
The astronauts have shown consistent losses

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.460
of 1-1.5% a month.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.980
Clinically, to a doctor looking at somebody who's gonna lose that kind of mass... they'd be concerned.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.860
Scientists at NASA have been trying to combat this deterioration for decades,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.580
But this requires detailed research on how the skeleton responds to low gravity –

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.960
a tall order for your typical earth-bound science lab.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.100
One surprising way to simulate zero-g
is using swimming pools.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.880
Now, scientists have an entire ocean to work with, as Ben's swim is providing researchers

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.180
an unparalleled opportunity to study 
human physiology at its limits.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.580
PAUL: It's also a risk that Ben's taking,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.700
being in the ocean for that long every day, something that no one has ever done before.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.340
We don't know, what are the consequences
on the human body?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.160
BEN: In the water, it's totally different. It's a feeling
of not feeling your body at all...

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.720
I don't feel the gravity.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.120
ADRIAN: It's very rare than anybody spends 
months in the water.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.620
Because of the lack of forces, you'd lose bone just like they do in spaceflight.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.054
I thought, 'well, this would be a good opportunity to do some bone measurements

00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:22.860
where somebody's been in the water for that long.'

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.160
Pre- and post-swim, Adrian and his lab made plans to collect information on Ben's total lean mass

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.380
and body fat percentage, and conduct 
Dual X-ray Absorptiometry,

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.080
or DXA scans, on his spine, hip, and heel bone.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.960
Ben's data may confirm findings that astronauts suffer the most damage to weight-bearing structures,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.460
like the calcaneus, or heel bone, and their entire skeleton's spongy internal architecture

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.420
also known as trabecular bone.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.300
ADRIAN: We did find, in one of our studies,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.640
that the trabecular bone is lost

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.240
at about twice the rate as the overall bone.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.220
Those trabeculae are like struts on a bridge.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.640
Once you lose that connectivity, 
it's very difficult to recover that.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.220
But recovering this loss, and preventing it in the first place, is one of NASA's most urgent concerns...

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.940
especially if long-term spaceflight is ever
to become a reality.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.340
Current strategies have focused on exercise and pharmaceuticals.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.020
ADRIAN: They have recently put a device up there called Advanced Resistive Exercise Device,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.520
and this allows the astronaut to put
very high loads on their skeleton,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.600
as you would on  Earth.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.260
If you add a bisphosphonate to that,
an anti-resorptive drug,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.300
you pretty much can protect the bone mass. The problem is each of those things have their downside.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.180
Too much strenuous resistive exercise, and an astronaut runs a high risk of getting injured;

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.620
Too heavy a drug regimen and they're subject to unwanted side-effects.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.520
ADRIAN: Ben, he's doing aerobic activity all day.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.200
The question is, would that be enough to protect the skeleton? If it doesn't, that means that no amount

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.520
of aerobic activity in space is ever going to work.
If it does, it may lead the researchers

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.600
to come up with a better protocol
to protect the skeleton.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.140
If we ever need to live in a harsh environment like space, protecting our bodies will be crucial.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.500
But if we can better protect our ocean's health 
here on Earth,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.240
living in space may not have to be our only option.
