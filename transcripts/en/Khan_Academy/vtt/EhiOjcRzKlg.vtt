00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:03.432
(laughter)

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:06.626
(patriotic music)

00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:08.574
Hi, I'm Sal, founder of the Khan Academy.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:11.578
- And I'm Kim, Khan Academy's
U.S. History fellow.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:14.348
- And it being July, the
month of our nation's birth,

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:15.841
as well as an election year,

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.306
a kind of not-so-exciting election year,

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.498
we thought we would spice
things up a little bit

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:25.422
by creating a crowdfunding
campaign to sponsor

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:29.426
American history and government
content on Khan academy.

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:31.396
The goal is to answer all
the questions you might have

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:32.985
about our history and our government.

00:00:32.985 --> 00:00:35.445
Anything from what's an executive order,

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:37.187
to how the Supreme Court works.

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:40.753
But to make it happen,
we need your support.

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:42.999
It'll help you learn, but even more,

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.694
it'll help your fellow citizens learn,

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:46.011
so that we can have a deeper, richer,

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.686
and more spirited democracy.

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:50.180
- So help us make history at Khan Academy

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.647
with our very first crowdfunding campaign

00:00:52.647 --> 00:00:56.395
to create education by the
people, for the people.

00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:58.716
- So Kim, you've got a
PhD in American History,

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:01.344
and you create and curate
a lot of our content,

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:02.846
what are we gonna do as
part of this campaign?

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:04.897
- Well, I think what's exciting
about what we're doing here,

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:08.220
is that this is going to
be a easy to understand,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.951
completely non-partisan way for people

00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.999
to learn more about our government,

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:15.624
and to become engaged and active citizens.

00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:16.714
- Very exciting.

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:20.517
We're looking to raise
$300,000 by July 28th,

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:22.197
and to put that in perspective,

00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:24.119
the content we're going
to create is going to have

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.605
more information than all of
the political ads combined,

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:29.578
for a very small fraction of the cost.

00:01:29.578 --> 00:01:31.153
And shortly after that, we're gonna start

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:34.155
putting the content up, that
Kim and I and others create,

00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:36.622
to answer all of your questions.

00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:39.164
- You can also get some
amazing Khan Academy swag

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:42.489
and perks by backing us here on Indiegogo.

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:45.322
- We look forward to your support.
