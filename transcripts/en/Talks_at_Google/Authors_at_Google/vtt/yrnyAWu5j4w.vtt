MAX MEDNIK: Thanks a lot
for coming, you guys.

00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:05.450
We have our guest
today, Donnie Eichar.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.920
He's an award-winning
director, producer, and author.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.970
"Dead Mountain,"
Donnie's first book,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.310
examines the Dyatlov
Pass incident,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.210
a mystery that has
confounded investigators

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.550
and inspired speculation
for over 50 years.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.070
As the first author to
retrace the Dyatlov hikers'

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.880
fateful footsteps in 1959, the
first person outside of Russia

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.340
to go to the Dyatlov
Pass in the winter,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.820
and the first person to
extensively interview

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.610
Yuri Yudin, the only surviving
hiker, before his death

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.090
earlier this year,
Eichar takes readers

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.940
through gripping, unpublished
material and photographs;

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.510
extensive, exclusive interviews;
first-person investigations;

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.230
and finally reveals
the true story

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.400
of what happened
at Dead Mountain.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.990
In addition to "Dead Mountain,"
Eichar recently produced

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.610
18 episodes of the
groundbreaking MTV documentary

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.799
series, "The Buried Life."

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.340
He and his team took the show
from the front page of the "New

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.270
York Times" to Oprah's
couch and shooting hoops

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.580
with President Obama.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.070
Come help me welcome
Donnie to Google.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.264
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:08.305
DONNIE EICHAR: Thank you.

00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:09.650
Glad to be here.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.450
MAX MEDNIK: So tell
us, Donnie, how did you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.680
become interested in
this case overall?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.890
DONNIE EICHAR: Well,
about four years ago, I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.890
was writing a project in
Idaho, a scripted project,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.880
and was actually
procrastinating,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.450
which I know none
of you guys do here,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.990
and I happened upon this story.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.230
And what really intrigued
me right off the bat was,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.330
how was it that a group
of very experienced hikers

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.400
left a perfectly good tent
and walked a mile away

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.750
from the tent, not
sufficiently clothed,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.100
without the proper
footwear, and walked

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.470
to, basically, certain death?

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.180
So that central question is
really what pulled me in.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.020
And then as a
documentary filmmaker,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.780
I thought, what
about the hikers?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.410
We're talking nine hikers here.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.990
Originally there was 10.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.850
Who were they?

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.350
What's their story?

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.642
So I also wanted to get
their story as well.

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:20.560
MAX MEDNIK: Nice.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.750
When did you decide that
you had to go to Russia

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.140
to actually study this and
further your investigation?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.170
DONNIE EICHAR: Well, I
should go back and explain

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.230
the story really quick,
just in quick story beats.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.760
In January of 1959, the
height of the Cold War,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.500
there was a group of
hikers that set out.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.960
Most of them were
university students,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.820
and they were setting out for an
expedition in the northern Ural

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.780
Mountains.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.850
Midway through the trip,
there was one hiker

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.550
named Yuri Yudin who turned
back due to an illness,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.990
never knowing he wouldn't
see his friends again.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.360
So two weeks later, the
hikers never return.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.170
So they send out a rescue
team and a search team

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.610
to investigate
their disappearance,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.390
and they find the
tent at the campsite,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.920
but the tent is intact.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.120
All their clothing, all their
boots, everything inside,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.460
there's even food sitting
there that was uneaten,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.320
is still intact,
but there's a hole

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.710
from the inside leading out.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.870
And they later found the hikers
scattered over a mile away

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.790
from the tent.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240
All of them were
insufficiently clothed

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.030
for subzero temperatures.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.510
The majority of them didn't
have on the proper shoes.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.210
Some had violent injuries.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.300
One was missing a tongue.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.740
So again, what baffled me is
how could it be over 50 years

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.950
and nobody understands or
has figured out the events

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.720
leading to their deaths.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.310
So I started
researching everything

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.980
I possibly could here.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.720
Googled like crazy.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.490
And I only came up with a
certain amount of information

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.520
that I didn't feel was
sufficient, so I thought,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.880
how can I further this story,
further my investigation?

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.089
So I found a man by the
name of Yury Kuntsevich

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.709
in Russia who's the head
of the Dyatlov Foundation.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.319
Called him with the
translator, and he

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:25.990
didn't me from anybody else, and
we talked for like 20 minutes.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.000
And he really didn't
give me much information,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.330
but in the end he
said, if you really

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.040
want to know more about
this story, come to Russia.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.520
So I hung up the phone.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.310
I thought, oh shit.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.060
He just basically-- it
was almost like a summons,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.560
you know.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.060
So I talked to my girlfriend,
who was seven months pregnant

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.700
at the time, which isn't the
best time to go to Russia.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.325
And she said, you got to go.

00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:57.450
So basically, I had two
people saying I have to go,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.680
so I actually had to go.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.940
And I jumped on a
plane, and I had

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.600
no idea what I
was stepping into.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.400
When I got there,
to Yekaterinburg,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.370
I lived with Yury
Kuntsevich and his family

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.660
and ended up uncovering a
trove of materials, the hikers'

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.710
journals, the hikers' recovered
photos, the criminal case,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.030
which the attention to detail
back then was extraordinary.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.660
And I also started to get
introduced to the friends

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.960
and family of the hikers
and the search teams

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.610
and started to interview them.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.910
And that's when the
story began to feel real.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.800
It was no longer a myth
or a rumor or this thing

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.700
that I didn't understand, and
it started to become real to me

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.294
at that point.

00:05:46.294 --> 00:05:47.002
MAX MEDNIK: Nice.

00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:48.740
What was it like
actually interviewing

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.448
some of the family
members of the hikers?

00:05:52.814 --> 00:05:54.480
DONNIE EICHAR: It was
a great experience

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.620
because that's when
I knew I had a story.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.245
And I started learning about
the hikers that-- you know,

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:03.780
it was the height of the
Cold War, but some of them

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.690
were poets.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.570
Some of them were musicians.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.120
And they were these
gentlemen adventurers,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.790
and there was this
sense of innocence

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.800
that existed that I don't
think exists anymore today.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.780
And they would go
off into the woods

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.400
for pure escapism
and sometimes just

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.790
to recite forbidden poetry,
if you can imagine that,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.500
or just to play songs
that are forbidden.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.220
They would memorize
hundreds of songs.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.290
So this great story
started to materialize,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.500
and I became as
interested in the hikers

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.640
as I was the actual
tragedy itself.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.560
But as I was interviewing
the search and rescue teams,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.360
I was also putting
together the story

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.800
of the investigation
and all the details

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.150
that followed with that.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.030
MAX MEDNIK: Wow.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.380
Tell us about the hikers.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.640
Did they actually have
sufficient experience

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.690
and skills to actually
go on such a trip?

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.550
DONNIE EICHAR: The hikers
were very experienced, highly

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.120
educated.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.530
Most were engineers.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.240
These weren't
university students

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.950
going out, getting
drunk, partying.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.660
They were doing it for all the
right reasons in my opinion,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:27.240
and they were actually working
towards a class 3 hiking

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.610
license, which is the
equivalent of a master of sport,

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.100
and they were at level 2.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.030
So they would have to cover
a certain amount of area

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.420
and do a certain
amount of things

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.003
in order to get this
level 3, and that

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:44.190
was what their final expedition
was into the northern Ural

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.760
Mountains.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.020
And they specifically
would challenge themselves

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.380
and put themselves in
dangerous situations

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.020
and extreme situations
in subzero temperatures

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.770
in remote areas simply for the
task of challenging oneself.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.220
And they would also
chart uncharted areas

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.972
for Google Maps
and all that stuff.

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:07.930
So they would go out
there and actually collect

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.720
data for their university
and come back and give it

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.060
to them simply to
chart the area.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.140
So I found that really
compelling as well,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.320
just the innocence of it,
and just the camaraderie.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.330
And as I said, they were kind
of like these Jack London type

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.610
characters, and they
were very respectful.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.530
And you know, there was love
interest within the group,

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.659
but they were gentlemen,
and there was two girls.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.220
They would never show
that love interest

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.299
because the goal was
to conquer the distance

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:47.970
and not let any other
personal stuff get in the way.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.240
So I just, I really admire that.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.819
I thought that's pretty great.

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:53.860
MAX MEDNIK: Why do you
think that Yuri Yudin, who

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.820
was the only survivor, who
hadn't spoken for so long,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.954
would talk to you, who was an
American from who knows where?

00:09:00.954 --> 00:09:01.790
DONNIE EICHAR: Yeah.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.810
Yeah.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.520
Yuri Yudin.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.000
Wow.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.940
Yuri Yudin was the
only surviving hiker,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.820
that turned back halfway,
never saw his friends again.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.370
He had alluded, journalists and
reporters for over 50 years,

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:22.690
and I had always wondered,
does he have survivor's guilt?

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.430
But I knew he held the
answers to the stories

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.870
in between the hikers'
journals and all the photos,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.340
and he's the only one that
could tell that story.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.180
So ignorantly, I thought
somehow I could find him.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.390
And after two years, I thought,
I'm not going to find him.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.810
But on my second trip there,
I found out that he was there.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.410
And big moment for
me, and I'm going in,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.670
and I finally sit down to
do an interview with him,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.930
and the translator's late.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.000
So we just sat there and
had tea for 40 minutes

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.710
and stared at each other, and
I couldn't talk to the man.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.490
And finally, the
translator shows up,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.920
and the first
question he says is,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.050
don't you have mysteries
in your own country?

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.350
DONNIE EICHAR: So I'd
come all this way,

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.480
and he hits me
with that question,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.660
and totally not
prepared for that.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.030
And he had a good point.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.820
Of course, we've
got mysteries here.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.030
Why do I care?

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.950
I'm not Russian.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.920
But he told me to turn off
my Cold War tape recorder,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.590
so I turned that
off, and then he

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.460
proceeded to interview
me for a good 40 minutes

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.240
before I could interview him.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.530
But once that trust
was established,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:46.260
he opened up over two weeks
and told me his personal story,

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.530
his background, his childhood.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.140
And told me this story
about these hikers

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.150
and these expeditions
that they would do,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.590
and it was sort of like
this sort of cold weather,

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.180
motorcycle diaries
style adventures

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.080
that they would have.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.280
And in this final
expedition, they

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.370
stopped at his school to
tell stories and sing music.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.200
And they stopped at a
wood-cutting settlement

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.900
and stayed up all night,
not partying and drinking,

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.290
but playing music
and reciting poetry.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.910
And to me, I was just shocked.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.630
I had no idea that was going on.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.170
So he was such an
important part of the book,

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.330
to be able to fill all that in.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.950
And it was really endearing.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.370
Every night he would say
to me, I'm praying for you.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.240
And he was praying
for me because he

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.750
was worried about me
going on this expedition.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.496
And it was very endearing,
but it was also scary as hell.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.162
And I would lay down
at night, because I

00:11:46.162 --> 00:11:48.130
would think, why is
this guy praying for me?

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.490
Is it really that dangerous?

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.660
I know it's remote, but.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.950
It was an honor for
me to interview him

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.810
and that he gave me his
story of all people.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.490
And unfortunately,
ended up dying shortly

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.690
after I interviewed him.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:12.170
So I consider that a
small piece of history

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.771
that, for some reason,
he told me about.

00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:21.154
MAX MEDNIK: How do you think
you were able to get his trust?

00:12:21.154 --> 00:12:22.320
DONNIE EICHAR: I don't know.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.760
I think part of it was,
just crazy American, went

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.900
all that way to go over
there and to give it a shot

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.790
and to try to get him to talk.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.280
And I think maybe, too,
it was I wasn't as focused

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.370
about the tragedy
as I just wanted

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.130
to know about his
friends and who

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.430
they were as people,
not Russians,

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.880
not-- it doesn't matter the
Cold War, just who were they

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.380
as people?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.610
Tell me stories
about them because I

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.620
wanted to be able to develop
a relationship with them,

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.600
as well as the readers
to be able to develop

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.350
a relationship with
them, because you have

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.380
to care about them
in order to want

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.029
to be a part of this story.

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:07.570
MAX MEDNIK: What
was it like actually

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.430
retracing the hikers' journey?

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.560
DONNIE EICHAR: Well, I
got to a certain point

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.980
where I figured out if I'm
truly going to tell this story,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.340
I have to literally
and figuratively walk

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.340
in their footsteps,
so I decided I'm

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:30.230
going to retrace their
footsteps the best I could.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.430
And it was a surreal
experience because years ago I

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.230
grew up in Florida-- I've
been in Southern California 17

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.890
years-- I would never
imagine I would be there

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:46.840
at the gateway of Siberia in
25 below zero, and for what?

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.790
I didn't really
know at that point.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.370
But to be able to go to those
places, to go to the school,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.160
and to go to Ivdel, where all
the gulags were that they wrote

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.302
about in their
diaries, and to go

00:13:58.302 --> 00:14:02.560
to Ushma, which is a
Mansi village where

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.850
the indigenous people live.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.020
They were right near there.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.140
And to basically
go from their dorm

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.610
to the place on the mountain top
where they had set their tent,

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.440
for me, personally,
was extraordinary.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.070
And one big thing
that I realized,

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.120
you could see in the
trailer, is to walk

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.580
a mile is extremely difficult
in daylight with the best gear

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.990
I could possibly buy to be
warm because the terrain

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.540
there, it goes from
a few inches of snow

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.090
to this much snow
in a footstep, so

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.330
it's very, very hard to walk.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.580
And to think that these hikers
left their tent at night,

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.810
insufficiently clothed
without footwear,

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.870
and walked a mile,
that's when I thought,

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.500
wow, this had to
have been something

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.020
that they thought it was
safer to leave the tent

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.570
than to stay in the tent.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.290
But to also just stand there
and look down into the cedars

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.010
where they died.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:06.670
And it was an extraordinary
experience for me,

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.672
and hopefully that's what
I've portrayed in the book.

00:15:11.672 --> 00:15:12.380
MAX MEDNIK: Nice.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.539
Did you have some people
locally help you or escort you

00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:17.580
during any of the hiking?

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:17.930
DONNIE EICHAR: I did.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.138
I had Yury Kuntsevich, who
is the head of the Dyatlov

00:15:20.138 --> 00:15:25.130
Foundation, and two other
people that came along,

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.970
Vladimir [? Borsnakov,
?] who is a scientist.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.930
All the people were a little
bit in their golden years,

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.170
so that was kind of interesting
going with those guys.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.860
And Yuri Yudin
didn't come along,

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.370
which, again, kind
of worried me a bit.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.090
But he just said,
farewell, and had

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:49.180
that look like, I may
not see you again.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.070
But you know, it was
a great experience.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.220
My first trip to
Russia, they made me

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.500
an honorary Boy
Scout before I left.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.170
And it may not sound like a
big thing here-- I wasn't a Boy

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.910
Scout-- but I was in tears
because they gave me a pin

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.070
and taught me the handshake,
and it was a real honor.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.970
So that was a continuation,
when I did the expedition,

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.990
of the camaraderie.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.050
And I put my life
in their hands,

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.790
and I had a one-year-old at
home on that second expedition.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:28.510
So I, by no means, climbed
to the top of Mount Everest,

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.240
but where I went
was very remote,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.747
and if something happens
there, I'm 30 hours away

00:16:33.747 --> 00:16:35.330
from the nearest
third-world hospital.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:42.370
So I put my trust in their hands
and in your fellow human being,

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.770
and it was a great experience.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.910
My translator on the trip wasn't
that great, so a lot of times

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.930
I didn't really know what
the hell was going on.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.420
And I had my camera,
my video camera,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.110
and I would flip the
screen backwards.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.090
And it sounds maybe a bit weird,
but through the experience

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.850
I would just talk
into the screen

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.540
and just see myself, but just
have someone to connect with.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.579
And I later showed
it to my girlfriend,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.050
and she's just
like, wow, I don't

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.675
know if I would show
some of this stuff

00:17:11.675 --> 00:17:13.536
to people because
it looks like you're

00:17:13.536 --> 00:17:15.119
losing your mind,
talking to yourself.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.849
But you know, I just
needed a connection

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:20.160
to talk as I'm going
through all this

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.670
because a lot of times I
couldn't really talk to people.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.010
So it was cool.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.917
MAX MEDNIK: That
sounds super intense.

00:17:26.917 --> 00:17:29.500
It sounds like through a lot of
the interviews and your travel

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.290
you got a pretty deep sense
for just Russian culture

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.380
and a lot of interesting
parts of Russian history

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.350
because you talked to
a lot of people who'd

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.080
gone through an
experience with much

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.710
different eras of
Russian history.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.010
Are there some interesting
takeaways or things

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.390
that really stuck with
you, not necessarily

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:53.205
related to the story of the
incident, but just in general?

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:55.330
DONNIE EICHAR: Well, you
know, I bought these boots

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.227
before I left called
Arctic Pro, and I

00:17:57.227 --> 00:17:58.810
don't want to give
away the companies.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.976
I don't want to bag on them.

00:17:59.976 --> 00:18:04.810
But these boots, before I
left I was so confident.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.500
They were supposed to be for
50 below zero temperatures.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.165
And I went and had lunch
with my two friends,

00:18:10.165 --> 00:18:11.632
and I made him try on the boots.

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:13.090
And I'm like, I'm
going to be fine.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.690
Look at these boots.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.320
So I get there to
Russia, and they

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.454
called them elephant boots,
and they were laughing at them.

00:18:20.454 --> 00:18:21.870
And they had these
things, I think

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.320
they're called
valentis, valenkis.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.450
And it's just basically
a wool covering

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.577
that looks like a woolly
mammoth foot or something.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.910
It's the craziest-looking thing.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.300
But they wanted
me to wear those,

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.580
and I insisted to wear
my Arctic Pro boots.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.100
So we're out there and
my feet start sweating

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.970
because they're not breathing,
and I feel my two toes start

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.930
to freeze together.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.300
And I'm like, uh-oh, I
think I have a problem.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.030
And you know, you can't take
your boots off, really, in 25,

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.570
30 below zero.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.530
So I said to Vladimir, through
the translator roughly,

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.450
I have a problem.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.680
My toes are freezing together.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.130
And he said, welcome to Siberia.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.930
DONNIE EICHAR: So
the end takeaway,

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.160
to answer your question,
is when in Russia,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.850
listen to the
Russians because they

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.280
know what they're talking about.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.988
MAX MEDNIK: Nice.

00:19:20.988 --> 00:19:23.320
That's good advice.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.860
Talk about your
process in actually

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.170
putting the book together.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.870
DONNIE EICHAR: Well, after
my second trip to Russia,

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.480
I came back.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.270
The interesting thing was I'd
never even had a book deal.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:41.620
On my second trip, I financed
the expedition on my own,

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.330
spent all my savings, which,
again, I had a one-year-old,

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.990
no book deal, going to Russia,
dropped all the savings.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.470
But I got back, and I got
the book deal luckily.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.000
And I put together
this command center

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.920
of sort of all the
photos inside my garage,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.520
and I put a timeline of
all the hikers' photos

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.640
and all the criminal case
photos, search and rescue,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.920
and put it in
chronological order,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.771
and just started working out the
story from all the interviews I

00:20:11.771 --> 00:20:12.270
had done.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.850
And then I started interviewing
Russian scholars and survival

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:26.510
experts, avalanche experts, and
going through every true theory

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.090
that might have happened
and ruling them out

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.210
until I had nothing,
and freaked out

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.320
because I didn't have
an end to the book.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.270
And I went and met with
scientists at NOAA in Colorado,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.830
and they helped me to
push through and find

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.790
a good conclusion
without losing my mind.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.750
MAX MEDNIK: Nice.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.840
Speaking of
conclusions, what really

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.400
did happen to the hikers?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.147
DONNIE EICHAR: Well--

00:20:57.147 --> 00:20:57.688
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:57.688 --> 00:21:00.028
Anybody who wants to read the
book, get out of the room now.

00:21:00.028 --> 00:21:00.861
DONNIE EICHAR: Yeah.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.584
I'm a filmmaker primarily.

00:21:04.584 --> 00:21:05.500
This is my first book.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.840
So I consider this
book like a film,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.355
so I can't give away the ending.

00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:11.271
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:11.771
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.010
DONNIE EICHAR: Yeah.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.890
And I'm not being coy
at all because I've

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.770
got a little flak
with some other things

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.260
like, how can you not tell us?

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.890
And I'm like, man,
I spent four years,

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.390
I can't just give
it away that easy.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.160
Like, read it.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.670
But I will say this.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.680
The lead investigator, Lev
Ivanov, his final conclusion

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.890
was an unknown compelling force.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.137
And that was the only case--

00:21:33.137 --> 00:21:34.470
AUDIENCE: An unknown what force?

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:35.870
DONNIE EICHAR: An
unknown compelling force.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:36.744
AUDIENCE: Compelling.

00:21:36.744 --> 00:21:37.900
DONNIE EICHAR: Hm-mmm.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:44.000
So that was the only case that
he ever had that was unsolved.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.450
And what I learned is that he
actually was pretty damn close,

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.640
considering he didn't have the
technology and the science.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.330
And the conclusion that I came
up with the scientists at NOAA

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:02.330
completely caught me off guard,
and I could have only arrived

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.960
at this conclusion
with modern science.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.000
So I would love to know
what you guys think,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.110
but I think it's a pretty
logical explanation.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.818
MAX MEDNIK: Nice.

00:22:14.818 --> 00:22:15.697
Thank you.

00:22:15.697 --> 00:22:17.530
We can open it up to
some of your questions,

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.122
and I have a handheld mic
that I'll give to you guys.

00:22:20.122 --> 00:22:21.830
AUDIENCE: Why did you
decide to undertake

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.336
an adventure like doing a book?

00:22:25.336 --> 00:22:28.204
Like, what motivated you?

00:22:28.204 --> 00:22:30.050
Did you have people
help fund it?

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.550
Why are you crazy
enough [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:36.625
all this time flying
around, to write a book?

00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:38.609
I want to hear your
story, your backstory,

00:22:38.609 --> 00:22:39.650
how you made this happen.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.920
DONNIE EICHAR:
Well, my backstory

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.340
and why I would do this, I'm
a bit ignorant and stubborn,

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.210
to be honest.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.260
But I also really wanted
to know about these hikers,

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.570
and I felt like there
has to be a story there

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.010
behind these 9, 10 hikers.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.300
So that's where the
root of it started.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.250
I have a documentary background,
and I have a personality

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.960
as well, as once
I get on something

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.890
I become a bit obsessive, which
isn't always a great thing.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.840
But for some reason, I
decided that I could at least

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.680
dispel all the false
theories in this

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.290
and highlight the
story of the hikers,

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:28.810
and I thought that people
would find it interesting.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.870
And also, the people
in Russia that

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.570
never knew what
happened, I never

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.330
thought I would give
them complete answers,

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.370
but I could shed a light on
a good possibility of what

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.770
happened, and maybe they could
have a little better closure

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:51.440
with their lives seeing
a factual account of what

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.170
happened to their loved ones.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.267
Why did you decide to
make it into a book

00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:59.320
rather than maybe trying
to pursue it as a--

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.780
DONNIE EICHAR: Sorry?

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.480
AUDIENCE: Why did you make it
into a book rather than, say,

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.090
decide to make a documentary
about it, like a film?

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.320
DONNIE EICHAR: Well,
on the first trip,

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.920
that was my full intention.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.320
I filmed everything
to make a documentary,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:22.770
but it's a very complex story,
and it's also a Russian story.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.900
So I wasn't quite
sure how I would

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.820
do that because I wanted
Westerners to know the story.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.320
I didn't want to just
make a documentary that

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.970
would be in Russian.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.730
But I started realizing
the story's so complex,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.570
I better do a book first and
get all the facts down and get

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:44.482
their stories down, and then I
have a platform to make a film.

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:46.440
AUDIENCE: How was this
all perceived in Russia?

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.530
Like, I think in the
trailer that you compare it

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.440
to the Kennedy assassination,
which is pretty infamous here.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.910
Are you now infamous in Russia?

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.060
Like, is this book being
translated to Russian?

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.532
What kind of story
is behind that?

00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:02.740
DONNIE EICHAR: Good question.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.920
First of all, it hasn't been
translated into Russian yet,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.480
so there really hasn't
been a response yet.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.120
The book's only been out
about 2 and 1/2 weeks.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.670
But the people that I
worked with there, there

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:21.870
was a big response while I was
doing it just because somebody

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.040
was out trying to separate
fact from fiction.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.620
Because from my understanding,
all the Russians

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.350
that I interviewed, they
have a complete distrust

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.490
of government there,
and pretty much everyone

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.810
thought the government
had covered something up.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.400
So they feared for
my safety as well,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.520
just carrying around
government documents and stuff.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.000
But as far as their response,
I don't know what it is yet.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.930
I only know in a
small community.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.720
But I'm really excited for
when the book is translated

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.840
into Russian to
get their response,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.730
and I hope it's well received.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:07.150
I did my best job I could of
telling an accurate story, one

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:11.480
that's not jaded, but one
that's also not perfect.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.300
As far as me going there
and solving a mystery,

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.180
it's not that.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.460
It's me going there as
an armchair investigator

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.210
and embedding myself and seeing
the story that presents itself.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.085
AUDIENCE: So what were
some of the conspiracy

00:26:25.085 --> 00:26:28.790
theories about this story?

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.346
DONNIE EICHAR: Theories, or
conspiracy theories, or both?

00:26:32.346 --> 00:26:33.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.390
DONNIE EICHAR: Yeah.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:42.725
Well, aliens, of course, because
you can never prove that.

00:26:42.725 --> 00:26:49.150
The top theories were
avalanche, that the hikers

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.860
had stumbled upon a
weapons testing area

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.920
that perhaps they shouldn't
have seen, the hikers had gone

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.800
to a religious site of the
local indigenous tribe there,

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.490
the Mansis, and the
Mansi killed them.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.185
There was even a story
that the CIA was involved.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:18.140
Another theory actually was that
people had escaped from a gulag

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.010
and went out there.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.190
But a lot of these
things, some of them

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.300
were a little bit more
simple, like the gulag.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.880
First of all, you're in
the middle of nowhere,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.620
and the nearest gulag
is 60 miles away.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:35.740
So they had, obviously,
fences there with barbed wire

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.360
and guards that
would shoot them.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.910
But this thing is, where
are you going to go?

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.910
You're in the middle of Siberia.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.170
If you leave that
compound, you're dead.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:50.770
So to think that prisoners
would go 60 miles on foot,

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:55.070
and then arrive at their tent
site and kill nine hikers,

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.760
for what?

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.940
So a lot of
theories, really when

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:03.950
I started to get into it
and the true facts of it,

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.200
I could cross them
off pretty quickly.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.090
But maybe I forgot
to mention, there

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.680
were light orbs seen
in the sky, and this

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.030
was in the criminal case file.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.740
And that was one of the
other things that I thought,

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.000
uh-oh, OK.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.400
I don't believe in
UFOs, but there's

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.040
30 people interviewed
that all saw

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.190
light orbs on the same days,
and there's something there.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:32.250
So I dug into it deeper, and I
explained what those light orbs

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.720
were in a logical
fashion through science.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.707
So you know, it was
frustrating at times

00:28:40.707 --> 00:28:42.290
because there were
all these theories,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.450
but once I started
clearing them out,

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.563
the real frustrating thing
was I got nothing, you know.

00:28:48.563 --> 00:28:55.187
And then working with
NOAA was just a godsend.

00:28:55.187 --> 00:28:56.270
That answer your question?

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:56.600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.350
DONNIE EICHAR: OK.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.560
AUDIENCE: So I haven't
read this book yet,

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.884
but, you know, we obviously
know it's the Blair Witch.

00:29:01.884 --> 00:29:04.214
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.214 --> 00:29:05.630
AUDIENCE: Can you
at least tell us

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.046
what happened to
the guy's tongue?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.210
DONNIE EICHAR: Sure.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.830
This was one of the things
that drew me in as well.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.390
There was a girl named
Luda, and she was actually

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.040
the outspoken one of the group.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.050
So some would say her
tongue was cut out

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:30.554
because she spoke too much
as a warning to other people,

00:29:30.554 --> 00:29:31.470
don't talk about this.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.620
We'll cut your
tongue out as well.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.980
But the fact of the matter
is she fell into a ravine,

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.390
and she was upside
down in the ravine.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.550
She was there for
quite a long time.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:49.020
And the snow starts to
melt, and there's a stream.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.880
So she's upside down, and
that's the part of her body

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.820
that's in the stream.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.100
And there's little organisms
that are in the stream,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.350
for sitting that
long, that eat away

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.940
the fleshy parts of the face.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.990
And the tongue is very
fleshy, so that's what it was,

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.630
the microbes.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.870
AUDIENCE: Why did you feel
compelled to find a conclusion?

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.670
When all other
theories had failed,

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.779
why did you feel that you
had to come to a conclusion?

00:30:19.779 --> 00:30:21.820
Like say, for example, in
the movie "The Zodiac,"

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.330
you didn't see a conclusion,
other than, oh, here's

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.340
this book that we never solved.

00:30:28.376 --> 00:30:30.250
DONNIE EICHAR: Well,
that's a great question.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.380
You know, I was sort of on
auto pilot at a certain point.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.360
I've got the hikers story, and
I put the whole criminal case

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.670
into a linear fashion so
it unfolded as a story.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.660
So what do you do from there?

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.400
And that's when I started ruling
out all the different theories,

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.480
working with scientists
and different experts.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.060
So by process of elimination,
I eventually reach a point

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:02.170
where I've proven these
theories don't work,

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.240
so the only logical
thing to do then

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.200
is to try to crack it
and try to find it.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.590
I, by no means, started
off doing this thinking,

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.930
I'm going to crack this
50-plus-year-old mystery,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.140
but I thought I'm going to
damn sure give it a try.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:24.070
And the way it's
presented in the book,

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:27.330
I'm not saying this is it.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:28.360
This is the end all.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.430
It's here is my theory.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.180
And a group of
scientists, we agree

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.320
this is perhaps what happened.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.886
And there's a recreation at the
last chapter of the book that

00:31:41.886 --> 00:31:44.570
puts everything
together, sort of a la

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.000
"Usual Suspects," where you
see all these things that maybe

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.870
didn't make sense, hopefully
make sense of that final night.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:58.420
And you decide for
yourself, is this it?

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.400
But we'll never absolutely know.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.590
There is one thing we
could do is go to the site

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:09.320
and test it with science,
which would be great.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320
I would love to do that.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.420
So that's something,
perhaps, in the future.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.090
But I didn't want
to present a theory

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.840
in the end or a conclusion
that didn't leave

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.280
any questions for
people to question it.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.250
Ideally, you read the book.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.540
Another person reads the book.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.450
You go have a beer,
and you debate it.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.710
Some things you might
agree with, some you don't.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.530
But it is presented
factually, and that

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.898
was my goal is to separate
fact from fiction.

00:32:37.898 --> 00:32:40.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] at NOAA,
the scientists you worked with.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.800
Can you tell us a
little more about that?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.740
DONNIE EICHAR: Yeah.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.380
Funny enough, I literally
was left with nothing,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:57.490
and I sent an email
to Dr. Bedard at NOAA,

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.240
and he agreed to meet with me.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.580
And it's a
government-owned agency,

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.050
so security is
pretty tight there.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.280
But funny enough, when I arrived
there to meet with all my data

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.610
and all my materials, there
was six Russians there,

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.250
you know, all these
Russian scientists.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.516
And they were all
really curious as well,

00:33:16.516 --> 00:33:18.890
and I think that's the only
reason why they ended up even

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.060
working with me because they
had a Russian background.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.410
And once again, why
does this American care?

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.610
So we just started going
through everything,

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.600
and I was nervous going
there because I was worried

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.540
they were going to not
find anything either.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.390
And I thought I had a
theory that was out there,

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:39.840
but-- trying not to
give away the theory.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.270
But they went through the
process of elimination as well,

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:47.781
and they were extremely
helpful, and I

00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:49.280
was honored to work
with those guys.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.870
I'm no scientist, you know,
and to be there working

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:58.420
with them and them giving
me the time for a book,

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.550
it was amazing.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.950
And it was a really
great experience

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.430
and a humbling experience too.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:08.550
These guys dedicate themselves
to some pretty extraordinary

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.439
things.

00:34:09.439 --> 00:34:10.379
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:34:10.379 --> 00:34:12.870
MAX MEDNIK: Any other questions?

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.409
If not, Donnie is happy to stick
around and sign some books.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.230
In the meantime, thanks
so much for coming.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.271
DONNIE EICHAR: Thank you.

00:34:18.271 --> 00:34:19.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:20.538
DONNIE EICHAR: Appreciate it.

00:34:20.538 --> 00:34:25.321
[APPLAUSE]
