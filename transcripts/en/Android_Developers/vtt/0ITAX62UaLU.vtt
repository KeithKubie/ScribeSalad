MARK BENNETT: My
name is Mark Bennett.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.730
And I'm actually very
new to Google Play.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.560
I only joined the business
in January this year.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.270
And well, what a
year's it's been.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.470
Play is a very
exciting business.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.050
I'm very humbled to see
some of those stories there.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.630
And we have a very busy,
packed agenda today--

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.619
some incredibly cool
stuff that you're

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.910
going to hear more about today.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.410
And my role is
pretty easy, really--

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.450
to talk about where Play and
Android are within the EMEA

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.570
region.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.320
So let's get started,
and we'll start

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.370
by talking about our
platform-- about Android, which

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.370
is growing exponentially
over the last seven years

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.750
since it was launched.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.890
And we announced an
amazing milestone that year

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.560
that we've passed 1 billion
active devices, which

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.204
is just an incredible number.

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:51.620
But what is also
a powerful number

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.350
is the 1.5 million activations
we are seeing every single day.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.310
And that's a reflection of the
success of, obviously, Android

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.900
on smartphones and
tablets, but also

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.060
as Android has
continued to expand

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.680
onto other platforms, such
as Android TV, wearables,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.750
and even into cars.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.160
And as that ecosystem
is expanded,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.670
so is the number of
OEMs we work with-- now

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.470
up to over 200 OEMs who are
developing for Android-- which,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.000
again, is a huge number.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.970
And then just to finish off the
ecosystem piece-- the operator

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.310
partnerships-- we're
working with carriers

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.650
across the world--
over 330 carriers

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.850
selling Android devices
and also enabling

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.840
Play customers to purchase.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.570
And then in terms of share,
it's an equally powerful story.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.340
We looked at the Android
share within the EMEA region

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.290
on smartphones.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.095
And the great news
here is that that share

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:51.970
has increased since last year.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.560
This is working with a research
company called Canalys.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.350
And that share's gone
up from 72% to 77%.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.800
So the momentum
is really with us.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.760
And the story's good
on tablets as well--

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.800
three out of five tablets
in EMEA now run on Android.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.170
So tremendous momentum.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.390
And the future's bright.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.610
The forecasts are
that smartphones

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.960
will double over
the next five years

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.940
to over 1.25 devices
in EMEA by 2019.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.400
And as you can see, the
lion's share of that growth

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.910
is going to come from Android.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.585
That's the big green
bit in the bar chart

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:32.950
there, in case you missed it.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.560
So a very exciting few
years ahead as Android

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.160
continues to expand
into new markets.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.470
And one area that is
particularly exciting

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.700
are these emerging markets.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.870
Last year we talked
about Android One.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.310
Our product director,
Michael Siliski,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.550
introduced this
initiative that Google

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.610
was leading to try and drive
Android share into emerging

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.710
markets-- even with all the
growth I just talked about.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.280
Only one out of four people on
this planet have a smartphone,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.730
and Google's ambition is
to help that next 5 billion

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.530
also come online.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.070
Android One is an
initiative-- we

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.080
work with OEMs,
chipset manufacturers--

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.760
to bring quality hardware
at a very low cost

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.480
into these emerging markets.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.970
And the exciting thing, or
the most interesting thing

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.910
for you guys, in
terms of Android One,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.930
is that the devices
have the latest

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.840
version of Android
on it, which we all

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.760
know is incredibly important.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.639
We announced last
year that we were

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.930
bringing Android One to market.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.330
And I'm delighted to say
that since then, we've

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.310
launched Android One in
India, Pakistan, Thailand,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.350
Indonesia, the Philippines,
Nigeria, and Turkey.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.870
And within EMEA, there's
significant continued expansion

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.130
as we bring Android One into
Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Spain,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.620
Morocco, and Egypt--
which I might have just

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.000
mentioned twice.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.120
But the growth is fantastic.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.530
And we're really excited to
see how Android One can bring

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.840
a really quality
experience at low cost

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.525
to even more users
in emerging markets.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.210
So this scale--
this huge scale--

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.559
I think it's safe to say,
we're the biggest app platform

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:16.100
in the world.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.230
Over 1 million apps
now live on the store.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.370
And they've been downloaded a
phenomenal 50 billion times.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.230
And Android users are
able to download your apps

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.400
in nearly 200 markets--
and importantly,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.240
to pay for those
apps in 134 markets.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.680
And payments, we know, is key.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.850
Over the last 12 months,
we've added 61 new forms

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.750
of payments in 32
markets, which has enabled

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.160
over 400 million Android
users to now purchase on Play

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.110
with a new form of payment.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.850
And we've expanded in
a number of key areas

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.430
to enable people to pay on
Play with different forms

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.090
of payment.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.050
DCB is now in 37 markets,
up from 25 markets in 2014.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.870
Just a couple of
weeks ago, we signed

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.810
a really big deal with a telco
called MTS in Russia that

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.530
now gives us virtually 100%
coverage for operated billing

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.920
in the Russian markets.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.350
Gift cards are now live in
28 markets, from 18 in 2014.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.800
And finally PayPal,
which we only switched on

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.652
early last year and is
now live in 21 markets.

00:05:29.652 --> 00:05:31.110
And in markets like
Germany, that's

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.120
been a phenomenal driver
to help our growth.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.020
And it was really pleasing to
see, in February this year,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.770
App Annie talk about Google
Play being bigger in Germany

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.540
than Apple's App store.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.690
So enabling payments helps
to enable the ecosystem.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.730
And the good news is it's
paying off for our developers--

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.050
for you guys.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.860
We announced that in 2014,
we paid out $7 billion

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.460
to our developer partners--
up from $5 billion in 2013,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.380
and up from $2 billion in 2012.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.680
And the momentum is still with
us with significant growth

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.180
as well.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.700
So a very, very
bright picture indeed.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.320
So you're going to
hear a lot today

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.270
about how we're continuing
to listen to you

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.810
and to build a better
platform for you

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.090
to distribute your apps, find
your users, and monetize.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.260
And I'm just going to touch on
three of the key themes today--

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.380
enhanced discovery
opportunities-- how

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.450
we can help you find those
users within the app-- more

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.620
tools to help you
publish with confidence,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.810
and making it easier to
help find and retain users.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.710
So let's start with
enhanced discovery.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.480
Play is about connecting
you with the Android

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.280
users that share the same
interests and passions

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.750
and needs as the products you're
building and taking to market.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.910
And a key part of what
we do is try and make

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.222
our store experience
personalized and relevant,

00:07:01.222 --> 00:07:03.680
so users keep coming in-- so
they're delighted that they're

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.740
finding the right apps and
games that really, really

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.140
excite them.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.220
And the first area is to make
that store very personalized.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.080
As we've started to really work
Google's expertise in machine

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.050
learning to make that a more
personalized experience--

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.320
to make those recommendations
come up as soon as a Play user

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.780
comes into the store.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.800
And we'll building more
types of collections

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.170
and increasing more types
of personalization services,

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.950
because we know that doubles
the number of app installs,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.770
by giving people
relevant recommendations.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.960
We've also added guided search.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.380
And this enables a Play
visitor to just search

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.210
for a broad generic term--
in this case, photography.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.960
And what we then do is provide
them with relevant clusters,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.820
bringing together
the types of apps

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.540
that you would expect
to see under a search

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.060
term like photography-- in
this case, photo editing

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.960
apps and collage apps.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.020
And we know that
will introduce users

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.400
to a broader range of apps, and
therefore, increasing downloads

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.450
in a particular
search term like that.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.950
And then finally,
an area that we're

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.700
quite interested in
seeing how it develops

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.900
is topic-based discovery.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.496
Our sense is that users relate
much better to topics rather

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:19.120
than like, here's
some more apps that I

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.750
think are recommended to you--
bringing together clusters

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.540
under types of searches
popular for the weekend,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.987
and games that are
going to make you laugh.

00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:30.570
And we think that
will have a lot more

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.230
engagement with our users
on the store as well.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.200
Families is a big
theme for Google.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.150
You would have seen a lot going
on within Google around making

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:45.130
our products and services more
relevant to families and family

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:45.810
safety.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.000
And that's absolutely the
case with Play, as well.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.840
Before [? I/O, ?] we started
working with many of you

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.660
guys around [INAUDIBLE]
and submission

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.105
to have your apps categorized
within the family experience.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.730
[? I/O ?] announced
that and you've now

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.160
seen this navigation appearing
within the store, allowing

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.450
parents to search by
different age categories,

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.180
by badges, even by
popular characters

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.250
to find the content
that's right for them

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.520
and right for the families.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.900
This is a really
big step for us.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.270
And we're seeing some
really huge numbers,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.650
in terms of increased uplift in
apps that are within the family

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.570
browsing experience.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.490
So if you have a family
app, please make sure it

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.210
is categorized within
this experience.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.700
And besides making it
easier for our users

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.360
to find great apps
and games, we've

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.980
continued to listen to
you and build better tools

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.510
to enable you to publish,
acquire users, and

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.890
and more importantly, learn how
you can improve your products

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.290
to retain those users.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.240
The list of tools and
features, you can see,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.630
has got longer and
longer, year after year.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.520
And you're going to hear a lot
more about really cool features

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.310
and functionalities that
we're bringing to market

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.100
to enable you to build better.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.630
And one of the
consistent things I've

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.130
heard in the few months
I've been in the business

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.420
as I've spoken to developers
is the power of Play

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.010
to iterate, to put products
into market quickly,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.730
to select groups of users,
and find out what's working

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.970
and what's not working
before you start

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.110
to spend money driving
acquisition to learn

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.380
the lessons around retention
before they come through.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.370
And there's just three
examples, before I

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.984
get kicked off the stage,
that I wanted to highlight.

00:10:39.984 --> 00:10:41.400
I had the pleasure
of going to see

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.270
the Wooga guys earlier on in the
year in their very cool offices

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.180
in Berlin.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.680
And I know a couple of
the guys are here today.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.060
Really pleasing to hear how
they're using beta testing,

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.390
staged rollouts-- again,
to learn more about

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.440
how users are enjoying the app
and where people are falling

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.100
out of their app as well.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.250
And it's great to hear that
they're iterating first

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.780
on Android.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.470
An app that you would've
seen in the video

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.190
at the beginning of today--
a really inspiring story

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.930
about Olivier, with RogerVoice,
to really revolutionize

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.050
telecommunications to allow
people who are hard of hearing

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.830
to have conversations.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.850
He's used-- exactly
the same as Wooga--

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.650
to iterate first
on the platform.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.840
And actually, he released
first on Android.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.380
And then, finally,
a great case study

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.100
from one of our developers
in Russia, my.com,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:37.030
with their great battle
game, Might and Glory.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.710
Super to see them
launch first on Android.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.430
So that's it from me.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.190
I hope you've got another sense
of the scale and the success

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.000
and the excitement
of Play on Android.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.620
The purpose of today is
to obviously give you

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.060
more information, but
also to listen to you

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.770
and to get more
feedback from how we can

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.920
make Play a better platform.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.676
So, with that, I look forward
to meeting as many of you

00:12:03.676 --> 00:12:04.770
as possible today.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.440
And thank you for listening.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.040
