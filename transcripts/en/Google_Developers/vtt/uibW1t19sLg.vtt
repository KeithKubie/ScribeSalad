JENNY MURPHY: Welcome to another
week of the Google+

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.050
platform office hours
on-air edition.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.840
This week, we're going to be
talking a little bit about the

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.230
new configuration options
currently in Publisher Preview

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.239
for the Google+ badge, the
second in line of our social

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.650
plug-ins for Google+.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.760
Before we dig in to that though,
let's do some quick

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.590
introductions.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.110
And I'll start.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.425
Hi.

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.070
I'm Jenny Murphy.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.620
I'm a developer programs
engineer here on the Google+

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.630
platform developer relations
team, which means I spend a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.550
lot of time getting kind of
down and dirty in the code

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.600
with you guys, whether it be
in forums, in office hours

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.030
like this, or in person
at events.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.250
So.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.160
JONATHAN BERI: Jonathan
Beri here.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.450
I'm a developer advocate on
Google+, also working with

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.750
Jenny on developer relations.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.456
You may have seen me speaking
at one of our many developer

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:56.620
events, GDD this past year or
upcoming ones like South by

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.615
Southwest.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:00:58.860
FRASER CAIN: I'm Fraser Cain.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.390
I'm the publisher of
Universe Today.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.040
And we've been using Google+
quite a bit for doing our

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.970
weekly Space Hangout, live
recordings of Astronomy Cast

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.020
and our virtual star parties,
where people can see images of

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.580
telescopes all live streamed
onto Google+.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.560
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.610
FRASER CAIN: Among
other things.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.580
JENNY MURPHY: You're
next, Allen.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.790
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I'm
Allen Firstenberg.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090
I'm a developer.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.960
Most of my development work with
Google+ has mostly been

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.450
focused around the
Hangout API.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.345
I've got a number of
different apps that

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:32.440
I'm working on there.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.400
I also do some app development
work for Android.

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.412
JENNY MURPHY: And you're
next, Abraham.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:41.070
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: Hi.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.490
I'm Abraham Williams. I'm a
front end developer and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.380
developer community manager
at a YC combinator

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.100
company called InboxQ.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.740
And I actually recently have
been working on a Chrome

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.510
extension that changes circles
in the Google+ UI to squares,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.476
just for a little bit of fun.

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:05.470
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.238
JONATHAN BERI: Nice.

00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:10.259
JENNY MURPHY: So a big part of
these hangouts is we answer

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.170
your questions live.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.020
But before we do that, I'm going
to talk a little bit

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.870
about the new exciting Google+
badge features that are

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.890
currently in Publisher
Preview.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.900
So I'm going to fire
up screen sharing.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.470
And you should be seeing,
momentarily, the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.365
reconfigurator for the
Google+ badge.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.640
So before we dig in to the new
features we've added, I'm

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.170
going to tell you a little bit
about the Google+ badge

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.565
overall just in case you're
not familiar with it.

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.500
The badge, as you can see it
right here, this little white

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.820
box, is a way of connecting
your website to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.620
your Google+ page.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.760
You insert this social plug-in
onto your website, and then it

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.050
links back to your
Google+ page.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.510
It also provides a single quick
way for people to add

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.960
your Google+ page to their
circles and easily follow you.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.110
And it also encapsulates all
the capabilities of the +1

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.415
button, which includes sharing
and all that neat stuff.

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:14.370
It has some other side
benefits, like

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.620
Google Direct Connect.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.860
But that's kind of a topic
that's beyond the scope of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.110
this introduction.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.740
But wait, there's more.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.920
In response to a lot of feedback
we've gotten on the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.360
badge, we've added some new
features which are currently

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.170
in Publisher Preview.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.640
So I'm going to scroll down and
show you there's this new

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.660
Advanced Options panel that will
soon be available on the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.380
Public Configuration tool.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.780
And it exposes some neat things
to make the badge fit

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.800
better into your website.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.310
The first and simplest
one is a dark layout.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.980
So we click on the dark
layout button, and

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.520
the badge turns black.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.060
So on your themes that are
darker and don't necessarily

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.902
have a white background,
the badge will

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.870
fit in a lot better.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.500
And if this is one thing that's
been preventing you

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900
from installing the badge,
it's a good time to start

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.055
investigating it.

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:05.710
There's one other cool
feature we've added.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.075
A lot of people said that the
badge doesn't fit well on

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:09.930
their website.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.020
So if you're the kind of person
who stays up at night

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.890
worrying about pixels, we
have a feature for you.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.459
The default width
is still 300.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.230
But we can go ahead and we
can change the width.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.250
And the badge will live
update above.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.530
And as you can see, the features
of the badge will

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.940
adjust to the size
you specify.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.290
So if we go down to 170 pixels,
say we wanted to fit

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.370
it in our little sidebar on our
website, it shrinks down

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.030
to a pretty small size.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.290
And all the other height
constraint features that were

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.040
available before are
still available.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.300
So we can shrink the
badge even further.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.210
So you can go anything from
the large 300 by 200 pixel

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.480
badge to the smaller 170 pixel
wide badge, which just shows

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.560
the following button, which
should give your users a great

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.630
experience.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.440
So as I mentioned, these
features are currently in

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.730
Publisher Preview, which is an
open sign-up program if you'd

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.500
like to start experimenting with
the new features today.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.020
I'll be adding a link to the
show notes when we're done.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.900
This is this form, which you
can see I brought up now.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.490
All you have to do is--

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.870
right there, and it will allow
you to add your account to the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.920
preview group so that you'll
be able to see the new

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.330
features as we roll them out
a few days ahead into the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.430
Publisher Preview group.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.230
But even if you're not
interested in that, these

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.270
features will be available
very soon.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.860
Preview group tends to
be pretty short.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.010
And we roll the features out
pretty quickly after that.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.722
So that's the new stuff
in the Google+ badge.

00:05:38.722 --> 00:05:39.972
Hope you find it useful.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.790
And here we are again.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.640
You can see our lovely
faces again.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.600
So now it's the part where we
start fielding your questions.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.450
So before we take it any
further, do you have any

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.935
questions lined up, Jonathan?

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.940
Jonathan's going to be reading
the questions for us today,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.490
and then the rest of us
will be fielding them.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.780
JONATHAN BERI: Not yet.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.910
JENNY MURPHY: Not yet.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.290
JONATHAN BERI: Why don't you ask
the guys in the hangout?

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.940
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.580
How about you guys?

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.020
Have you guys been up to
anything cool or have any

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.921
questions about--?

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.370
FRASER CAIN: One question that I
noticed in the list was, how

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.010
do you make the video
size larger?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.460
And that's sort of always the
first question that we get.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.900
And so there's sort of two
ways to go about that.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.580
One is that you can--

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.710
usually at this point someone
will have posted the raw video

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.530
feed into the comments.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.500
And then you can get that,
you can click that.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.495
And then you can press F11 and
then you get full screen.

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:44.450
The other thing you can do is
there's an extension called

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.530
Better Hangouts on Air.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.500
And if you install that, then
you'll get a bunch of little

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.420
buttons right underneath
the video.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.090
You can embed it.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.810
You can maximize it.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.690
And one of the things you can
do is pop the video out, and

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.530
you can expand it.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.040
So if you're wondering how to do
that, it's Better Hangouts

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.180
on Air is the extension.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.510
And it is always the first
question you get, is how do

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.786
you maximize it.

00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:06.910
JENNY MURPHY: So that's
something we should add as a

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.485
built-in feature, perhaps.

00:07:08.485 --> 00:07:11.380
FRASER CAIN: I would rec-- it
would save us all a lot of

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.405
time, yeah.

00:07:13.405 --> 00:07:14.806
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:07:14.806 --> 00:07:16.056
FRASER CAIN: Yeah.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.480
JENNY MURPHY: Anything
else coming in?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.600
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Do you want
to touch briefly on how the

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.210
badge relates to Direct Connect,
and how it relates to

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.820
the +1 button?

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.820
JENNY MURPHY: Sure.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.615
So let me pull up the--

00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:33.125
actually, I won't pull up
the screen sharing.

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:34.730
I'll just tell you about it.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.620
So the badge actually contains
the +1 button, which provides

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.960
some additional functionality
that's kind of under the

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.650
covers, behind the scenes.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.730
When you install the badge on
your site, it connects your

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:52.170
plus page to your website and
allows us to coalesce the +1s.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.670
Which means that the +1s that
appear on the badge and your

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.480
Google+ page are actually
the union of the--

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.425
so it's the sum, only counting
the overlap once, of all the

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:06.360
+1s that happen on your web
page as well as those that

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.650
happen on your Google+ page,
which is pretty cool.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.970
It also enables your website
to be available for Google

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.540
Direct Connect.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.880
So what is Google
Direct Connect?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.516
Let's take a look.

00:08:18.516 --> 00:08:20.300
We'll fire up screen
sharing for this.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.150
So you see a Google search
page up there.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.440
Direct Connect, once we've
discovered that you have the

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.780
badge installed, the algorithm
will determine

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.159
[? when is the ?] time to
set up Direct Connect.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.370
And once it has, you get these
cool shortcuts available.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:53.190
So if you search for Plus
Android, we can see that

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.525
Android's Google+ page
is the first result.

00:08:55.525 --> 00:08:58.310
And it gets a neat little
icon and stuff.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.220
The plus sign is the indicator
that someone using Google

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.656
search is doing a Direct
Connect query.

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:07.860
When they click on that, some
special behavior opens up.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.010
Rather than listing a search
result, it brings up their

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.760
Google+ page immediately.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.130
And if I'm not following them
already, it will actually

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.660
prompt me to follow them.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.570
So this is a great way, you
can just tell people, just

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.520
search for + my brand name.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.870
So for my example site, + Baking
Disasters on Google.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.710
And it will immediately bring up
your Google+ page, which is

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.240
pretty cool.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.121
It's a great way to drive
people to that site.

00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:36.852
JONATHAN BERI: So we
got a question.

00:09:36.852 --> 00:09:40.502
Can I have a badge for my
Google+ profile, or does it

00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:42.320
only work on pages?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.540
JENNY MURPHY: That's
a great question.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.690
Right now, the badge only works
on Google+ pages, which

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.580
are intended for non-person
entities, in general--

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.410
organizations, businesses,
or celebrities,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.635
potentially, athletes--

00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:02.202
which are people but they're
special because their page is

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:05.570
often managed by multiple
people.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.450
But the badge does
not currently

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.140
work for profile pages.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.450
But we've heard this a lot.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.565
And we're trying to think
of how we want

00:10:12.565 --> 00:10:14.532
to accomplish this.

00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:16.280
FRASER CAIN: I've got one
question about this.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.420
Is there any connection between
the badges and trying

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.030
to sort of make the

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.110
rel="author" tag more connected?

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.990
You know, the rel="author" for
identity on articles that you

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.490
write, to try and connect
that all together with

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.650
your Google+ profile.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.416
Right now it's kind of hard
to implement on websites.

00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:42.610
JENNY MURPHY: So the Google+
badge actually exposes a new

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.690
kind of semantic markup for
establishing relationships.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.000
And it's the rel="publisher"
element.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.320
So you do like a link
rel="publisher" and that's

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.850
actually how we determine that
your website is connected to

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.420
your Google+ page.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.640
In terms of authorship itself,
although the story is still

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.140
kind of manifesting itself, the
authorship is definitely a

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.550
big part of the story.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.450
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: [? Tamor ?]

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.720
asked a question on Fraser's
re-share of this.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.790
He asks, can the Direct
Connect be enabled and

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.835
disabled on command?

00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:25.750
JENNY MURPHY: So the Direct
Connect is kind of being done

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.640
on the back end.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.970
We're crawling.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.650
It's being done in the
search engine.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.370
So it's being done
asynchronously.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.140
For this reason, you can't
easily turn it on

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.680
or off at this time.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.560
What you can do is, you can set
up the elements that will

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.850
allow us to know that you want
Direct Connect, which is the

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.290
rel="publisher" element.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.440
And sign the Google badge.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.520
And then you can remove those
elements, and tell us that

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.190
you're no longer interested.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.280
But it is going to take some
time for that stuff to adjust,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.300
just like a lot of stuff that
impacts search [? engines. ?]

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.050
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.000
JENNY MURPHY: But that's
a great question.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.470
JONATHAN BERI: So we had
one simple question.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.970
Can you link to documentation
for the plug-ins badge?

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.620
And so I added that link
to the comments.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:18.590
All of our documentation is at
developers.google.com/+ and

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.470
then you can find the
different areas.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:25.060
We broke it down to plug-ins,
hangouts, APIs, and general

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.986
documentations.

00:12:25.986 --> 00:12:27.980
JENNY MURPHY: We'll also be
including all of these links

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.960
in the show notes.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.240
So if there's anything else
you'd like us to link,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.924
definitely comment and we'll
be sure to add it.

00:12:33.924 --> 00:12:36.760
FRASER CAIN: I don't know if you
guys noticed, Felicia Day

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.640
and Veronica Belmont broke
Google+ two days ago with

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.490
their hangout on Air.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.170
They hit the 500
comment maximum

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.770
within about four minutes.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.980
So I can definitely see that as
more and more celebrities

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.300
come on board and start
to do more of

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.450
these hangouts on Air--

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.410
that they passed up
to 500 literally

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.840
within like 20 minutes.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.016
It didn't take them long.

00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:02.770
JENNY MURPHY: Right.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.110
That's a good point.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.985
Us personally, doing the
platform office hours, we're

00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:10.700
kind of investigating new ways
to have larger communities be

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.590
able to ask questions and
have those bubble up.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.780
Although the comment stream is
very simple and accessible, it

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.775
has some limitations, like the
one you described of having a

00:13:19.775 --> 00:13:23.040
500 comment limit on a post.
So in addition to expanding

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.460
the capability of the platform,
we're always looking

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.370
for other ways of making
this stuff easier.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.680
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.140
Siegfried asks, can you
elaborate more on the privacy

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.140
policy that's needed when
your request more quota.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.620
JENNY MURPHY: The privacy policy
that's needed when you

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.240
request more quota.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.730
That's a good question.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.710
JONATHAN BERI: So the short
answer is we're not lawyers.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.150
And we can't provide
you legal advice

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.630
around the privacy policy.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:59.130
But what we look for is a clear
expression of user data

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.100
in a privacy policy.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:07.910
So for example, how you store
the data, how you access the

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.060
data, how you redistribute
that data.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.270
As long as that--

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.360
this echo is killing me-- as
long as you include that in

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.870
the privacy policy and users can
discover that, we consider

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.280
that a good privacy policy.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.710
In terms of the legal pieces
of a privacy policy, you'll

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.770
have to investigate that within
the country that you

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.155
live in and the country you wish
to operate the website.

00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:28.120
JENNY MURPHY: Exactly.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.564
JONATHAN BERI: That
was the short.

00:14:30.564 --> 00:14:32.080
JENNY MURPHY: So hopefully
that's pretty straightforward.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.300
But we can't offer you
any specific advice.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.550
JONATHAN BERI: And if
I'm not hinting--

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.730
if I'm not expressing it well
enough, there's not a

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.560
clear-cut privacy policy.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.480
We just want transparency.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:44.820
OK.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.620
So we have a few
more questions.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.740
From Oleg, does the plus
name in search look at

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.925
the actual page name?

00:14:50.925 --> 00:14:52.670
Or how does it determine
what to pull up?

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.870
Let's say there are 10
pages with Android 1,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.500
Android 2, Android 3.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.710
And there are badges linked to
them from various places.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.190
So when someone searches for
plus Android, how does it

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.990
determine which plus
page to pull up?

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.360
JENNY MURPHY: That's
a great question.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.920
This is something that's
a little bit fuzzy.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.460
Because it's determined
algorithmically, but in

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.890
general it's the title of the
business page, the plus page.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.130
So if you have that Android
page, it's going to be a +

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.040
Android, especially if
you're the official

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.022
Android page out there.

00:15:25.022 --> 00:15:26.370
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.820
This one's from Jeffrey.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.820
Will putting a badge on a
business page help to verify

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.070
the business?

00:15:36.342 --> 00:15:38.762
JENNY MURPHY: It certainly
can't hurt.

00:15:38.762 --> 00:15:41.650
JONATHAN BERI: And the business
verification process

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.050
is part of the Geo team.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.210
And there's a whole series of
policies of how to get your

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.340
business verified.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.480
If you go to any one of the
business pages, there's a link

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.720
say, are you the owner?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.550
And then you follow
that process.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.200
They're not directly related,
but it just adds more

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.355
credibility to your business
if you have a plus page.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.560
Greg prefaces his question, it
is not a badge question but

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.416
definitely a hangouts.

00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:11.382
I sell G-apps for a biz, and I
have clients ask when Hangouts

00:16:11.382 --> 00:16:12.940
On Air, especially with a
recording feature, will be

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.475
available in general
distribution?

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.880
JENNY MURPHY: As with many kind
of future-looking things,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.710
this is something that's a
little difficult for us to

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.660
talk about.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.840
Things are always changing.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.940
We're always focusing
on what's most

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.330
important to our users.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.680
And for this reason, the release
dates are not really

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.640
something we talk about.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.580
Because we don't know
them ourselves.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.470
Hangouts On Air, a wider
distribution is

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.540
one of these examples--

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.020
an example of this.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.200
So we can't tell you when it'll
be available right now.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.570
It's still really
experimental.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.190
There are still a lot of
kinks to work out.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.650
And we're still working with
our small set of testers to

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.410
make sure it's a really
accessible, great experience

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.450
for everyone before we
open it up wider.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.485
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:16:57.485 --> 00:17:00.110
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.690
Next question from Robert is,
how do you limit the width of

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.706
a small badge?

00:17:04.706 --> 00:17:06.390
JENNY MURPHY: Of
a small badge?

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.569
So currently, in the currently
production public version, you

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.319
can't limit the width
of the badge.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.829
It is fixed at 300,
which is why we've

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.624
added these new features.

00:17:16.624 --> 00:17:18.935
So I'm going to pop up
screen sharing again.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.369
But in the version that's
currently on Publisher

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:32.800
Preview, which will be out very
soon, the width of the

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.310
small versus the large
badge is the same

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.860
configuration option.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.990
So one width element,
specifically if you scroll

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.850
down to the code, we can see
that there's actually a width

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.595
attribute added to the G+ tag.

00:17:46.595 --> 00:17:48.280
Which--let me zoom in--

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.795
so you can actually
see the code.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.060
So down here in the little
code window on the

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.690
configuration tool,
you can see that

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.210
there's a width specifier.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.670
Specifying that width attribute
is the same whether

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.940
you're using a small
or large badge.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.480
In addition to the width
attribute being available,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.890
we've actually added a height
attribute, which allows you to

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:15.250
specify the normal height and
the small badge height

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.580
explicitly in pixel size.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.780
So it should be a little bit
more straightforward and open

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.214
us up to more possibilities
in the future.

00:18:24.214 --> 00:18:26.350
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.970
So Steven asks, can you take us
through the simplest way to

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.860
put the badge on our website.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.830
JENNY MURPHY: Simplest way
to put the badge on

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.040
your website, sure.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.130
I can definitely do that.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.004
I'm going to have to fire
up an editor real quick.

00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:44.350
Actually--

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.920
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I'd also
point out while she is, that

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.100
if you're doing something like
a Wordpress site, a lot of

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.690
plug-ins are becoming available
that will add the

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:54.530
badge for you.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:59.180
So there's not as much that
you'll need to do.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.815
And it's suddenly occurred to me
that I haven't checked yet

00:19:00.815 --> 00:19:04.450
if Blogger has gotten
a plug-in to do so.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.056
And I'm looking now.

00:19:06.056 --> 00:19:08.050
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:13.480
So I don't have the set-up to
quickly do a live demo.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.790
But I can show you the kind of
code walk-through process.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:22.030
I'm going to fire up screen
sharing again, go back to our

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.280
window and I'm going
to zoom out.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.285
So let's walk through setting
up the badge.

00:19:29.285 --> 00:19:31.510
I'm going to reload this
configuration tool, which will

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.210
clear out all the options,
and walk you through the

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.770
steps to use it.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.200
The first step is to go to the
configuration tool, which is

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.095
found on
developers.google.com/+.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.190
You go into the left side menu
and you see a little

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.760
configuration tool option
in the menu.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.030
And you click on it.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.920
And it will bring you to this
configuration tool.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.030
There's one manual step that
you're going to have to do to

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.440
enable the configuration tool,
which is get the ID of your

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.630
Google+ page.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.390
So we're going to go over
to the other tab.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.250
And we're going to go to my
wonderful Google+ page for

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.210
Baking Disasters, a fictional
business I

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.920
created for these demos.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.510
And to get the Google+
page identifier, you

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.570
go up to the URL.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.870
And you'll see a number
in there.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.420
That number is the ID of
your Google+ page.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.286
So we're going to copy that.

00:20:28.286 --> 00:20:30.630
We're going to go over into
the configuration tool and

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.480
paste it in.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.890
The badge will automatically
show up in the preview.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.960
So the next step is to format
the badge using these tools to

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.160
make it look how you want--
the correct language, if

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.595
you're experimenting with the
preview for [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:51.530
version of badge, maybe
change the width--

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.580
until you end up with
a badge with the

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.830
configuration that you want.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.980
And while I've been making all
these changes to the badge,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.890
within the tool we
can scroll down.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.130
And this code has been updating
in real time.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:09.600
It's just been off the screen so
you weren't able to see it.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.070
And in this code we see a
few different things.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.410
The first thing we see is
a link element with a

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.520
rel="publisher" attribute.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.170
We can get in a little
further.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.880
The rel="publisher" attribute
and the URL

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.250
of our Google+ page.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:32.750
This is the feature that tells
crawlers that hit your web

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.760
page about your Google+ page
and that you are the

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.540
owner of that page.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.360
This is how the Direct Connect
feature is enabled.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.180
This is also how the coalescing
of the +1 count is

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.410
identified and registered.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.410
The next element in this little
snippet of code is some

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.540
JavaScript code.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.360
It actually starts over here
but this is the meat of it.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.760
And this element initializes the
JavaScript that knows how

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.710
to render the Google+ badge
as well as the +1 button.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.500
It's actually the
same JavaScript.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.600
And this also specifies some of
our configuration, like the

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.580
English language, some of the
stuff that's kind of global

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.760
throughout the page.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.430
These two elements we will
grab and, just as it's

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:23.190
described in this comment up
here, we'll copy them and go

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.500
over to our fictional web page,
which is just in a pasty

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.900
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] right now.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.690
And we just stick these things
right into the head of our

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.940
HTML document.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.300
So the link will, as I said
before, allow Google to

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.350
identify that link between
your plus page

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.660
and your web page.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.880
And this big chunk of JavaScript
will asynchronously

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.600
load the JavaScript that's
required to render the badge

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.890
in such a way that it doesn't
interfere with the loading of

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.860
the rest of your page.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.710
So it won't slow
anything down.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.790
But there's one more step.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.330
We go back to the configuration
tool.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.800
We notice there's one
more chunk of stuff.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.650
There's the code that's actually
the badge itself.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.970
So we place this tag just as
it's described, wherever we

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.320
want that badge to render.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.090
So let's copy it and go
back to our pasty.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.660
And let's pretend there's
content on this web page.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.740
This web page is very
spartan right now,

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.420
contains nothing at all.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:32.180
But let's say we wanted to put
it below our title and before

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.430
our content.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.200
So when we render this page, it
will put the Google+ badge

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.950
below the title and above that
"content is awesome" content.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:49.550
And that's it.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:55.700
That's how easy it is to set
up the badge on your page.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.020
And if you'd like to go a little
further-- let me scroll

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.910
up through this way zoomed
out web page--

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.510
there's actually documentation
that describes a whole bunch

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.390
of more configuration options,
and describes what all these

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.030
things do in detail.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.830
I'm not going to go through
all them here.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.780
But I will link to them
in the show notes.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.210
And this shows you all the
different ways that you can

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.390
configure the badge and how you
can manually set it up.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.710
For example, if you want to
change the way it loads or if

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.250
you have to integrate it
differently depending on how

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.815
your website renders.

00:24:24.815 --> 00:24:26.960
Like you know, if you had
to put certain things in

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.550
different templates.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.810
And it also shows you
some cool tricks.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.080
So we'll be linking to those
in the show notes.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.110
And that's how easy it
is to install the

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.034
badge on your web page.

00:24:35.034 --> 00:24:36.440
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.590
Siegfried has a follow-up
question regarding the privacy

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.100
policy, which I'm super excited
because I actually

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.810
want to clarify this
a little bit.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.010
Are there any needs to offer
delete options if I save

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.180
public information about
the author [? after ?]

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.590
in the database?

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.240
There's a few places to learn
about our policies and our

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.220
terms of service.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.640
And I encourage everybody's
who's building anything with

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.430
the API, even if you're just
using the badge, to review at

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.520
the very least the policy.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.200
So to find the [? topic ?] of
the policy stuff, it's at

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.200
/+/policies on our
developers site.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.480
Jenny, if you could just
pull those up.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:11.600
JENNY MURPHY: Sure.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.850
I'll screen share.

00:25:15.215 --> 00:25:16.520
JONATHAN BERI: Because
it's worth noting.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.720
If you look at this, this
doesn't look like your typical

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.970
legal document.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.790
A lot of it's about spirit of
how we want users to be

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.230
treated with our APIs.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.840
The first three bullet points
are the most important.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.620
Put the user first, be
transparent, and

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.420
respect user data.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.740
And that's the general theme
of the rest of the policies

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.240
and the terms of service, too.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.590
And it's a more digestible
way.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.790
You can read it probably by
the time I'm done talking.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.770
There's a big section on
personal information from the

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.790
Google+ APIs.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.160
And specifically to Siegfried's
question about

00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.450
deletion, point three,
deletion rules.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:05.410
We ask that as a developer you
give a user a reasonably

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.590
convenient way to delete any
of their personal data.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.550
Does that have to be a true
export in deletion, like we

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.010
offer with Takeout?

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.070
No, that could be when they
disassociate their account,

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.810
you delete it.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.700
Or some other way that they
know that their content's

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.070
being protected and wiped
from your system.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:29.100
To go into the more legalese,
heavier definition of it, we

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.320
have a Google+ platform terms
of service, which is spartan

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.650
in comparison to our general
API terms of service.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.990
And that actually goes into more
detail about our views of

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.620
data portability and how
we generally expect all

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.440
developers who use Google
platform to build upon to have

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.010
a concept of data portability.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.290
What that means for your privacy
policy, to go back to

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.770
the original question, doesn't
have to be explicitly

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.670
expressed in that policy.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.680
It would be great if you just
tell the users what you're

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.870
doing with their data, and
what happens when they

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.410
disassociate, how they
delete that.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.850
But in general, you should be
taking care of that on the

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.090
users that you have. And it's
a great place to say that in

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.790
the privacy policy.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.590
Another place, if you're
interested in data

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.425
portability, is to
actually having a

00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:22.550
data portability policy.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.480
And I believe
dataportability.org has

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.940
guidelines of how to express
data portability.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.090
So awesome question.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.020
Obviously one I am
passionate about.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.970
Next question.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.390
Can I use the API to write to
an activity or a chat pane?

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.390
It looks like it's read-only
at the moment.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.110
Also, is the chatroom
stored permanently

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.991
after the hangout ends?

00:27:47.991 --> 00:27:49.820
Seems like three questions.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.710
JENNY MURPHY: So the
first question--

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.930
it sounds like you've actually
done your homework.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.350
And you've researched the
API a little bit.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.760
The RESTful web services that
make up the core of our API,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.060
and the hangout apps, neither of
them expose the ability to

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:09.970
create activities in the stream,
nor to interact with

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.630
the chat window on a hangout.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:16.180
The only way to create
activities in the stream right

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.010
now is with the social plug-ins,
the third component

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.890
of our platform--

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:26.370
the brand badge as well
as the +1 button.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.140
The chats themselves in the
hangouts are not persistent.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.814
So, in response to your
third question.

00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:36.650
FRASER CAIN: Yeah, in general,
you gotta make sure that you

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.470
don't post anything into that
chat that you want to keep.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.770
JONATHAN BERI: When will the
Hangout On Air, or just API,

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.520
be available for embedding on
a third party site, if ever?

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.280
So in terms of the Hangout
On Air, that's

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.000
actually an easy question.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.620
It's a YouTube stream.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:57.135
And if you've seen some of the
more public Hangout On Airs--

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:59.600
a few weekends ago, there
was an artist

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.270
doing body art painting--

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.960
it's just a YouTube
livestream event.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.250
So you can actually grab the
embed widget and stick it on

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.270
any page you want.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.310
If you noticed, some people
included the YouTube link, the

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.210
full-screen link, the extension
that was mentioned

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.160
earlier also does
that same thing.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.360
So you can embed that.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.650
In terms of the hangout
themselves,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.670
currently no plans.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.700
And the general future release
type of things that we don't

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.400
comment on, we've heard
ideas around that.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.990
And we're looking into it.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.690
But no timeline or any
promises around that.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.380
FRASER CAIN: Yeah.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.190
That's one of the things
that we're doing.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.200
It's relatively straightforward.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.450
So you can actually--

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.610
we're livestreaming our
Astronomy hangouts.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.890
We've actually got a page that
you can go to that, as soon as

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.580
we start our event, we have a
little publisher section.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.420
And we can put the embed
code in there.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.070
And then it can stream
from that location.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.085
We pull the comments from
Google+ as well as Twitter at

00:29:57.085 --> 00:29:58.230
the same time.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.500
And so it's sort of like a
single location you can go and

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.190
just kind of wait.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.000
And then when the show starts,
then the screen updates.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.900
So it's definitely, definitely
possible.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.346
We've done it.

00:30:08.346 --> 00:30:10.386
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, that's
a very cool feature.

00:30:13.098 --> 00:30:15.510
JONATHAN BERI: This one's a
feature request from Oleg.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.160
Since we're talking about pages,
one feature I would

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.840
like to see getting added is a
Google Calendar link, or embed

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.220
on business pages as
a standard feature.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.320
So there's actually two
features on here.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.560
Cool.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.140
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.640
We like those ideas.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.960
We've heard some
of them before.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.530
And I think they're--

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.520
or one of them, I've heard
the events link.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.010
I think that's a really
cool idea.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.308
And we'll relay it.

00:30:38.308 --> 00:30:40.600
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: I think
something that a number of

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.940
people are requesting
is a transparent

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.240
background on the badge.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.010
JENNY MURPHY: So there are some
technical reasons that we

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.390
decided to have a white and a
black background for now.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.580
It's that the badge is actually

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.120
rendering in a single iFrame.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.130
And iFrames are opaque.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.500
So there's some challenges
there.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.990
But it's definitely feedback
we've heard.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.000
We're considering it.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.670
And we're looking for ways to
make sure that the badge fits

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.630
well into everyone's website.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.590
So keep that feedback coming.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.070
JONATHAN BERI: Rob asked, is
there any way to incorporate

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.780
the chatroom function for those
watching hangout instead

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.990
of the current stream comment.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.536
I know that you can have a chat
within a hangout and you

00:31:23.536 --> 00:31:27.822
can have participants, but
not just the viewers.

00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:29.240
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: This
is a very, very

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.550
often requested feature.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.850
If you speak to the hangout
people and the hangout people

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:37.590
have their own chat tomorrow
tonight or tomorrow afternoon,

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.620
and ask them, they will tell
you the same thing.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.810
Everyone's requesting it.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:45.391
They don't have a date yet for
when this will be in place.

00:31:45.391 --> 00:31:47.140
JENNY MURPHY: Thank you
very much, Allen.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.100
Yeah, that sums it
up pretty well.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.530
We're definitely investigating a
lot of ways that we can have

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.370
people who are watching the
Hangout On Air interact with

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.810
the rest of the hangout.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.370
Chats are some ideas.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.450
There's a lot of different ideas
we're kicking around.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.670
We just want to make sure that
whatever we launch works

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.910
really well for everyone.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.260
And everyone has a really great
experience, whether they

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.110
be doing a Hangout On Air with
a smaller audience or an

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.240
enormous audience, where they
hit that 500 comment limit on

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.660
the post within ten minutes.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.360
So we're working on stuff.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.390
Hang tight.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:18.160
JONATHAN BERI: As you can see,
we're experimenting with

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.200
different ways to run
our Hangouts On Air.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.470
And we might decide that the
comment system works for us.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.030
But somebody else might
find another way.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.020
And then the product might
converge on a different one.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.590
So it's cool to experiment
around how you use Google+.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.060
And a lot of that time
that becomes the

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.570
next feature in Google+.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.710
So definitely good if you can
submit that feedback.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.540
And join the office
hours tomorrow.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.780
JENNY MURPHY: And if you've
done any interesting

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.830
experiments, or anyone out
there, if you come up with a

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.030
really cool solution to this
challenge, please let us know.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.440
Or you know, the hangout
office hours also.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.860
We'd like to hear it.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.850
We know that a lot of
the greatest ideas

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.125
come from the community.

00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:58.800
JONATHAN BERI: So CJ asks, what
happens in the event the

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.130
user browses my web page,
observes the badge, but is not

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.764
signed into his or her
Google account.

00:33:04.764 --> 00:33:07.295
JENNY MURPHY: So if the visitor
is not signed in to

00:33:07.295 --> 00:33:10.130
their Google account, they
will see a badge this is

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:14.160
rendered as if they have not
added them to their circle,

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.820
because we don't know
who they are.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.715
So [? it declares ?] the Add
to Circles button up there.

00:33:17.715 --> 00:33:21.990
How much I can actually probably
show you-- let me get

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.370
that configuration
tool back up.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.870
I'll show you what
it looks like.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.720
So it's going to be a
very standard badge.

00:33:38.712 --> 00:33:39.962
All right, screen
sharing again.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.810
So it's going to look-- if
they're not signed in, it's

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.740
going to look a lot like this.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.980
It'll have the Add to Circles
option up there.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.220
It'll have the +1 button.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.310
Neither of them will
be toggled.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.970
Because we don't know who
that user is, because

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.150
they're not signed in.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.070
The [? invitation's ?]

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.560
below, next to the +1 button.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.720
Probably contain more general
information and less personal,

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.760
specific information.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.580
When they click on either of the
buttons to trigger one of

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.320
these user specific events,
we're going to open up a

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.630
window that'll allow them to
sign in so they can complete

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:17.949
that action.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.840
If they don't have a Google+
account and they've signed in,

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.590
then we'll take them through the
flow to allow them to sign

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.130
up for a Google+ account
pretty quickly.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.960
So that they can get back to
your web page and do whatever

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.386
they were doing there.

00:34:31.386 --> 00:34:34.520
JONATHAN BERI: Great question.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.679
Yari, or Jari, asks, Google+
API question.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:39.889
Right time.

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:43.420
It is not yet possible to get
all public posts from a

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.860
Google+ user with Google+ API.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.730
There is some kind of limit
around 460 ports or something.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.739
And then he links
to something--

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:53.210
to some service I
think he builds.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.974
Do you know if there's plans
to remove this limit?

00:34:56.974 --> 00:34:58.340
JENNY MURPHY: This
limit sounds like

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.330
a pretty big challenge.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.990
This is the first I've
heard of it.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.570
You should be able
to keep paging

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:03.890
through the public posts.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.050
This is something I would
personally consider a

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.560
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.840
I'm going to dig in to it and
figure out what's going on.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.870
Thanks for the link.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.230
I'll follow up.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.850
And we'll see if we can
get this fixed.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.500
Because you should be able to
keep going back to those

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.243
public posts.

00:35:16.243 --> 00:35:18.610
And you should be able
to access everything.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.450
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: There used
to be a 250 post limit.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.450
But that has been gone for
a couple of months now.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.050
I am wondering if this is
related to a limit on the

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:34.230
number of API crawls within
a certain time frame.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.400
I don't know his circumstances
of his question.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.012
But that would be my first
debugging question.

00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:40.900
JENNY MURPHY: It is true.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.300
If you're hammering through
the APIs really quickly,

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.210
you're probably going to hit
some query-per-second limit of

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.250
your IP or something
like that.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.050
But if you hit that, you should
be getting a pretty

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.310
clear message back in the
response body telling you

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.720
exactly what you're
doing wrong.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.820
The tokens that you get back,
the paging tokens, should

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.190
persist for quite a while.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.940
So you should definitely
be able to page

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.120
through all the results.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.890
You may have to throttle
yourself if you're going

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.080
through an enormous number.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.080
But 460 is only like, four
and a half pages at the

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.790
maximum page size.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.710
So this shouldn't be
too challenging.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.341
We'll follow up with
you on this one.

00:36:18.341 --> 00:36:21.990
JONATHAN BERI: Gregory just has
a bug report on Firefox 9.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.010
So I guess we'll follow
up with that.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:23.810
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.125
Thank you very much.

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:29.090
JONATHAN BERI: Siegfried has
a separate question.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.020
It says, the search feature
in API is getting better.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:31.580
JENNY MURPHY: Yay.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.305
JONATHAN BERI: Thanks,
awesome.

00:36:33.305 --> 00:36:35.970
And finding more relevant and
up-to-date activities.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.500
Will this get better over time,
or how can we measure

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.360
how good the results are?

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.560
Hmm.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.690
JENNY MURPHY: This is something

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.400
we're constantly doing.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.480
We like search here, as
you might expect.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.710
So we're constantly working to
improve the search results

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.265
that you're seeing from
the API as well as

00:36:54.265 --> 00:36:55.710
from the web interface.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.970
And we're going to be
continually improving that.

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.730
And we're doing a lot of
measurements ourselves to see

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.115
how well we're doing.

00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:04.600
And this is kind of the
stuff we don't really

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.560
talk about too much.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.400
So I can't go into
any details.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.470
But this is another
great question.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.340
We're definitely working to
improve the search results.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.940
And we're really glad that
you're noticing that they're

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.520
getting better.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.905
That means we're on
the right track.

00:37:14.905 --> 00:37:17.150
JONATHAN BERI: And in terms of
how can you measure how good

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.460
the results are?

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.345
If you're finding what
you're searching?

00:37:24.345 --> 00:37:25.480
No, in all seriousness.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.640
It definitely is something
we actively work on.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.760
Not just the API team, but it's
more of the product team

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.170
and the search team that's
part of Google+.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.550
And we're adding more data
points, and we're improving

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.360
our algorithms, and for
sure it's going to

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.400
get better over time.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.584
That's one thing I
can guarantee.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.940
[? Tamar ?] asks, where
can I find the notes?

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.560
JENNY MURPHY: Where can
you find the notes?

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.270
The official location, the
official write-up, is in the

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:57.020
Google+ Platform Discussion
Forum.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.980
Fortunately, we're going to
be linking to that from

00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.980
all over the place.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.150
So if you can find this post
that you've commented on just

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:08.490
now, the video recording, once
it's been added in YouTube, or

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.970
any other posts that follow-up
about these office hours or

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.680
the event on Google developers
all these are going to link to

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.760
the canonical location where
all the show notes and all

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.360
those links are held.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.480
So pretty much anywhere,
even the post you're

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.970
looking at right now.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.160
Great question though.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.540
JONATHAN BERI: So
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] asks, I have

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.870
a rel="publisher" link set up
in the profile about page

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.910
links back, but auto-complete
doesn't link to it.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.425
I assume by auto-complete you
mean the Direct Connect.

00:38:38.425 --> 00:38:40.290
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, the plus
sign Direct Connect

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:41.840
auto-complete.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.260
So that's one of those things
that happens asynchronously.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.470
There's no way that you can
explicitly hit a button and

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.030
turn it on right now.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:52.800
But by adding that
rel="publisher," you're

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.570
telling us that you want
to be involved in the

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.200
Direct Connect program.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.570
So when the time comes around,
when the algorithm has decided

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.260
it's a good time, we're
going to add that plus

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.670
auto-complete thing.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:11.390
JONATHAN BERI: [? Ellen ?] asks,
any other way to verify

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.256
that he's done everything
correct?

00:39:14.256 --> 00:39:16.280
JENNY MURPHY: There is
not any specific way.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.825
You can use the rich
snippet tool.

00:39:17.825 --> 00:39:19.212
JONATHAN BERI: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:39:19.212 --> 00:39:21.090
JENNY MURPHY: The rich snippet
tool will tell you if your

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.690
mark-up is correctly
[? well-formed. ?]

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.990
And that's going to be a good
indication that everything is

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:27.040
set up well.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.290
But other than that, all you can
kind of do is hang out and

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:33.334
wait for it to get enabled.

00:39:33.334 --> 00:39:36.240
JONATHAN BERI: So Robert asks,
when will the width and height

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.490
be available in the developer
config tool?

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.448
Is yours different
from mine now?

00:39:41.448 --> 00:39:43.650
JENNY MURPHY: So mine is a
little different from yours.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.090
And I'm actually going to show
you how you can play with it

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.570
right away.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:52.020
So going back to that same
window I had been showing you

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.840
for a lot of the hangout,
there is a web page that

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.550
allows you to sign up for
the Platform Preview.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:06.250
The Platform Preview gives you
slightly early access for your

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:10.870
account to see what some of
our future social plug-ins

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.040
will look like.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.260
And the reason we have this
group in existence is so that

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.260
you, as the webmaster, can
adjust your website for the

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.640
new features of the badge.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.030
So you can take advantage of new
features of the badge, the

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.810
+1 button, any of our other
social plug-ins, the moment

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.780
they're available.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.610
It's pretty easy to
join this group.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.560
It's linked from the
documentation for the brand

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.220
badge right now.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.590
All you have to do when you get
on this page, which I'll

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.330
also include in the show notes,
is just go here and put

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:43.610
in your email address.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.140
And when you put in your email
address and sign up, you'll be

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.190
added to the group.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.580
Whenever we have a new
feature, like the new

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:54.880
configuration tool with the
width and height, entering

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.535
Platform Preview, we will send
you a notification so that you

00:40:58.535 --> 00:41:01.500
know to go look at it
and play with it.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.750
And it's just that simple.

00:41:05.816 --> 00:41:07.170
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.880
Lisa asks, any plans for
integration of any stream

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.660
access and publishing
with third party

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.261
dashboards like HootSuite?

00:41:15.261 --> 00:41:16.480
JENNY MURPHY: That's
a great question.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.630
We're actually experimenting
with that stuff right now in a

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.460
very limited scope.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.900
And we're not really sure
exactly how that's going to

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.620
expand yet.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.695
It's still in the
early stages.

00:41:26.695 --> 00:41:29.130
But it is definitely something
we're actively working on.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.530
And if you dig around, if you
Google around, you'll see that

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.525
HootSuite actually talked about
our partnership already

00:41:33.525 --> 00:41:34.712
a little bit.

00:41:34.712 --> 00:41:36.630
JONATHAN BERI: Yes.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.590
I believe there's even a sign-up
page on the HootSuite

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:42.040
site to allow you to
request access.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.006
So you can contact them for more
information about that.

00:41:46.006 --> 00:41:48.480
Let's see.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.350
There's a lot of requests for
IRC chat and different ways to

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.490
get chats and hangouts.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:57.590
JENNY MURPHY: We actually
have an IRC channel.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.410
But I don't think any of us
are in there right now.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.040
But if you guys would like to
chat about it while we're

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.300
doing the Hangouts On Air or
anything else, we are on

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.720
Freenode at Google+ Platform.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.980
And we will be adding--

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.722
we're still in the early
stages, we're still

00:42:14.722 --> 00:42:16.310
experimenting with this
as a support channel.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.710
But it sounds like people
are interested.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.530
So go check it out.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.850
And we'll be linking to it from
our documentation in the

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:23.110
near future.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.900
So it'll be easier
for you to find.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.370
But I hang out in there a lot.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:29.720
So you can always find me
there, except right now.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.110
Because I'm busy,
for some reason.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.520
JONATHAN BERI: So we have--

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.870
so we're hitting about the
edge of our time frame.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:40.430
Let's see.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:43.660
There's some good comments and
suggestions of how to fix the

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.240
iFrame, transparency issue,
questions about what's

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.500
drawn behind us.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.025
Those are actually Google+
dinosaurs.

00:42:52.025 --> 00:42:53.960
JENNY MURPHY: Rahhh!

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.680
JONATHAN BERI: Not what
Oleg suggests.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.260
Timing, when are Google+
office hours?

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.940
Same time.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.010
We have office hours every week
at the same time, same

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:05.210
bad channel.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.235
You can always find us in our
streams posting about it,

00:43:09.235 --> 00:43:11.180
whoever gets to it first.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.580
JENNY MURPHY: I also post
messages in the discussion

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.410
group a few days
ahead of time.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:20.130
And there will be an event on
the Google developers event

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.850
list that you can use to RSVP.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:24.650
And we update those as news
develops on them.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.260
But they're always
at the same time.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:32.680
11:30 AM Pacific time, which is
during the workday for most

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.810
of North America and the
Americas, and in the evening

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:39.855
and early night for most of
our European friends.

00:43:39.855 --> 00:43:43.150
Or later night, I guess,
for a lot of you.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.370
JONATHAN BERI: Let's see if
there's one more question.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.830
JENNY MURPHY: Before
we wrap up, yeah.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.010
JONATHAN BERI: And I guess
Nicholas's question is the

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.350
most important.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.535
Can you work more and faster?

00:43:52.535 --> 00:43:53.640
JENNY MURPHY: We work--

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.960
we really love our jobs.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.790
So we work more and
fast a lot.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.266
Like it's almost fast motion
here sometimes.

00:43:59.266 --> 00:44:04.210
JONATHAN BERI: And so there's
a certain limit to how much

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:05.300
more you can do.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.160
Because there's only 24
hours in a single day.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.830
The best we can suggest
is if you just keep

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.260
the feedback coming.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.800
Then we can be more efficient
with that,

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.052
with those 24 hours.

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.440
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.915
We always love the feedback.

00:44:17.915 --> 00:44:20.360
JONATHAN BERI: And on that note,
I think that ends this

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:20.900
week's office hours.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.340
JENNY MURPHY: Does anyone else
in the hangout have any--

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:24.295
JONATHAN BERI: --final words?

00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:27.500
FRASER CAIN: I have one quick
comment, which was, did you

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.330
guys get a chance to catch
President Obama's hangout

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.260
couple of days ago?

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:32.910
JONATHAN BERI: Of course.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.730
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.470
FRASER CAIN: It was a pretty
cool demonstration of what

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.970
hangouts could look like and
should look like, I think.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:46.140
And in many cases,
it was awesome.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.210
Because you could click, you
could maximize, it was

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.450
high-def, the audio
sounded good.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.960
They were clearly able to
bring in like high-grade

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.090
cameras into the stream.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.570
All of the pieces were there.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:04.020
So if that's the technology road
map, I think all of us

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.270
working in this space can
definitely agree that that's

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:08.150
where it ought to go.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.000
Because that was amazing.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.660
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Fraser,
have you seen Peter

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.550
McDermott's interviews
with some of the

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.570
participants of that?

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.350
FRASER CAIN: Yeah.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.940
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I encourage
anybody who hasn't to go find

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:19.600
those interviews.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.850
Because some of them are very
interesting, very revealing.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:28.030
And not just to see what the
participants thought of it,

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.956
but what they think of Google+
and hangouts now.

00:45:31.956 --> 00:45:32.680
FRASER CAIN: Yeah.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.510
I mean in many cases they had
never heard of Google+ or

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.780
didn't really understand the
hangouts, but they were

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.140
brought up to speed.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.270
And pretty transformative in
going through the process.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:45.710
But I think that as the way the
hangout ran and the way it

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:47.350
was as a communication
and publishing

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.345
channel was pretty great.

00:45:49.345 --> 00:45:54.770
And so if you can sort of push
back to achieve that, please.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:58.148
We want that, exactly that.

00:45:58.148 --> 00:45:59.020
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.240
I think we all want that.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.920
And we're definitely working
towards making this stuff as

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.660
good as we can.

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.240
And there's definitely some
stuff we use as kind of a

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.490
model for that.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.150
Cool.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.910
So unless there's anything else,
I think we're going to

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:14.662
call it a day.

00:46:14.662 --> 00:46:17.410
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: I actually
have a quick question.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:22.200
Do you know the current
status of the--

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.660
so you can put the rel="author"
link to your

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.340
Google+ profile on your blog.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.080
And then when those blog posts
show up in search results,

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.260
it'll embed your
profile image.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.896
Are you aware of the
status of that?

00:46:34.896 --> 00:46:36.560
JENNY MURPHY: That is the
authorship feature.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.450
And that is available now.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.750
So you can start
doing that now.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.570
You can use tools like that rich
snippet testing tool to

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.180
validate that your markup
is correctly configured.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.450
And in search results, a lot
of my search results I see

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:52.380
stuff that I've written showing
up with my profile

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.360
picture and links to information
about me there.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.510
So it's already there.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:58.980
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS:
Is it automatic?

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.540
Last I checked, there was some
submission form you had to

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.860
fill out to get in.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.950
So is it all automatic
now, or--

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.960
JENNY MURPHY: There is a
submission form that will help

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.200
us prioritize.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.550
But it's open right now.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.105
We're actively crawling and
looking through that

00:47:12.105 --> 00:47:14.870
information and using it
to create the best

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:15.890
search results we can.

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.050
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: Awesome.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:17.840
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.780
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.051
JENNY MURPHY: Very, very
welcome, of course.

00:47:21.051 --> 00:47:21.470
All right.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:23.060
Unless there's anything else,
I think we're going

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.550
to call it a day.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.050
Thanks to everyone out there,
everyone who joined us in the

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:30.780
hangout, and everyone out on
Google+ who asked some

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.330
wonderful questions.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.230
And we will be seeing
you next week.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:35.590
JONATHAN BERI: And don't
forget, if you have any

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.820
questions you didn't get a
chance to answer, you can ask

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.110
it in our forums, which is
linked from our developer site

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:42.180
as well as our Google+
profiles.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.020
JENNY MURPHY: Yep.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.495
So feel free to ping
us, anytime.

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:46.420
Thanks again.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.100
Bye everybody.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.350
JONATHAN BERI: See you.
