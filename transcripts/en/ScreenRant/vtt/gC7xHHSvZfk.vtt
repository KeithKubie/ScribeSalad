00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.340
With Disney distributing their films all around
the world it is common for them to make changes

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.750
with their animated features for different
markets.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.859
Some of these variations might seem insignificant
to us but it could mean a world of difference

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.280
to that other country.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.090
Sometimes these modifications are due to events
that happened around the world and Disney

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.860
felt an adjustment was needed.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.710
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Alternate
Versions of DISNEY Movies You Never Knew Existed.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.510
Remember to click that like button when we
come across a fact you don’t know and stick

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.879
around to the end of the video for a Zootopia
story that changes the way you see the movie.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.149
Monsters University

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.579
In their dorm Randall Boggs shows Mike Wazowski
a tray full of cupcakes that reads, “Be

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.159
my Pal” after he fixes the upside down one.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.519
This joke translated well for English speaking
audiences but what about other countries?

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.249
When Disney released the film to foreign countries
that didn’t speak English they changed the

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.089
letters to smiley faces.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.389
That way, when one is upside down it just
looks silly and the joke works but in the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:08.410
US we always want you to be our dal, I mean
pal.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.650
Toy Story 2

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.780
When Buzz gives a pep talk to Andy’s toys
before they begin their quest to save Woody

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.530
an American flag waves behind him as the American
National Anthem plays and all of this becomes

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.970
part of a TV screen.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.960
To help keep the film marketable for foreign
markets the team at Pixar made an alternate

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.850
version for foreign distribution.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.100
Instead of a flag they used a globe and they
also removed the National Anthem.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.480
Composer Randy Newman also wrote a new score
called the “One World Anthem” for this

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.480
version.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.510
That’s an appropriate name Randy!

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.510
Planes

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.760
The character Rochelle from Disney’s Planes
is a beautiful gradient of colors from white

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.230
to to pink to vibrant red.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.480
Depending on where you saw the film she might
not look the same.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.610
In Australia, she is red, green, yellow, black,
and white with a kangaroo on her side.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.690
She also might not be named Rochelle in China
her name is Yún Yàn Fēi and she has a red,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.750
yellow, and white paint job, while in Germany
she’s white, black, yellow, and red and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.960
referred to as Heidi.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:38.680
We’ve heard of a horse of a different color
but this is the first time for 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.269
a plane.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.269
Wreck-It-Ralph

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.230
One of the sugar rush racers in Wreck-It-Ralph
is an Asian themed girl named Minty Zaki and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.650
her name is actually homage to Japan's famous
animator, Hayao Miyazaki.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.640
Since she was already Japanese and a minor
character in the film it is surprising to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.160
find out that she was remodeled for foreign
distribution in Japan.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.890
They even changed her name to Minty Sakura!

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.730
We guess the name Minty works for both countries
but not the name Zaki.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.760
Lilo &amp; Stitch

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.790
Lilo &amp; Stitch was released in 2002 but the
film was being developed well before then,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.870
the animated hit featured a climatic ending
that involved a plane hijacking.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.639
After the horrific, terrorist events that
took place on September 11, 2001 the filmmakers

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.829
rewrote and redrew the ending.

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.930
Instead of a passenger-filled Boeing 747 being
hijacked it was replaced with Jumba’s red,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.430
white and blue spaceship.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.719
Originally this climax took place through
the city streets of Hawaii and was also changed

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:48.920
to mountains and volcanoes to avoid undesirable
thoughts during the film.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920
Inside Out

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.760
Making films more relatable to global audiences
seems to always be on the forefront of Disney’s

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.760
mind.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.019
When Riley is a baby and she’s disgusted
by broccoli, Anger let’s her dad have it.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.659
Still, dad is no fool; he knows the imaginary
plane will make Riley want her greens and

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.489
his work will be accomplished.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.730
But these greens didn’t work for Japan audiences
so the broccoli was changed to green peppers.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.749
Both vegetables gave the chance for Anger
to let off a little steam in either country.

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:16.749
Melody Time

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:18.519
Smoking cigarettes has troubled older Disney
cartoons for many years; Pinocchio hasn’t

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.519
been edited because his actions have consequences
but others aren’t as lucky.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.519
The Pecos Bill segment from 1948’s Melody
Time is one of those that have been edited.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.519
Disney digital removed any cigarette that
he was smoking and since most of the film

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.519
it just dangles from his mouth it isn’t
noticeable but when he does handle it the

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.519
hand movements do look a little odd.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:24.519
Maybe he’s a magician cowboy practicing
for his next performance.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:25.519
Moana

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.519
In the US the name Moana is quickly becoming
popular with little girls but in Italy a similar

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.519
name is popular with grownups, Moana Pozzi.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:30.750
The woman with the name, Pozzi may have died
in 1994 but she’s still known as one of

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.870
the most popular adult film stars in that
country.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.560
Disney changed the name of their 56th animated
feature to Oceania in Italy to not confuse

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.450
parents with the adult film star.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.340
Maybe they were afraid that only teenage boys
would be buying tickets.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.340
Zootopia

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.310
There is a character in the film Zootopia
named Peter Moosebridge who is appropriately

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.570
portrayed by a moose but that’s not the
case in every country.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.250
In Japan he is a Japanese raccoon dog and
in New Zealand he’s a koala named David

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.250
Koalabell.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.250
Our favorite variation has to be Brazil where
he is a jaguar named Onçardo Boi Chá.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.260
Even in countries where he is still a moose
they changed his name, in the UK they named

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.130
him Moosos Alexander but kept the same design.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.910
It sounds like Peter Moosebridge has identity
issues as he travels around the world.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.910
Frozen

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.170
When Disney first developed Frozen, the two
main characters Anna and Elsa were completely

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.170
different.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.910
For starters Anna was portrayed as a typical
Disney princess and less strong-minded but

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.770
the biggest change came from Elsa.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.850
Elsa was actually the villain of the film,
a hermit with evil powers that was asked by

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.170
Anna to freeze her heart after a breakup.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.990
We’re glad that Disney made these changes
and we’re sure they are happy too since

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.520
the film is their highest grossing animated
film ever.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.050
