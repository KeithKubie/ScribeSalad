00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.340
I'm interested in the twin prime

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350
I'm interested in the twin prime
 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.789
I'm interested in the twin prime
conjecture so this is asking about

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
conjecture so this is asking about
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.550
conjecture so this is asking about
consecutive prime numbers P 1 as the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
consecutive prime numbers P 1 as the
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.530
consecutive prime numbers P 1 as the
first prime which would be equal to 2

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
first prime which would be equal to 2
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.080
first prime which would be equal to 2
and there'll be the second climb P 2

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
and there'll be the second climb P 2
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270
and there'll be the second climb P 2
which would be equal to C and you can

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
which would be equal to C and you can
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.099
which would be equal to C and you can
look at the gaps between the times so

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
look at the gaps between the times so
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.370
look at the gaps between the times so
the gap between 3 &amp; 2 is 1 this is the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
the gap between 3 &amp; 2 is 1 this is the
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.320
the gap between 3 &amp; 2 is 1 this is the
only time you can possibly have two

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
only time you can possibly have two
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540
only time you can possibly have two
prime numbers which differ by exactly 1

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
prime numbers which differ by exactly 1
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.609
prime numbers which differ by exactly 1
and so the next smallest possible gap

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
and so the next smallest possible gap
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.730
and so the next smallest possible gap
would be a gap of size 2 it's only not

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
would be a gap of size 2 it's only not
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.370
would be a gap of size 2 it's only not
the case that all gaps become size to

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
the case that all gaps become size to
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.840
the case that all gaps become size to
you but the question is how many of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
you but the question is how many of
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.160
you but the question is how many of
these gaps of size 2 so for example 101

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
these gaps of size 2 so for example 101
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.920
these gaps of size 2 so for example 101
and 103 are two rather large prime

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
and 103 are two rather large prime
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139
and 103 are two rather large prime
numbers which differ by exactly two and

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
numbers which differ by exactly two and
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.020
numbers which differ by exactly two and
then the twin prime conjecture so that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
then the twin prime conjecture so that
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060
then the twin prime conjecture so that
this having two points which differ by

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
this having two points which differ by
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.670
this having two points which differ by
exactly two happens instantly after if

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
exactly two happens instantly after if
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860
exactly two happens instantly after if
the twin prime conjecture was false at

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
the twin prime conjecture was false at
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.360
the twin prime conjecture was false at
some point you go along the number line

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
some point you go along the number line
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090
some point you go along the number line
and then all prime gaps would always be

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
and then all prime gaps would always be
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369
and then all prime gaps would always be
bigger than 2 but we don't believe

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
bigger than 2 but we don't believe
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900
bigger than 2 but we don't believe
that's the case we believe that it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
that's the case we believe that it
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369
that's the case we believe that it
should be the case the twin prime

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
should be the case the twin prime
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.420
should be the case the twin prime
conjecture is correct

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
conjecture is correct
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340
conjecture is correct
so no matter how far you go along

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
so no matter how far you go along
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.649
so no matter how far you go along
there's always going to be some bigger

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
there's always going to be some bigger
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.250
there's always going to be some bigger
primes and in fact infants that differ

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
primes and in fact infants that differ
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.310
primes and in fact infants that differ
by just exactly two so you can test this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
by just exactly two so you can test this
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770
by just exactly two so you can test this
on a computer and we found pairs of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
on a computer and we found pairs of
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.870
on a computer and we found pairs of
times that just by exactly 2 with over

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
times that just by exactly 2 with over
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.929
times that just by exactly 2 with over
300,000 decimal digits and in fact they

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
300,000 decimal digits and in fact they
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880
300,000 decimal digits and in fact they
are surprisingly common that it's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
are surprisingly common that it's
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800
are surprisingly common that it's
certainly not all the time but if you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
certainly not all the time but if you
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960
certainly not all the time but if you
look at the first how far you have to go

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
look at the first how far you have to go
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789
look at the first how far you have to go
after a million to find a pair of twin

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
after a million to find a pair of twin
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.130
after a million to find a pair of twin
primes it's not very far if you look

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
primes it's not very far if you look
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560
primes it's not very far if you look
after a billion it's not very far if you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
after a billion it's not very far if you
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660
after a billion it's not very far if you
look after a thousand billion it's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
look after a thousand billion it's
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700
look after a thousand billion it's
actually not very far until you start

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
actually not very far until you start
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.219
actually not very far until you start
finding Twin Pines most pines aren't

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
finding Twin Pines most pines aren't
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.200
finding Twin Pines most pines aren't
going to have the one after it been just

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
going to have the one after it been just
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870
going to have the one after it been just
two apart but we still believe that you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
two apart but we still believe that you
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580
two apart but we still believe that you
should be relatively plentiful and so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
should be relatively plentiful and so
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.710
should be relatively plentiful and so
far if you check on a computer they seem

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
far if you check on a computer they seem
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.359
far if you check on a computer they seem
to speak to you but whether it's really

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
to speak to you but whether it's really
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.670
to speak to you but whether it's really
2 all the way as far as you go is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
2 all the way as far as you go is
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.690
2 all the way as far as you go is
something that you can't check on the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
something that you can't check on the
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.969
something that you can't check on the
computer and that's where you need to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
computer and that's where you need to
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.530
computer and that's where you need to
try and prove the real mathematical

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
try and prove the real mathematical
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.170
try and prove the real mathematical
result so we don't actually know how old

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
result so we don't actually know how old
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030
result so we don't actually know how old
the twin prime conjecture is that some

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040
the twin prime conjecture is that some
 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.590
the twin prime conjecture is that some
people have claimed that it should go

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
people have claimed that it should go
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.120
people have claimed that it should go
all the way back to Euclid and it's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
all the way back to Euclid and it's
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.469
all the way back to Euclid and it's
certainly the kind of question that the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
certainly the kind of question that the
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.059
certainly the kind of question that the
ancient Greeks could easily have thought

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
ancient Greeks could easily have thought
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.490
ancient Greeks could easily have thought
about the most recent time where we've

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
about the most recent time where we've
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.320
about the most recent time where we've
seen someone really write down the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
seen someone really write down the
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.309
seen someone really write down the
conjecture

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
conjecture
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.500
conjecture
he was just over 100 years ago by

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
he was just over 100 years ago by
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.020
he was just over 100 years ago by
Deponia MEAC but he actually conducted a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
Deponia MEAC but he actually conducted a
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.699
Deponia MEAC but he actually conducted a
rather stronger more general form of the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709
rather stronger more general form of the
 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.020
rather stronger more general form of the
twin prime conjecture that's a bit more

twin prime conjecture that's a bit more
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.330
twin prime conjecture that's a bit more
complicated it's not just gaps of size 2

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
complicated it's not just gaps of size 2
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.759
complicated it's not just gaps of size 2
but also gaps of size 4 and gaps of so 6

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769
but also gaps of size 4 and gaps of so 6
 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.339
but also gaps of size 4 and gaps of so 6
and so there's a suspicion that the twin

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349
and so there's a suspicion that the twin
 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.890
and so there's a suspicion that the twin
prime conjecture itself is rather old er

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
prime conjecture itself is rather old er
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.080
prime conjecture itself is rather old er
than that but we know it's at least 100

forever this is one of the interesting

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
forever this is one of the interesting
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.619
forever this is one of the interesting
and frustrating things about prime

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
and frustrating things about prime
 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.439
and frustrating things about prime
numbers that often it's clear what the

right answer should be if you give me a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
right answer should be if you give me a
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.679
right answer should be if you give me a
simple problem like the twin prime

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689
simple problem like the twin prime
 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.229
simple problem like the twin prime
conjecture you can think about it

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239
conjecture you can think about it
 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.580
conjecture you can think about it
heuristic lis a bit you can check in on

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590
heuristic lis a bit you can check in on
 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.229
heuristic lis a bit you can check in on
computer and you can quite quickly

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239
computer and you can quite quickly
 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.849
computer and you can quite quickly
convince yourself that this should

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859
convince yourself that this should
 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.830
convince yourself that this should
clearly be the right answer and you can

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840
clearly be the right answer and you can
 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.990
clearly be the right answer and you can

by tweaking the arguments you should be

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300
by tweaking the arguments you should be
 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.820
by tweaking the arguments you should be
able to bring 70 million down to some

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830
able to bring 70 million down to some
 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.770

extra work so there was a polymath

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440
extra work so there was a polymath
 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.230
extra work so there was a polymath
project which was a big online

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240
project which was a big online
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.210

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.450
arguments in Jiang's work now they came
up actually with quite a lot of neat

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460
up actually with quite a lot of neat

bandgap string times in any way so I was
 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.780

about prime numbers so I was just

of this and look at things in from the
right perspective a variation on the

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.779
right perspective a variation on the
ideas that I was thinking about were

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:26.789
ideas that I was thinking about were
 

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:28.010
ideas that I was thinking about were
able to prove banner gaps in a

this gave a completely new way of

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560
this gave a completely new way of
 

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.279
this gave a completely new way of
proving bana gaps between times so both

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:34.289
proving bana gaps between times so both
 

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.589

my work in Jiang's work is very much

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599
my work in Jiang's work is very much
 

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.510
my work in Jiang's work is very much
based on the earlier work of ghosting

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.459
continue deer and golden continued doom
used an argument that's fundamentally

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:43.469
used an argument that's fundamentally
 

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:45.660
used an argument that's fundamentally
using a technique known as CID met

using a technique known as CID met
they prove the great result about primes

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.010
they prove the great result about primes
 

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.220
they prove the great result about primes
which come close together and they said

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:50.230
which come close together and they said
 

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.800
which come close together and they said
if we could prove this other technical

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:52.810
if we could prove this other technical
 

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.050
if we could prove this other technical
result that isn't to do with submitted

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.060
result that isn't to do with submitted
 

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.750
result that isn't to do with submitted
then we'd be able to get down a gaps

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760
then we'd be able to get down a gaps
 

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.389
then we'd be able to get down a gaps
between primes and so what Jiang managed

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399
between primes and so what Jiang managed
 

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:03.269
between primes and so what Jiang managed
to do is essentially prove something

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279
to do is essentially prove something
 

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.040
to do is essentially prove something
like what they wanted to prove and

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.050
like what they wanted to prove and
 

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.720
like what they wanted to prove and
therefore use their argument to get

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:06.730
therefore use their argument to get
 

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.800
therefore use their argument to get
bandgap string x whereas my approach was

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:10.810
bandgap string x whereas my approach was
 

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.410
bandgap string x whereas my approach was
based on their original ideas rethinking

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:13.420
based on their original ideas rethinking
 

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.940
based on their original ideas rethinking
some of the way their original argument

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:14.950
some of the way their original argument
 

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.980
some of the way their original argument
worked which meant that you didn't need

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:16.990
worked which meant that you didn't need
 

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.819
worked which meant that you didn't need
such a strong technical input and so I

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:20.829
such a strong technical input and so I
 

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:22.410
such a strong technical input and so I
could use weaker results that be known

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:22.420
could use weaker results that be known
 

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.139
could use weaker results that be known
for the past 50 years or so instead on

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:25.149
for the past 50 years or so instead on

for the past 50 years or so instead on
the one hand I tend to sort of feel my

before I actually write down all the

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440
before I actually write down all the
 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.560
before I actually write down all the
details so I did have this feeling that

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:34.570
details so I did have this feeling that
 

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.389
details so I did have this feeling that
yes this has the feeling of being right

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399
yes this has the feeling of being right
 

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:40.829
yes this has the feeling of being right
but at the same time I remember being

00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839
but at the same time I remember being
 

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:42.600
but at the same time I remember being
pretty scared when I first came up with

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:42.610
pretty scared when I first came up with
 

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.030
pretty scared when I first came up with
the ideas because you know I was going

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040
the ideas because you know I was going
 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.380
the ideas because you know I was going
to be very much putting myself out there

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:46.390
to be very much putting myself out there
 

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.910
to be very much putting myself out there
and it's very important for

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920
and it's very important for
 

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.100
and it's very important for
mathematicians to really be strict with

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.110
mathematicians to really be strict with
 

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.360
mathematicians to really be strict with
themselves to check that they've got all

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.370
themselves to check that they've got all
 

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.460
themselves to check that they've got all
the details right but you often have

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:53.470
the details right but you often have
 

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.170
the details right but you often have
this internal feeling about these things

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:55.180
this internal feeling about these things
 

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.470
this internal feeling about these things
and it felt like to me I was really

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480
and it felt like to me I was really
 

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.970
and it felt like to me I was really
surprised so yeah there was suddenly

00:09:59.970 --> 00:09:59.980
surprised so yeah there was suddenly
 

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.769
surprised so yeah there was suddenly
lots and lots of interests I was a

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:01.779
lots and lots of interests I was a
 

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:03.840
lots and lots of interests I was a
postdoc at the time in module when this

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:03.850
postdoc at the time in module when this
 

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.069
postdoc at the time in module when this
came out and suddenly I was getting

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079
came out and suddenly I was getting
 

00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:07.500
came out and suddenly I was getting
invitations to fly all over to give

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:07.510
invitations to fly all over to give
 

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.329
invitations to fly all over to give
talks in different places in the u.s. so

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:09.339
talks in different places in the u.s. so
 

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:11.280
talks in different places in the u.s. so
it was really exciting for me being able

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:11.290
it was really exciting for me being able
 

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.769
it was really exciting for me being able
to meet all these famous mathematicians

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:13.779
to meet all these famous mathematicians
 

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.540
to meet all these famous mathematicians
give talks of my work suddenly everyone

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:15.550
give talks of my work suddenly everyone
 

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.250
give talks of my work suddenly everyone
was very excited I hadn't really

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.260
was very excited I hadn't really
 

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.870
was very excited I hadn't really
expected this at all I thought you know

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880
expected this at all I thought you know
 

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.210
expected this at all I thought you know
as pleased that I'd proven a nice result

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:21.220
as pleased that I'd proven a nice result
 

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.740
as pleased that I'd proven a nice result
but I was more pleased because I'd

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:22.750
but I was more pleased because I'd
 

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.639
but I was more pleased because I'd
finally managed to get an understanding

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:23.649
finally managed to get an understanding
 

00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:26.460
finally managed to get an understanding
of these things and I get I had the

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.470
of these things and I get I had the
 

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.840
of these things and I get I had the
satisfaction of the proof I hadn't

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:27.850
satisfaction of the proof I hadn't
 

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.509

really expected there to be any media

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519

interest or all these people asking me
 

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.860
interest or all these people asking me
to give talks and things so some people

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:34.870
to give talks and things so some people
 

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.269
to give talks and things so some people
have called it the main our towel method

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279
have called it the main our towel method
 

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:39.030
have called it the main our towel method
so Terry towel was also thinking about

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040
so Terry towel was also thinking about
 

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.160
so Terry towel was also thinking about
similar ideas he was very actively

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.170
similar ideas he was very actively
 

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.630
similar ideas he was very actively
involved in leading this polymath

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640
involved in leading this polymath
 

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.460
involved in leading this polymath
project and so he came up with

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:44.470
project and so he came up with
 

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.590
project and so he came up with
essentially the same method at the same

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600
essentially the same method at the same
 

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.240
essentially the same method at the same
time it's another bizarre coincidence

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.250

Terry and I came up with this new

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:56.199
Terry and I came up with this new
 

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:58.290
Terry and I came up with this new

not quite all the way there's a new idea
that's needed to get all the way to the

reason for it is that we have these

00:12:13.819 --> 00:12:13.829
reason for it is that we have these

perfectly there are only approximately
 

00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:23.930
perfectly there are only approximately
detected prime numbers so maybe they get

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940
detected prime numbers so maybe they get
 

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.139

and if you're getting like one in ten at
 

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:32.360
and if you're getting like one in ten at

00:16:27.439 --> 00:16:29.019
hypothesis 2 than this and so you
automatically prove a million other

00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:29.029
automatically prove a million other
 

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:31.389
automatically prove a million other
theorems just with this and we have this

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399
theorems just with this and we have this
 

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:34.480
theorems just with this and we have this
huge new understanding that even more

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:34.490
huge new understanding that even more
 

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.299
huge new understanding that even more
than the Riemann hypothesis as a result

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:37.309
than the Riemann hypothesis as a result
 

00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:39.610
than the Riemann hypothesis as a result
the proof and the ideas and the proof

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:39.620
the proof and the ideas and the proof
 

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.160
the proof and the ideas and the proof
that prove the reading hypothesis

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.170
that prove the reading hypothesis
 

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.090
that prove the reading hypothesis
inherently must get such a good

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.100
inherently must get such a good
 

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.009
inherently must get such a good
understanding of prime numbers that we

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:45.019
understanding of prime numbers that we
 

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:46.480
understanding of prime numbers that we
will have this whole new way of looking

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.490
will have this whole new way of looking
 

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.309
will have this whole new way of looking
about prime numbers I would guess if

00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319
about prime numbers I would guess if
 

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:49.569
about prime numbers I would guess if
someone was able to prove the Riemann

00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:49.579
someone was able to prove the Riemann
 

00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:51.519
someone was able to prove the Riemann
hypothesis and this whole new technique

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:51.529
hypothesis and this whole new technique
 

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:52.780
hypothesis and this whole new technique
that would open up all kinds of new

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:52.790
that would open up all kinds of new
 

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.749
that would open up all kinds of new
possibilities so yeah if I had to choose

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759
possibilities so yeah if I had to choose
 

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:57.999
possibilities so yeah if I had to choose
one it be the Riemann hypothesis does

00:16:57.999 --> 00:16:58.009
one it be the Riemann hypothesis does
 

00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:59.679
one it be the Riemann hypothesis does
the Riemann hypothesis ever get any of

00:16:59.679 --> 00:16:59.689
the Riemann hypothesis ever get any of
 

00:16:59.689 --> 00:17:03.639
the Riemann hypothesis ever get any of
your brain done I like to sometimes

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:03.649
your brain done I like to sometimes
 

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:06.610
your brain done I like to sometimes
think about some questions connected to

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:06.620
think about some questions connected to
 

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.340
think about some questions connected to
the Riemann hypothesis but the Riemann

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:09.350
the Riemann hypothesis but the Riemann
 

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:13.090
the Riemann hypothesis but the Riemann
hypothesis itself I feel I have no good

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:13.100
hypothesis itself I feel I have no good
 

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.100
hypothesis itself I feel I have no good
intuitive way of even starting to how to

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.110
intuitive way of even starting to how to
 

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.590
intuitive way of even starting to how to
attack that kind of problem but there's

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600
attack that kind of problem but there's
 

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.179
attack that kind of problem but there's
lots of smaller problems connected to

00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:19.189
lots of smaller problems connected to
 

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:20.529
lots of smaller problems connected to
the Riemann hypothesis that are very

00:17:20.529 --> 00:17:20.539
the Riemann hypothesis that are very
 

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.539
the Riemann hypothesis that are very
important for par numbers and those are

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:22.549
important for par numbers and those are
 

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:23.710
important for par numbers and those are
things that I'm very interested in

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720
things that I'm very interested in
 

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.210
things that I'm very interested in
certainly things about quite a lot yeah

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:25.220
certainly things about quite a lot yeah
 

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.570
certainly things about quite a lot yeah
likely to find your N you know your true

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:28.580
likely to find your N you know your true
 

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.760
likely to find your N you know your true
love because the prime numbers are so

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:30.770
love because the prime numbers are so
 

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.250
love because the prime numbers are so
far apart at that large ends of things

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:33.260
far apart at that large ends of things
 

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.710
far apart at that large ends of things
so it's a pretty loveless place you know

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720
so it's a pretty loveless place you know
 

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.480
so it's a pretty loveless place you know
at that end of thing so you get a bigger

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:37.490
at that end of thing so you get a bigger
 

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.500
at that end of thing so you get a bigger
a bigger numbers you might think there's

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.510
a bigger numbers you might think there's
 

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.090
a bigger numbers you might think there's
just no way you're going to find your

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.100
just no way you're going to find your
 

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.580
just no way you're going to find your
true look
