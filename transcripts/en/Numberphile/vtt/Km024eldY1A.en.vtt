00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
How many games of chess are there?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.220
So, there is a popular fact that

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.700
the number of games of chess is greater

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.980
than the number of atoms there are in the observable universe.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.120
This is the fact. Is it true?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.520
Well, the number of games of chess is known as Shannon's number

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.300
so let's find out what is Shannon's number, and how it was worked out.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.540
Claude Shannon. He... in the 1950s he wrote a paper "How to program a computer to play chess"

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.140
...It was about how to program a computer to play chess.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.340
And in that paper he came up with an estimate for how many games of chess there are

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.980
So it is only an estimate.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.860
So he estimated that the number of games of chess would be

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.640
Ten to the power...round about ten to the power 120

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.760
Which is... well, just massive! It's billions and trillions of googles

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.260
It's so massive, that's a huge number.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.460
If we compare that with atoms in the observable universe

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.000
there's about ten to the 80 atoms in the observable universe

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.900
so there are more games of chess

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.740
You could assign billions of games of chess for each atom in the universe.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.040
How did he come up with this massive figure?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.560
So what he decided was, well, he looked at some games of chess and he said

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.980
Well, on average, at any position, there are about thirty legal moves that you can make.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.460
So, the first player would have thirty legal moves he could make

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.920
And if you do two moves, that's the first player then the second player

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.920
Then that would be, for each move by the first player

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.980
the second player would have thirty.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.720
so if was only two moves

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.960
It'd be thirty by thirty

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.880
So that would be NINE HUNDRED already, just with two moves

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.760
Some terminology here: when I'm saying *moves* I actually mean what is called a *ply*

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.580
That means that one player goes first, then the second player goes next, then the next player...

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.260
So in chess terminology a move is the white player then the black player

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.900
So another move would be the white player again, the black player again.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.780
But we're just going to say *moves* to be: each player takes a move

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.740
It's actually called a ply in chess terminology.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.700
So if the first player has 30 legal moves he can make

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.460
Then for each move the second player has another 30 legal moves he can make

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.660
So with just two moves there are nine hundred moves you can make altogether.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.460
If it was three moves, it would be 30 by 30 by 30

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.620
If it was four moves, it would be 30 by 30 by 30 by 30.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.000
Shannon said, Well, a game is about 40 moves.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.920
Ah, that was in chess terminology, so he means 80 plays.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.780
So...

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.940
This is all Shannon did, he said

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.780
A game is about 30 legal moves...

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.060
80 plays

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.960
and that is around about 10 to the 120.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.120
BRADY: Well that is the most wishy-washy...

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.180
JAMES: Yeah. It was only in passing, it was only an estimate, it was only a paragraph of the paper

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.660
And he did this rough estimate, this rough number, to show that if you had a computer

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.860
and it was trying to work out then the future of the game, and trying to work out

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.900
all the legal moves and where this game was going to go

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.440
so that it could make decisions, sort of, how to play next...

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.820
Then, the computer would never make a move

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.220
If it was calculating one game per microsecond it would be until the end of the universe

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.460
it would never play. This was the point Shannon was trying to make with this rough estimate.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.020
So we're going to have a look at a sequence of games there are when each player takes their turn.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.920
So the first move is by white.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.160
So...let's take the first move, and white has twenty legal moves.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.640
So we've got...we've got one here for each pawn, so that's eight.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.400
We've got the double move there by each pawn, so we've got sixteen.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.540
We've got two moves there for each knight...two moves on this side here and here...

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.060
And that's twenty.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.340
So, twenty moves for the first player. Now black takes the next turn

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.840
And for the next turn he can respond with the same twenty moves.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.860
So for each move player 1 takes, black can take twenty moves, so you multiply, it's 20 by 20...

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.180
There are now 400 games that could have happened, already.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.340
With just two moves there are already 400 games that could have happened.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.800
Let's see what happens next. Then suddenly it becomes much more complicated.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:17.880
When white plays next it becomes...8902 moves. Suddenly, phoof! 8000, well, nearly 9000 games that you can play, with just 3 plays.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.440
BRADY: This sounds a lot more precise than what Shannon was doing, this is real numbers.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.340
JAMES: Yeah, these are real numbers. With these small numbers we can work this out.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.080
So far so good -- it's going to get harder with larger numbers.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.100
So, let's write out a few more.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:40.900
The next move is black, and he'll have 197,742.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:49.080
So after black moves again we now have 197,742 possible games that could have been played.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.880
All the possible games we could have done in those four moves is already 200,000.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.220
BRADY: This is crazy.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.640
JAMES: Huge numbers already, huge numbers.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.300
BRADY: Although, you are able to know exactly what the number is, so it just seems like

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.100
if you spend enough time on this you'll be able to...

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.460
JAMES: So OK, we can keep going can't we? So we can keep going

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.280
and these numbers are going to get bigger and bigger

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:19.300
Now, in theory, the total number, the largest number, the longest chess game can be...

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.600
something around 11,800 of these plys.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.620
11,800.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.820
That's invoking though, you have to invoke the 50 move rule, cause you could just go on forever,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.260
if you just ended up with two kings, just going backwards and forths.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.840
A game could last forever. So there is a rule that stops a game lasting forever that says:

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.800
Well, if you've played 50 moves with nothing being captured, and you're just messing about--

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.420
BRADY: Or a pawn being moved, isn't it.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.960
JAMES: Yeah it's a pawn hasn't moved, something hasn't been captured,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.940
or you repeat the board three times. If that happens then you call it a draw.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.740
So there's a cut-off point. Now some people have worked out what the longest possible chess game is...

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.420
It's something around 11,800. There's some disagreement, not much disagreement though,

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.740
Within, a hundred or so of that.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:23.860
So if you see how fast this sequence is growing, can you imagine how many games there are

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.380
altogether. Especially when you're going all the way up to nearly 12,000 moves.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.200
Some of those games would be nonsense games, where you can win,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.500
you've only got one move left and you can win in one move, but you don't,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.440
you start moving other pieces and you start doing other things.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.020
It becomes a massively complex tree of possibilities

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.980
and that's why this number is, just, going off to a HUGE numbers.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.620
Godfrey Hardy, a famous 20th century mathematician

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.400
He tried to estimate the number of chess games there were.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:08.560
His estimate was ten to the power ten to the power fifty.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.180
Let me say that again: it was 10^(10^50).

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:20.660
This is miniscule when you compare it with what Hardy's estimate was.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:28.580
What Shannon was doing was saying, "This is a forty move game, where the average number of moves is thirty."

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:35.300
So he was saying that if there were 80 plays, that's what he's saying,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.600
He's saying this is about ten to the power 120.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.240
That's what Shannon is saying.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.480
So he's not even considering all these other games.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:53.340
So it was Godfrey Hardy, the famous 20th century mathematician - worked at Cambridge, discovered Ramanujan,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.400
He tried to estimate how many games of chess there were.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:04.220
It was actually when he was writing about Ramanujan, cause Ramanujan had sent him a paper which had a large number in it

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.680
He said, "Just to understand how big this number is, if you compare it to the number of games of chess

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.420
I reckon that's 10^(10^50)."

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.420
Was Hardy close? I don't know. He didn't give any working out for this, this was in passing

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.580
I did say a lot of these would be nonsense games; let's try some sensible estimate.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:29.120
If it was, let's say if each player had an average of three sensible moves,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.860
instead of thirty legal moves. Same sort of idea. If we did that...

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:44.500
So instead of 30^80 it would be, say, 3^80. Does that seem more reasonable? Yeah?

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:57.300
So that's 3^80, I can tell you that's around about  10^40. So now not as large as the number of atoms in the observable universe

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.980
Still, still very large though, 10^40.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:10.320
If for example, everyone in the world paired off and they had to play a game of chess every day

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.920
and it had to be a different game every day, and they did that...

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.720
To play all possible games, this 10^40 sensible games

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:28.160
it would still take you trillions and trillions of years to play them all.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.020
Or if you think about it another way

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.220
If we consider all games of chess that have ever been played in history,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:41.860
then that is only a tiny fraction of all the possible games of chess there are to play.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.480
BRADY: I can't think of a better supporter for a video about chess than a company called squarespace.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.980
Now if you want a presence on the web, whether it's a blog, a business, or just a cool way to tell the world about what you're doing,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.860
then squarespace is a super resource.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.140
I host my own blog on squarespace, and it's so quick and hassle-free.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.440
In a matter of minutes I can have anything up on the web, looking great --

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.400
and that's looking great on both computers and mobile devices, which is often the hard bit.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.660
Now whether you're a bit of a novice, or you are a coding grandmaster

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.680
squarespace will give you as little or as much control as you like.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.160
So whatever your endgame, you really should...check them out (see what I did there? "check them out").

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.240
"endgame", it's pretty good that. Anyway.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:32.840
They've got a great range of templates to get started. Then you can tweak them, play around until your heart's content.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.820

As they like to say, "Build it Beautiful"

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.180
BRADY: Do you play chess?

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:06.260
JAMES: I do play chess, I know chess, I'm no expert on chess, I'm no grandmaster.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.520
I play chess for fun perhaps. I used to play chess with my dad.
