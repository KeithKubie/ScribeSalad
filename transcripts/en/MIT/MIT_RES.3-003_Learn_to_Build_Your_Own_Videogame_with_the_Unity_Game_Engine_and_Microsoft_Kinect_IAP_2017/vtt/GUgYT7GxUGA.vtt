GUEST SPEAKER 1: My name is My
name is Abraham, this is Jason.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.110
Jason, Kevin,
[INAUDIBLE] And our team

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.261
was called Speed Racers, and
that now it's called the "Cat's

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:28.760
Cradle."

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.926
That's the name of the game.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:34.700
The change of the name was like
a learning experience, at least

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.740
the way I see it.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.910
And I'm sure my teammates
will expand on this.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.835
So last week, when we did
the little two-day project,

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.752
one of the, I
guess, the pitch we

00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:48.522
took was to make a racing game.

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:51.170
And we had this
plan that we were

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.130
going to use the
roll ball physics

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.240
simulation mechanic
to make it two

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.364
simple wheels for an object.

00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:02.960
And in trying to solve...

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.620
it ended up being a
little harder than that.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.590
And next week we
decided which is going

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.890
to expand on that
same project and try

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.880
to finish the racing [INAUDIBLE]
And the components that we

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.280
tried to figure out and that
we came up with making a game

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.660
is something like a fail
state, things that change

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.564
speed, ramps, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.160
But of the big
debate and the reason

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.882
why it's called "Cat's Cradle"
now rather than "Speed Racers"

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.840
is because we actually
figured out how to make,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.910
well Jason figured out
a way to make a car,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.720
like a functioning you
go forward, you go left,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.130
you go right.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.290
And there was this conversation
what like two days ago, where

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.570
it having the more basic
two balls [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.640
moving something
forward was awkward.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.322
It didn't feel as
good as the car.

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.030
And we had to make a
choice whether we're

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.460
going to do the car,
which was a little more--

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.280
it was softer and nicer to
play with, but also not that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.500
interesting, or
change our premise

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.270
and abandon the racing
game and instead

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.750
keep pushing for
the notion of we

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.600
have two balls and
these move awkwardly.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.580
And so now we have this
awkwardly moving game.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.130
How can we make that you know,
funny or fun or interesting?

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.280
And so that's why we
have "Cat's Cradle."

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.675
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.550
GUEST SPEAKER 1: You
want to show the Kinect?

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.400
STUDENT: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.895
GUEST SPEAKER 1: So now instead
of having a racing car that

00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:41.910
is very cool and on fire, you
have this fun cat [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.330
and the awkwardness
of the mechanic

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.170
became a funny thing
as [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.953
And so it was a lesson
on [INAUDIBLE] awkward

00:02:54.953 --> 00:02:58.567
because we could make the
most amazing [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:58.567 --> 00:02:59.483
mechanics [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:00.390
Jason did it.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.032
Jason made a beautiful
functioning car.

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:08.378
We decided it was better
to have this physics-based,

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:09.350
roll a ball.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.696
Two things [INAUDIBLE] and
to just make it [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:14.696 --> 00:03:26.135
Two [INAUDIBLE] physics and the
programming aspect of it all.

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:29.105
So that was the big
design [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:32.071
have something awkward so we
design for the alternative

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:32.570
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.946
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So
yeah, this looks hard

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:46.430
than it is because [INAUDIBLE]
if you click on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.400
So in a way, it [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.840
So it's a [INAUDIBLE] So
if I move the right one,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.142
he will turn left.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:07.930
And if I move the left,
you'll move to the right.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.410
So I can move them
both in unison

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.050
so that it will go straight.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.530
Yeah, so [INAUDIBLE]
and kind of wiggle it

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.972
around just moving forward.

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:21.450
So excited [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.476
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And actually
we have a version of it

00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:25.434
that works with Kinect.

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:29.418
Right now, this is
working [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:32.406
And it's a very different
experience but not

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:34.900
necessarily one that
makes it better or worse.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.944
This is that if we
embrace the awkward,

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:38.610
you know, [INAUDIBLE]
moving [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.740
awkwardly and moving
[INAUDIBLE] actually,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.190
the fact that it's
a little harder

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.700
makes it funnier
looking at your pushing

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.532
and pulling as trying to test.

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:50.031
So we can try the
the Kinect version

00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:51.810
to see how that [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.478
GUEST SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:56.478 --> 00:04:58.186
GUEST SPEAKER 1: But
yeah, that was the--

00:04:58.186 --> 00:05:00.200
I think that was the
big realization--

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.070
like, work with what you have
and see [INAUDIBLE] doesn't

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.860
deliver what you think was
reported at the beginning

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.210
actually can become a new thing
that has its own mistakes.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.780
We tried, like, a very
nice car like thing

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.620
with the cat [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.500
It's just-- it felt like
we've seen that game before.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.568
Like, a very nice car
moving around-- it's

00:05:20.568 --> 00:05:21.484
like, we've seen that.

00:05:21.484 --> 00:05:25.275
A cat [INAUDIBLE] where two,
like, awkward [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:27.580
are carrying around
a thing with big cat

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.303
almost like the discovery of
more [INAUDIBLE] So here's

00:05:34.303 --> 00:05:35.030
the cat.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.837
The cat's [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:47.763
GUEST SPEAKER 2:
Using the Kinect--

00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:49.138
GUEST SPEAKER 3:
Yeah, so because

00:05:49.138 --> 00:05:51.360
we decide to have not
seen on the player,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.670
so this is actually
a simpler track,

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.040
not like the one that
is so challenging.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.662
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:09.120
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Can we do an
amazing work with the camera?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.720
Those of you who saw
the prototype, the guy

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.060
was standing around
like a crazy.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.952
And now he's
falling [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:20.424
GUEST SPEAKER 2: And the
Kinect is just plugged in.

00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:21.628
GUEST SPEAKER 3: It is.

00:06:21.628 --> 00:06:23.092
STUDENT: Is it on?

00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:24.068
GUEST SPEAKER 3: It is.

00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:25.217
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:26.508
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Put up. reset.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.032
Hopefully it runs [INAUDIBLE]
happening [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:34.740
come on, come on.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.660
And it feels like
you're pushing the bin.

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:42.330
GUEST SPEAKER 3:
And the reason we

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.746
have here two
separate projects is

00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:46.680
because we tried combining
both projects into one,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.000
but we had a lot of conflicts.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.259
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I think
the next iteration will

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.775
have [INAUDIBLE] he's
testing the mechanics to make

00:06:56.775 --> 00:07:00.842
it a little smoother, you know,
add some animations so there

00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:01.550
is more feedback.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.120
Right now, the feedback
is a little limited.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.880
I think that the [INAUDIBLE]
like their suffering

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.296
a lot more than what
they look like right now.

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:09.795
And--

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.440
GUEST SPEAKER 2:
[INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.398
GUEST SPEAKER 3: Sorry?

00:07:17.398 --> 00:07:19.084
GUEST SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:21.580
GUEST SPEAKER 3: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.455
GUEST SPEAKER 1: While
that is going through,

00:07:23.455 --> 00:07:24.746
do you guys have any questions?

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:25.925
What do you guys think?

00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:30.500
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So yeah, it's
[INAUDIBLE] there it goes.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.150
STUDENT: It's the hand charge
are not on a flat surface

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.209
that they can't get
friction to move forward.

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:37.000
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Right
now, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.780
are just-- it's just a mesh
that is replacing [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.230
object that is
acute that has been

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.510
pushed around [INAUDIBLE] body.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.170
STUDENT: So if it [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.086
GUEST SPEAKER 1: It can
move longer, anything.

00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:49.330
And it does [INAUDIBLE]
a new version of it,

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.340
I would like to-- would have had
time to animate the hedgehogs

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.080
and try the steps
and can do something

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.615
a little more
advanced like that.

00:07:59.615 --> 00:08:02.156
STUDENT: You said, like-- spread
your arms out a little more.

00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:04.894
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Ah,
good, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:04.894 --> 00:08:07.072
STUDENT: Because they're
in front of the shoulders.

00:08:07.072 --> 00:08:08.280
STUDENT: I don't know, it's--

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.370
I think it's because
the tables here.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.270
But it's having
trouble tracking.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.750
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:23.080
GUEST SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.612
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
OK, we'll try again.

00:08:26.612 --> 00:08:41.170
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.420
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Here you Are.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.396
Oh no!

00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:47.680
We also [INAUDIBLE] that, like,
following this [INAUDIBLE],,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.565
it will be interesting to see
[INAUDIBLE] like a big cat with

00:08:50.565 --> 00:08:52.940
two [INAUDIBLE] these two
[INAUDIBLE] are carrying around

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.260
a big cake--

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.530
something like that.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.060
And you have, like,
anything-- and you're

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.832
having to control these
two characters [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:03.440
A new version
would probably have

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.673
also a cat that is deattached
and has some sort of physics.

00:09:06.673 --> 00:09:08.173
And you can drop
him and [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.050
very angry-- you know,
something like that.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.462
Keep exploring that notion.

00:09:13.462 --> 00:09:14.398
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:14.398 --> 00:09:17.674
STUDENT: What's the white stuff?

00:09:17.674 --> 00:09:19.300
GUEST SPEAKER 1: He
is just very salty.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.622
It's just like, they're
angry, and like, you know,

00:09:21.622 --> 00:09:24.080
stuff comes out [INAUDIBLE]
replaces with, like, swear word

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.920
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.977
He is, I can't
believe you're doing

00:09:27.977 --> 00:09:29.060
this [INAUDIBLE] you know.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.143
But right now, it's just
like [INAUDIBLE] particle

00:09:31.143 --> 00:09:32.280
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.330
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Initially,
we also wanted so that--

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.590
such that if the cat
tumbles down and then

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.550
the cat will be susceptible to
beat the gravity and just like

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.722
rolls down [INAUDIBLE] of these.

00:09:46.722 --> 00:09:53.600
But when we did that, like,
everything just broke.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.156
Like, when you press play, that
cat just flew to outer space.

00:09:57.156 --> 00:09:58.530
So we had to remove
that feature.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.540
GUEST SPEAKER 1: This is amazing
to see a cat [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.596
GUEST SPEAKER 2: It is actually
not tracking that well.

00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:19.480
STUDENT: I was watching
this work way better

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.030
when you guys were--

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.550
GUEST SPEAKER 1: It was kind
of fun yesterday making it.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.700
It feels like you're a big head.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.900
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Because it
was started one zero position

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.278
where you position yourself.

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:31.736
So the next thing
you need to do is

00:10:31.736 --> 00:10:34.530
to move forward
in the z direction

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.840
closer to the Kinect such
that it increase exact value.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.220
And then the thing should
actually propel you forward.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.450
And if you go backward to that
zero [INAUDIBLE] position,

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.120
it should actually go behind.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.280
So it's like two
differential wheel.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.320
If you want to steer
yourself, you just

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.410
move your leg backward
and your right forward

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.887
or some [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:55.887 --> 00:10:57.970
GUEST SPEAKER 3: I wanted
to just show you the cat

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.360
because it's funny looking.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.484
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yeah, you
can actually take a look

00:11:01.484 --> 00:11:02.360
at the artwork here.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.994
[INAUDIBLE] actually making--
put in a lot of effort making

00:11:05.994 --> 00:11:06.820
this--

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.004
GUEST SPEAKER 3: He's
just like this angry cat.

00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:10.996
Ugh!

00:11:10.996 --> 00:11:13.480
He's so angry.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.360
He's so angry.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:15.982
And--

00:11:15.982 --> 00:11:17.690
STUDENT: So this is
not a standard asset.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.523
GUEST SPEAKER 3: No.

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:20.800
GUEST SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]
scratching [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.654
And he spent like two days.

00:11:22.654 --> 00:11:24.070
GUEST SPEAKER 3:
I should probably

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.200
should have spent more
time doing something

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.260
to help the game actually
work a little smoother.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.470
But I figure, like, if we
have something awkward,

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.144
we can just make something
awkward to move with it.

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:37.770
And so those two [INAUDIBLE]
of that angry cat,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.790
they became the
"Cat's Cradle" game.
