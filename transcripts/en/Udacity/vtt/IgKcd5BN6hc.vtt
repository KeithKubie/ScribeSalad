00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, back to the potential sources of error--the fact that the earth is a sphere, well we decided

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that's not 100% true that the earth is so close to spherical that any error introduced is negligible.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We also decided that the sun's rays don't arrive exactly in parallel and that we're going

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to do more about this in the homework, but the error this introduces turns out to be negligible.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's talk about point 3--do the sun's rays actually arrive vertically in Syene?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now to answer this question, let's think back to how Eratosthenes came to this conclusion.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Eratosthenes had come to this conclusion by hearing that if you look down the well,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
not necessarily a poorly drawn well, but a well in Syene on the summer solstice

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you could see the very bottom--what this meant was that the sun's rays must have been striking

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in such a way that a ray which entered the top of the well can make it all the way to the bottom,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and so his conclusion was that the sun's rays are striking vertically.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now let's see if this is necessarily the case.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Sure, a ray that comes in vertically will make it all the way to the bottom of the well. No problem.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But it's that the only ray that would go from top of the well to the bottom--no.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What about this one--this ray also illuminates the bottom of the well and it comes in at a slight angle.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, let's look at what the maximum possible angle could be that allow one of these rays

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to enter the top of the well and still illuminate the ground below.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And now it would be this ray, if we try to make this angle any steeper, it wouldn't actually hit

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the bottom of the well or it would hit somewhere along the wall.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
How can we calculate this angle?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Well let's make some assumptions about the depths of the well

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the width of the well that Eratosthenes was looking at.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, I'm no well expert but I'm going to assume that this well had a depth of 40 meters.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Those of you who know more about wells than I do can tell me

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if this is a reasonable depth for a well.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm going to assume that the width of the well--from this edge to this edge--was about 1 meter.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, we have the dimensions of our well.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We have an extreme case solar ray coming down and just barely illuminating the bottom of the well.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now I wonder, what angle does this correspond to? We know it's not quite vertical.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Using your new trig skills, I bet you can tell me what this angle Î± is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that this ray is making with the vertical.

00:02:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
