Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.240
&gt;&gt; Welcome to the Library
of Congress,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.080
and to the Young Readers Center.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.200
Have any of you have been to
the Library of Congress before?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.500
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.800
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.050
I see one, two three, four, okay.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:57.630
Thanks for coming back, and I hope
to see the rest of you again soon.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:10.320 position:56%
You're in the biggest library in the
world, but you wouldn't recognize it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.740
in this room, because we,
the Young Readers Center,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:29.950
it's a newer library, a big
library; the biggest one

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:39.820
in the world, and it's
215 years old.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.120
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.400
&gt;&gt; But we, the Young Readers
Center, we're only seven years old.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:58.490
And I'm Karen Jaffe, I'm head
of the Young Readers Center.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.470
And I'm here to invite
you to participate

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.910
in a very special program.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.630
And first I'm going
to ask you a question.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:32.570
When you think of a library,
what do you think of; what?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.930
What's the one thing you
think of in a library?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.070
You can just shout it out.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.610
What is it?

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.910
&gt;&gt; Books.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.210

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.510

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.810
&gt;&gt; Books.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.880
&gt;&gt; Right; and what is it
that we find inside books?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.180
What is it?

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.480
What?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.780
&gt;&gt; Pictures?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.300
&gt;&gt; Okay; what else, what?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.600
&gt;&gt; Words.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:21.040
&gt;&gt; Words. Okay; so we think of
books, and we think of words.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.310
But there are other
things that have words.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.220
And they have things that
go along with the words,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.690
and that's called "music."

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.200
And in order to get a song,
you have music, and you have --

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.500
&gt;&gt; The words.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.040
&gt;&gt; Words. So today we have two very
special musicians and songwriters,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.340
Cathy Fink, and Marcy Marxer.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.640
And they write their own
songs, they sing them,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.940
and they play instruments.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.240
They do everything.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.540
So now we're looking at a different
way of learning about words,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.840
and what they mean, and
having fun at the same time.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.140
So here you go.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.440
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: Hi, everybody.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.740
Well, we are really
excited to be here,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.040
partly because we love
the Library of Congress.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.340
And we do make up or write a lot of
our own songs, but sometimes we go

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.640
to libraries, places like
the Library of Congress,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.940
and in fact we've been right
here, and we do research.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.240
We look up old songs.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.540
And we try and find old songs
that maybe people haven't heard

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.840
in 200 years, and see if we
can make them come alive.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.140
Now, there's a not so old
song that you already know.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.440
We're not going to sing it
yet; we might sing it later.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.740
But you probably already
know the song called,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.040
"This Land is Your Land."

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.340
Do you guys know that?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.640
&gt;&gt; No.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.940
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: Not yet, all right?

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.240
Well, the man who wrote
that song is very famous.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.540
And the Library of Congress
has a lot of his songs,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.840 position:56%
maybe a hundred of them, maybe more.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.140
And it is a song that gives us a
chance to say hello to each other.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.440
Now, before we get started,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.740
everybody say hello
with just your hands.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.040

Excellent; you guys are good.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.540
Okay; now we're going to say
hello in a very special way

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.380
that Woody Guthrie taught
us how to say hello.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.450
Because there are lots of ways to
say hello, different languages,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.490
just different words in
our English language.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.370
And we're going to
say, "How do you do?"

we say, "How do you do,"

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.290
we're going break a big wave and
smile like this, "How do you do?"

&gt;&gt; How do you do?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.450
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: Now, one fun
thing about having music

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.730
at the library is we are
allowed to make noise.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.230
A lot of times, the libraries,
they don't want you to make noise

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.550
because people are reading, and
studying, and concentrating.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.600
But in this room this morning,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.060
all of our noises are
going to work together.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.500
So whenever Marcy or I say, "How do
you do," you're going to answer us

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.930
like this, "How do you do?"

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.520
Now, even your teachers
are going to answer us,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.250
because we don't want them to think
that they're not a part of this.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.630
And furthermore, kids, when
you go back to your classroom

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.930

they haven't practiced,

but it might not be the most
important meal of the day,

before lunch.

once, and get people singing

to the bus stop, and he'd go home.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:09.430
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: How many songs
have we learned from other people?

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.730
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: Hmm.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:14.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: My guess is that over
the years, we've probably learned

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.820 position:56%
about 2,000 songs from other people.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.400
And then over the years, we've
probably written about 500 songs.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.700
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.000
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: Other questions?

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.300
Yes?

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.600
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.900
What?

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.200
&gt;&gt; I forgot.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.500
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: You forgot?

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.800
That's okay.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.100
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: That's okay.

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.400
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: Do you
have another question?

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.700
&gt;&gt; Can you change the
songs to [inaudible]?

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.000
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: Can you
change the songs for what?

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.730
&gt;&gt; Jewels; like jury, jewels.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.120
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: Jury jewels?

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.420
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: Oh, sure.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.720
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: In this song --

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.020
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: Do
whatever you want.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.170
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: You can but, you
know, this song isn't so much

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:50.360
about things, jewels are things, as
it is about feelings and equality.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.870
So that would be a
tricky thing in this song.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:57.880
You know, some songs are about
things, but this one is really

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.220
about love and equality,

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:10.000
and it feels like jewels don't
really fit [overlapping].

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.630
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: Well, you know,
that's an idea I'd never heard.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:27.300
It would be really, really fun to
go giving jewelry out to everybody.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.120
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: So we've got
time for one last question.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.640
Is there somebody who
has not asked one,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.880
someone who has not
had their hand up?

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.180
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: Oh.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.480
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink: You haven't.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.550
&gt;&gt; Do you like the other kinds
of songs that people hear?

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.310
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: Yes;
we like a lot of songs.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:57.250
I like music from almost
every type of music.

00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:02.080
I like pop music, I like
rock and roll music.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.380
And --

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.680
&gt;&gt; Cathy Fink We both do; and
you know what, when you leave,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.980
you're getting a CD of ours
called "Banjo the Beat Box,"

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.280
and it's got a combination of
folk music and hip-hop on it.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.580
We love hip-hop.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.880
And it's got a friend of ours with
us, a guy named "Christylez Bacon,"

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.180
and he does hip-hop together
with us, and it's crazy fun.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.480
We want to thank you for being
such a fabulous audience.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.780
Marcy and I are going to
thank you in sign language.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.080
&gt;&gt; Marcy Marxer: [Overlapping].

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.380
And now thank you with our hands.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.680
[Applause]

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.980
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
