PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
The title of our talk

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.500
is Instant Buy Everywhere,
How to Turbocharge Mobile

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.520
Monetization, and so how you
can score more goals when

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.180
it comes to
monetizing your apps.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.530
So I'm Prakash Hariramani.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.650
I'm Product Manager of
the Google Wallet team.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.079
And with me is--

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.537
MICHAEL GALPIN:
I'm Michael Galpin.

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:19.480
I'm the engineer
on the Wallet team.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.280
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
And today we're

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.654
going to talk
about a few things.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.190
But before we talk
about the details,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.300
I just want to mention that we
were here last year standing

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.830
in front of you when we launched
this product called Instant

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.980
Buy.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.360
We've come a long
way since then.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.850
And a lot of it is thanks to
you all and your enthusiasm.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.630
So the three themes we have for
today are platform expansion.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.010
So Instant Buy today is now
on all major mobile commerce

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.810
platforms.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.910
What I mean by that is Android,
iOS, mobile web, and desktop.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.080
Instant Buy everywhere.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.130
The second theme is
developer expansion.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.110
So we're really gratified.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.820
We'll talk about some
of the case studies

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.380
and the developer
interest we generated,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.790
and the number of developers who
are live, and more importantly,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.959
growing benefits
on the platform.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.000
And then the last thing
we're going to talk about

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.330
is a little bit beyond payments.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.260
Because to us, commerce
is not just payments.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.340
It's about the whole
shopping experience.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.160
So I use my Android phone
for my entire journey

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.090
when I'm shopping.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.440
It's not just when I'm
making the payment,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.606
but right from the time I'm
searching for something,

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.440
when I want to have
my loyalty or offer

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.230
information be part
of that journey.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.950
So we'll talk about that, too.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.880
So first let's
talk about mobile.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.960
So we are living in
a mobile-first world.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.280
And this is a
mobile-first product.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.870
So I'm sure you've seen
similar charts like this.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.880
Mobile commerce is
something that's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.270
growing extremely rapidly.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.080
As you can see in this
chart, one of every five

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.130
transactions-- roughly
20% of all transactions

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.040
are on mobile devices.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.170
Mobile commerce volume is
supposed to be 84 billion

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.530
in 2014.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.960
And if you take
a step back, it's

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.080
amazing that 20% of all
transactions that are online

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.060
will be mobile.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.440
That's almost double what
it was two years ago.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.710
So that was the good news.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.800
So what's the bad news?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.380
Or what's the sobering news?

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.730
The sobering news is a typical
mobile checkout still takes

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.526
about 24 steps.

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:19.900
I'd like to have
a show of hands.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.620
How many of you
have tried to make

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.570
a purchase on a mobile device--
let's say, buying a ticket,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.770
or take out-- and have had
to abandon it midstream?

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.470
OK.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.260
Well, there is hope.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.910
We'll talk about how we
can solve that pain point.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.430
So why is it so difficult to buy
something from a mobile device?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.340
Why 24 steps?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.190
So let's take a
typical check out flow.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.140
What happens?

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.560
You select what you want.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.250
You put it into your cart.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.800
You confirm your order.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.630
And then the pain starts.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.860
So at a high level, the pain
points are in two broad areas.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.490
One area is entering your
credit card information,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.266
your expiration date,
your billing address.

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:00.890
And God forbid if
your shipping address

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.520
differs from your
billing address.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.190
The second pain point is
registration and signing up.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.760
So together, when you put
these pain points together,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.630
no wonder there's a
problem with conversion.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.510
99% of mobile shoppers
abandon a purchase mid-flow.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.300
Now I started the theme
saying turbocharging

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.800
mobile monetization.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.762
And to get mobile
monetization, you

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:24.970
need to have high conversion.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.850
To have high conversion, you
need to have less friction.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.020
And what we just talked about
is actually adding friction.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.305
So how do we solve this?

00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:33.480
This is staggering.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.530
You, as developers, are losing
money because of high friction.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.229
So how do we solve this
problem for monetization?

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.520
So we'd like to offer a
solution, Google Wallet Instant

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.430
Buy.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.050
And I want to walk
through how we

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.020
believe we have
solved this problem.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.860
So the first thing we
have done is faster

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.715
checkout for physical goods.

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:52.340
I'd like to have a
show of hands again.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.840
How many of you have made
a purchase on any Google

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.160
property, like Google Play, or
Drive, or anything like a game,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.490
or a book, or
something on Google?

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.110
OK.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.400
Well, the good news is you
all have a Google Wallet.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.310
And the better news is you can
use that Google Wallet to make

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.560
purchases not just on Play
and Google properties,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.140
but also on
third-party merchants--

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.209
the ones that have
integrated with Instant Buy.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.290
So speed is everything
in mobile commerce.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.680
And remember I said earlier
there's two big pain points.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.013
One is a pain point of entering
credit card information.

00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:28.180
Well, by virtue of you
having a Google Wallet,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.300
by virtue of having made a
purchase on a Google property,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.000
you've eliminated
that pain point.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.101
So it's really two taps,
two clicks, and check out.

00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:38.600
The second pain
point I talked about

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.080
was skipping
registration and sign-in.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.420
So don't make your customers
fill out these registration

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.720
forms with special character
passwords and caps and all

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.490
the other hoops.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.950
If you integrate with
Google Single Sign-On,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.380
essentially, you can
eliminate that one step.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.115
Anyone who has a
Google identity,

00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:58.490
by virtue of having set up a
Gmail account or having used

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.720
another Google service, can
enter those credentials.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.095
And I'm going to talk about
this also in our case studies

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:07.410
because developers like
yourself, who have integrated

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.370
both Single Sign-On
and Instant Buy,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.232
have found higher conversion.

00:05:12.232 --> 00:05:13.940
So let's talk about
security because what

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.586
I talked about earlier
was the convenience.

00:05:16.586 --> 00:05:18.210
Traditionally,
convenience and security

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.890
has been a zero sum game,
if you can have something

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.010
very convenient at the expense
of security or vice versa.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.650
We believe that's
a false choice.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.310
And we believe we have
raised the bar on both.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.463
So with convenience,
like I said earlier,

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.546
if you use Single Sign-On--
and actually if you're

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:34.100
on an Android
device, you're always

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.680
logged in-- we believe we have
solved that friction problem.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.230
So what are we doing
about security?

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.771
How do we make sure
the transaction's

00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:43.460
secure both for you, as
a developer or merchant,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.880
and for the end user,
which is your customer?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.340
Well, one is we generate
a one-time virtual card

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.650
for every transaction.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.370
It's like a one-time
Discover card.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.180
So it's unique for
that transaction,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.190
and that protects your user.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.000
The other thing we do is we
have a very sophisticated risk

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.780
engine.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.660
So if we suspect fraud, we
will challenge the user, and in

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.130
some cases, deny
the transaction.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.671
And that protects
you as a developer.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.560
The next question that always
comes up is integration.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.274
How easy or difficult
is this to integrate?

00:06:16.274 --> 00:06:17.940
So the good news is
it's only one or two

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.260
weeks of integration.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.440
And Michael's going to talk
about something we just

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.820
recently released in the
last few months, which

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.330
is called Wallet Fragment.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.030
So that's made the integration
process even easier.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.410
But there's one other important
point with integration.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.490
We do not get in the middle
of your payment processor

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.720
or acquirer.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.090
So when we generate this
one-time Discover card,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.170
it can ride the rails of
your existing processor.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.340
So if you're using a
Stripe or a Paymentech,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.190
you don't need to
make any changes.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.550
You can just continue using
that payment processing.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.717
Now that helps in many ways.

00:06:48.717 --> 00:06:50.966
One is many of our merchants
and developers have said,

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:52.890
I want to keep that
existing relationship.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.290
The second way it helps is
by minimizing the integration

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.250
burden, because you
don't have to change

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.510
any of your
downstream processing.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.520
And the other thing I'll add
is, don't take my word for it.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.390
We have a partner showcase.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.380
We have three or four partners
there that you will see,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.340
Eat24, JackThreads,
and Hotel Tonight.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.031
So I'd encourage you to go
there and ask them firsthand

00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:14.405
about the integration
experience.

00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:18.610
So finally, what's the catch?

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.320
This sounds good.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.620
Well, there is no catch.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.130
There are no additional fees.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.610
We don't charge
anything for using

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.370
Google Wallet Instant Buy.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.890
Like I said earlier, you will
need a payment processor,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.119
so you'll continue
paying those fees.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.660
So in summary, I
think we have talked

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.420
about how we can
remove the pain points.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.540
Paint point of entering
your payment information.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.530
Pain point of registration
and signing up.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.440
How it's secure and convenient.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.460
And we raised the bar on both.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.950
Lightweight integration.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.350
And no additional fees.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.390
So before we talk about
where we want to go, let's

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.640
talk about where we have been.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.473
So like I said at the
beginning of the talk,

00:07:56.473 --> 00:07:59.650
it's been about a year since we
launched Instant Buy on Android

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.677
and Michael and I
stood in front of you.

00:08:01.677 --> 00:08:02.760
We made you some promises.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.230
So we actually have been
able to fulfill the promises.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.560
And when we talk
about case studies,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.990
I'll elaborate on those.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.347
So May was our launch
on Android at I/O.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:14.430
This was a limited launch.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.270
We had about a dozen or so
developers we announced.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.660
The next milestone
we hit was October.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.982
So we opened up sandbox
access to everyone.

00:08:22.982 --> 00:08:25.440
In fact, I would encourage any
of you who have a mobile app

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.760
or site that accepts
payments, I would

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.700
encourage you to
go to our sandbox,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.020
go to our developer site,
and kick the tires with it.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.480
The next milestone
we had was this year.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.799
And we launched two things.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.110
One is Wallet Fragment,
which I talked about.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.549
And Michael will do more
justice to this than me.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.150
The other thing
is Wallet Balance.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.880
So I use my Google Wallet a
lot for sending and receiving

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.090
money.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.450
Now I can use that same
balance for making a purchase

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.024
on an Instant Buy merchant.

00:08:54.024 --> 00:08:55.440
And Michael's going
to actually do

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.240
a demonstration on that, too.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.920
And then, just hot off
the press, earlier in June

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.690
we launched on iOS.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.310
So now we, again, continuing
the theme of Instant

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.970
Buy everywhere, we
are now supported

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.717
on all major mCommerce
platforms, including iOS.

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.550
MICHAEL GALPIN: Prakash,
this is Google I/O.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.280
I don't think anybody
here is using iOS.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.490
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So on
that note, let's do a demo.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.520
And I'm starving, Michael.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.390
I didn't get a chance
to get breakfast.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.990
I got so excited
about this talk,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.005
so I thought let me
just order some food

00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:30.005
while we're up on stage.

00:09:30.005 --> 00:09:31.090
MICHAEL GALPIN: Sounds good.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.440
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So this
is one of my favorite apps.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.480
It's Eat24.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.040
And for those of you
who were here yesterday,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.100
there was a demo of
Eat24 on Android Wear.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.930
So besides that you can also
use it on an iOS device.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.650
So let me try Pebbles Deli Cafe.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:51.500
So I can order
something right now.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.924
Well, iOS devices.

00:09:54.924 --> 00:10:01.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.615
OK, let's give it one more shot.

00:10:06.317 --> 00:10:07.279
OK.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:10.165
AUDIENCE: Apparently,
you're getting started up.

00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:13.080
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So while
switching back, we'll be--

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.740
We'll come back to this.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.920
But I would encourage you
to come to the Eat24 booth

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.400
and give a shot on
all major platforms.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.940
MICHAEL GALPIN: The iOS gods
are getting their revenge now.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.820
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
So one thing I

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.150
said earlier was I was really
gratified that we have-- thanks

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.652
to you all, thanks to all
the developer support we got,

00:10:34.652 --> 00:10:37.010
we've come a long
way since last year.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.920
So this is the
representative sample

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.610
of all the different
verticals we are across.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.040
As you can see, some
few highlights here.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.676
Travel is one of the largest
verticals in mCommerce.

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:52.800
So we are really gratified.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.710
We have almost all the
major travel companies here,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.500
like Priceline, like Expedia,
like Orbitz, like Travelocity.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.940
The other thing I want
to flag is Order Ahead.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.419
So besides Eat24 we also
have Domino's Pizza.

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:07.710
We launched with them recently.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.550
It's another one of my
favorite Order Ahead apps.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.260
We have a lot of
traction in retail.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.800
The other thing I
want to talk about

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.110
is we're really gratified
that many of these

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.710
are mobile-first companies.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.900
So I said earlier, we are
a mobile-first product

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.740
in a mobile-first world.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.700
And many of these companies are
not just integrating with us,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.230
they are actually transforming
the whole customer experience.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.450
So for example, Uber
pioneered rights sharing.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.110
Eat24 transformed the
take out experience.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.190
Airbnb transformed the
hotel and tourism industry.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.350
Hotel Tonight has transformed
last minute bookings.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.050
So we're really excited that
these companies have actually

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.610
made us part of their journey.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.070
And when I say us, I don't
just mean Google Wallet Instant

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.550
Buy, but the entire
Google stack.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.970
So what do I mean by that?

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.570
So if you look at our partner
showcase, with Hotel Tonight,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.120
not only can you pay
conveniently in two clicks

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.890
with Google Wallet
Instant Buy, you

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.990
can have keyless entry
to your hotel room.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.860
I hate standing in
a lobby when I'm

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.250
trying to check into a hotel.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.690
I'd love to be able to
just go to my room door

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.240
and know where I'm checking in.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.470
JackThreads.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.320
Not only can I buy
something fashionable,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.000
I can actually try it
on in a virtual Hangout

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.770
before I buy it.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.879
And you can see this in action
today at the partner showcase.

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:22.670
MICHAEL GALPIN: And
you've got to check out

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.640
the Android TV app from Eat24.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.320
I know Prakash will want to
maybe order that bagel there.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.060
It's Android, so it'll work.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.540
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So
I can be hungry, lazy,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.470
and stylish at the same time.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.220
OK.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.060
So let's talk a little
bit about case studies.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.039
As I said earlier, we made
some promises last year

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:46.830
about this product.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.850
So one of the promises
we made was conversion.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.808
And the good news is
we've been able to deliver

00:12:50.808 --> 00:12:51.930
on that promise.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.710
And again, this goes
to attack the problem,

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.920
the 99% abandonment rate.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.940
So Ruelala, as you
know, is a destination

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.970
for desired brands at
members only prices.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.660
They were our launch
partner last year.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.560
They saw a 400%
increase in conversion.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.680
And they also saw 50%
more repeat purchases.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.090
So again, talking
about monetization.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.510
Continuing on that theme, Fancy.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.020
They saw a 20%
increase in conversion.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.380
And they also had a 14%
increase in average order size.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.475
Priceline.

00:13:23.475 --> 00:13:24.850
Again, like I
said, we are really

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.740
gratified we have all the major
online travel agencies that

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.370
have integrated
with Instant Buy.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.620
And they saw a 71%
higher conversion rate.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.270
And they also saw
a lot of traction

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.990
with the share of Google
Wallet transactions on Android.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.480
And finally, Eat24.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.150
So the common theme, as you
have noticed across these case

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.100
studies, is conversion.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.260
So 70% increase in conversion.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.550
One of every three purchases
on their Android devices

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.220
is a Google Wallet transaction.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.690
And we have launched with
them for just about six months

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.120
or so.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.885
And Google Wallet users are
72% more likely to return.

00:13:59.885 --> 00:14:01.620
So again, going back
to turbocharging

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.810
mobile monetization, you
get higher conversion,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.105
more repeat users, higher
average order size.

00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:09.480
The other thing
I would recommend

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.340
is-- we have all these case
studies posted publicly.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.680
I just gave you the headlines.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.193
And this is all on
our website, so I

00:14:16.193 --> 00:14:19.650
would encourage you to go
check it out for yourself.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.000
And with that, I'm going to
transition it to Michael.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.487
MICHAEL GALPIN: OK.

00:14:26.487 --> 00:14:28.070
So as Prakash
mentioned, overstock.com

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.740
launched a new version
of their app recently

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.600
that integrates Google Wallet.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.970
So now we're going to do
another demo-- hopefully,

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.450
this one goes a little
better-- to show you guys

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.964
what the Overstock
app looks like.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:46.960
So could we-- OK.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.620
So in the app there's
lots of awesome things

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.980
you can buy from Overstock.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.370
I've picked out a
FIFA World Cup soccer

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.270
ball that looked pretty cool.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.530
So I'm going to purchase it.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.290
This is their cart page.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.240
You'll notice the beautiful
Buy with Google button

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.416
down there at the bottom.

00:15:07.416 --> 00:15:09.040
So of course, I'm
going to tap on that.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.210
This brings up the
Wallet UI where

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.911
I can use whatever credit
card I want to use,

00:15:17.911 --> 00:15:20.160
any credit card I've used
to buy anything from Google,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.660
buy anything from
the Play Store.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.200
Maybe I've got some Candy Crush
and app purchases I've made.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.300
All those cards will be
available to me there.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.820
And a shipping
address to ship to.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.861
Of course, Overstock
requires a shipping address,

00:15:32.861 --> 00:15:35.120
since they're going to send
me this great soccer ball.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.400
And also notice that I
can use my Wallet balance

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.440
for this transaction.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.310
I see I've got $21 in there.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.020
That means Prakash must have
paid me for our World Cup bet.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.315
I bet there'd be at
least one biting that

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:50.750
would happen during the event.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.525
And Prakash paid me by Gmail.

00:15:53.525 --> 00:15:55.110
So I've got some
extra cash in there.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.700
So let's use that
for my purchase.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.770
OK.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.804
So now I just go to the
Overstock checkout page.

00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:07.220
I see some of the
same information

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.320
here that I just
picked-- I'm using

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.450
Google Wallet, what
card I'm using.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.700
And I'm using my
Wallet balance as well.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.290
I see my shipping address here.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.800
So I can look over this,
make sure it looks good.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.609
If I want to change it, I
just tap on the Change button.

00:16:21.609 --> 00:16:23.400
But everything looks
good here, so I'm just

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.608
going to go ahead and Submit.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.920
And that's it.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.720
Just like that I'm done with
my purchase from Overstock.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.600
My soccer ball's on its way.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.050
They showed that I paid with
my Google Wallet account,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:44.340
so I didn't have to go in and
type in a credit card number

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.245
or any of that, type
in my shipping address.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.060
OK.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.200
So there were a few
things we saw there.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.622
And I want to go back through
them a little slower now.

00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:00.080
As you see, we can
go through check

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.770
out very quickly
using Google Wallet.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.200
But let's take things
a little bit slower.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.780
The first step in
integration and in that flow

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.460
there was requesting was
called a Masked Wallet.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.210
That might sound
kind of mysterious,

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.869
but it's really just your
wallet information, your payment

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.829
information, and an address.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.230
We call it masked because
we only share the last four

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.795
digits of your
credit card number.

00:17:22.795 --> 00:17:24.420
So we just tell
Overstock, hey, they're

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.980
going to pay with
Visa ending in 1234.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.790
And we give Overstock,
in this case,

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.270
your shipping address,
since they probably

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.416
need that to calculate
shipping cost or taxes.

00:17:39.416 --> 00:17:41.870
So that's the first step is
getting that masked wallet

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.860
from Google.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.040
The next step is displaying
that information.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.370
So when we saw the Checkout
screen on Overstock,

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.490
they showed that same
masked wallet information.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.360
So the user sees it.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.200
The user knows, OK, yeah, this
is going to the right address.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.410
And this is charging
the right credit card.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.590
Once you get a chance
to review that,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.260
then you can submit the order.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.760
And that's when
Overstock asked us

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.090
for what we call a Full Wallet.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.500
A Full Wallet is where we
generate a one-time card

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.830
that we then give to Overstock,
plus, again, the shipping

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.900
address, since that's
an important part

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.500
of the transaction.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.627
That credit card is just a
normal credit card number,

00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:23.210
just like a number that a user
would have typed in themselves.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.570
There is no difference with it.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.140
So they can just take that, send
it to their back end systems,

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.990
to their order
management systems,

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.460
send it to their
payment processor,

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.890
just like they would with
any other credit card,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.960
and then start the
order management flow.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.490
Now this flow hasn't changed
really at all from a year ago

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.712
when we launched the product.

00:18:43.712 --> 00:18:45.170
But from our launch
partners we get

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.230
a lot of really useful feedback.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.930
And one of things we realized
was the first two steps here,

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.960
the Masked Wallet and
Display Mask Wallet

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.540
steps, a lot of times those are
really, really similar for each

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.330
of our partners
who've integrated.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.670
It's not always the same for
everybody, but in many cases

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.710
it is.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.910
And so we thought, is there a
way that we can learn from this

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.460
and make it even
easier for folks?

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.570
And that's where we got the
idea for the Wallet Fragment.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:17.702
The Wallet Fragment
has a couple of modes.

00:19:17.702 --> 00:19:21.260
If you go back to the Overstock
app, in that Cart page,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.910
do you see that Buy
with Google button?

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.520
That's the Wallet Fragment.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.190
That's the Wallet Fragment
in the Button Mode.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.665
And so it's just displaying
that Buy with Google button.

00:19:30.665 --> 00:19:32.040
There's a couple
options you have

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.570
there for changing the text.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.210
You can do a Buy Now if
you like, for example.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.400
And the button is
very, very re-sizable.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.550
It will very dynamically
fit into whatever space

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.990
you tell it to fit into.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.470
And it's just like a
normal view in Android

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.260
that you can give it all the
different kinds of layout

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.835
parameters you're used to.

00:19:51.835 --> 00:19:54.110
You don't have to learn any
kind of new special syntax

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.690
to get this to fit into
your UI very nicely.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.100
So the button displays there.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.640
And it handles all its own taps.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.710
So when I tapped
on it, Overstock

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.200
didn't have to write any
code to handle my tap.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.645
The button itself
handled the tap.

00:20:06.645 --> 00:20:08.145
The Wallet Fragment
handled the tap.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.240
That brought up the Wallet UI.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.030
And then at the
end of that flow,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.522
we returned a Masked
Wallet to Overstock.

00:20:16.522 --> 00:20:18.980
We returned that Masked Wallet
via the "on activity result"

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.840
call back, just like
our existing APIs.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.310
So no change there.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.195
We still returned the
data to the applications

00:20:27.195 --> 00:20:28.050
in the same way.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:34.630
The next screen we saw was the
checkout page on Overstock.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.680
Now take a look at the
top part of that screen.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.590
You see the payment method,
the Google Wallet, the shipping

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.200
address, and the Change
buttons over there.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.960
That's the Wallet
Fragment again.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.390
But this time, it's
in the Details mode.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.630
Now the rest of the screen--
the action bar, the item

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.150
information, the total
tax, Submit button,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.040
all those things, that's
just the Overstock app there.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.500
All they've done is drop in
our fragment on the screen.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.960
But you couldn't really
tell that these are actually

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.280
coming from two
different processes.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.852
That's because we allow a lot
of customization of the Wallet

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:11.390
Fragment, especially
in Details mode.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.910
You can customize the background
colors, the text colors,

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.800
text sizes, the button colors.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.890
You can provide
your own drawables.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.430
We wanted to make it where
this could fit in seamlessly

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.860
to the existing application,
so that it looked

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.510
like it was built by Overstock.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.330
But actually, this
was built by Google.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.350
All this UI is being created
separately and injected

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.610
into the Overstock application.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.660
Once again, you have the
Change buttons there.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.620
And any taps of
those buttons are

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.940
handled by the Wallet
Fragment itself.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.189
So if the user wanted
to change it and say,

00:21:47.189 --> 00:21:49.230
actually, oh, let me change
what shipping address

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.770
to send this to, then,
once again, a new Masked

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.380
Wallet would be created and
returned to the Overstock

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.230
application via "on
activity result."

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:59.240
So if they had to
then recalculate

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.510
shipping costs or sales tax,
they could do that, of course.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:08.092
So Wallet Fragment
addresses one issue of, here

00:22:08.092 --> 00:22:10.300
are these common things we
see in these applications,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.810
can we make it easier?

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:16.430
But just how much
easier could we make it?

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:20.030
So let's take a look at the
code for using Wallet Fragment.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.250
There's just three
steps to using it.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.990
First, is you create a fragment.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.824
We have a nice little
Builder method for it.

00:22:27.824 --> 00:22:29.781
And you have to tell it
what mode to put it in.

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:31.150
We saw the Button mode.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.360
We saw the Details mode.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.950
So you just tell it here
what mode to put it in.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.310
Next, you initialize it.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.690
And this is where you give a
Masked Wallet request to it.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.335
The Masked Wallet request is
how you specify things like,

00:22:43.335 --> 00:22:45.960
hey, I need a shipping address,
or maybe I need a phone number,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.110
or I don't need a phone
number, or maybe I

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.740
don't need a shipping
address at all.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.185
That's where you specify
those types of things,

00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:52.900
so we know what
kind of data to make

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.150
sure to return to
your application.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.610
So you initialize the Fragment
with that request information.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.150
And then this is just
an Android fragment.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.020
So the way you add it
to your application

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.180
is just like you would any other
fragment, in this case, using

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.930
a fragment to transaction.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.840
You can actually reference
the Wallet Fragment via XML

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.170
as well, if you like to use
XML to do all your layouts.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.040
Either option works.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.415
It's just like a
normal fragment.

00:23:16.415 --> 00:23:18.123
So you just drop it
into your application

00:23:18.123 --> 00:23:20.340
just like any other
fragment you would do.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.907
And that's it.

00:23:21.907 --> 00:23:23.240
So we think this is pretty easy.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.640
We think you can really
eliminate a lot of code.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.390
In fact, we integrated a Wallet
Fragment into our sample code.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.690
So if you go to the Google
Play services client

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.090
library and the
SDK add-on, you'll

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.700
see the sample
application for Wallet.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.400
And if you get it
today, you'll have

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.920
a version that uses
Wallet Fragment.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.340
Now some of you may recognize
the screen shot here.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.824
Many folks here use the
Gerrit code review tool.

00:23:53.824 --> 00:23:55.240
If you do any
Android development,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.640
it's the defacto way
you do code reviews.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.450
So this was the change where we
dropped in the Wallet Fragment

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.410
and removed the previous code.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.640
Altogether, we got rid
of 800 lines of code

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.920
from our sample
application by switching

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.720
to using the Wallet Fragment.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.042
Now if you're a new
developer, new to Wallet,

00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:17.000
you won't even want to
bother with the old way.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.074
Just go straight to using
the Wallet Fragment.

00:24:19.074 --> 00:24:20.990
If you used it on an
existing integration then

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.600
you can really eliminate
a lot of code like we did.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.650
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: 1,100
lines of code, Michael?

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.640
I'm just a Product Manager.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.848
I didn't realize developers
write that much code just

00:24:28.848 --> 00:24:29.560
for a button.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.309
MICHAEL GALPIN: Yeah,
it actually is true.

00:24:31.309 --> 00:24:33.540
When we're not watching
World Cup games,

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.647
we do write a lot of code.

00:24:35.647 --> 00:24:37.730
But with Wallet Fragment,
you can write less code.

00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:41.680
OK.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.790
So Wallet Fragment
makes it even easier

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.150
to integrate Instant Buy.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.880
But again, it
wouldn't even matter

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.215
if Instant Buy wasn't
a compelling product.

00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:55.740
As Prakash went over some
of these points earlier,

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.990
the reasons you want
to use Instant Buy.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.810
The top two here--
faster checkout,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.780
don't make people type
in credit card numbers.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.790
Use the credit cards
they've already got.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.770
Skip registration and sign-in.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.010
Don't make someone
have to remember

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.720
some other crazy password
that they're probably

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.480
going to forget or just going
to use the same password they've

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.310
used everywhere else and create
some more security problems.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.100
Just use Google
Sign-In for that.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.420
It's more secure.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.720
It's secure for the users.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.160
They are able to protect
their information.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.380
They don't share their
full credit card numbers.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.650
It's more secure for you guys.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.020
Google's risk engine is
always looking out for fraud,

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.890
always protecting
the transactions.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.360
And then you saw how lightweight
the integration can be.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.110
I just showed you the
Wallet Fragment part

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.036
which made it even easier.

00:25:47.036 --> 00:25:48.410
But as Prakash
mentioned earlier,

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.493
most developers are able
to do all the integration

00:25:50.493 --> 00:25:53.110
in about a week.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.110
We try to keep it super light.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.190
On Android, we're part
of Google Play services.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.170
So if you get the Play
Services client library,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.990
just compile it into your code.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.250
You may already have the
Play Services Client Library,

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:10.240
if you're using things like
Sign-In, or Maps, or Google+.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.580
Any of those things, it's
the same client library.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.259
And finally, no additional
fees, of course.

00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:18.800
We're just giving
you the credit card

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.350
that you're using, just like
you would any other credit card.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.280
So you send it to your
payment processor.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.120
So there's nothing
extra happening here.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.290
No extra fees from Google.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.730
So we talked
earlier about how we

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.410
want to go not just in
payments, but really Wallet

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.580
is going beyond
payments into commerce.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.480
So I'm going to hand
it back over to Prakash

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.067
to talk about how
we're doing that.

00:26:42.067 --> 00:26:43.150
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Great.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.750
Thank you, Michael.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.530
So just for some
context, last year at I/O

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.570
we introduced something
called Wallet Objects.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.900
So essentially, it's
the notion of digitizing

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.690
your entire physical wallet,
not just your payment cards,

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.180
but your loyalty
cards, your offers,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.000
and putting it into
the Google Cloud

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.310
and accessing it
from any device.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:09.840
So I personally get inundated
with emails, with offers.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.710
I sign up for loyalty programs.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.580
I forget what I signed up for.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.510
And then when I
actually need to use it,

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.770
I don't have a contextual
way to retrieve it.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.350
So that's the problem
we are solving.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.280
We are freeing your
customers from having

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.290
to carry these physical cards
for loyalty, these printed

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:25.940
offers.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.740
When they want to redeem a
coupon, all they have to do

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.560
is save to Google on your
mobile app or your site,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.230
and they're done.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.990
But there's more
to it than that.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.960
So the other thing is
branding and reach.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.112
If you have a loyalty card
that you put to save to Google

00:27:44.112 --> 00:27:45.820
you get [INAUDIBLE]
in the Google Wallet.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.450
And I'm going to show you
a demo of how this works.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.500
So you get more
distribution and branding.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.000
The third thing I
want to talk about

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.150
is engagement and
also redemption.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.860
So I'll give you an example.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.880
I have a Walgreens loyalty card.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.200
When I go in a Walgreens
store, I get notified.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.090
So I have my balance
rewards number.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.510
I don't need to carry
my physical card.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.600
And if I have an offer, I
can actually redeem it there.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.270
So it's what I call
smart notifications.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.710
I don't get notified if I
am driving by or walking by.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.770
I get it when I'm in the
store, so it's not spam.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.090
And what helps you
as a developer is,

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.070
through these contextual
notifications,

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.945
it drives engagement.

00:28:24.945 --> 00:28:27.180
And I'm more likely
to redeem that offer.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.270
I'm more likely to
use that loyalty card,

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.990
if it's in the palm of my hand.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.590
So let me give an example.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.730
And we're going to actually
use a real partner app.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.700
So first, just for context,
this is the Google Wallet app.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.160
So as you can see, I don't have
any offers saved right now.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.540
If I had any offers
saved to Google,

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.860
you would have seen them here.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.500
And now what I'm going to
do is go to the Belly app.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.000
So Belly is one of
my favorite apps.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.630
I love offers.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.750
And like I mentioned
earlier, I'm still hungry.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.020
So continuing with
that theme, let

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.070
me save this jerk
chicken wrap offer.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.780
As you can see,
it's very simple.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.706
I save it to Google.

00:29:04.706 --> 00:29:06.080
And like I said
earlier, when you

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.790
do that, it's
saved to the cloud.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.490
And I can access it any time.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.040
But don't take my word for it.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.620
So let's go back.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.080
And as you can see, the
offer showed up right here.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.970
So now when I'm
walking past 876 Cafe,

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.740
I'll get a geonotification
saying, here's this offer.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.920
Do you want to use it?

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.980
And I can use it.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.700
I can save money as a consumer.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.330
And it can drive engagement for
you as a developer or brand.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.140
So this is, again,
going back to commerce

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.339
is more than just payments.

00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:34.130
And we are trying to
cover that entire life

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.610
cycle of a consumer's journey.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:42.520
So just in terms of
other housekeeping notes,

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.440
I'd also like to--
before we wrap up--

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.210
just do a few pointers.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.160
One is-- I mentioned earlier, we
have sandbox open to everybody.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.310
So I'd encourage you to
go to our developer site.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.631
It's
developers.google.com/wallet.

00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:57.130
We have an interest
form if you want

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.530
to sign up for Instant Buy.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.040
We have also an
interest form if you

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.804
want to sign up
for Wallet Objects.

00:30:01.804 --> 00:30:03.220
And the other thing
is if you want

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.390
to talk to us in person we
have an office hour session

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.687
today at 1:00 PM.

00:30:08.687 --> 00:30:10.520
So I'd encourage you
all to come by if you'd

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.780
like to have a further detailed
discussion on anything we

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.730
talked about today.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.271
MICHAEL GALPIN: And
just to reiterate

00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:17.790
one thing on the sign-ups.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:21.410
For Instant Buy, you can
install the Play Services client

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.630
library and start developing
against our sandbox

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.330
immediately.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.409
There's nothing to sign up for.

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:29.200
You could do it right
now from your laptop,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.450
if you had it with you.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:34.000
There is an interest form to
fill out for production access.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.960
The Save to Google APIs, they're
in a beta phase right now.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.980
So you need to fill out
an interest form with us,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.792
and then we'll give you
access to those APIs as well.

00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:45.750
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: OK.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:46.250
Great.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.737
So we'd like to keep the
floor open for questions now.

00:30:48.737 --> 00:30:51.070
We'd love to hear from you
about any questions you have,

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.140
especially on the
challenges you might

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.306
be having with monetization.

00:30:53.306 --> 00:30:54.139
Go ahead.

00:30:54.139 --> 00:30:55.930
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
just curious to know

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.760
how Google actually
makes money from this.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.718
Are you not getting any
fees from the partners?

00:30:59.718 --> 00:31:01.280
And then just a second question.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.960
Just philosophically,
how has Google

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.250
thought about payments
changing over time

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.269
in terms of where you
were five years ago

00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:08.810
and what Google
Instant Pay is today?

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:09.250
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Sure.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.249
That's a great question.

00:31:10.249 --> 00:31:12.970
So I think, as I said earlier,
this is a free product.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.344
So we are really focused
on the consumer experience.

00:31:15.344 --> 00:31:17.260
What we would like to
do, I mentioned earlier,

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.750
we are in a mobile-first world.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.125
And we really believe there
is a big problem that has not

00:31:21.125 --> 00:31:24.080
been tackled, which is the
mobile shopping experience.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.300
So what we'd like to do
is improve that shopping

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.240
experience by reducing
friction, driving conversion,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.070
because that's something that
our consumers are asking for.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.680
That's something our retailers
and advertisers are asking for.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.190
So that's our main driver
behind being in the space.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.300
In terms of how we see payments
evolving, like I said earlier,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.320
I gave you more than
a hint about that.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.700
I said, we're looking
at the whole commerce

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.490
journey, the whole
shopping journey.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.240
And what we are trying to
do is help the consumer

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.940
along every point
in that journey.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.940
And to us, payments
is one element of it.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.140
The other element where we
think we can bring value

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.590
is things we are demonstrating
in the partner showcase.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:02.120
So for example, I mentioned
earlier Hotel Tonight,

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.280
not only can you use
two-click checkout,

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.860
you can actually
use Google assets,

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.850
Google APIs to
get keyless entry.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.022
With JackThreads, not only can
you use two-click checkout,

00:32:11.022 --> 00:32:12.730
you can actually have
a virtual hang out,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.960
try something on
from your living room

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.820
before you actually
buy it online.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.920
With Eat24, you can be watching
your favorite football game

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.024
on Android TV and
order it from there.

00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:24.940
So that's the future we
see where you actually

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.972
make it a delightful commerce
experience for the user

00:32:27.972 --> 00:32:29.930
and put not just payments,
but the other Google

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.386
assets as part of their journey.

00:32:32.386 --> 00:32:33.270
Go ahead, please.

00:32:36.572 --> 00:32:38.780
AUDIENCE: You guys talked
a lot about physical goods,

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.770
but a lot of the
people you listed

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:45.142
are obviously services and/or
digital goods potentially.

00:32:45.142 --> 00:32:46.600
In light of that,
can you guys talk

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.540
about how the-- since you're on
IO-- Android and iOS Play Store

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.490
policies come into
play, and when

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.860
you can use Wallet versus
when you have to use

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.357
Play store for different
aspects of purchasing?

00:32:59.357 --> 00:33:01.440
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.060
So when we said
physical goods, we

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.930
meant physical
goods and services.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.320
If you have digital goods
we have a great API,

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.344
Google Wallet In-app Billing.

00:33:09.344 --> 00:33:10.760
So we'd encourage
you to use that.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.320
And the other thing is these
are two very different things,

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.090
that Google Wallet In-app
Billing is a solution that also

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.140
processes your
payment, provides you

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.140
distribution, and many other
things that you can read up

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.940
on our website.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.880
What we're offering
is specifically

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.130
designed for physical goods.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.300
We do not process your payment.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.570
So anything that you have
that's a digital good consumed

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.610
on or off the device should
use the In-App Billing API.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.570
Anything like purchasing a
ticket or a physical good

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.362
would be the Google
Wallet Instant Buy API.

00:33:38.362 --> 00:33:40.903
And if you want, I'm happy to
chat with you after the session

00:33:40.903 --> 00:33:42.250
and walk through in more detail.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.370
MICHAEL GALPIN: And just
to add one thing to that,

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:46.520
the Play In-app Billing does a
lot of awesome things for you

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.415
in terms of keeping track of
what items has a user purchased

00:33:51.415 --> 00:33:52.030
and all that.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.170
So it's a very, very rich API.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.260
Whereas, this is very
much focused just

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.890
on facilitating payments.

00:34:00.132 --> 00:34:01.340
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Go ahead.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.690
AUDIENCE: So if you already have
a pre-optimized flow for return

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:09.670
customers on your
website or app,

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.980
is it possible to have the first
visit go through this system,

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.570
and then the return visit just
go through your regular system?

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:22.330
Can you reuse that
information a second time,

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.110
or a third time,
or a fourth time?

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.116
MICHAEL GALPIN: So one
key aspect to Instant Buy

00:34:27.116 --> 00:34:30.170
is that we are generating
a one-time card.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.320
So that card's not meant to
be reused over and over again.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.550
That's part of the security
that we provide to users

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:40.090
that, if that card was
somehow compromised,

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.139
the risk there to
them is very limited.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:46.650
But otherwise, yes, I think
what you're talking about

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.281
would definitely possible.

00:34:48.281 --> 00:34:49.989
But just keep in mind
that you can't just

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.840
reuse that same
card that you used

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.235
last time from Instant Buy.

00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:56.600
AUDIENCE: So is there a way to
get a new card without showing

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.020
the user the whole flow,
like if they want to say,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.060
I want this again.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.230
Or do you have to send them
all the way back through

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.188
and have them pick an
address and a credit card

00:35:06.188 --> 00:35:07.450
and everything?

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.158
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
I think a lot depends

00:35:09.158 --> 00:35:10.490
on how your flow works exactly.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.860
But we do think it's very
important that people

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.520
see what card's getting
charged for them.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.085
So we do think it's important
to display that information

00:35:19.085 --> 00:35:21.890
and give them a way to change it
in case like, oh, I don't want

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:22.500
to use that card anymore
or the shipping address.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.125
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:25.470
I assume you could
still show the last four

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:29.170
digits, the ones that
are shown in the--

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.209
MICHAEL GALPIN: So, yeah.

00:35:31.209 --> 00:35:33.750
I failed to mention earlier when
I went through the Overstock

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.820
demo, but you might have noticed
there was a check box saying,

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.820
use Wallet as my
default in the future.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.800
If you leave that checked,
then in the future,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.070
you skip the Wallet UI part.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.662
But we still ask that you show
that information to the user.

00:35:46.662 --> 00:35:49.120
We think that's a good user
experience for them to see that

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.059
and to know what's
getting charged.

00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:54.350
AUDIENCE: I have one more
question, but he can go next.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:55.880
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.100
Is there an option
for revenue sharing?

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.510
Because in Paypal, for
instance, I develop a site,

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.400
and I get a cut of the payment.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.450
And it's just automatic.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.890
I don't have to do anything.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.940
So is there an option in Google
Wallet for revenue sharing?

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.770
I've asked the
question last year too.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.207
And the person said, yeah,
yeah, we're looking at that.

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:17.790
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
So I think, first,

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.414
just to reiterate
what we said earlier,

00:36:19.414 --> 00:36:21.000
we don't process your payment.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
So Paypal processes
your payment.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.564
The way our model
works is whoever

00:36:24.564 --> 00:36:26.855
you're using for processing,
like Braintree, or Stripe,

00:36:26.855 --> 00:36:29.220
or Paymentech, you'll
continue using that.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.190
And we don't charge any fees.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.160
So that's one fundamental
distinction we have.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.370
Again, I don't have the
specifics of this revenue

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:37.877
sharing thing that you have.

00:36:37.877 --> 00:36:39.960
MICHAEL GALPIN: We don't
take any of your revenue.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.190
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Exactly.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.540
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.790
But there is a Google
Wall-- some kind of-- when

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:51.470
you say in-app, there's an
in-app web version, not only

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:52.810
Play Store.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.780
I know I used it.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.419
Right?

00:36:56.419 --> 00:36:58.210
Is there a different
group then that does--

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.600
MICHAEL GALPIN: That's a
different product for the web.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:04.710
And that does have a revenue
share associated to it.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.654
AUDIENCE: So there is a
revenue share for that one?

00:37:07.654 --> 00:37:08.820
I'll talk to you afterwards.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.330
MICHAEL GALPIN: Yeah.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.680
Please come by the office hours.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.600
We can go into that.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.922
Absolutely.

00:37:12.922 --> 00:37:14.130
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Go ahead.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.450
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.350
How many of the total users,
for Android specifically,

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.810
actually has a Wallet
account percentage-wise?

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.569
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So we
don't disclose those numbers.

00:37:25.569 --> 00:37:27.360
You probably saw the
presentation yesterday

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.580
on the growth of Android.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.663
And you saw the show of
hands earlier when I said,

00:37:30.663 --> 00:37:33.570
how many of you have
made a purchase on Play

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.980
or any other property on Google?

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.120
So essentially, anyone who's
made a purchase on Play

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.692
has set up a Google
Wallet account.

00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:42.025
AUDIENCE: Percentage-wise,
do you know how much is that?

00:37:42.025 --> 00:37:42.850
30%?

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:43.790
90%?

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.020
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So we
don't share those numbers.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:46.820
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.040
Because that's part of the
[INAUDIBLE] eventually.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.123
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Right.

00:37:50.123 --> 00:37:52.310
AUDIENCE: If this
doesn't have a Wallet.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.740
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: I agree.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.340
Great question.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.390
So the best way I
can answer it is

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.223
with public information
in our case studies.

00:37:56.223 --> 00:37:58.110
So I talked earlier about Eat24.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.050
One of every three
transactions on Android

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.219
after they implemented
is with Google Wallet.

00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:04.010
I talked about the
other four case studies,

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.300
too, where they had a
similar share of Wallet.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.720
So I would say that's probably
your best signal in terms

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.000
of attraction we have
with Google Wallet.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.830
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:13.710
And by the way, if I don't
have a Wallet account,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.902
does the Checkout button
become a Register button?

00:38:16.902 --> 00:38:18.360
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Great question.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.220
So if you click on
Buy With Google--

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.680
so when Michael showed the demo
on Overstock-- if you don't

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.060
have a Wallet
account, it's going

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.530
to guide you to
the Setup screen.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.409
But even there,
thanks to Michael,

00:38:27.409 --> 00:38:28.950
we have been able
to reduce friction.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.960
So what I mean by that is we
use our Places Autocomplete API,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.880
so you don't have to
enter your full address.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.970
We have OCR, so you
can actually take

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.790
a picture of your credit card.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.560
We didn't show a
demo of the setup,

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.320
but we have tried to even make
that as painless as possible

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.210
in Google Wallet.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.450
MICHAEL GALPIN: And once
you set up there, then you

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.033
can use that same Wallet account
on all the Google properties,

00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:49.156
including in Play.

00:38:49.156 --> 00:38:50.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.844
Thank you.

00:38:51.844 --> 00:38:53.260
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering how

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.630
this works outside of the
credit card ecosystem.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.530
So if you're dealing
internationally,

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.780
for instance, in where I come
from in the Netherlands, 70%,

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.992
80% of all transactions
are with online banking.

00:39:03.992 --> 00:39:04.950
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: OK.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:05.574
Great question.

00:39:05.574 --> 00:39:07.610
So today, this is
a US-only product.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.464
That's all I can say.

00:39:10.464 --> 00:39:11.880
One thing I didn't
mention earlier

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.891
is we take your
feedback to heart.

00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:15.640
So a lot of the features
we have this year

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.980
were based on feedback
we've gotten in the past.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.060
So all I can say is, yes,
we hear you loud and clear.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.190
And stay tuned.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.950
AUDIENCE: For the
Coupon and Loyalty

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:31.765
Card Program buttons, is that
only for brick and mortar

00:39:31.765 --> 00:39:32.265
retail?

00:39:32.265 --> 00:39:35.082
Or does it work for
websites and things, too?

00:39:35.082 --> 00:39:37.290
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: You can
use it for websites, too.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.123
But one of the things
I talked earlier about

00:39:39.123 --> 00:39:40.800
was driving engagement
and redemption.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.730
So we found it resonates most
with an in-store4 component

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.220
because, when we talked
to our developers,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.260
they said, I want to get
somebody in my store.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.593
I want it to be very contextual.

00:39:53.747 --> 00:39:55.830
You could use it for, like
I said, more than that.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:57.290
But we found most of the
attraction and interest

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.530
we have is for our
retailers who actually

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.940
have an in-store component.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.035
MICHAEL GALPIN: Yeah, like when
you create one of those offers,

00:40:04.035 --> 00:40:07.870
you can put geofence locations
for your stores, for example.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.397
So then, as Prakash
mentioned, users

00:40:09.397 --> 00:40:11.480
get walking through your
store, they get notified.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.470
Hey, I've got this offer to you.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:17.800
So we definitely found a lot of
value for physical locations.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.880
But it does work
for digital as well.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.350
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Go ahead.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:23.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have a
quick question for you.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:26.127
Everything you've talked about
today has been around mobile.

00:40:26.127 --> 00:40:27.710
And I just want to
confirm a statement

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.970
that I thought I heard you say
early on in the presentation.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.440
This is available also
on desktop, correct?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Yes.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.150
So we are available across
all of major platforms

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.921
everywhere, Android, iOS,
mobile web, and desktop.

00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:41.420
And we actually do
have partners who

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.940
have done that integration
across all platforms, Orbitz,

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.880
Fancy, which I talked about.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.400
We have more than
a dozen developers

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.530
who have actually gotten
value not just on mobile,

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.129
but across the entire
platform spectrum.

00:40:53.129 --> 00:40:53.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.930
Great.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:54.429
Thanks.

00:40:54.429 --> 00:40:56.648
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Sure.

00:40:56.648 --> 00:40:59.252
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:59.252 --> 00:41:01.585
I'm from Overstock, so we
were part of that integration.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.880
This is more of a plug
feedback kind of a thing.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.087
There's a 67% conversion, once
they do buy with Google Wallet.

00:41:18.087 --> 00:41:20.170
So we're really excited
about the conversion rate.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:20.520
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Thank you.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:20.850
Thank you.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:21.348
MICHAEL GALPIN: Thank you.

00:41:21.348 --> 00:41:24.220
AUDIENCE: And we're really
happy with that integration.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.290
I guess the one feedback
I would like to provide

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:30.910
is maybe if you could
raise the dollar

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.999
amount that you guys
support on the back end.

00:41:32.999 --> 00:41:34.040
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Sure.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.414
That's a great
piece of feedback.

00:41:35.414 --> 00:41:37.290
So one thing is, with
the one-time card,

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:41.080
we have a limit of
$2,000 per transaction.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.370
So we are looking
at various things.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.820
And generally, we have
found that, for the majority

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.140
of our customers, it
fits into their 95

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.442
percentile of transaction size.

00:41:50.442 --> 00:41:51.525
But that's great feedback.

00:41:51.525 --> 00:41:52.380
Thank you.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.080
MICHAEL GALPIN: We
limit things, again,

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.050
as security for our customers,
for Google Wallet users.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:00.840
So that way, again, if there
is any kind of compromise,

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.850
the amount of damage that
can be done is very limited.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.110
But we certainly understand
there are apps out there

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:09.412
where the transaction
amounts can be greater

00:42:09.412 --> 00:42:10.120
than that amount.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.005
So we hear you.

00:42:13.005 --> 00:42:14.310
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Great.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:17.020
So unless there's any
other questions-- so again,

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.162
we'll be there at office
hours, 1:00 PM in the pod.

00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:22.120
So we look forward to
seeing many of you there.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.495
And thank you,
again, for coming.

00:42:23.495 --> 00:42:24.610
[APPLAUSE]
