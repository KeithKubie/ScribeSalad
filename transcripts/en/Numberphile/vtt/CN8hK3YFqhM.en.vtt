00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.380
Well, this object is made from a single sheet of paper

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.740
and just cut loose like this.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.000
And Brady, can you hold this flap, please?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.740
Ok, we shall call this the "first state",

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.700
so, this flap is, um, above what he's holding.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.440
Now please release it.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.880
He can hold it like this and this is going to be the "second state", ok?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.860
This flap is below what he's holding.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.720
Now, you cannot go from the first state to the second state

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.520
because he's in the way, yeah?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.500
And you cannot, you know, go from the first to the second.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.000
Well, if these are made of rubber, something flexible,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.720
then I can stretch it and pass it over his body and come back underneath

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.480
But it's not rubber, I mean, it's real paper, so you can't do this.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.340
So, you cannot go from first to second.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.980
Now, please close your eyes for a moment, and...

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.820
Okay, keep it closed...

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.460
Now, I'm going to do something

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.100
And open your eyes

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.240
What!? It went from the first to the second

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.860
And he was holding this all the time and he didn't let it go

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.300
so how did it happen?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.940
That's really strange.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.520
From this state

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.640
to this state

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.460
while this is always being held

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.660
So, let's do it with eyes open this time

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800
Can you hold it again?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.600
Now, you can keep the eyes open

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.920
First I'm going to roll it like this

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.900
and that's like the pair of handcuffs

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080
Or,  if you want, you can think of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.940
circle here and then imagine another imaginary circle which makes it a torus

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.960
And I, mathematician like to say I "reverse" the orientation of both generators of the torus

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.020
loops of the torus

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.220
And they do this, and then that keeps the orientation and I'm on the other side.
