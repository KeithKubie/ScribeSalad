00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.680
We have made a new material

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.330
it's a material that has never existed

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.660
on earth before:

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.210
metallic hydrogen.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.849
Hydrogen is the simplest atom in the

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.160
periodic table of the elements, it consists

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.320
of a single proton with the single

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.599
electron around it, at room temperature, it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.019
exists as a gas but if you cool hydrogen

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.199
down to low temperatures it actually

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.140
liquefies and if I cool it to about just under

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.500
14 degrees it forms a solid. Imagine my

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.190
fingers are molecules here with the two

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.800
atoms, if you compress it to a high

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.899
enough density eventually you will get

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.600
to a pressure or a density where the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.850
molecules dissociate and it forms an

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.030
atomic solid and this is a metal.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.160
You have two diamonds sitting opposite to each

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.920
other inside here we load the sample as a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.159
liquid state, but as soon as you pressurize

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.440
it, the molecules get closer together it becomes

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.479
a solid, and then we're squeezing the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.580
solid, and even though this device looks

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.710
very small we can generate pressure

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.590
more than the center of earth.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.390
You never know how it's going to be

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.340
applied but imagine that it's metastable

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.399
and you can make electrical wires out of

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.189
it, you could conduct electricity across

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.799
the country without dissipation, you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.140
could make magnets which are used in MRI,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.060
for example, that would work at room

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.920
temperature. Right now the magnets have

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.740
to be cooled with liquid helium. NASA has

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.930
supported some of our research because

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.420
it turns out that if it's metastable and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.759
you could cause it to convert to molecular

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.340
hydrogen, it releases an enormous

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.049
amount of energy and it would

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.450
revolutionize rocketry and it's a very

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.890
nice thing to achieve.
