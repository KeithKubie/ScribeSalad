00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.320
So, let's assume for now that we have a perfect hash

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.670
function. That it distributes keys evenly across all the buckets. And then

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.640
the question is which of the following will leave the expected

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.040
look up time for a given keyword essentially unchanged. For the first

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.890
choice is we can double the number of keywords, without changing

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.550
the number of buckets. The second choice is we can keep the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.900
number of keywords the same. But double the number of buckets.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.410
The third choice is, we can double the number of keywords and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.600
double the number of buckets. The fourth choice

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.960
is we can halve the number of keywords, keeping

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.360
the number of buckets the same. And the final

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.010
choice is we can have half as many keywords,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.970
and half as many buckets. And the question

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.580
is, which of these five, and there could be

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.050
more than one that's correct, Will essentially leave the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.580
time it takes to look up a keyword unchanged.
