00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.510
Zane is a dangerous
fellow who likes

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.180
to go rock climbing
inside an active volcano.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.000
He is a dangerous fellow.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.070
He just heard some
rumblings, so he's

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.030
decided to climb out
as quickly as he can.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.890
Zane's elevation
relative to the edge

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.630
of the inside of the
volcano in meters,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.560
E, as a function of time in
seconds is shown in the table

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.410
below.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140
Zane climbs at a constant rate.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.850
So this guy, I mean if we
were to draw a volcano here,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.210
this guy is just kind of silly.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.790
So this is my volcano.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.280
And he's actually
climbing on the inside

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.680
of an active volcano.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.310
So there's probably smoke and
ash and all the other stuff

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.870
coming out of this thing.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.240
So this really is
dangerous for him.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.320
And let's say that this
right over here is Zane.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.230
He's climbing up from
inside the active volcano.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.610
So let's think about
what they're telling us.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.069
So based on the table, which
of these statements is true?

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.360
So I'm not going to even look
at these statements here.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.210
I'm just going to try
to interpret this.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.510
So his elevation as a
function of time in seconds

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.240
is shown in the table below.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.930
So his elevation is negative
24 when time is equal to 0.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.230
And this table is done in a
kind of nontraditional way.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.640
Normally, we would
have the input

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270
into the function on
the left-hand side.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.172
And then we would have
the function of it

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:33.130
on the right-hand side.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.690
And actually I like
looking at things that way,

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.240
so I'm going to
make it like that.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.120
So let me copy and paste this so
I can put it on the other side.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.090
So let me cut and let me paste
it, paste it right over here.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.190
So this one, now I can think
of it a little bit clearer.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.750
So at time 0, he's going to
be at negative 24 meters.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.770
At time 4 seconds, he's going
to be at negative 21 meters.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.800
So this makes a little bit
clearer, at least in my head.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.060
So let's think about
what's happening.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.060
So where does he start?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.000
At time equals 0, where is he?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.501
Well at time equals
0, he is 24 meters

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:10.750
below the edge of the volcano.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.200
So this distance
at time equals 0,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.235
this distance right
over here is 24 meters.

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.860
And we could even
plot this in a graph.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.470
So this is his elevation
relative to the edge,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.070
and it is a function of time.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.420
I'll write it like that.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.700
And it is negative
most of this time.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.160
So I'm going to make the
t-axis a little bit higher.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.350
So it looks something like that.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.880
That's our t-axis.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.630
And when t is equal to 0,
we see that his elevation

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.660
is negative 24 meters.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.310
So his elevation is
negative 24 meters.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.720
So he's going to, this is
right here at 0 seconds.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.080
And then when time increases
by 4, so our change in time

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.235
is equal to 4, what's
his change in elevation?

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:04.210
Well, his change in
elevation is, let's see,

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.610
he's going from negative
24 to negative 21.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.970
He increased by 3.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.690
So his change in elevation
is equal to positive 3.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.580
He increased by 3.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.240
So at what rate is he increasing
his elevation with respect

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.130
to time?

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.130
Well, change in elevation
is equal to 3 per unit.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.470
And that's 3 when
his change in time.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.900
And remember this triangle just
means a Greek letter delta,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.340
shorthand for change in.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.686
So change in elevation over
change in times is 3 over 4.

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.060
So one way to
think about this is

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.575
that he goes 3/4 of
a meter per second.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.970
The units up here is meter.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.890
The units down here is second.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.940
So he goes 3/4 of
a meter per second.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.410
And we can verify that.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.840
The next row here, we see
our change in time is 8.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.116
So it's twice as
much time has passed,

00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:04.990
so he should have gone
twice as much distance

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.990
if his rate is constant.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.920
Let's verify that
that's the case.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.980
So he went from negative
21 to negative 15.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.460
His elevation increased by 6.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.399
So change in elevation
over change in time

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.640
is 6/8, which is the
same thing as 3/4.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.200
So you see that he has
this constant change.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.950
So let's plot a few
of these points.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.360
So when time is 0, his
elevation is negative 24.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.240
When time is 4,
right over there,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.410
his elevation is negative 21.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.110
Let's say this looks
something like this.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.040
And so his elevation
as a function of time

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.635
is going to look
something like this.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.140
Let me actually draw it a
little bit more to scale.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.520
Because the other
thing that we do know

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.420
is that when time is
32, his elevation is 0.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.920
So let me put that
right over there.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.890
When time is 32,
his elevation is 0.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.580
So his elevation as
a function of time

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.795
looks something like this.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.480
And we could plot other
points there when time is 4.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.360
So 4 is going to
be at this half.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.880
That's a 4.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.080
So 4 is going to be
right over there.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.410
His elevation is negative 21.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.250
So this is a general idea.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.510
He starts at negative
24 meters and he

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.160
increases at a rate of
3/4 meters per second.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.980
So which of these
choices is correct?

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.970
Zane was 24 meters below
the edge of the volcano when

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.160
he decided to leave,
and he climbs 3 meters

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.350
every 4 seconds on the way out.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.180
That seems right.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.092
He climbs 3 meters
every 4 seconds.

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:40.550
So we're going to
go with that one.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.270
Let's make sure that
these aren't right.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.204
Zane was 24 meters
below the volcano when

00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:45.620
he decided to
leave, and he climbs

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.210
4 meters every 3 seconds.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.190
No, no, it's 3 meters
every 4 seconds.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.640
So that's not right.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.060
Zane was 32 meters below
the edge of the volcano.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.420
No, that's not right.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.620
Zane was 32 meters.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.950
That's not right either.
