00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:01.256
- [Instructor] We're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.256 --> 00:00:03.977
is get some practice doing division

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:08.356
with numbers that are
multiples of 10, 100, 1,000,

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:09.616
things like that.

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:11.033
So let's say we wanted to compute

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:11.866
what 2,400

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:15.700
divided by 30 is.

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:19.228
Pause this video,

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:20.923
and see if you can calculate it

00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:24.895
using whatever strategy
makes sense to you.

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.763
Alright, so let's think
about this together,

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:29.428
and I'm gonna show you how my
brain likes to handle this.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.729
We'll do this out on my
little digital blackboard,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.769
but eventually you'll be
able to do things like this

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.110
in your head.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.777
So 2,400 or 2,400 divided by 30,

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:43.501
that is the same thing as 2,400

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:49.715
over 30.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.082
So this is just another
way of saying 2,400

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:57.708
divided by 30.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.732
Now the reason why I wrote it this way

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:03.674
is because you can now
write each of these,

00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.037
the numerator and the denominator

00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:07.122
as the product of some number

00:01:07.122 --> 00:01:10.239
and either 10 or 100 or 1,000.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:14.239
So 2,400, that's the same
thing as 24 times 100,

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:20.114
and I knew that.

00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:22.180
I was like, okay, I've got
these two zeros at the end,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.894
so you could view this
literally as 24 hundreds,

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:28.285
and then 30 you can view as,

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:29.479
we got one zero here,

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.111
so it's three tens.

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.051
The three is in the tens place.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.551
So three times 10.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.605
Now what's valuable about
thinking of it this way

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:43.739
is you can separately
divide the 24 by the three

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:45.734
and then the 100 by the 10,

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:48.394
so this is the same thing as,

00:01:48.394 --> 00:01:50.250
lemme do this this way,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.427
as that times that.

00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:55.260
And so we have 24 divided by three

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.265
times 100 divided by 10.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.860
Now 24 divided by three,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.696
you might already know
that is going to be eight.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.589
Three times eight is 24.

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.756
So this is going to be equal to eight,

00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:19.415
and what's 100 divided by 10?

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:22.371
Well, 100 divided by 10
is just going to be 10,

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:26.342
so our quotient, I guess you could say,

00:02:26.342 --> 00:02:28.077
is going to be eight times 10,

00:02:28.077 --> 00:02:30.744
or it's going to be equal to 80,

00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:35.304
and we're done.

00:02:35.304 --> 00:02:38.178
And you might notice
something interesting here.

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:39.678
So if I take my 24

00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:44.002
and divide it by my three,

00:02:46.404 --> 00:02:48.186
I'm gonna get this eight,

00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:50.308
and then if I take two zeros

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:52.189
and if I take away another zero,

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.395
I'm gonna be left with
one zero right over here.

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:56.549
So you get 80,

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.092
but why did that thing
with the zeros work?

00:02:58.092 --> 00:03:00.804
Because you're really
just taking 2,400 hundreds

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:02.959
divided by three tens.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.043
So 100 divided by 10,

00:03:05.043 --> 00:03:06.100
well, you're gonna lose a zero.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.267
That's gonna be equal to 10,

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:09.194
which has only one zero.

00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:11.411
Let's do another example
just to hit the point home,

00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:12.810
and try to do this next example

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.952
the way we just did it,

00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:14.785
maybe in your head

00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:16.524
or maybe on a piece of paper.

00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:19.664
So let's say we wanted to calculate 3,500,

00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:22.140
which you could also think of as 3,500,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.473
and we wanna divide that by,

00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:27.907
lemme write the division symbol

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.681
a little bit nicer than that.

00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:32.014
We wanna divide that by 700.

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:37.869
Pause this video and see
if you can compute that.

00:03:38.727 --> 00:03:40.661
So as we just did,

00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.744
we could view this as 3,500 over 700.

00:03:45.293 --> 00:03:47.210
3,500 we can view as 35

00:03:51.352 --> 00:03:52.185
times 100

00:03:55.272 --> 00:03:57.855
over, this is going to be over.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.524
Lemme get the right color here,

00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:05.274
over seven times 100.

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.539
Now the one hundreds cancel out,

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.109
and we're just left with 35 over seven.

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.464
Now what's 35 divided by seven?

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:19.798
Well, that is going to be equal to five,

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:22.855
and notice, you could just say 35

00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.938
divided by seven is five,

00:04:25.934 --> 00:04:28.336
and if you're saying, "How many
zeros do I have left over?"

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:29.944
Well, I have two zeros here,

00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:31.861
but since I'm dividing by
something with two zeros,

00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:34.024
those two zeros are
going to be canceled out.

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.495
I don't want you to just memorize that.

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:38.274
The reason why that happens is
because those two zeros here

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:40.557
represent hundreds, 35 hundreds.

00:04:40.557 --> 00:04:42.147
These two zeros represent hundreds,

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:43.732
so if you divide 100 by hundreds,

00:04:43.732 --> 00:04:44.943
they're all gonna cancel out.

00:04:44.943 --> 00:04:46.022
So you had two zeros before,

00:04:46.022 --> 00:04:47.830
but you're dividing by
something with the two zeros,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.580
so you don't have any
zeros after the five here.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.573
Lemme do one more example

00:04:52.573 --> 00:04:53.827
just to really hit that point home,

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:55.452
but I want you to appreciate that

00:04:55.452 --> 00:04:57.258
it's not just some magical trick.

00:04:57.258 --> 00:04:58.628
It just makes sense out of things

00:04:58.628 --> 00:05:00.590
that you might already know.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.763
So if someone, and I'm
gonna give a crazy one,

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.013
let's say we had 42 million

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.306
divided by,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.230
let's say, 60,000.

00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:25.365
What is that going to be?

00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:27.078
Pause the video and see
if you can think about it

00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:28.870
on your own.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.418
Well, using the notions
that we just talked about,

00:05:32.418 --> 00:05:35.918
you could say, "Alright, 42 divided by six

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:39.344
"is going to be seven."

00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:40.292
And then if I, let's see,

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:42.974
over here I have six zeros,

00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:45.105
so we're talking about millions,

00:05:45.105 --> 00:05:49.941
and I'm gonna divide by
four zeros right over here,

00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:51.658
which is 10 thousands.

00:05:51.658 --> 00:05:52.947
So if you had six zeros,

00:05:52.947 --> 00:05:56.187
or if you have millions with six zeros

00:05:56.187 --> 00:05:58.931
and you divide by 10
thousands with four zeros,

00:05:58.931 --> 00:06:01.724
six minus four is gonna be two,

00:06:01.724 --> 00:06:04.232
so your answer's gonna
have two zeros in it.

00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:07.028
So this is going to be equal to 700.

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:09.363
Now once again, not a magical trick,

00:06:09.363 --> 00:06:10.381
the way that we got this

00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:14.048
is that this is equal
to 42 times a million.

00:06:16.397 --> 00:06:18.950
We got our six zeros right over there

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.783
divided by

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:24.553
six 10 thousands,

00:06:24.553 --> 00:06:25.970
six times 10,000.

00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:31.617
So our 42 divided by six,

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:33.979
that's where we get the seven from,

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.784
and now one way to think about it,

00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:38.872
if we divide the numerator
and the denominator by 10,

00:06:38.872 --> 00:06:39.755
we lose a zero.

00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:40.588
Then we do it again.

00:06:40.588 --> 00:06:41.421
We lose zeros.

00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.254
We do it again.

00:06:42.254 --> 00:06:43.087
We lose zeros.

00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:43.920
We do it again.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.753
We lose zeros,

00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:47.714
and so this thing just all becomes one,

00:06:47.714 --> 00:06:49.136
or another way to think about it,

00:06:49.136 --> 00:06:50.371
if we divide the numerator

00:06:50.371 --> 00:06:53.122
and the denominator by 10,000,

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:54.767
this becomes one.

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:57.465
This thing loses four zeros,

00:06:57.465 --> 00:06:58.784
and you're left with,

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:01.657
42 divided by six is seven hundreds,

00:07:01.657 --> 00:07:03.275
because we have a one
now in the denominator,

00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:05.525
100 divided by one, so 700.
