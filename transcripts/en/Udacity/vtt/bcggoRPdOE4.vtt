What is the process called when we successfully condition Greg to flinch after

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:07.677
he hears the repeated pairing of the neutral stimulus with the unconditioned

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:11.382
stimulus, and then the neutral stimulus becomes a condition stimulus, which

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:17.917
will elicit the condition response. Is this process called a acquisition. Is it

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:23.623
called extinction or is it called spontaneous recovery? Select 1.
