00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.270
In this segment, we'll be
talking about how to obtain a

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.960
developer key to make YouTube
API calls and

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.770
run the sample code.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.000
To do this, we'll need a
registered Google account.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.805
The first thing we want
to do is browse at

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.530
a Google API console.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.750
We can find this at
code.google.com/apis/console.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.100
Or we can just search for
"Google API console" in our

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.310
favorite search engine.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.150
We'll need to create a project
the first time we open a site.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.720
Projects [? are ?] grouping at
the APIs, and it may make

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.040
sense for us to create different
projects for every

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.200
new application that we write.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160
For running the sample code, we
only need one project and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.810
one set of API keys.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.950
After we enable our project,
we'll need

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.250
to enable some services.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.260
Let's click through to the
Services menu, if we're not

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.680
already on this page,
and scroll down.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.570
We'll want to enable the YouTube
Data API and YouTube

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.910
Analytics API first.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.990
Let's toggle the YouTube Data
API from Off to On.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.070
The very first time we do this,
we'll be presented with

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.720
the terms of service.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.320
We'll want to read the terms
of service and accept if we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.715
want to be able to
use the API.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.430
Now when we scroll down, we'll
see that the YouTube Data API

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.940
has been accepted and enabled.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.730
We'll click On to also enable
the YouTube Analytics API.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.790
The search by topic code
sample requires use of

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.510
Freebase API, so we'll need
to enable that as well.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.520
There's a separate terms of
service that we'll need to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.770
read and accept.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.520
Once this is done, we'll need
to access our API keys.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.000
We can do this by clicking API
Access in a navigation menu.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.610
There are two types of API
access, simple and authorized.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.460
If all we want to do is search
for videos, channels, and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.810
playlists, all we need
is simple API access.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.870
The key is already provided
to us in our project.
