The Joe Rogan experience.
Now when you say dyslexic,
so if you read something,

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:09.720
what do you see?
I,
I really,
I say it,
but I get word blindness.
I'm word blindness.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.740
I just see how the words,
long words,
I,
I couldn't wrap the,

4
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:17.790
my license took me a just to say let alone to spell.

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.580
Um,
I just find it,
I s I sub vocalize.
So in my head I'm going,

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.330
Oh man,
goes to Jack.
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.820
I will say though,
and you know,
when your kids,

8
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.370
they actually read it out loud and I'm not reading out loud,

9
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.610
but I'm saying it in my head.
And other people that they can do a page,
you know,

10
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:39.150
they do this speed reading and they just,
you shouldn't,
shouldn't,

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.510
and they could just take it whole pages and stunning.
I can't,

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.300
I don't understand that either.
That's,
that's tricky.

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.860
So my spelling was Kat with a k ceiling with an SBA,
logical spelling.
Um,

14
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.370
my writing is all over the place,
bigger letters,
smaller letters,
bigger letters.

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.390
Um,
and they tested me and they said I'm severely a tip to eight,

16
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.530
typically dyslexic.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.490
So I have a huge mental map memory.

18
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.650
I can hold a lot of things in a memory in my head.

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.050
So that's just sort of a permanent distinction.
Like you do,

20
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.670
this is just who you are.
There's no way to fix that seems.

21
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:13.290
So I haven't heard of anyone coming out of dyslexia and saying,

22
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:16.290
now I can read much faster.
Now I can do things.

23
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:19.440
I just think you're stuck with that.
But it's,
it means you think sideways.

24
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:23.760
And I think a lot of creative people at this,
Lexi,
I think sideways.
Yeah.

25
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.760
So you see clouds,
you see a lion in the clouds,

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.010
you see puffy has a train going through the sky,
you know,
um,

27
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.110
it's a,
it's a creative thing.
Uh,
juxtaposing things on your wall.

28
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.410
You have to juxtapose thing,
which is they don't lead from one to the other.

29
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.190
That can be fighting right against it or completely bonkers or out of it.

30
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm just looking at here in the room,
you know,
and,
and linking things together.

31
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.310
I think creativity,
we're trying,

32
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.330
I was trying to throw ourselves by in comedy by something that's weird and

33
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:58.890
opposite and funny.
Um,
Caesar,
you should,
you know,

34
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.860
I'm going for the salad line when I said that.
Do you ever think is solid?

35
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.930
And then people,
it seems to make people off again.
I,
yeah.
Caesar Salad,
Eh,

36
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.660
this guy was Emerton road at a million goal,
ish.
People,
you know,

37
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.160
and he ends up as a salad is not a cognac.
Napoleon gets a cognac or brandy,

38
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.540
but he's a salad.
What's that about?
So,
um,
yeah,

39
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.370
this is my dyslexic traits,

40
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.830
but I think you get dealt these cards when you're born,

41
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.610
whatever genetic cards they are,
and the,

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.560
the art of life is to play your cards as well as you can.

43
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.590
