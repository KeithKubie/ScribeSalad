Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today things are going to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.420
get a little bit confusing, because we’re going to talk
about revolution and independence in Latin America.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.370
It’s a bit confusing because:
1. Latin America is big,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.730
2. It’s very diverse,
3. Napoleon makes everything complicated,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.530
and
4. As we’ve seen in the past, sometimes

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.710
revolutions turn out not to be not that revolutionary.
Witness, for instance, the New England Revolution,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.230
who instead of, like, trying to form new and
better governments are always just kicking

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.630
balls around like all the other soccer teams.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.720
[theme music]

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.820
Right, so before independence, Latin American
society was characterized by three institutions

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.949
that exercised control over the population.

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.389
The first was the Spanish Crown, or if you
are Brazilian, the Portuguese crown. So, as

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:52.260
far as Spain was concerned, the job of the
colonies was to produce revenue in the form

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.199
of a 20% tax on everything that was called
“the royal fifth.” So government administration

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.040
was pervasive and relatively efficient - because
it had to be in order to collect its royal fifth.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.940
Then there was the Catholic Church. Even more
than royal officials, the church exercised

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.720
influence over people's everyday lives. I
mean, the church even controlled time – the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.170
church bells tolled out the hours and they
mandated a seven day work week so that people

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.610
could go to church on Sunday.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.460
And finally, there was patriarchy. In Latin
America, like much of the world, husbands

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.610
had complete control over their wives and
any extra-or-pre-marital skoodilypooping was

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.610
severely punished. I mean, when it was the
women doing the illicit skoodilypooping. Men

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.630
could basically get up to whatever. This was
mainly about property rights because illegitimate

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.260
children could inherit their father’s property,
but it was constructed to be about, you know, purity.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.620
To get a sense of how patriarchy shaped Latin
American lives, take a gander at Sor Juana

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.800
Ines de la Cruz, whose name I’m actually
abbreviating. A child prodigy who spoke five

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.770
languages by the age of 16, de la Cruz wanted
to disguise herself as a boy so she could

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.630
attend University, but she was forbidden to
do so. Still, she wrote plays and poetry,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.820
she studied math and natural science, and
for being one of the leading minds of the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.750
17th century, she was widely attacked, and
eventually forced to abandon her work and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.530
sell all 4,000 of her books. That’s a shame
because she had a great mind, once writing

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.489
that “Aristotle would have written more
if he had done any cooking.”

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.950
Couple other things:
First, Latin America led the world in transculturation,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.980
or Cultural Blending. A new and distinct
Latin American culture emerged mixing:

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.660
1. Whites from Spain called Peninsulares,
2. Whites born in the Americas called creoles,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.599
3. Native Americans, and
4. African slaves.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.379
This blending of cultures may be most obvious
when looking at Native American and African

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.849
influences on Christianity. The Virgin of
Guadalupe, for instance, was still called

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.349
Tonantzin, the indigenous earth goddess, by
Indians, and the profusion of blood in Mexican

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.329
iconography recalls the Aztec use of blood
in ritual. But transculturation pervaded Latin

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.739
American life, from food to secular music
to fashion.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.900
Somewhat related: Latin America had a great
deal of racial diversity and a rigid social

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.219
hierarchy to match. There were four basic
racial categories: white, black, mestizo – a

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.859
mix of white and American Indian - and mulatto,
a mix of white and black. We try not to use

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.599
that word anymore because it’s offensive,
but that’s the word they used.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.689
And from the 16th century on, Latin America
had a huge diversity of mixed race people,

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.959
and there were constant attempts to classify
them and divide them into castes. You can

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.489
see some of these in so called casta paintings,
which attempted to establish in a very weird

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.779
and Enlightenment-y way all the possible racial
combinations.

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.980
But of course that’s not how race works,
as evidenced by the fact that successful people

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.879
of lower racial castes could become “legally
white” by being granted gracias al sacar.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.150
So by 1800, on the eve of Latin America’s
independence movements, roughly a quarter

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.529
of people were mixed race.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:38.109
All right, now let's have us some revolutions.
How shall we organize this, Stan? Let's begin

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.099
with Latin America's most successful country
as defined by quality of soccer team.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.319
So Brazil - he said as thousands of Argentinians
booed him - is obviously different because

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.769
it was ruled, not by Spain, but by Portugal.
But like a lot of revolutions in Latin America,

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.109
it was fairly conservative. The creoles wanted
to maintain their privilege while also achieving

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.900
independence from the Peninsulares.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.489
And also like a lot of Latin American revolutions,
it featured Napoleon. Freaking Napoleon. You’re

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.779
everywhere. He’s behind me, isn’t he?
Gah! So when Napoleon took over Portugal in

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:13.459
1807, the entire Portuguese royal family and
their royal court decamped to Brazil. And

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.220
it turned out, they loved Brazil. King Joao
loved Brazil so much...

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.980
Off topic, but do you think that J-Woww named
herself after King Joao? I mean, does she

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.340
have that kind of historical sensibility?
I think she does.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.090
So King Joao’s life in Rio was so good that
even after Napoleon was defeated at the Battle

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.660
of Waterloo, he just kind of stayed in Brazil.
And then, by 1820, the Portuguese in Portugal

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.410
were like, “Hey, maybe you should come back
and, like, you know, govern us, King of Portugal.”

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.490
So in 1821, he reluctantly returned to Lisbon,
leaving his son Prince Pedro behind. Meanwhile,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.140
Brazilian creoles were organizing themselves
around the idea that they were culturally

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.810
different from Portugal, and they eventually
formed a Brazilian Party - no, Stan, not that

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.100
kind of party, come on - yes, that kind - a
Brazilian party to lobby for independence.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.140
Then in 1822, they convinced Prince Pedro
of boring, old Portugal that he should just

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.010
become King Pedro of sexy, big Brazil. So
Pedro declared Brazil an independent constitutional

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.070
monarchy with himself as king.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.670
As a result, Brazil achieved independence
without much bloodshed and managed to hold

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.930
on to that social hierarchy with the plantation
owners on top. And that explains why Brazil

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.720
was the last new world country to abolish
slavery, not fully abandoning it until 1888.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.370
Right, so even when Napoleon wasn’t forcing
Portuguese royals into an awesome exile, he

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.110
was still messing with Latin America. Let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.130
So Latin America’s independence movements
began not with Brazil, but in Mexico when

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.850
Napoleon put his brother on the Spanish throne
in 1808. Napoleon wanted to institute the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.390
liberal principles of the French Revolution,
which angered the ruling elite of the Peninsulares

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.990
in what was then called New Spain. They were
aristocrats and they just wanted to go back

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.420
to some good old-fashioned divine right monarchy
with a strong church. So the Mexican Creoles,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.650
seeking to expand their own power at the expense
of the Peninsular elite saw an opportunity

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.030
here. They affirmed their loyalty to the new
king, who was French even though he was the

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.770
king of Spain. I told you this was complicated.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.000
Then, a massive peasant uprising began, led
by a renegade priest Padre Hidalgo, and supported

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.580
by the Creoles because it was aimed at the
Peninsulares, even though they weren’t actually

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.780
the ones who supported Spain. This was further
complicated by the fact that to the mestizo

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.180
peasants led by Hidalgo, Creoles and Peninsulares
looked and acted basically identical - they

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.720
were both white and imperious - so the peasants
often attacked the Creoles, who were technically

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.990
on their side in trying to overthrow the ruling
peninsulares. Even though it had tens of thousands

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.580
of supporters, this first peasant uprising
petered out.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.080
But, a second peasant revolt, led by another
priest, Father Morelos, was much more revolutionary.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.610
In 1813, he declared independence and the
revolt lasted until his death in 1815. But

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.230
since he was a mestizo, he didn’t gain much
Creole support,so revolutionary fervor in

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:57.110
Mexico began to fade... until 1820, when Spain,
which was now under the rule of a Spanish,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.450
rather than a French king, had a REAL liberal
revolution with a new constitution that limited

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.490
the power of the church. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.230
So, in the wake of Spain’s liberalizing
movements, the Mexican elites, who had previously

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.570
supported Spain, switched sides and made common
cause with the creoles in the hopes that they

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.160
could somehow hold onto their privileges.
And pushing for independence together, things

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.600
went very well. The Creole general Iturbide
and the rebel mestizo commander Guerrero joined

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.680
forces and won independence with most of the
Peninsulares returning to Spain.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.430
Iturbide – the whiter of the two generals
– became king of Mexico in 1822 (remember,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.750
this was a revolution essentially AGAINST
representative government). But that didn’t

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.120
work out and within a year he was overthrown
by the military and a republic was declared.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.200
Popular sovereignty was sort of victorious,
but without much benefit to the peasants who

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.840
actually made independence possible. This
alliance between conservative landowning elites

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.889
and the army - especially in the face of calls
for land reform or economic justice - would

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:55.540
happen over and over again in Latin America
for the next century and a half. But before

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.810
we come to any conclusions, let’s discuss
one last revolution.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.389
So Venezuela had a cadre of well-trained creole
revolutionaries, who by 1811 had formed a

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:08.139
revolutionary junta that seized power in Caracas
and formed a republic. But, the interior of

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:12.730
Venezuela was home to mixed-race cowboys called
Llaneros who supported the king. They kept

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.670
the Caracas revolutionaries from extending
their power inland.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:21.139
And that, is where Simon Bolivar, “el Libertador,”
enters the picture. Bolivar realized that

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:24.650
the only way to overcome the various class
divisions (like the one between the Caracas

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:29.570
creoles and Llaneros) was to appeal to a common
sense of South American-ness. I mean, after

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:34.010
all, the one thing that almost all South Americans
had in common: they were born in South America,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.160
NOT SPAIN.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.100
So then, partly through shows of toughness
that included, like, crossing flooded plains

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.779
and going without sleep, Bolivar convinced
the Llaneros to give up fighting for Spain

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:48.370
and start fighting against them. He quickly
captured the viceregal capital at Bogota and

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.529
by 1822 his forces had taken Caracas and Quito.

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:55.710
Hold on, hold on. Lest I be attacked by Argentinians
who are already upset about what I said about

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.980
their really good soccer team, I want to make
one thing clear: Argentina’s general Jose

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.340
de San Martin was also vital to the defeat
of the Spanish. He led an expeditions against

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.650
the Spanish in Chile and also a really important
one in Lima.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.040
And then, in December of 1824, at the battle
of Ayacucho, the last Spanish viceroy was

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.970
finally captured and all of Latin America
was free from Spain. Oh, it’s time for the

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:23.650
open letter? That’s A chair, Stan, but it’s
not THE chair.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.540
An Open Letter to Simón Bolívar. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:34.380
today. Oh, Llanero. I wonder if his hips swivel
when I wind him up. Context is everything.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.660
They do! Hey there, cowboy.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.540
Dear Simón Bolívar, First, you had fantastic
muttonchops. It’s as if you’re some kind of handsome

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.500
Martin Van Buren. You were a man of immense
accomplishments, but those accomplishments have

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.460
been richly rewarded. I mean, you have a country named
after you. Not to mention, two different currencies.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.380
But for my purposes, the most important thing
you ever did was die. You may not know this,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.760
Simón Bolívar, but when I'm not a world
history teacher sitting next to a fake fireplace,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.800
I am a novelist. And your last words, “Damn
it, how will I ever get out of this labyrinth,” feature

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.960
prominently in my first novel, Looking for Alaska.
Except it turns out, those weren’t your last words!

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.620
Your last words were probably, “Jose, bring
the luggage.” But I decided to use your

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:19.060
fancy, romantic, inaccurate last words. It’s
called artistic license. Put that in your luggage.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.300
Anyway, fantastic life; I just wish you’d
nailed it a little bit better with your last words.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.020
Best wishes, John Green.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.840
So by 1825, almost the entire western hemisphere
– with a few exceptions in the Caribbean

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.850
- was free from European rule. Oh, right.
And Canada. I’m just kidding, Canadians.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.050
It’s so easy to make fun of you because
you’re so nice. So I tease you and then

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.870
you’re like, “Aw, thanks for noticing
that we exist.” It's my pleasure!

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.830
Anyway, this is pretty remarkable, especially
when you consider that most of this territory

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.910
had been under Spanish or Portuguese control
for almost 300 years. The most revolutionary

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.320
thing about these independence movements were
that they enshrined the idea of so called

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.910
popular sovereignty in the New World. Never
again would Latin America be under the permanent

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:04.310
control of a European power, and the relatively
quick division of Latin America into individual

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.730
states, despite Bolivar’s pan South American
dream, showed how quickly the people in these

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:14.140
regions developed a sense of themselves as
nations distinct from Europe, and from each other.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.890
This division into nation states prefigures
what would happen to Europe in the mid-19th

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.990
century, and in that sense, Latin America
is the leader of 19th century world history.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.380
And Latin American history presages another
key theme in modern life - multiculturalism.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.910
And all of that makes Latin America sound
very modern, but in a number of ways, Latin

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.400
American independence wasn’t terribly revolutionary.
First, while the Peninsulares were gone, the

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.300
rigid social hierarchy, with the wealthy creoles
at the top, remained. Second, whereas revolutions

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.660
in both France and America weakened the power
of the established church, in Latin America,

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.100
the Catholic Church remained very powerful
in people’s everyday lives.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.580
And then, there is the patriarchy. Although
there were many women who took up arms in

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.920
the struggle for independence, including Juana
Azurduy who led a cavalry charge against Spanish

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.260
forces in Bolivia, patriarchy remained strong
in Latin America. Feminist ideas like those

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.010
of Mary Wollstonecraft would have to wait.
Women weren’t allowed to vote in national

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:10.190
elections in Mexico until 1953. And Peru didn’t
extend voting rights to women until 1955.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:16.560
Also, Latin America’s revolutionary wars
were long and bloody: 425,000 people died

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.500
in Mexico’s war for independence. And they
didn’t always lead to stability: Venezuela,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.100
for instance, experienced war for much of the 19th
century, leading to as many as a million deaths.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.990
And it’s important to note that fighting
for freedom doesn’t always lead to freedom;

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.550
the past two centuries in Latin America have
seen many military dictatorships that protect

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.140
private property at the expense of egalitarian
governance.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.480
“Freedom,” “independence,” and “autonomy”
are complicated terms that mean different

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.680
things to different people at different times.
So too with the word “revolutionary.”

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.220
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.600
Location change because I forgot to record
the credits, and my shirt matches the wall.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.550
Probably should have thought about that one
a little bit harder. Crash Course is produced

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.820
and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor
is Danica Johnson, the show is ably interned

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.970
by Meredith Danko, and it’s written by my
high school history teacher Raoul Meyer and

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.040
myself. Our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.550
Last week’s phrase of the week was "giant
squid of anger." If you want to suggest a

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.660
future phrase of the week or guess at this
week’s, you can do so in comments, where

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.900
you can also ask questions that will be answered
by our team of historians.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.560
Look at the beautiful Crash Course poster! Available 
now at DFTBA.com; link in the video description.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.560
Thanks for watching, and, as we say in my
home town, Don’t Forget To Be Awesome. Ow!

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.340
That's much harder to do when there's carpet.
