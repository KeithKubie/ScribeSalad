00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.300
Helium is fun for parties and making videos
for the internet, but for scientists, helium

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:12.160
has way more use than just getting a rise
out of people.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.269
Hey breathing animals, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.550
Get ready to freak out.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.289
There's a HELIUM SHORTAGE!!!

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.289
FREAK OUT.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.949
Okay, we got that out of our collective systems?

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.949
Great.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.919
See, before helium fills your party balloons
it has to be harvested.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.869
And though it can be pulled from the air,
the far easier way is to extract it from the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019
Earth's crust just like oil!

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.430
Natural gas is commonly 7-percent helium.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
So as it gets more difficult to find and extract,
it will get more expensive, which is terrible

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.730
not just for the giant inflatable alphabet
industry -- which came out of nowhere by the

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.170
way -- but also for science!

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
Helium is the second most abundant element
in the universe, but it's actually not that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.940
common on Earth.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.580
And, though we mostly associate it with balloons
and silly voices, helium is way cooler than

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.580
that.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.540
Helium is a noble gas -- which means it's
inert, and unlike my ex, it's VERY stable

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.540
and non-toxic.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.490
It's great for filling things like dirigibles,
and deep-sea divers use helium mixed with

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.850
oxygen because it's more stable at depth…

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.280
It's so stable that rocket builders pressurize
fuel tanks with it, it's reliable for radiation

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.390
detection systems, and arc welders (who play
in temperatures above 3000 Celsius) use it

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.630
at as gaseous safety blanket.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.390
Cryogenics companies, nuclear plants, satellite
manufacturers, and wind tunnel engineers use

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.110
it too, because it can handle reaallly cold
temperatures.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.110
Helium is.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.110
the.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.110
coolest.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.120
Below its boiling point of negative 269C,
Helium becomes a superfluid -- a liquid that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.830
flows without friction, and as we close in
on absolute zero helium behaves as a supersolid

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.330
and has even more crazy traits!

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.030
It's unique thermal properties make helium
popular with all the crowds: Physicists use

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.360
it with their superconducting magnets on the
Large Hadron Collider, engineers put it in

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.760
MRI scanners in hospitals, and helium-neon
lasers power supermarket barcode scanners.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.310
This stuff is everywhere!

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.390
And yet.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.000
It's not really.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.260
On Earth, Helium -- officially called, Helium-4,
comes from radioactive decay.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.760
When a radioactive element like uranium or
thorium breaks down over time (or decays),

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.540
it will occasionally lose two protons and
two neutrons.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.540
They'll just, break off; this is called Alpha
Decay.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.940
If that alpha particle grabs a couple of electrons,
BOOM helium-4!

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.670
It happens all the time.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.120
And yet, we're not surrounded by helium, because
it's lighter than our atmosphere -- so it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.500
floats all the way to the top, where it's
stripped off into space by the sun.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.090
And if you think Helium-4 is super rare, meet
it's cousin isotope: Helium-3.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.030
Helium-3 can be used as revolutionary future
fuel for fusion power plants, but it's less

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.160
than a fraction of a percent of all helium
on Earth… so we'd have to mine it on the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
moon.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.490
Actually, helium is way more common in space
overall…

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.349
So if we're in a shortage… who should get
the helium, scientists who need it for experiments

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.390
or Over the Hill balloons at the drug store?

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.069
Maybe we should feel bad about wasting helium-4…

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.520
Especially since the price we pay isn't really…
right.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.280
See, from 1925 till the 1990s, the government
was stockpiling helium from natural gas fields

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.260
in Texas, but then decided to flood the market
and sell it all in 1996.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.650
So now, the helium supply is inflated -- pun
intended.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.040
Though, luckily, scientists just found a huge
reservoir in Tanzania, so our supply should

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.090
last for decades, but even still, it's not
exactly renewable… so eventually we will

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.170
be out again.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.599
Cue sad balloon floating away into a blue
sky.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.250
Interestingly, SourceFed covered the "world
running out of helium" story like 4 years

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.250
ago.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.510
Have you heard of SourceFed?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.140
