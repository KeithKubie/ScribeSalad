00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.580
Evolution is the fundamental idea in all of
life science.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.800
So if we raise a generation of science students
who don’t understand the main idea in biology

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.599
they’re going to be incompletely educated
students and this is going to be trouble for

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.769
the United States because the United States
keeps in the game economically by innovating

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.609
– having new ideas, new products, new ways
of doing things.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.230
That’s what the United States produces and
brings to the world.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.660
And if we raise a significant fraction of
our students who don’t understand science

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.590
we’re not going to have the engineers and
scientists to continue this tradition.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:47.660
So for me it’s troubling objectively or
subjectively as one can be and as a citizen

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.120
of the U.S.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.260
I believe, I think here on Big Think that
the problem is the same thing that allows

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.420
us to recognize patterns to imagine shapes
and things and routes and ways to get things

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.040
done before we actually start doing those
things that that ability also enables us to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.110
understand that despite our best efforts we’re
all going to die.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.610
And I think that makes all of us a little
nutty.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820
We all find it a little troubling.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.890
And so because it seems incredible that all
this stuff that we store in our brain, all

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.360
the memories we have, all the mental images
that we are able to keep, all the algebra

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.180
that we learn, that all that goes away when
we die is really hard for all of us to accept.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.220
And along with this is that we are not nature’s
last word.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.120
We are not the final answer that nature came
up with.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.230
That we are not what some entity created as
his or her very best work.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.420
We’re just one more step on the evolutionary
timeline.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.040
And for many people that’s so troubling
they can’t accept it at all.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.840
For me, of course, it’s empowering and amazing
and it makes me want to live every moment

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.640
of every day in the best way possible.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.370
But for a lot of people it’s literally unimaginable.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.270
Our journey begins when I was in New York.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.810
I’m living in New York nowadays but a year
and a half ago I came here on an airplane

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.760
and I had to be someplace for a television
interview at – I had to get up around 5:00

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760
a.m.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760
Eastern time which was 2:00 a.m.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.010
Pacific time.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.349
And by the time I got to Big Think I was worn
out.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.940
I was a little worn out.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.220
And you guys asked me a fabulous question
about creationism.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.160
I’m not sure why you chose to ask that question
and I spoke from the heart how troubling I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.760
find it for the United States science educational
system, for our science students in the U.S.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.040
to be excluded or not be enlightened and not
be enabled by the fundamental idea in all

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.920
of biology which is descent by natural selection,
evolution.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.050
So you guys posted that and people went a
little crazy on the electric Internet, the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.720
computer machine that the kids use.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.770
And I just remind everybody when people take
the time to write and they take the time to

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.270
hate me that much, these are not people you’re
not going to reason with.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.959
These are not people that you’re going to
sit down and have a conversation with and

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.480
a discussion and achieve a new conclusion.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.010
We each have pretty much made up our minds
and so you can’t worry about that stuff

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.460
too much.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.690
My concern is not for the grownups who take
the time to write these inflammatory things

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.599
and react to your fabulous website and so
on.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.769
My concern is for the people who are still
in school, the people who are the future of

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.819
the U.S., the future of the U.S. economy.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.410
And larger the future of the world’s economy.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.769
I mean the United States is so influential.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.520
It’s the third most populous nation in the
world and it’s the nation that sent people

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520
to the moon.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.319
I mean it’s still a big influence.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.559
You can make very strong arguments for South
Korea, Japan – huge economies doing amazing

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.289
– Brazil doing amazing things.

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.139
But still the United States is the leader
in this stuff and so when we exclude a generation

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.120
of science students we’re headed for trouble.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.509
I guess what I would just remind everybody
who is troubled, each of us who might be upset

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:40.169
by the inflammatory comments below the Big
Think videos, those people are not really

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:48.939
in the mainstream and I will state categorically
that if they really believe the earth is 6,000

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.069
years old they’re really wrong about that.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.580
And that’s not an extraordinary statement.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:03.689
But I can’t tell – I’m not sure if the
guys, the people at Answers in Genesis really

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.610
believe that the earth is 6,000 years old.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.849
I’ll say they certainly seem to.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.319
When you’re with them they certainly seem
to be true believers.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:18.259
But they all use mobile phones, they all use
Facebook and Twitter and so on.

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.639
They take advantage of all of our technology
developed through the process of science.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.870
They’re all happy to have had smallpox vaccinations
if they’re of a certain age.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.119
Or they’re all happy to have not died of
smallpox, I’ll put it that way.

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:38.300
They’re all happy to eat food grown on farms
that is in general extraordinarily healthy

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.039
in general compared to other parts of the
world.

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:48.759
It’s not laden with bacteria and other harmful
pathogens that might be associated with food

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.759
stock.

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.309
Once in a while we have big trouble here but
the United State food system is a lot better

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:54.949
than most places.

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.300
And they take advantage of all of that.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.580
But apparently they don’t seem to appreciate
the science that led to it all.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.539
And what I find so troubling with the Answers
in Genesis people is they have a very diligent

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:14.770
or complete indoctrination program for young
people.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.050
They have quizzes and workbooks and classroom
curricula designed to indoctrinate young people

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.999
in the extraordinary and obviously wrong idea
that the earth is somehow 6,000 years old

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:33.720
and there was a flood 4,000 years ago and
somehow land plants survived and salt water

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.099
and seawater mixed but there’s still freshwater
fish and so on.

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:47.051
All these bits of evidence in nature that
point out how obviously wrong it is, they

00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:50.990
press on and they work very hard to indoctrinate
young people.
