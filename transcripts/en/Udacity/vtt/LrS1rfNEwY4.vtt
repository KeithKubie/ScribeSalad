00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.850
Instantly recognized by most of the
connected world, the Google logo wasn't

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.210
always so polished and
also has a rich typographic history.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.010
&gt;&gt; The original logo was
created by Sergey Brin in GIMP

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.130
in a typoface called Baskerville Bold.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.700
That's right, in GIMP.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.500
There was even a time when
the Google logo had a exclamation

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470
point like with Yahoo!

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.880
&gt;&gt; Ruth Kedar designed
the logo we see today, but

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.300
before the final design was reached,
&gt;&gt; She iterated on a whole bunch of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.180
ideas.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.930
The final wordmark is set
in the Catull typeface,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.910
using the primary colors in green.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.780
It's continued to evolve over the past
16 years with minor refinements, and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.865
most recently,
a flatter more simplified look.

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:39.475
&gt;&gt; Now Google doodles have
become a much anticipated

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:41.265
part of the Google.com homepage.

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:44.065
but did you know the idea for
doodles came about when Sergai and

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:47.615
Larry wanted to mark the occasion
of attending Burning Man in 1998.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.935
&gt;&gt; The doodle is a temporary
mask that denotes holidays,

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:52.825
signficant events, or figures.

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:56.015
The doodles stylistically mix
organic and inorganic objects and

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:57.920
figures to make the letter forms.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.510
&gt;&gt; And after viewing just a few of them,
thanks to the gestalt laws of grouping,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.239
your brain immediately
recognizes even very lyrical and

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.120
stylized drawings as the individual
letters in the word Google.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.420
&gt;&gt; Now material design utilizes
these very same principles and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.350
concepts to make it easier for
users to comprehend your UI.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.255
Knowing all that will you look at
the Google logo the same ever again?
