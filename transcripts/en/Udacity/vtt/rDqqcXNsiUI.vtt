00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.540
Chances are you probably
have a Facebook account.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.510
You might have a Twitter account.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.300
You might have a LinkedIn.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.390
You probably have several accounts
spread across several different social

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.830
networking sites and you use them for
a lot of different purposes.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.920
You might use one to keep
up with family and friends.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.260
You might use one for job networking or
when to find new media to consume.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.190
More and more people are actually using
social networking in education as well.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.520
There are teachers in middle and high
school that are using Facebook in their

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.910
classroom or using Facebook
to extend their classroom.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.530
They figure, if my students are on
Facebook every evening anyway,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.370
why don't I give them
assignment notifications there?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.659
Why would I host my
discussions on there?

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.453
Why don't I meet my students where they
are and try and bring the educational

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:40.137
experience to them, as opposed to
convincing them to come get it from me.

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:42.854
But there are others that suggest
that this isn't the best approach.

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:46.494
That by trying to integrate education
with something like Facebook, we're

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:50.470
watering down education, or we're trying
too hard to make education artificially

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.720
cool and really, we're losing some
of the real value in education.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.304
So these are some of the issues
that we're going to wrestle with in

00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:56.901
this lesson.

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:58.931
We're going to talk about whether or
not education and

00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:01.740
social networking should
actually be integrating this way.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.860
Should we try and
use Facebook for education?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.840
Should we try and
use Twitter for education?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.090
Or can we actually build new tools or
build new communities that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.800
blur the line between social networking
and education, while also preserving

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.808
some of that sanctity or some of that
rigor to that educational environment.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.460
Things like EdModo that
are custom built for

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.780
education but also have a lot of social
networking type features in them.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.450
So, we'll talk about these
different tools and these different

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870
questions that are available in
the community during this lesson.
