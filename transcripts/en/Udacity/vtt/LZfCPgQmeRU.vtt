00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.820
Rather than one person reading the entire ledger, say we

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.510
had more people to help, like the staff of your accounting

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.240
department. We'll split them into two groups, called the mappers and

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.620
the reducers. Then we'll take the ledger, break it into chunks,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.370
give each chunk to one of the mappers. That way all

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.930
the mappers can work at the same time, each over a

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.630
small fraction of the data. Let's see what a mapper would

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.650
do. They will take the first record in their ledger, and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.870
on an index card write the name of the store,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.870
and the amount of a sale. Then they'll take the

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.500
next record, and repeat. As they're writing the index cards

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.730
they'll pile them up so that cards for the same

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.130
store go in the same pile. By the end, each

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.330
mapper will have a pile of card per store. Once

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.850
the mappers have finished, the reducers can collect their sets

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.100
of cards. We'll tell each reducer which store they're responsible for.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.510
Such as this one for New York City, and this

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.560
one for Miami and Los Angeles. The reducers go to the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.410
mappers and retrieve the pile of cards for their stores.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.010
It's fast for them to do because the mappers have already

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.060
separated the cards into a pile per store. Once the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.190
reducers have retrieved all their data, they collect all the small

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.590
piles and create a larger pile. Then they start going through

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.250
the piles one at a time. All they have to do

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
at this point is add up all the amounts from all the cards in

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.200
the pile. That gives them a total sales for that store. They can then write

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.620
that amount on their final sheet. To

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.310
keep things organized each reducer goes through his

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.440
or her set of piles in alphabetical

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.600
order. In other words, Los Angeles before Miami.
