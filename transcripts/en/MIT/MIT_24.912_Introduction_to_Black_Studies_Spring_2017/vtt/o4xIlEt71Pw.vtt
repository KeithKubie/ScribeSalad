MICHEL DEGRAFF: From
the very beginning

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.440
of this course is designed
for this semester,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.300
we wanted to connect the
humanities, the classroom,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.309
with social justice.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.620
And luckily, we
had guest speakers

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.560
who themselves have been
engaged in social change.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.179
So for example, I mentioned
before John Turman.

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.720
There was also
Professor Fox Harrell.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.780
In fact, most of
our guest speakers

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.270
have been engaged in real
life trying to make change

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.770
for social justice.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.660
And because some of our
students were themselves

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180
children of immigrants,
many of them

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.554
got very interested,
for example,

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:41.420
in the issue of migration.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.360
Or to protect the
rights of migrants

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.690
who had been under attack in
the recent couple of years.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.290
Thanks to John Turman,
some of the students

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.630
connected to the
MIRA group, which

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.320
is the Massachusetts Immigrant
and Refugee Advocacy coalition.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500
And they were actually
very happy to do so,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
to be able to connect not
only the personal biographies,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.150
but also the classroom
work with actual action

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.990
for social change.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.470
And we also got to
understand the ways in which

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.580
what we are studying
in this course--

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.350
for example, the issue of
language and assimilation--

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.000
have impacts, say,
in the courtroom.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.700
So the issue of language
and assimilation

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.330
was particularly evident in the
court case of George Zimmerman.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.800
The trial of--

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.070
Zimmerman was accused of
killing Trayvon Martin.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.330
This young black boy who
was seen in his neighborhood

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.190
after seeing his
dad and he was--

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.170
after he bought some
Skittles and some drinks

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.610
and he was killed
by this vigilante.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.680
And the reason why
he was acquitted

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.520
is because the star witness
for the prosecution, Rachel

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.890
Jeantel, who happened to be
this young woman of Haitian

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.220
and Dominican decent, and
because of the way she spoke,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.400
she spoke with a black accent.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.800
And that accent,
undermined her credibility.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.880
In fact, some of the
jurors were clear

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960
that they would not believe
her because she sounded--

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.460
because of the way she spoke.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.390
And there's a beautiful
analysis of this episode--

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.910
a very sad episode--
by John Rickford

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.880
and Sharese King in the
journal, the journal Language,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.250
where they showed
very clearly that that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.610
was the main factor
for Rachel Jeantel

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.460
to not be believed by the jury.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.630
So here this is a
clear case where

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.460
attitudes towards language have
an impact on social justice.
