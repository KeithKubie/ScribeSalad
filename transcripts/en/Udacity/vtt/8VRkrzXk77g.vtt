00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.310
Okay David, what did you have for
the first sentence?

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.990
&gt;&gt; So for the first sentence, I created
the predicates lays eggs, feathers, and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.940
reptile, and
said if the animal lays eggs and

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.450
the animal does not have feathers
that implies the animal is a reptile.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.900
For the second one,
I said if the animal has feathers or

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.710
the animal has talons that implies
that the animal is a bird.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.040
So animal feathers or
talons, feathers or talons.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.402
For the third,
which is a longer one, I said,

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:31.099
if the the animal lays eggs and the
animal has a beak and the animal flies,

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.270
all three of these all in a chain,
that implies the animal is a duck.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.230
And similar for the fourth one, we have
three predicates on the left side.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.720
If the animal lays eggs,
the animal has a beak, and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.920
the animal does not fly,
then the animal is a Platypus.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.740
This guy shows us why a platypus is
such a strange animal because we need to

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.050
make a lot of caveats in order to
find what a platypus really is.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.240
&gt;&gt; Good David, that looks right to me.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.880
So to wrap this part up, let us note
that when we defined what a predicate

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.790
was, we set up a predicate like
Flies can map into true or false.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.670
Well okay,
a predicate can map into true or false.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.460
What about complicated sentences like
this, which are multiple predicates,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.370
as well as, implications?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.950
How do we find out whether the sentence
as a whole maps into true or false?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.620
That's what we're going to look at next.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.700
We're looking at truth tables.
