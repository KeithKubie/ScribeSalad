00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.060
There are historical reasons why our
healthcare system is the way it is and

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.491
why we've been so
slow to adopt health IT.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.065
For more on that, and more details
on the US healthcare system,

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:15.417
refer to chapter one in the text.

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:19.606
Now that we have the background to
understand why fixing health care is

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:24.292
a national priority, we'll look at what
the US federal government is doing to

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:27.061
foster the adoption of health IT and
create new

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.330
financial incentives to encourage
more use of patient centered care.
