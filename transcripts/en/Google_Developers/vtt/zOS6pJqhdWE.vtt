Let's talk about volume
control with Google Cast.

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:08.920
When you build for
Google Cast, you

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.530
have to understand it's a
really powerful experience.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.990
You're in control of
a big TV on the wall,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.080
and you're in control of a
big powerful sound system.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.370
So it's really important
to follow our UX guideline

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.485
principles about
how you do volume.

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:25.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.520
Now what I'm talking
about is that when

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.145
you're controlling
volume on the phone,

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:30.670
the last thing I
want to have to do

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.490
is put my phone down
to look for the remote

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.810
to control the volume.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.680
If it starts blasting really
loudly, what I need to do

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.530
is immediately control
the volume from my phone.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.755
So let's break it down.

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:42.380
First thing you need
to do is make sure

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.930
that the buttons on
the phone control

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.810
the volume on the Cast device.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.220
Secondly, they should
work on the Lock Screen.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.880
And thirdly, they
should even work

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.970
when you're in another app.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.120
Be aware that if another
app is in the foreground,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720
it may not be possible to
control the volume at a system

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.260
level.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
So there are limitations
in what you can do when

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.950
your app is in the background.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.440
Ideally, your app will provide
onscreen sliders as well as

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.310
physical buttons to give
your users options about how

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.390
they control the volume.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.130
These might seem
like simple tips,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.640
but it's super
important to ensure

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.820
that your user feels in control
of their powerful entertainment

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.630
system.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.610
Not only that, but they'll
stick with your app

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.870
instead of finding an alternate
that does things properly.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.980

wait to run my 2,000 watt

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.520
speakers through your app.
