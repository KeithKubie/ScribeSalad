1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.210
I've been a police officer road.
Some long questions for Echo Charles Reed.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.140
He's been studying them for four hours.

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.320
I've been a police officer for about four years.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.760
I consider myself to be proactive and try to get after it every day.

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.500
Much like many of my brother and sister law enforcement officers recently I

6
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.160
switched to a bigger agency with a,
with a bit of a different mission.

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.310
I still try to be as proactive and as thorough as I can in everything that I do,

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.170
but I've noticed that many of the front line supervisors in this agency want

9
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.380
officers to be reactive rather than proactive.

10
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.030
The supervisor in particular has told me to stop working so hard and get it

11
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.920
salty,

12
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.690
suggesting that I lower my morale.

13
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.430
The question is how do I build a relationship with these supervisors while still

14
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.410
being proactive and working hard?

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.570
So this is what I did when I got to seal team one.

16
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.400
I was this guy right here.
I was fired up.

17
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.010
I was,
hey,
oh,
we're doing the obstacle course today.
Cool.

18
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.100
I'm going to wear my rucksack with a 40 pound sand bag in it.

19
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.300
And all the guys that were older,
well,
you know,
looking at me like,
dude,

20
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.010
pump breaks

21
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.200
and you know,
of course,

22
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:35.201
what did I think those cards are hardcore guys are weak.

23
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.220
That's what I was thinking.
And then,
you know,
I thought to myself,
okay,

24
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.690
how can I,
how can I have influence over them?

25
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
How can I have influence over the platoon that a man can?

26
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:53.981
I have influence over the platoon that I'm in if everyone that's in my platoon

27
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:58.190
doesn't like me?
No.

28
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.713
Can you,

29
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.990
if everyone in my platoon doesn't like me because I am super hardcore,

30
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.000
then are they gonna steer it all in my direction?
No.

31
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.870
The answer's no.
The answer's no.
In fact,

32
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.820
they're going to isolate me.
In fact,

33
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:20.230
I'm going to have no influence over my platoon and that's,

34
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.190
that's a horrible thing.
So what did I do?
Did I just go,
okay,
cool,

35
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:29.390
I'll do it.
Looks like donuts is the deal.
No,
I didn't do that at all.

36
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.920
But I conformed.

37
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.220
But I conformed and people think,
oh,
that's weak.

38
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.030
You shouldn't conform.
Look,
you are not the priority.

39
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.210
You as an individual are not the priority in a seal platoon,

40
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.913
you're not.

41
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.180
The priority is the platoon.

42
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.210
The priority is the mission and if we're going to execute a mission,

43
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.840
we need to be very tight as a team.

44
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.230
So if I put my personality above the unity of the team,

45
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.980
I'm hurting our capability of accomplishing the mission,

46
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.720
especially if I realized that guys need to train a little bit harder and instead

47
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.920
of actually doing something that's going to move them in that direction,

48
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.270
they reject me and now I'm outside the,

49
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.160
the Brotherhood,
the circle,

50
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.300
and now I haven't moved them into the right direction at all.

51
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.810
So now there's one guy that's in really good shape,

52
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:39.811
me and everyone else is going in the other direction and I have no influence

53
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.990
over them that that's just terrible.

54
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.830
The mission is the most important thing.

55
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.160
In order to most effectively execute the mission,

56
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.900
we have to have the best possible team in order to have the best possible team.

57
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.260
We have to have trust and relationships inside the team.

58
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.240
If I
violate that,

59
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.760
I'm taking away from the team.
I'm taken away from our mission capability.
Now,

60
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.481
of course,

61
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.040
if there's someone that's grossly out of shape or out a standards,

62
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.330
yeah,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna try and tighten that person up.
But again,

63
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.710
if someone's completely out of standards and all I do is attack them,

64
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:28.180
what's their reaction?
It's too to step away from me to reject me.
But if I,

65
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.590
if I say,
hey man,
you know,
I know you've got a lot of experience and you know,

66
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.520
I'm,
I'm 19 and I just got a bud so I'm in pretty good shape,
but like,

67
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.660
can,
can,
can you teach me some of the tactics that,
you know,

68
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.340
and all of a sudden I'm building a relationship with them
and then I say,

69
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.080
Hey,
do you want to go for a little,
a little John with me after work?

70
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.680
And you know,
that guy's done eight deployments and he's tired and he's old,

71
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:57.460
but he wants to be back in shape because we all want to be in shape.
And he goes,

72
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.580
okay,
short one

73
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.540
and we're moving in the right direction.
So that's what you need to do.

74
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.330
You have to,
you have to back off a little bit.

75
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.750
You have to find balance and you have to focus on the team and it's better to

76
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.520
have the whole team.

77
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.260
It's better to have 20 people that move a little bit in the right direction.

78
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.830
Then have one person by themselves that's going in the right direction and

79
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.090
everyone else is going in the wrong direction.

80
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.900
So that's what you need to do.

81
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.280
Take the sandbag out of your ruck sack a little bit and you know,

82
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:37.920
I ran with jungle boots on,

83
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:42.700
I did all this stuff and it didn't take me very long to realize I was not doing

84
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:45.190
the right thing,
not making my team stronger.

85
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.980
I was isolating myself and stopped it.

86
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.420
So this guy,
he should like what?

87
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:57.421
Start acting just a little bit salty or you nor you know,

88
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.210
lower his morale appearance a little bit to kind of fit in so to speak.

89
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.940
Yeah.
Do you want to be part of the team?

90
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.470
If you're not part of the team,
you don't have any influence.

91
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:16.340
If you don't have any influence,
you can't move the team in the right direction.

92
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.410
If you can't move the team in the right direction,

93
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.460
the team is less mission capable.
That's what you're there for,

94
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.430
is to make the team more mission capable.

95
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.780
Every moment that you don't do that,
you're,
you're doing something wrong.

96
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.210
So yes,
you don't have to show up.
I mean,

97
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:38.330
just imagine I was a new guy at seal team one people we show up to run the

98
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.260
[inaudible] course,
the o courses,

99
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.720
obstacle courses are really hard obstacle course.

100
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.170
And I show up with a rock sack on with a 40 pound sandbag it as a new guy.

101
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.850
Yeah.
You know,
of course got people like,
oh,
that's fired up.
But people were like,

102
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.770
okay,
Oh,
you're,
oh,

103
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.101
you're,

104
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:03.101
you're 19 years old and you just got out of buds and whatever makes sense.

105
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.280
We don't like you.
So

106
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.830
it's kind of like steering like a big Van,
right?

107
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.050
You can't just start making big turns with the big,

108
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.760
otherwise the thing's gonna gonna tip over a little bit.
See what I'm saying?
No,

109
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:24.680
you gotta like you can't,
if you gotta you gotta go slow is what I'm saying.

110
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.840
Okay.
You guys understand.
