what is a prime first of all we have to
decide what it means for a number to be

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310
decide what it means for a number to be
 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.600
decide what it means for a number to be
a prime now you remember back on earth 7

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610
a prime now you remember back on earth 7
 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.450
a prime now you remember back on earth 7
was a prime because you couldn't write 7

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460
was a prime because you couldn't write 7
 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.870
was a prime because you couldn't write 7
as 2 times 3 or anything except 1 times

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880
as 2 times 3 or anything except 1 times
 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.050
as 2 times 3 or anything except 1 times
7 if the only way to factorize it is as

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060
7 if the only way to factorize it is as
 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.720
7 if the only way to factorize it is as
1 times itself and it's a prime number

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730
1 times itself and it's a prime number
 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.680
1 times itself and it's a prime number
on the moon is 7 a prime on the moon

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690
on the moon is 7 a prime on the moon
 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.360
on the moon is 7 a prime on the moon
well notice 7 is equal to 8 times 7 it

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370
well notice 7 is equal to 8 times 7 it
 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.980
well notice 7 is equal to 8 times 7 it
because 8 times 7 you pick the smaller

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990
because 8 times 7 you pick the smaller
 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.800
because 8 times 7 you pick the smaller
of the two which is 7 so 7 is 8 times 7

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810
of the two which is 7 so 7 is 8 times 7
 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.100
of the two which is 7 so 7 is 8 times 7
so 7 is not a prime because it has a

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110
so 7 is not a prime because it has a
 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.220
so 7 is not a prime because it has a
factorization but really before we get

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230
factorization but really before we get
 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.550
factorization but really before we get
down to the details of this we have to

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560
down to the details of this we have to
 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.950
down to the details of this we have to
decide what precisely it means to be a

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960
decide what precisely it means to be a
 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.550
decide what precisely it means to be a
prime so formally and numbers of prime

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560
prime so formally and numbers of prime
 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.280
prime so formally and numbers of prime
if the only factorization is 1 times

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290
if the only factorization is 1 times
 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.480
if the only factorization is 1 times
itself what does one mean on the moon we

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490
itself what does one mean on the moon we
 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.710
itself what does one mean on the moon we
have to say what is 1 if I put it in

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720
have to say what is 1 if I put it in
 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.340
have to say what is 1 if I put it in
quotes on moon well what is 1 1 has the

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350
quotes on moon well what is 1 1 has the
 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.200
quotes on moon well what is 1 1 has the
property that if you multiply anything

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210
property that if you multiply anything
 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.990
property that if you multiply anything
by 1 you get what you started with 1

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000
by 1 you get what you started with 1
 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.130
by 1 you get what you started with 1
times 3 is 3 1 times 111 is 111 right on

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140
times 3 is 3 1 times 111 is 111 right on
 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.100
times 3 is 3 1 times 111 is 111 right on
the moon that's not true 1 times 3 on

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110
the moon that's not true 1 times 3 on
 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.730
the moon that's not true 1 times 3 on
the moon is not 3 it's 1 1 times I well

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740
the moon is not 3 it's 1 1 times I well
 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.670
the moon is not 3 it's 1 1 times I well
one time so 111 happens to be 111 by

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680
one time so 111 happens to be 111 by
 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.170
one time so 111 happens to be 111 by
accident that well 1 on the moon 1 times

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180
accident that well 1 on the moon 1 times
 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.290
accident that well 1 on the moon 1 times
anything is basically all ones and zeros

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300
anything is basically all ones and zeros
 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.300
anything is basically all ones and zeros
1 times 30

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310
1 times 30
 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.810
1 times 30
is ten because you go through a digit by

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820
is ten because you go through a digit by
 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.030
is ten because you go through a digit by
digit and pick the smaller so one on the

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040
digit and pick the smaller so one on the
 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.450
digit and pick the smaller so one on the
moon is not one what is one on the moon

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460
moon is not one what is one on the moon
 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.330
moon is not one what is one on the moon
would you care to make a guess

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340
would you care to make a guess
 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.360
would you care to make a guess
what's the number is that I haven't

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370
what's the number is that I haven't
 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.130
what's the number is that I haven't
thought about it at nine it's not very

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140
thought about it at nine it's not very
 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.010
thought about it at nine it's not very
good fantastic brilliant because when

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020
good fantastic brilliant because when
 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.260
good fantastic brilliant because when
you multiply something by nine it just

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270
you multiply something by nine it just
 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.930
you multiply something by nine it just
copies what it sees nine times seven two

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940
copies what it sees nine times seven two
 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.490
copies what it sees nine times seven two
seven nine times one is one

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500
seven nine times one is one
 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.000
seven nine times one is one
just copies what it sees so on the moon

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010
just copies what it sees so on the moon
 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.220
just copies what it sees so on the moon
nine is the one so on the moon a prime

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230
nine is the one so on the moon a prime
 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.010
nine is the one so on the moon a prime
number has the property that the only

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020
number has the property that the only
 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.680
number has the property that the only
way you can factorize it is nine times

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690
way you can factorize it is nine times
 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.840
way you can factorize it is nine times
itself so seven is obviously not a prime

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850
itself so seven is obviously not a prime
 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.880
itself so seven is obviously not a prime
because seven is equal to 8 times 7 what

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890
because seven is equal to 8 times 7 what
 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.080
because seven is equal to 8 times 7 what
about 8 8 is not a prime because an 8 is

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090
about 8 8 is not a prime because an 8 is
 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.720
about 8 8 is not a prime because an 8 is
equal to 8 times 8 so start a prime it

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:30.730
equal to 8 times 8 so start a prime it
 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.790
equal to 8 times 8 so start a prime it
has a factorization in which one of the

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800
has a factorization in which one of the
 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.490
has a factorization in which one of the
fact neither factor is 9 any number if

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.500
fact neither factor is 9 any number if
 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.970
fact neither factor is 9 any number if
for it to be a prime the biggest digit

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:38.980
for it to be a prime the biggest digit
 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.270
for it to be a prime the biggest digit
has to be a 9 so 25 is not a prime

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280
has to be a 9 so 25 is not a prime
 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.880
has to be a 9 so 25 is not a prime
because we could multiply it by 5 and

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:44.890
because we could multiply it by 5 and
 

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.550
because we could multiply it by 5 and
get what we started with so we thought I

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560
get what we started with so we thought I
 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.110
get what we started with so we thought I
have a 9 in the number so 19 is the

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120
have a 9 in the number so 19 is the
 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.230
have a 9 in the number so 19 is the
smallest we must have a 9

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240
smallest we must have a 9
 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.130
smallest we must have a 9
there's no way to build 19 except what

00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.140
there's no way to build 19 except what
 

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.970
there's no way to build 19 except what
19 times 9 right you can't factor is

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:02.980
19 times 9 right you can't factor is
 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.040
19 times 9 right you can't factor is
because it's got a 9 in it so if you

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.050
because it's got a 9 in it so if you
 

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.980
because it's got a 9 in it so if you
know if it was 18 we can multiply 18 by

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:07.990
know if it was 18 we can multiply 18 by
 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.590
know if it was 18 we can multiply 18 by
an 8 and get 18 we'd have a

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:10.600
an 8 and get 18 we'd have a
 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.930
an 8 and get 18 we'd have a
factorization so you can always multiply

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:12.940
factorization so you can always multiply
 

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.360
factorization so you can always multiply
by the biggest digit and get what you

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.370
by the biggest digit and get what you
 

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.610
by the biggest digit and get what you
started with so the big biggest digit

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:17.620
started with so the big biggest digit
 

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.590
started with so the big biggest digit
had better be 9 these Prime's are going

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:19.600
had better be 9 these Prime's are going
 

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.410
had better be 9 these Prime's are going
to be rare than yes but not that all

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:22.420
to be rare than yes but not that all
 

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.680
to be rare than yes but not that all
that rare so yeah how rare are they well

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:25.690
that rare so yeah how rare are they well
 

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.010
that rare so yeah how rare are they well
let's look at the prime numbers so what

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.020
let's look at the prime numbers so what
 

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.450
let's look at the prime numbers so what
about 9 itself so back on earth we don't

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:33.460
about 9 itself so back on earth we don't
 

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.000
about 9 itself so back on earth we don't
say 1 as a prime because it's we

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.010
say 1 as a prime because it's we
 

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.280
say 1 as a prime because it's we
wouldn't have unique factorization 2 is

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:38.290
wouldn't have unique factorization 2 is
 

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.570
wouldn't have unique factorization 2 is
the smallest prime but on the moon just

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:42.580
the smallest prime but on the moon just
 

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.750
the smallest prime but on the moon just
as one isn't a prime on on earth 9 isn't

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760
as one isn't a prime on on earth 9 isn't
 

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.630
as one isn't a prime on on earth 9 isn't
a prime but apart from that

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640
a prime but apart from that
 

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.590
a prime but apart from that
we get 19 so the primes the lunar primes

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600
we get 19 so the primes the lunar primes
 

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:04.710
we get 19 so the primes the lunar primes
1929 39 49 59 69 79 89 90 is a prime 91

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720
1929 39 49 59 69 79 89 90 is a prime 91
 

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.140
1929 39 49 59 69 79 89 90 is a prime 91
as long as there's a nine and there's no

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.150
as long as there's a nine and there's no
 

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.300
as long as there's a nine and there's no
obvious way to factorize it you have to

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:09.310
obvious way to factorize it you have to
 

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.810
obvious way to factorize it you have to
check that 90 is a prime we can't get 90

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:12.820
check that 90 is a prime we can't get 90
 

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.510
check that 90 is a prime we can't get 90
by multiplying two numbers you have to

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:15.520
by multiplying two numbers you have to
 

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.970
by multiplying two numbers you have to
check it but it's true it's easy to

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:17.980
check it but it's true it's easy to
 

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.870
check it but it's true it's easy to
check 99 we get 109 yes that's a prime

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880
check 99 we get 109 yes that's a prime
 

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.790
check 99 we get 109 yes that's a prime
but 119 is not because as we saw a

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800
but 119 is not because as we saw a
 

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.970
but 119 is not because as we saw a
moment ago 19 times 19 yes

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980
moment ago 19 times 19 yes
 

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.990
moment ago 19 times 19 yes
119 so 1 1 9 is not a prime but roughly

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000
119 so 1 1 9 is not a prime but roughly
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.970
119 so 1 1 9 is not a prime but roughly

well that's that's 1 pick the smaller of

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800
well that's that's 1 pick the smaller of
 

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.699
well that's that's 1 pick the smaller of
the two okay now we do the C C times 9

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:17.709
the two okay now we do the C C times 9
 

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:22.530
the two okay now we do the C C times 9
is well it's C whatever C is multiplying

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:22.540
is well it's C whatever C is multiplying
 

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.380
is well it's C whatever C is multiplying
it by and 9 doesn't change it and C

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:25.390
it by and 9 doesn't change it and C
 

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.560

times 1 well C can't be 0 so it's gonna

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:28.570
times 1 well C can't be 0 so it's gonna
 

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.910
times 1 well C can't be 0 so it's gonna
be 1

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920
be 1
 

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.569
be 1
now we add them up and we get 1 1 plus C

00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:33.579
now we add them up and we get 1 1 plus C
 

00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:37.380
now we add them up and we get 1 1 plus C
I don't know what it is it's the bigger

I don't know what it is it's the bigger
 

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.889
I don't know what it is it's the bigger
of 1 and C well it's gonna be C it could

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:40.899
of 1 and C well it's gonna be C it could
 

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:44.040
of 1 and C well it's gonna be C it could
be 1 anyway what we get is the number 1

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.050
be 1 anyway what we get is the number 1
 

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.199
be 1 anyway what we get is the number 1
c9 but C can't be 0 because if C was 0

can't happen this is a contradiction if
C was equal to 0 we wouldn't get the 1

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:58.450
