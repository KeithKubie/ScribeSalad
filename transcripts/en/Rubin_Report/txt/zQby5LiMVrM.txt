Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          joining me today as a biologist, a former professor at evergreen state who is now a professor in exile Bret Weinstein. And welcome back to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me back on professor and exile life friend. That's what it says on your Twitter bio, which means it's your most defining characteristic right now. That has become the the tenor of my life. All right, so I went into the Rubin report archives. They're very much like the Jedi archives. I went into the Ruben report archives this morning that you were on this show originally on May 30th, 2017. So that's about a year and a half ago. It was just as the Evergreen Brouhaha was beginning. You, you still were employed at the time, uh, which probably seems like a lifetime ago. Um, so I think first maybe we should just play a little catch up from then. I just to be clear, you, you have been on the show one since then. You are on with your brother Eric. And we did a little bit about evergreen in your life, but I saw, I've thought first let's just do catch up on, on what happened, where you're at, where you're going, and then we're going to do sort of new territory and we're going to cover a lotta biology and all that. Great.

Speaker 3:          01:15          So May 30th of 2017 would be exactly one week into the riots. The protests at my classroom that became relatively famous happened on May 23rd so one weekend I was sitting in this chair

Speaker 2:          01:31          and that feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? I mean it feels like it for me and I think less has happened to me, although it's been a pretty busy year and a half.

Speaker 3:          01:37          The transformation of my life and Heather's life in that period has been so dramatic that it's hard to even relate. You know? I've never had so much happen in a year.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yeah. So, okay. So for people that don't know anything about the story, and I suspect there's very few watching this at the moment, can you give me like the 92nd recap of what happened? So can that be done in 90 seconds? Let's see.

Speaker 3:          02:02          It can be done with with carnage. I'll say I feared this question more than any other because there's so much detail in the story. It can't be covered properly. Give, give a cliff notes version that basically as an explainer, equity and inclusion movement got started on my campus as it is on virtually every campus. And the new president of Evergreen threw fuel on the fire. He used the division over that issue to accomplish things he could not have accomplished otherwise. I tried to block his moves to dismantle the excellent part of Evergreen's teaching model, which Heather and I were using to full effect. And I became effectively enemy number one of this equity and inclusion movement. They arranged a protest at my classroom. Very dramatic. 50 students showed up demanding my resignation. Not a single one of them was a student I had ever encountered.

Speaker 3:          02:59          Um, but in any case, they made a terrible error. They filmed their confrontation with me. They uploaded it. I now know to Facebook somebody else in the public, uh, picked those videos up and broadcast them in the world, watched me, tried to reason with them. And uh, that set things in motion where evergreen started using me as an excuse for its problems. It blamed me for what happened there for the drop off in enrollment for all sorts of things. And uh, I started engaging with the public about what was taking place at Evergreen, uh, issues of freedom of expression, free inquiry on college campuses and increasingly a evolutionary biology, which, you know, people, uh, did not initially really understand that that was the focus that I had not uh, freedom of speech issues. Now increasingly that's what people want to talk to me about, although we going to get to plenty of that because I know that's what you're, your real focus and passion is.

Speaker 3:          04:03          And it's sort of funny that now you've been thrust into this. Um, but in effect you were protesting putting racist policies on campus. Is that fair to say? Yes, and this is one of the, I think, hardest lessons for people to learn. People, good people get the idea that you can spot the right side by certain heuristics. And you know, there's been a historical fact of oppressed people tending to be people of color, et cetera. And so people have gotten lazy about recognizing who's in the right. If you follow a principle to its logical conclusions. In other words, if you're against segregation, for example, as I am, then when the segregationists are telling white people to leave campus or asking them to leave campus, then you are committed to standing against segregation. And when you do stand against segregation, the world goes crazy because people who are, um, being lazy about recognizing which side is defending the principle that they, they subscribe to, uh, they fall out in the wrong place.

Speaker 3:          05:17          And so anyway, yes, it is your principles and adherence to them that gets you in trouble. Yeah. Okay. So you then show up in this studio a week after this whole thing goes down. It was your first public interview about any of this. What did you think at the time was going to happen by talking about this publicly or, or what was your hope at least by talking about this publicly? Well, you know, initially my hope was to expose the foolishness at evergreen and save the college from its own worst instincts because your audience may not care terribly deeply about this, but for a small number of people, for 4,000 students at a time, Evergreen was actually a wonderful experiment in which it was possible for people who hadn't had tremendous, uh, educational advantages before they got to college to have an experience that couldn't be reproduced anywhere else. Evergreens model was so unique that if you ended up in the right classrooms with professors who really cared, it was, it was like no other place. And, and you were given incredible, uh,

Speaker 2:          06:30          freedom as a professor to do what you wanted with these kids. Right.

Speaker 3:          06:33          I believe that the position that Heather and I had was the freest academic position in the country and maybe on earth. Wow. I mean, really more freedom than a tenured professor at Harvard has. And that was, let's be honest, it was both a blessing and a curse. If you decided to use that freedom for good, if you decided to figure out how to innovate structures that didn't exist anywhere else, you could do it and nobody could tell you not to. On the other hand, if you decided to, uh, you know, take the rest of your career off and you know, teach with one hand while you, you know, dealt with your hobbies, you could also get away with murder. And so that happened as well. And you know, there was a tension every, every good professor at evergreen grumbles about the fact that there are a large number of people who, uh, are holding positions there that they don't really value.

Speaker 3:          07:26          And you know, the, the phrase that we, that we typically used in private on the faculty was that Evergreen paid in freedom, which meant, um, that it didn't pay well. It wasn't a good paying job, but the ability to have a blank canvas and decide how you were, you know, what you wanted to teach and in what way, and to innovate new mechanisms and take students off campus for a week or two or 10. Um, that freedom was a very valuable commodity, that Evergreen undervalued the whole time it should have. It should have leveled with people that it was hiring and it should have said, look, this job is not going to make you wealthy, but it can make you very happy if you have the temperament that really wants to figure out what's possible.

Speaker 2:          08:09          So as this was unfolding and now you went public and you also did Rogan and you were on Tucker Carlson where you said, I'm deeply progressive because suddenly you were sort of getting crap from your side, so to speak, and you were getting embraced by perhaps a different side. And I do want to get a little more into that now because it shows what a sort of crazy realignment politically we've had these days. Um, were you shocked how deep it went? So you went public, you are, you are giving the facts, you were exposing sort of the corruption and how it went all the way up to the administration and all that. I think from that first interview we did, I think you thought that there would be a course correction in your, or at least there was a chance for a course correction and at least the way I read the last year, at no point was there a slow down or any reflection from the administration and the rest of it, they just went in on it.

Speaker 3:          09:01          Yes. I am completely shocked by the fact that the world's recognition of just how awful things were at evergreen did not force an acknowledgement that something was wrong. So I would not have been surprised if evergreen had backed off cynically if they had privately said, actually we were on the right track, we were misportrayed and, but we nonetheless have to acknowledge what the world is saying to us. The fact that that did not happen at all still shocks me and I can't explain it because you have a president who is widely understood to be a, is there a polite word for bonds?

Speaker 2:          09:44          He's bonkers. He's is one of my favorite words. Yeah. I like bananas too, but bonkers whackadoodles Yang. But in any case, we have a president who was,

Speaker 3:          09:54          I mean, look, he's the mad king, right? He's the mad king and you've got a whole bunch of people standing around, um, accepting his authority when in fact he's an outsider, is understanding of the college, uh, or his plans for the college are completely inconsistent with the values that the college was founded on. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:15          And where are they really accepting as Athari actually, because there are moments in, in the chaos of this that these videos are posted where he can't even leave to go to the bathroom. And it's like he was also a hostage in this, in his own, maybe his own like perverted dream or something. You know what I mean? He was,

Speaker 3:          10:32          um, both puppet and puppeteer. Yeah. Okay. Um, and so the thing is, yes, he is held hostage in those things, but I believe he's a willing hostage in the sense that he's trying to accomplish something and you know, look, it tells the whole tail. Once you say what we are doing is about equity,

Speaker 2:          10:50          there is a whole swath of people that cannot figure out how they would object no matter what it is that you say next, no matter what your plan is. If you've said that it is for the purpose of racial equity, then a whole section of the population will just fall in lockstep. What is that? What is that psychologically do you think? Oh, I know because I think we're seeing this everywhere now. This is not just something that's happening at universities anymore. This is happening all over society. I wish I could. I could

Speaker 3:          11:19          say that it is an error in cognition that people are seeing it incorrectly. What I know for sure now as well as anybody on earth is that the part of people's minds that drives them in the direction of silence, of self editing, of all of these things is actually accurately perceiving a threat that it cannot manage. Now, I'm not looking for sympathy. I do not have my job anymore. And I miss it. It was a great, however, I've landed on my feet, I'm, I wouldn't trade my position for any other. I like where I am. However, first of all, there's not an infinite number of those positions in the world. So most people who are looking at some sort of an equity and inclusion juggernaut who are thinking, should I stand up, actually have to ask themselves what happens if I do? Um, do I have an economic plan B for my family?

Speaker 3:          12:21          Right? Anybody who doesn't have an economic plan B for their family. And I have to say, as much as I would like evergreen to be a place in which all the faculty had enough skills that they could go do something else. If they have to, they don't. Right? They can't easily move to another college because the way they teach at Evergreen doesn't, uh, create a CV that will get you hired elsewhere easily. Um, and so I think lots of people are looking ahead and saying, if I stand up and I say the right thing now, what, what will, what will become of me? And the problem, the place where I, you know, I have sympathy for anybody who sees that and says, look, I don't have a plan B. I don't know what to do. Where I lose sympathy with them is when they then having made that calculation, rationalize what they are saying and they join, not reluctantly, but they become enthusiastic allies of this movement in order to, uh, basically they sell the rest of us out. Right.

Speaker 2:          13:20          And in a weird way, they almost have to do that psychologically to live with themselves. Right. I mean, otherwise you realize that mean then you are a sellout in the, you know, it, it's harsh, but it's true. But what I'm so fat, why? The reason I'm so fascinated with this is because as you know, I've been on tour with Peterson for the last couple months and I think this is the number one question that we get asked. People want to speak up and they are afraid of losing their jobs. And I think that's why your story resonated with so many people because people were looking at you and going, well, it's pretty freaking obvious. This guy is not a racist. He's not a hater. He's a self identified, left d and progressive and all of these things. And somehow he stood up to the monster. And I think the fact that you're still here and you're, you're at, you're not employed at the moment. And I W I do want to discuss that a little bit too, but the fact that you're still here, you're alive, you're still willing to talk about these things. I think that's the type of courage that people are looking for at the moment.

Speaker 3:          14:16          Well, you know, I do. So I have to say for I know a year now, uh, I have had these interactions, you know, a couple of times a day somebody will come up to me on the street and unless I'm in Olympia, it's always nice. People have people,

Speaker 2:          14:34          even sons beard, they're still coming up to actually that has reduced that I think are not quite sure. Yeah. There is that who I think it is or is that Eric or is it provided? I don't know. But you go buzz cut and, and then you're Scott free then. Oh Man, I'd be, yeah, I could go on the Lam. They'd never find me. Yeah. Um, but

Speaker 3:          14:52          the thing is the, it raises questions. The stuff that people say to me about what they see on the outside, you know, I get to compare that to what the experience was on the inside. And so I've done a lot of thinking about what it is, is, you know, is there some reason that that I stood up when others didn't. And I think, you know, it comes down to something simple, which, you know, I'll just, I'll just put it out there. I think people are rationalizing their acceptance of this nonsense movement in order to sleep. And for some reason that particular switch works the opposite way from me. If I heard myself rationalizing that I would not be able to sleep. So in order to sleep I had to stand up and you know, I'm lucky, I have really good friends. I have a wonderful brother who was, you know, friends with you and that put us in contact and uh, I have something else to talk about. Evolutionary biology is fascinating to people. They don't know how to think about it. And there, you know, just as my students where they're very interested to hear what I have to say on the subject. So that means somehow, even though I couldn't see it exactly on May 23rd of 2017, there was a path forward for me, which, you know, it could come crashing down tomorrow, but so far it looks good and I, I regret nothing.

Speaker 2:          16:21          Is there an evolutionary explanation to that type of person that either can sleep or cannot sleep? Because you know, people come up to all of us all the time. Now and they say, I wish I could speak up. I don't want to lose my job. My wife's pissed at me. I mean all of these things. And they're literally, sometimes I'm talking to people one on one and they're whispering, I mean this, this, this layer of fear is seriously real and it is sitting on top of people. So is there an evolutionary explanation why at the moment it seems that a very small amount of people are doing it? Absolutely. And for me, just quickly, I would just say for me it's like, I don't know if it's about sleeping, I just, I just feel like I'm doing what's right. That's it. It's actually not more, uh,

Speaker 3:          17:09          you know,

Speaker 2:          17:10          it's not more a confusing or needs more of an explanation

Speaker 3:          17:14          and then that, that's just what I'm doing. Um, yeah, there are two things to say on this front. One, so I know we're going to talk more about evolutionary theory later on, but yeah, there is a way in which evolutionary theory stalled 30 years ago and I don't believe that the explanation that you're looking for is on the table in the way that you know any evolutionists that you asked, but say, Oh yeah, the explanation is over here, but I do believe we can see what it is. There are a lot of adaptations that do not map well onto the individual. If you look at the individual and you say, well, why would the person behave this way? It seems paradoxical sometimes if you look at something larger than the individual and it's not the group. This is the thing. We've been caught in this argument about group selection since the 60s and or actually even earlier, but that's where it began to come to a head.

Speaker 3:          18:12          If you look at the lineage that is to say a population of people who are related now talking about ancestral ancestral populations, there are many, uh, characteristics that have value for the lineage moving forward, that are hard to understand from the point of view of the individual and many of the things that we have a really hard time explaining, including things like homosexuality and religion. Um, many of these things are adaptations that exist at that slightly higher level. And so what I would say is an individual who can't sleep if they're not doing the right thing or if they hear themselves rationalizing that individual is not well suited to certain jobs. Um, but they're very well suited to other jobs. And the idea that a population has an emergent nature and that, you know, a division of labor between, you know, I'm not telling you that not rationalizing is the way we should all be.

Speaker 3:          19:17          It may well be that we need certain people who are very good at carefully rationalizing certain things in order to get jobs done. I mean, I would imagine if you are in the military, if you were in a position of command in the military, that there are certain things that you have to rationalize in order to win the war. Now, I'm not saying I don't like war. Uh, I'm not saying that, you know, every war should be one. You know, you shouldn't enter into a war that, uh, isn't justified. But once you've entered into it, the goal is justified. Maybe you have to rationalize certain things. You know, you move troops over here in order to protect something over there. Well, what are you doing to these people? You may be sending them to their deaths. So, you know, I even talking about it makes it makes me uncomfortable because, uh, it's not something I would be good at.

Speaker 3:          20:09          But the point is, when you look at the population and the fact is the populations that we have alive on earth today are all winners, right? These are the winners. Irrespective of how you got here. You're respective of how, uh, oppressed your population looks in relation to other, somehow you made it to the president. You're a winner. Um, those winning populations had many characteristics within them and they knew how to call upon these people and you know, sideline those people and then switch it up at the point you arrive somewhere else. We're different skills are necessary. So, um, in essence, yeah, I think there's a very simple evolutionary explanation and some of us have certain skills, other people have other skills. And the real trick is can you figure out the switching mechanism that decides what to call on? At what moment?

Speaker 2:          20:58          That seems to be the key part of this, right? I mean, that's it. It's like some people are going to do it. Some people, some people know they should do it and won't do it. Some people probably shouldn't do it and do, do it and everything in between. Well,

Speaker 3:          21:11          you know, you probably have this experience too, but when I, when people come up to me and they talk to me, there's just a couple of different styles of conversation that unfold. Um, you know, there's lots of people who want to, you know, apologize for what happened to me, which I always find that odd. You know,

Speaker 2:          21:27          unless they were there in the room, right. Unless it was them just never knows. But I'm guessing those people have nothing about him that you never contacted me. But you know, some people want to apologize, some people,

Speaker 3:          21:37          you know, I want to thank me and some people, there's this one thread which is I'm facing something like this too. Yeah. Can you give me some advice? And you know, I always say the same sort of thing to them and it throws them, you know, I always say, look, it's not safe. You have to think very carefully about what you're doing and don't kid yourself about what you're signing up for and you know, you can, you just watch in their eyes as they, um, grapple with the fact that they didn't get what they wanted from me, what they want it to be told. They wanted somebody to egg them on and say, do it. It's the right thing. It'll work out. And you tell them, oh, it may not work out. And you know, there's a moment of heartbreak, but my hope is that the people who should do it have to go through that little heartbreak in order to get to the other side. And so among my various, uh, jobs at the moment is to show people the abyss and just say, look, is this the abyss you want to jump? If it is, nobody can tell you that, but you, I certainly can. Yeah. It would be irresponsible of me to tell people to do something like what I did. Because you could get, you could get maimed.

Speaker 2:          22:56          Yeah. And in a way it's, it's sort of the shows that I'm most proud of. Here are the ones where I was able to facilitate a little bit of that. So it's sitting down with you. It's sitting down with Lindsay Shepherd who went through something very similar and sitting down with James Damore, these people who did not ask to, to be heroes, who even if I say the word hero, I can see you're uncomfortable. You know what I mean? Like the people that didn't want this, but somehow it got thrust upon them. And then, and then they got there and then hopefully I was able to amplify that a little bit, which then spreads that out to all sorts of other people, which is pretty cool. So let's, let's, I know I don't want to do this for obviously the entire interview, so let's just catch up on a couple of things. What we'll do a bit more. So there's one

Speaker 3:          23:37          thing that is, and I believe there's a little caveat to it. If you do it and you'd do it for the right reasons, in other words, you could do it cynically. You could stand up against one of these things in order to see if you couldn't get famous or something. People will see through that, right? Especially the people who've gone ahead down this road because they know something about it. Um, but if you do it for the right reasons, if you're really trying to advance the ball to challenge a bad narrative, the people who have gone through this recognize and you know, it won't feed you, but it is very reassuring to discover other people who see a, the corrupt narrative who understand what happens when you challenge it. Um, so anyway, if, if you're hungry to meet other people like that, uh, standing up, you know, you got to figure out what they're going to do to feed yourself, but it does put you in contact with lots of people who, uh, are very worthwhile.

Speaker 2:          24:40          Yeah. It's so interesting because again, after being with Peterson, it's like people say to him, you know, I want to get a new job. Should I just quit my job tomorrow? And it's like you have to seriously think about what your options are. You may hate your job, but doesn't mean you can leave tomorrow. Right? You got to think about all of this seriously. And I think that that is the key here. So I'm curious how much of this has shifted what you think politically, because you do talk about politics now. And I know when I had you in there for the first time, I think I said to you, we'll revisit this question because I thought, here's a guy that's that. I come from a very similar political places, him as a progressive and all of these things. And now I see, you know, as you know, I consider myself a classical liberal and I, and I love libertarian ideas.

Speaker 2:          25:25          Obviously we just did stand up together last night in Bray California. You and your brother joined me on stage for the second half and it was mostly a conservative crowd. There were some Trump people, there were some lefties and some liberals, but you know, mostly conservatives and they love you guys. And yet you both still identify as lefties and the whole thing. And I wonder now, a year and a half later, are you shocked at that, that you are now really liked by people that perhaps you thought were your yogic opponents and now you're sort of on the outs with the people that you used to be allies with? Okay, that's, that's a good question. I get one every episode. Um, I am

Speaker 3:          26:09          hardened and flabbergasted by what I encounter on the center. Right. You know, this is not the Republican party that I remember from my youth. This is a very different entity and I think it has a lot of refugees who had been driven out of other places and they've grouped there because I don't, because, because something over there is making sense to them.

Speaker 2:          26:36          Well, as you said to me the first time we met Dave, you have PTSD for vehicle from the, yeah. I must say we should, we should return to this, but I, I, uh, was very

Speaker 3:          26:44          heartened to hear you bring that up. Um, during your episode with, uh, with Ben Shapiro and Eric and, and Jordan, you, uh, you went through a cool exercise, which I think deserves a place. Um, with steel manning and your exercise I think was something like where is some place that you suspect your own thinking might be incorrect and you brought up political PTSD as a place to pay attention to. But let's just say I am shocked that uh, the center right seems to be, you know, it has protective custody of liberty and free speech and science of all things. I mean, how the heck did the center right ended up ended up having custody of these things which are traditionally things that the writers is uneasy about on the left, uh, has, has defended. But nonetheless, the people who value them are where they are. I think they do have something wrong.

Speaker 3:          27:44          You, your, your initial question was, has this changed my political view? And I think one of the everybody said it would. And I, you know, I, I believe I am being honest with myself when I say really hasn't changed my view of what is true politically much if at all. I think because what I believe is true isn't predicated on anything social. Right? In other words, these are conclusions that I reached through game theory and evolutionary thinking and observation of the political landscape. They're not things, you know, it wasn't that I went to a dinner party and had a good time and fell in with their political ideas. Right? So it's not, you know, the fact that I am not, um, welcomed in certain quadrants of the left, it doesn't change anything about what's true at all. Right. It can't.

Speaker 2:          28:35          So I, I understand that, but at the same time, I mean, you can go to, I've done public events with you that are usually, we're usually invited by libertarian organizations. Um, we've done some iron, ran things together and, and a couple of other things. And I think everything that we've done publicly and when you joined me for stand up, the crowds all basically seem to be on the right, as you're saying, this sort of new, this new center, right. That maybe needs a better phrase than that concenter rights. It needs something sexier than that per se. Um, but I mean, have you been invited anywhere by progressive's to tell your story or to get some comradery or empathy or sympathy or Kudos or anything other than GFE very occasionally

Speaker 3:          29:16          and only slightly. I mean, the, the asymmetry is amazing. And I must say one of the most interesting things to me about the early phase of, um, you know, just public part of my life is that initially there was just this overwhelming, uh, uh, message that came back at me. You are a conservative or welcome to conservatism or something like that. And to the dark side I think is what they usually do. Say that. And then at the point that, uh, the phrase IDW showed up on the landscape, then there was this point about, oh, the IDW is, uh, you know, right wing movement or something like that. And so there's a trajectory there. There's something, we track immediate effects pretty well as people we can observe them and detect them. There's often a slower pattern that is harder for us to see. And so just by analogy, I find this as true with healing, you know, just physical healing.

Speaker 3:          30:15          If you do damage to your knee, for example, there's a one month healing trajectory, but there's also a one year and a five year trajectory and they're much harder to spot. Um, so anyway, the, the interesting thing is the challenge of you're on the right or now, surely you will be moving to the right. You know, that was just an overwhelming message that came back. Um, but the ability to talk back to that message and say, actually, no, still on the left, actually part of a left, you don't even remember exists. And one of my fears is that all of the stuff that the left was correct about is not getting properly credited now. So to the extent, I don't know if people have seen this, a hidden tribes, a report that came out maybe a month ago now that says that there's this vast Alsace, yeah, 80% in the middle of do agree on, you know, the desirability of a fair society that doesn't burden one population in order to enrich another. And you know, that we basically share

Speaker 2:          31:19          that basically it's only 8% actually that buy into this hyper political correctness and the, and the rest of that, it's a tiny fringe, the authoritarian

Speaker 3:          31:27          left and it's a tiny fringe on the, you know, the white nationalists, right. And the rest of us in the middle, you know, we're not in perfect agreement, we don't agree on the order of the priorities, but we do agree basically on what a good society would function like. And that a lot of the gains, I mean, you know, the ability to be gay and out and function in society without that being a tremendous obstacle that that's something that, you know, the left deserves credit for racial equality. You know, equity is a different beast by virtue of the new, uh, I hesitate to even call it at definition because it's not a definition in the standard sense, but it quality. These are traditional left values and we were right about. And so the fact that these things are now no longer controversial that belongs in the discussion to the left has been right about some stuff. It's also been wrong about some stuff and the right has been right about some stuff and it's been wrong about some stuff and it is time for that conversation.

Speaker 2:          32:28          Absolutely. And that's why I don't denigrate what it was. I am upset with what it is and perhaps guys like you and your brother and Sam, some people that still identify as left, these will be able to do a reclamation project that I just don't see anymore. I see sort of more that this thing needs to burn. So out of the ashes, the Phoenix can rise. That's just maybe a little bit of a tactical thing, but let's just jump back to an evolutionary explanation for some of this. So I asked you about why some people can do this from an evolution evolutionary perspective, why some people are able to step up and some people aren't. What about, what's the evolutionary explanation for why this, let's say 8% very loud, but small group of people feel the need to purge everyone. Is there, is there an evolutionary, because that seems it would be almost counter to evolution. You'd want to have more commonalities with people and bring in a big tent. But what I see them consistently doing is just getting rid of everybody who dare, you know, talk back to the, to the God. Well, you know, I, I wish I had known this was gonna come up cause I would have looked it up, but there was, uh, there was, uh, put me on the spot,

Speaker 3:          33:38          got a report that emerged. Maybe it was six or eight months ago that I don't, you know, I haven't looked into it and it's not my area of specialty, but, uh, it sounded right to me. And what it said was that there is a particular, um, there's a particular personality trait, authoritarianism that isn't ideological. It doesn't really care whether it's, uh, you know, defending fascism or communism, um, what it wants to do, his boss, people around. And that essentially what's confusing to people is that at the moment, these dyed in the wool authoritarians are concentrated over on the left and they're saying stuff that sounds nominally like leftist stuff, but that, you know, we're the winds to shift and the authoritarians have the moment to be over on the right they be there. And so, uh, that, that makes sense to me. And what I would like people, yourself included to consider is that there is almost no point in engaging those people, right?

Speaker 3:          34:50          This question of the importance of liberty is settled, right? The 80% of us in the middle all get the fringe on the far left and the far right are, I don't want to say safe to ignore because they can always rise up and become important as the one on the left is doing. Um, however, that's not where the game is. The game is all of the people who can't figure out how to escape from the stigma at all. That is driving civilizations. So all of the people who are falling in line with what's going on on the authoritarian left, those are the people to reach. And what you raise about, you know, let's say the audience last night at the comedy club and you know, this is reliable, this was the second one I with you. It was exactly the same the first time. The thing that is so heartening is, you know, I can come into a room and you're right, that room last night must've been 95% right of center.

Speaker 3:          35:53          Yeah. And first thing you tell them is here's a, a progressive, I'm, I tell them I'm a radical, right? Yeah. It doesn't dampen their enthusiasm one bit. In fact, it, they're thrilled to discover that things are not so bleak and that there is somebody on the other side of this thing who still talking reasonably and can hear them and can see them and doesn't think that they're racist and out of control. And so anyway, you know, I know I take a lot of flack for, you know, interacting with the right and I am not listening to that flack because it is the best thing we can do is to engage and uh, you know, when you spot the humanity of the people on the other side, then to the extent that we differ over something, we can talk about it.

Speaker 2:          36:41          All right. Well we could keep going down this Pandora's box of, of lunacy related to everything that you've been through. But let's do, let's just catch it up to where we are now and we can start looking at the future a little bit. So you and your wife, Heather, who you referenced how they're high end, who's been on the show, who's a brilliant professor as well and, and, and has that, that brave evolutionary tick that you have to, how'd you end up marrying a woman that was going to have the same evolutionary tickets? You, that's pretty good. Uh,

Speaker 3:          37:07          you really want to know the answer. Yeah, I'm Heather and I, we were not going out, but we were friends in high school and you know, I don't know that others will understand the, the phrase, but the one that runs in my head is somebody goes to high school with the girl you should marry and it might be you. Right. So anyway, in my case, you know, I don't know how because you know, I was, I was a confused kid. Like every other kid that age, there was something about her that seemed so very right. And I have to say, um, I was right about that best decision I ever made.

Speaker 2:          37:45          Was she ever pissed at you during this because you sort of thrust her in the spotlight too. And the fact is both of you left your jobs, you got a $500,000 settlement for two tenured positions, which to some people that out if I hundred thousand dollars, I was like, oh, that sounds like a lot of money. But, but this is your life's work. You and your wife, you've since relocated your family and your two kids. Um, so this is, this is massive. 500 grand in the scheme of that is not a lot. But was she ever sure,

Speaker 3:          38:12          uh, bothered or, or hesitant by what you were doing? Cause she didn't go public about this until a bit after. Um, she was never pissed. Not for a minute. She and I were in complete agreement. We saw the same thing unfolded evergreen. The, uh, the nature of our teaching at Evergreen was kind of interesting in the sense we had like a little undeclared graduate program and evolutionary biology where we couldn't award you a master's degree, but if you were interested in evolutionary biology and many people didn't know they were, but they would take my program and uh, then I would sort of nudge them over towards Heather's program. So we had students bouncing back and forth and we had a community of people that were, um, in our circle. So the basic point is that creates a, a, an opportunity for every night at dinner. Heather and I would compare notes, what we were seeing at the college and all of these things talk about, you know, students, you know, what the student's blind spot is, what they do particularly well.

Speaker 3:          39:18          And as this unfolded, Heather and I saw the identical picture, or maybe the way to say it is the picture of what was happening emerged between us as we discussed it. And she was, let's put it this way, what put me in the bullseye was the emails that I wrote. And the thing is I said in faculty meetings, I never wrote an email that Heather didn't look at first and tell me it's ready. Um, and frankly there were a lot of emails that I didn't send and if I made one error, I believe I should have sent every one of them, right. Because what they do is they leave a, a historical record of what is taking place. So the descent was in retrospect, very clear as you went back through the emails. Um, but anyway, yeah, Heather, Heather was in complete agreement the whole time. And I think, uh, the confrontation was less in keeping with her personality traits than mine, but in terms of her commitment and her belief in what we were doing, it was a team effort.

Speaker 2:          40:26          There's a lesson in marriage right there at, there's probably many lessons in marriage. Okay. Yeah. All right, so let's just get to where you are now. You guys have left Washington. Neither one of you are teaching at the moment. You're trying to figure out what your future is. I assume the same with Heather. What does that like, number one and number two, I think a lot of people would be surprised to know that schools have not thrown offers at you. I mean you, you have a seriously great public profile. Now you are respected by so many people. You have, you have fans and not just students. Now you have former students, but you have fans that would love to sign up for courses that you would be teaching and all sorts of things where I think most people would look at this on their face and think, wow, what an asset this would, this guy would be not only intellectually but PR wise and all that.

Speaker 3:          41:14          That's not where we're at. It's absolutely not. And it, uh, it does say something and I'm, I'm an outsider to whatever discussions it is that result in nothing of that sort coming our way, but it is conspicuous. Um, so you asked what it's, what it's like, um, you know, I'm having a, a, a very unusual experience in life and you know, my, my life was great before any of this happened. It's great now. Um, the lack of security is frightening when I stare at it, you know, Heather and I have two kids and if we didn't, we would be in a different position. We could take, uh, risks and we could afford to go through, you know, years of austerity. But as it is, we have responsibilities and you know, our kids didn't sign up for this.

Speaker 2:          42:07          Hmm. Um, so I mean they would've let you saying they didn't get that gene. What are you telling me? Oh no, they're bored. But yes. Yeah, it's our responsibility to protect them. And so, you know, the, the whole thing has been, uh,

Speaker 3:          42:21          frightening from the point of view of what it means for the future because literally, I don't know, it seems like things are headed along a path in which, you know, the settlement that you mentioned is a tiny fraction of what we would have earned over the rest of our careers. And of course, green, a huge amount of it was burned up paying lawyers and, uh, taxes, you know, you get all that money in one chunk. So we got about two years of buffer money, uh, from that, but it wasn't, it wasn't like we got bought out. We, uh, we could have in a state that had punitive damages, we likely could have one, uh, something much more like 4 million bucks for the amount of income that we would have earned over the rest of our careers.

Speaker 2:          43:10          And, and why did you guys not go that route? Because I think a lot of people, when they saw the number, I remember when I saw the number, I think I just saw an article or something and I was like,

Speaker 3:          43:18          Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Why so low? Because Washington was one of 11 states without punitive damages. It's that sense.

Speaker 2:          43:24          Oh, I thought you said that Washington did have punitive damages. Oh, I just misheard you. Okay. So that, that uh, that caused us

Speaker 3:          43:32          to, uh, effectively cut our losses and decide that there was nothing to be done. We did the best we could with evergreen and cutting our ties with them at the point that they made it clear. I mean, they, they behaved atrociously in negotiations for one thing. They dragged their heels. They wouldn't sit down with us until we were already back on contract for the next year, fully. Assuming that we would be going back into a classroom, but what would it be like to walk onto a campus that is, you know, paying a PR firm to demonize you. Right. What would that be like? And we would have done it, but they, uh, they insulted us in negotiations. They offered us panic buttons. Right. As if, so panic buttons in the room. Literally. Yeah. Like,

Speaker 2:          44:18          as if the problem was that we were panicking, um, rather than that they had, you know, they could have at least they offered you a counter baseball bat. Right. Wouldn't that have been nice? Right. Something. Um, but they didn't, and, you know,

Speaker 3:          44:32          hobbling the police, the, the whole thing was a fiasco. So we cut our losses. We've, we've moved, we moved to Portland, uh, which is wonderful. Um, I know that's in some ways, not interpretation, but it is a marvelous place. The more progressive place. Uh, it does seem that we have, whether you're a glutton for punishment on to the belly of the beast. Um, but I, you know, the beauty of Portland, you know, there's a beauty in, there's a tragedy. There is this, uh, equity and inclusion thing and it seems to go up to the mayor's office who happens to also frighteningly in a parallel to evergreen be the police commissioner so he can, uh, stand down the police and, and has done so in some circumstances, all that video from a couple of weeks ago with Antifa basically running traffic in the middle of Portland. I mean it's, it's unfathomable that that's happening in the streets of the United States city.

Speaker 3:          45:25          Right, right. It is. They are flirting with the same, I mean, it is the same story as evergreen, except, um, this is a major American city. You know, to have a college, uh, play games with literal anarchy is dangerous enough to have a city doing it. Uh, I shutter to think you didn't want to think about Texas. I really on this tour, I got to tell you a San Antonio, I think you'd have a field day over there. Well, but here's the thing. The other part of liberalism is also true in Portland. So I never encounter, uh, the Antifa madness and the mayor and his, uh, confusion. You know, it's like the mayor of your town. You never, you never run into it. What I do run into, he's a clean, uh, functional city. People as far as I can tell, are very decent to each other. Um, you know, uh, they make provisions for cyclists to commute around the place. So I think in some sense, Portland is, it shows exactly the conflict between the left better instincts in its worst instincts. And, uh, I hope that it will come around to the kind of enlightened progressivism that used to exist rather than the naive progressivism that seems to have taken over

Speaker 1:          46:48          [inaudible].
