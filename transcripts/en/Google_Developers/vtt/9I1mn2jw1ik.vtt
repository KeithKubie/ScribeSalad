00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.220
CAMILLE LAMY: Thank you.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.120
Hi, everyone.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.300
As Elizabeth said, my
name is Camille Lamy.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.620
I'm very happy to be here
tonight and quite humbled,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.370
to say, to be in front
of all of you like that.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.670
And really, this
is my first time

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.820
doing this kind of talk
about my life story.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.100
It even has a fancy
title, so that's nice.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.280
And I have no idea of
how it's going to go,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.390
but, hey, let's get started.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.970
So to tell you a bit
more about myself,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.590
I'm a software engineer
here at Google Paris.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.280
I'm what we call a tech
lead for a project that's

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.710
rewriting how web navigations
are handled in Chrome.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.230
So a tech lead at Google manages
the technical orientation

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.810
of a project, but not the
people associated to it.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.470
So my project is not very big.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.300
That means I also do a lot of
coding in my day-to-day job

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.010
to get the project moving along.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.700
To be frank, I did not want
to be a software engineer when

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.410
I was six years old.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.250
I did not teach my self how
to code when I was 7 or 8,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310
for that matter.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.920
In fact, the very,
very first line

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.740
of code I ever wrote
in my life was when

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.520
I entered [SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.060
So I was 18.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.830
And you know what?

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.180
You can become a software
engineer at Google

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.410
even if you did not learn how
to code in primary school.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.680
And that's completely fine.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.090
So that's, yeah.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.260
In hindsight, though, I find
that the career of software

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.170
engineer really, really
was a good fit for me.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.630
When I was growing
up, I liked all kinds

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.560
of creative activities.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.930
So I played a lot with LEGOs.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.100
I drew a lot, badly,
but I liked that.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.070
I practiced ceramics as
an after-school activity

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.050
for 11 years.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.670
And on top of liking
to create things,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.800
I really liked computers.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.100
So we got our first computer
at home when I was seven.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.130
And I played a lot
of video games on it.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.590
It was my secret hobby.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.810
Yeah, I say a secret
hobby because, you see,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.120
it didn't actually
seem girly enough

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.100
of an occupation for my primary
school and middle school

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.710
classmates.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.360
So I would totally
not acknowledge

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.720
that I was doing it.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.130
But I was really doing it
a lot, or way too much,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.820
according to my parents.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.030
Well, that's their opinion.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.760
But despite all of that on the
computer playing video games,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.120
I never thought, hey, maybe
I should learn how to code.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.830
And despite both my
parents working in IT

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.730
and being trained
programmers themselves,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.650
they never thought, hey, maybe
we could teach her how to code.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.260
No, that did not happen.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.784
In fact, I did my
[SPEAKING FRENCH],

00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:05.270
so the middle school
internship, in a company

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.870
that was writing ERPs.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.710
So that's software
that run businesses,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.990
if you don't know about it.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.690
But it wasn't really my choice.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.690
It's just that I
could not be bothered

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.180
to look for an internship,
so I took the easy way

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.490
out of going to my
mother's company.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.460
And the result of that
internship at the time

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.960
was I never, ever, ever,
ever want to be a secretary

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.780
and I don't want to work in IT.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.390
I only got 50% right.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.950
I mean, really, apart from that
brief foray in the world of IT

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.870
when I was 13, the idea of
working in computer science

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.400
really never entered my mind.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.270
It's not like I would
say, no, I don't

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.230
want to be a computer
software engineer,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.530
it's just I would not
even think about it.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.925
So I wanted to be many things
in my life when I grew up.

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:01.600
I wanted to be an
astronaut at one point.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.470
Terrible idea.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.440
I'm actually afraid of
taking planes, so nope.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.770
Then I wanted to be an
archaeologist in Egypt.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.510
I'm a red head.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.380
I can stand about 15 minutes
in the sun without burning.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.880
So, nope.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.510
I wanted to be a history
professor, a nuclear physicist.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.990
And when, finally, I reached
second year of engineering

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.250
school, I thought, hey, computer
science, well, I kind of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.120
like it.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.600
I've got good grades.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.266
Maybe I could try that
as a career, you know?

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:31.640
And at same time,
I thought yeah,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.410
it's been the case
for three years.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.490
You could have asked
yourself the question before.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.980
But, well.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.020
So with that new found
knowledge of my vocation,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.480
I decided to specialize
in computer science

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.540
at engineering school.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.110
And then later, I went
to Stanford in the US

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.820
to do a master in
computer science.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.320
And after that, I
was hired at Google,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.650
which was completely not
the outcome I had in mind

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.580
when I left for
the US, by the way.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.050
Because, up until my first
year of master, what I really,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.067
really wanted to be
was a researcher.

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:07.150
So I had wanted to be a
researcher for a long time

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.240
in various fields.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.930
But the research part,
at least, was constant.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.420
And I went to Stanford
with a now ex-boyfriend.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.590
And he had to do his
master in four quarters

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.800
and then come back to France.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.400
So I decided I
would do the same,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.691
you know, being the girlfriend.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.280
And, well, so I have found
myself over there thinking,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.980
oh, I need to find myself a PhD
for when I come back to France.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.640
And well it was not really easy.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.780
First, I had to start in
January when normally you

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.806
start in September.

00:05:44.806 --> 00:05:48.370
And also my
ex-boyfriend had decided

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.260
he would do his in Toulouse.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.040
And honestly, I could
not find a PhD subject

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.690
in my specialty in Toulouse
that would appeal to me.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.160
And the more I thought
about it, the more I

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.680
felt like my heart
wasn't set on doing it,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.780
so I let the deadlines slip by.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.200
And eventually I found
myself in September

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.860
knowing that I would be going
back in France in three months.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.550
And I had no idea what I
would be doing with my life.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.910
I realized that I did not want
to stay doing nothing, waiting

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.370
for maybe getting another PhD
starting in the next September

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.530
and doing nothing
for eight months.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.800
I also realized that I
needed money, honestly.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.040
So I thought, well,
I'm going to get a job.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.210
That's well.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.530
But then there was one thing.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.975
I had no professional
experience at all.

00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:46.070
My plan up until then was to
be a researcher in academia.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.610
So I had not thought about
the professional experience.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.570
I was in the US looking
for a job in France.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.050
And I had no idea on
how you look for a job,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.480
like no idea at all.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.490
But I had this friend who had
done an internship at Google

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.500
over the summer.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.040
And so he came back and
he was telling me, oh,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.920
Camille, Google, it's so great.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.970
Like they've got
all this free food.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.310
And it's good free food.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.100
And you know you
can wear whatever

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.050
you want when you go to work,
like shorts and t-shirts

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.597
and flip-flops.

00:07:18.597 --> 00:07:20.180
Well. also, they've
got cool projects,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.980
but really, really you
should totally apply.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.935
So, I said, OK, well,
sounds nice, why not.

00:07:26.935 --> 00:07:27.560
I looked it up.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.750
I saw that they had an
office here in Paris,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.510
which I didn't know, and
I said, OK, I'll try it.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.640
So I sent my resume.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.140
I got through the
interview process.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.340
And I was hired.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.030
So it turns out to be a
really, really good decision

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.770
because now I realize
that I actually

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.160
like software development
a lot more than research.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.550
So I'm very happy about that.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.230
I work with great people.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.226
I really enjoy my job.

00:07:52.226 --> 00:07:54.440
In fact, I often
tell that it's less

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.910
of a job, more of an occupation
that I'm being paid to do.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:05.200
And on top of that, I met
my partner at a party hosted

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200
by one of my colleagues.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.267
So that's yeah to Google.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:16.390
But even though I'm very
happy to be where I am,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.670
looking back I have to
realize that the way there

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.680
was paved with good decisions
that I made for bad reasons--

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.380
yeah, free food is good, but
it's only free food-- and just

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.115
luck sometimes.

00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:36.539
And just thinking
about that, I found

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:41.120
that it's really helped me
lighten the burden of making

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.970
hard decisions.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.010
Because, you know,
so sometimes we

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.620
make good decision
but for bad reasons,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.060
or we made very,
very bad decisions

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.140
for perfectly good
reason at the time.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.750
And very often, despite
all that we were thinking,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.390
we completely miss very
important decision factors

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.260
in our choices.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.630
So when I realized that
even if I put a lot of work,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.550
there was a definite
chance that I would not

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.300
get the right decision and
that it was normal, by the way,

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.540
I stopped agonizing over
each decision that I had to.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.300
make because
instead of focusing,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.250
OK, I need to find the right,
perfect decision for this,

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.700
I would say, OK,
maybe I won't find it.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.770
So, if I mess things
up, what happens?

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.760
What does it need
for me to fix that?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.830
The answer I found
most of the time is,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.280
well, there are a few
hassles, but seriously it's

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.840
not so much of a big deal.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.480
So when I kept that
in mind, for me

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.460
it was just much easier to
say, like this thing that

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.550
was occupying all my mind and
I would spend so much time

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.770
thinking about it,
and I could just

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.200
let it take less
of my mind and be

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.860
more at rest, which I
found to be a skill that

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.530
was useful during my career.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.310
So, for example, at one point,
I was asked to lead a project.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.660
So that's the project
I'm currently leading.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.250
And I hesitated.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.210
So I took a step
back and thought, OK,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.350
if you mess up, what's
the worst that can happen?

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.220
Well you will just
suck at your job.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.280
So two things,
either you improve,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.190
well, or if you don't
improve, then you probably

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.080
should hand the
leadership to someone else

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.530
and then you go back to
handling everything on your own,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.000
which you were fine and doing.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.400
And, well, everybody's fine.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.230
It's no big deal.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.930
So I could say,
OK, I will try it.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.120
So again you maybe wonder
why I would hesitate

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.020
in front of a good
career opportunity,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.710
because I mean normally when
people give you a career

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.960
opportunity, and you don't have
to move to another country,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.720
not have to move at all, don't
even have to change a team,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.870
I mean normally,
you should say yes.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.190
But, see, there's this thing
called the imposter syndrome.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.790
So if you don't know about
the imposter syndrome,

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.070
I suggest you Google it.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.390
Basically, it's a
problem that a lot

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.920
of people in very intellectual
jobs face, especially women.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.210
So basically the
idea is that you

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.480
attribute your successes
to external factors,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.290
or you were lucky.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.190
And you attribute your failures
to yourself, oh, you suck.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.990
So you end up thinking that
you are a fraud, an imposter.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:36.290
And so that if you fail,
people are going to unmask you.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.390
And they will see how
bad you really are.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.270
And in a professional context,
maybe they'll fire you.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.620
And I must say that
getting hired at Google

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.090
was very bad for the
imposter syndrome.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.360
So as I said before, I had
no professional experience.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.435
What I had done in my
studies was one internship,

00:11:55.435 --> 00:11:59.070
a military internship in
the public relationship

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.080
service of the French Navy,
the [SPEAKING FRENCH],

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.580
the factory worker internship
in a puppet theater in Russia,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.830
and a research internship
in the public research lab

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.730
in France at Inria.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.500
So coming into Google,
I had no idea at all

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.790
what I should be expecting.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.300
And then I joined
the team and-- so

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.760
they were all men-- they
were more senior than me

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.920
and they were more experienced.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.750
I started writing code and all
I got was comments such as,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.890
oh, you can't do that.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.165
Oh no, this is the wrong
thing to use there.

00:12:35.165 --> 00:12:40.010
Ah, you're violating the
[INAUDIBLE] this is bad.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.490
By the way, every new
engineer at Google gets that.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.527
That's just plain normal, but
you know, it's your first time,

00:12:45.527 --> 00:12:47.940
it feels a bit weird.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.000
And on top of that,
my team at the time

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.190
was made with made up of
absolutely die-hard Linux

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.240
fanatics.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.470
So they would have these
lunch conversations

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.830
about what is the best
Linux library to use

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.260
for these super
arcane kind of things

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.350
to do like compressing these
song in this weird format

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.540
or whatever.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.600
And honestly, I knew nothing
about Linux libraries--

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.250
I still don't by the way, so.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:20.060
So really, I arrived there and
I felt like I knew nothing.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.010
And sometimes I wondered,
hey, why did they

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.944
hire me because I knew nothing?

00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:29.155
Happy for me, I was
quite competitive

00:13:29.155 --> 00:13:30.570
and I like challenges.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.440
So I said, OK,
well you know what?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.110
I'm going to try.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.820
I'm going to try to learn
what I need to do my job.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.529
And hopefully, I learn it fast
enough that they still keep me,

00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:42.320
because it looks like
a nice place to work.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.530
So I would like to stay here.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.140
And with leading the
project, it was the same.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.400
I say, OK, it's a challenge.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.440
I'm not sure about it.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.780
But you know, I will try it
and we'll see what happens.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.960
In truth, I'm not really sure,
it was really a challenge.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.940
But I'm very sure that
my mind was making it so.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.510
And it's been my experience
that our mind creates

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.730
those perceived
challenges, those barriers,

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.710
and very often that
keeps us from accepting

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.510
really good opportunities.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.480
So maybe we are
afraid because we

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.120
are afraid of
novelty, of change,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.530
of failure, of going
against our own biases.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.080
And acknowledging
that you create

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.430
those barriers for
yourself, that's

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.300
one good step in
overcoming them so

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.020
that you can do all
the cool things that

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.450
are presented to you.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.200
For myself, I found that
it's just not enough.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.740
Because even if I
recognize, rationally,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.320
that my mind is
simply freaking out,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.340
it's not enough to
make the fear go away.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.860
I mean it's still there.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.100
So for example, when I was asked
about making this presentation,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.740
what I am thinking is
like, oh, but the people

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.290
with 10 years of
experience in this room,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.190
they will think that what
I'm saying is useless to them

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.910
because I'm so young.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.640
And then I recognize that if
I had 10 years of experience,

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.340
I would be worrying
about the people

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.910
with 20 years of
experience thinking

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.500
that I'm saying useless stuff.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.830
So at one point, I have to
say, OK, I'm afraid, fine.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.580
But you know what?

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.835
I'm still going to try it.

00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:28.090
And I found that it become
just easier and easier

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.340
when you try it.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.500
And I think that's how you
build self-confidence if you

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.100
don't have it from the start.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.510
At first you fake it, and you
say, yeah, sure, I will do it.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.020
It's OK.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.230
I'm scared, but it's fine.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.060
I will do it.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.970
And then maybe you succeed.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.650
And so you'll feel more
confident about yourself.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.430
I mean you succeeded in doing
the big, scary thing that you

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.630
set out to do.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.630
So that's pretty cool.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.910
Or maybe you fail.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.420
That's a possibility.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.400
And very often, I think you find
that the failure is not as bad

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.970
as you imagined it to be.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.310
And then, afterwards,
you struggle less

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.500
to accept the scary
opportunity because you're

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.780
less afraid of failure.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.840
So really, really, when you see
that scary, big opportunity,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.482
take it.

00:16:16.482 --> 00:16:17.940
First it's going
to be interesting.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.860
It's probably going
to be good for you.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.960
And it will make taking
those in the future easier.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.130
And another thing to
remember-- to make it easier

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.680
to stretch yourself,
in my opinion--

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.716
is that we, as people,
are not static beings.

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:33.652
We change.

00:16:33.652 --> 00:16:36.500
We learn new things.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.470
We grow.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.800
And I think if all of you
look back 10 years ago,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.610
would you have imagined
becoming who you are right now?

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.260
I imagine a lot of you did not.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.430
And I know for myself
that I did not.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.560
So I have two sisters, they
are much, much younger than me.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.020
And I have a father who has
this dreadful, dreadful habit

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.610
of comparing our school results.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.420
Side note, if you're a
parent, don't do that.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.390
Just don't do it.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.140
It sucks.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.790
OK?

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.040
And so one day, one of
my sister comes to me

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.959
and say, ah, Camille, you're too
hard to have as a big sister.

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:19.950
If we listen to dad, you're
this like half goddess.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.670
And you've got limitless
understanding of everything.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.829
And I'm like, well,
first he's exaggerating.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.239
I can assure you I'm 100% human.

00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:31.280
And there are many things
that I don't understand

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.810
and that I suck at.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.260
And second, even you're saying
no, it's too hard, et cetera,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.290
you are comparing
yourself to me right now.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.140
You are not comparing
yourself to me at your age.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.730
And really, me 10
years ago would not

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.980
like to be compared
to me right now,

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.340
even though I'm the
same person, sort of.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.210
So it's been the
same, at least for me,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.740
in my professional career.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.940
So when I joined
Google, I did not

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.730
have the skills to
do the job I do now.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.790
But I learned them
over the time,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.770
like step by step, by taking
bigger and bigger challenges,

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.415
and finding what I
needed to overcome them.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.800
So really, again, we
change, we grow, we evolve,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.990
and I think that's
really awesome.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.530
So for me, this has been
one of the thing that

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.960
kept me going and saying,
oh, I will try that.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.820
I will try that new
challenge, because I wanted

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.070
to see if I could succeed.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.200
I wanted to see if I could
become the kind of person that

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.700
does that thing.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.690
And so I'm really looking
forward to what I can do.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.050
And I'm pretty sure
that a lot of you

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.620
will grow and will
do amazing thing,

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.650
and that there are many,
many, many good things that

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.320
are coming for you.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.170
And so, with that, I'm very
happy to be here tonight.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.670
And I wish you all a
very, very good evening.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.570
