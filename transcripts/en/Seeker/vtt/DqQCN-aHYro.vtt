This episode of DNews is proudly brought to
you by Subaru.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.990
BY TESLA WE'VE GOT IT!

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.610
Wireless electricity might be coming to a
home near you...

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.100
y'know.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.590
Someday.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.699
Greetings programs, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.470
In 1897, Nikola Tesla — asexual genius and
inventor extraordinaire — wanted to QUOTE

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.189
"turn the whole world into a giant wireless
dynamo."

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.251
He was awarded a patent in 1907 for wireless
electricity but then the Great War began and

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:37.890
the whole thing was lost to history.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.820
Now, over a century later, researchers at
MIT created wireless power transmission which

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.000
could realize his dream!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Sort of.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.790
While Tesla was trying to power cities, this
transmits wireless power around your house!

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.900
Your phone, car, television, laptop, game
console, controllers, remotes, toaster and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.329
every lightbulb in every frickin' lamp could
all be powered by magnetic resonators.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.110
The Faraday Law of Induction describes how
an electromagnet creates a magnetic field.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.249
When an electrified coil of wire is wrapped
around a metal rod, the metal magnetizes.

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:17.719
Similarly, when you pass a magnet THROUGH
an unpowered coil of wire, the magnet creates

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.609
electricity.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.280
Physics is awesome.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.880
Researchers at MIT found a way to turn simple
physics into a wireless way to transmit electricity

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.600
using a similar technology to WiFi.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.799
By plugging in a resonator to the alternating
current outlet in your wall, the device creates

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.100
a magnetic oscillation.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.319
The magnetic field of the resonator is large
enough to mingle with nearby coils installed

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.280
in the walls and floors of your house — and
ultimately into every device and BOOM wireless

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.650
power.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.159
One magnetic coil influences another and another
all over the house.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.869
It's like the barking chain in 101 Dalmatians!

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.049
MIT spun off the technology into a funny named
company called WiTricity.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.170
The system can already power televisions,
cell phones and keep their special AA batteries

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.259
fully charged all at the same time!

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.770
To be honest, induction charging has been
around for a while, as has wireless power

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.920
transmission.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.720
Radio waves are wireless power, the pads you
can buy to charge your cell phone, mouse or

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.860
game controllers use wireless power, but this
is a bit different.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.300
The ones we have now use near-field induction
and this blows it into a whole new proportion.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.360
The problem with any of these systems, is
the efficiency.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.890
Magnetic fields have to be relatively close-by
to pick up other magnetic fields.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.110
The MIT researchers were able to power one
60 watt light bulb from 2 meters away — but

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.280
it was only 45% efficient.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.680
So they put in 133 watts to power a 60 watt
bulb.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.320
Not awesome; though according to the researchers,
this system is 1 million times more efficient

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.520
than the ones already on the market... and
the CEO of WiTricity says it's 1,000 times

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.280
more efficient than a battery!

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.910
This works with both OLD and NEW technology.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.180
Just because it's old doesn't mean it's not
awesome.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.590
Just ask Tekzilla's Patrick Norton - Pat customized
3 high-mileage Subaru cars for 3 charity-minded

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.770
