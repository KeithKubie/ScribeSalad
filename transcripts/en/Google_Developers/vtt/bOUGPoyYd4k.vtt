00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:08.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to Coffee with a Googler.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.710
Today I'm meeting
with Alex Danilo

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.692
to talk about web standards
and why they're so important.

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:15.150
ALEX DANILO: So
[? LoMo, ?] so tell

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060
me, with all these
interviews and stuff,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.970
have you actually
learned anything useful?

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: Have I
learned anything useful?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.640
Wow.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.620
Certainly I've learned how
hard it can be in a studio.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.580
No, but seriously.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.570
It's been really fun
to chat with a lot

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.240
of different and various
Googlers from around the world,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.640
and from different
things that they do.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Like, I had Josh Gordon on
for one episode where we

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.030
spoke about machine learning.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.405
And machine learning
is something

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:42.730
that I've been trying
to study, and having

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.840
a lot of trouble with.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.520
ALEX DANILO: It's complicated.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
really complicated.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.869
And my math days are
like 20 years behind me.

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.660
And one of the things
that Josh spoke about

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.070
is, like, how he's teaching
machine learning, and trying

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.600
not to be so mathy about it.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.390
And that really helped.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.640
And we had Ankur Kotwal
on a recent episode.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.819
And he was talking a lot about
Google Maps and Santa Tracker,

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:04.360
and a lot of behind the scenes
of Santa Tracker and the stuff

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.360
that he built. And I
learned how important it is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.770
to have a good project manager.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.436
You'll have to watch the episode
to see what we mean about that.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.209
ALEX DANILO: Cool,
I'll watch it.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I was
actually thinking about you

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.420
the other day when
I read this quote.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.644
And it was-- I'm paraphrasing,
I may have it wrong.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.310
But it was something
along the lines of,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.259
like, the great
thing about standards

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.300
is that there are so many
of them to choose from.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.030
And I know you're
working on standards.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.897
Was that an Andrew
Tanenbaum quote?

00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:28.730
ALEX DANILO: It was.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.521
That was his quote.

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:30.490
Yeah, definitely.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
you're working on standards,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.490
and you're working
on web standards

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.860
in particular for Google.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.740
And it's like, well, what's
the status of the web today?

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.930
How are things
going with the web,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.780
and how are things
going with standards?

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.785
ALEX DANILO: Well,
that's a great question.

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:43.410
There's a lot of
activity in standards.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.880
I mean, there are
multiple groups.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.942
There are multiple working
groups, as you know.

00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:49.400
Personally, I'm working on the
HTML standard at the moment.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.691
So I'm helping edit the spec
with a bunch of colleagues

00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.010
from other companies.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.760
And the way I kind of
view it is standards

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.200
are really important, because
without standards, things

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.290
don't work right.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.120
If I write a web page and I
just bash the markup together,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.610
it might work in
my browser, but it

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.040
won't work in other browsers.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.540
And the way it works
across browsers

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.706
is through standards, right?

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:09.990
So that the browsers
implement the same thing.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.279
And if I implement my page
adhering to the standards,

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.570
it will work everywhere, right?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it's
important to get things working

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.740
the same way everywhere, right?

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.800
I remember the old story about--
wasn't it like a Mars mission?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.400
Where the Europeans
measured it in metric,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.250
and we measured it in imperial.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.540
And instead of
landing, it went splat.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.090
ALEX DANILO: Slammed
in the planet.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.452
All over.

00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:31.260
Same thing happened
quite a long time

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.680
ago with the Fortran
program as well.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.474
Where it was like people
decided to use Fortran for one

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:37.640
of the space probes in NASA.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.848
And somebody put a comma
where there should have been

00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:40.980
a full stop, or vice versa.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.770
The probe went
flying off into space

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.860
because it had a variable
that wasn't being used.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.500
It was just [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.820
Now the space program
doesn't use Fortran anymore.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: Is that why?

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.690
ALEX DANILO: Well,
probably that.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what
have they switched to?

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.015
ALEX DANILO: Most likely Ada.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:54.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.970
ALEX DANILO: That is a
military standard, in fact.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.428
So standards are important from
a lot of different aspects.

00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:02.390
Just for developers, you
kind of think, yeah, great.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.515
Why have them?

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.730
Andrew Tanenbaum's right.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.230
There's a zillion
of them out there.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.850
But a perfect example is in
the old days of the railroad,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.230
back in the 1800s
or whatever it was,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.750
there were competing companies
building their own railroad

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.536
tracks, but they were
different widths.

00:03:15.536 --> 00:03:17.160
So you get to the
state border, and you

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.580
wouldn't be able to
continue with the train

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.640
because they didn't
have a standard gauge.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520
Hence, they brought
in a standard gauge.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.811
ALEX DANILO: So it's
the same with the web.

00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:26.070
We define a set of standards.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.989
Every browser vendor
builds those standards

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:28.780
into their browser.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.960
So when I build
for the standard,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.730
I can expect it to
work everywhere.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.980
And if it doesn't, it's a bug.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.521
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Right, so you don't

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.110
want to be that
train that fits one

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.050
railroad, but not the other.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.540
ALEX DANILO: Exactly.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.873
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what
exactly does your role entail?

00:03:40.873 --> 00:03:41.910
What are you doing?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.640
ALEX DANILO: What we're
doing-- well, what I'm doing

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.460
is basically working with
a bunch of the other folks

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.530
in the HTML group.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.637
And we collate all the changes
that people submit to us.

00:03:49.637 --> 00:03:51.220
Like the working
group works together,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.529
but it's an open
development process.

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:55.320
Like for example, if
you're a web developer

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.620
and you come up with
some brilliant idea

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.899
that you want in the spec,
you can talk about it.

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.440
You can bring it to what we call
the web incubation community

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.390
group.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.800
You can work on the
kind of idea there.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.610
Develop it.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.340
And then if becomes
kind of stable,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.930
we'll pull it into
the standards.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.730
So as editors, it's our
job to write the words,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.344
put it into the spec,
make sure it's testable,

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:16.760
and it will go
through the process

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.529
and eventually become
a real browser feature.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: HTML5 was
the most recent big spec

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.800
that everybody's
been hearing about.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.850
What's next?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.690
ALEX DANILO: Well the
next is 5.1, which

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.132
I'm working on at the moment.

00:04:28.132 --> 00:04:30.430
And 5.1 is kind of interesting.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.680
It's a refinement
of 5.0 in many ways.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.140
There are a number
of new things,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.227
and there are a number
of things being dropped.

00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:39.310
One good example of a
feature that's being dropped

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.434
is called request autocomplete.

00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:43.600
So that was a feature for
payments on the web, which

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.536
was great on mobile devices.

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:46.910
And it shipped in
Chrome, so it's

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.040
shipped to stable browsers.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.440
However, the uptake by the
community and developers

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.310
has been really low.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.857
So we're like, well, other
browsers aren't doing it.

00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:56.440
This is not a feature we would
want developers to try and use,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.400
because it's just not
prevalent everywhere.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.610
So we're pulling it.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.650
So 5.1 will actually make
us a bit closer to reality.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.391
That's kind of a
big aim for 5.1.

00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.390
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.976
Now given that we're moving
more and more mobile,

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.100
and we're moving more and
more towards apps instead

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.010
of desktops with browsers,
and our internet information

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.210
access is coming through
apps, what impact

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.460
is that having on standards?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.254
Are standards becoming
less important?

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:20.670
ALEX DANILO: I
think standards are

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.480
important for different reasons.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.160
Like the app thing is
important in its own right.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.270
But we've kind of
seen a huge wave

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.820
of adoption of the app stores,
and the all this sort of thing

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.570
in Google Play, etc.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.710
However, the way I look at
as a more web-focused person

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.430
is that apps are great.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.129
Like, I've written apps myself.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.670
But there are something like 2
million-odd apps in the store.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.470
So if I want to find
something, the discovery

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.928
is really, really
difficult, right?

00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:47.090
The story of discoverability
in apps is terrible.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.270
And I can only install a
few on my phone, right?

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.240
You're really lucky
to install 100.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.720
And so, from the point
of view of usability,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.030
I'd only install apps that
I really, really need,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.920
that I will use every day.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.690
If you switch back to kind of
the web focus, with the web,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.800
you can basically go to
this site and that site.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.840
In fact, you can go
to millions of sites

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.590
without installing
anything on your phone.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.500
You just go through the browser.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.100
So the beauty of that is
that I can go-- well today,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.040
I'm going to go to this
shopping store, use their site,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.120
buy their stuff.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.410
And tomorrow, I can go
to this other store,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.910
and I don't have to clutter my
screen with the little icons.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.201
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right, I see.

00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.990
And you can even do things also.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.190
You can put a link to
those stories on your home

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.757
screen anyway via that website.

00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:27.840
ALEX DANILO: That's right.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.834
In fact, we have
installed a home screen.

00:06:29.834 --> 00:06:32.000
Chrome has a feature-- in
fact, many mobile browsers

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.280
have the same feature-- where
if you visit a site a few times,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.320
the browser goes, hey,
you like this thing.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.305
Would you like me to stick
an icon on your home screen?

00:06:39.305 --> 00:06:41.388
And if you say yes, it'll
put a little icon there.

00:06:41.388 --> 00:06:43.190
And then from the
user's point of view,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.260
the next time they click on
it, it just looks like an app

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.760
to them.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.530
So they can't actually
tell the difference

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.621
between an installed
app and just a website.

00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:51.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: So browsers
are effectively becoming

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.080
more app-like in some ways.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.004
Or sites on browsers.

00:06:54.004 --> 00:06:54.920
ALEX DANILO: They are.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.480
In fact, modern
browsers-- like when

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.130
you're talking about standards--
I'll just rewind a little bit.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.910
If you run back,
say, 10 years, there

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.299
used to be a
standard called WAP.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:05.840
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, I remember WAP.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.590
ALEX DANILO: You remember WAP.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.830
See?

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.996
A lot of people remember it.

00:07:07.996 --> 00:07:09.590
I won't talk about
some of the quotes

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.470
about WAP, not here anyway.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.430
But WAP was a standard,
and it shipped

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.940
on a ton of mobile devices.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.540
Like hundreds of thousands.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.290
And even millions, sorry.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.200
So that standard lasted
for quite a while.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.600
But it was really primitive.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.040
It was geared to the
mobile devices of the time.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.170
Fast forward 10 years.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.760
We're in the smartphone era,
where the thing in your pocket

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.050
is like a supercomputer
from a long time ago.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.550
And the browser
is full-featured.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.950
It's as powerful as
a desktop browser.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.310
And so the shift to
mobile is not just

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.150
a shift into new styles of
browsers with new capabilities,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.770
but the power there
gives you all this stuff

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.050
that we didn't have
before, that you usually

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.380
associate with native apps.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.080
Like, for example,
accelerometers.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.630
You have the device
orientation API.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.120
So it can flip my phone
around, and actually

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.110
play a game with a ball
rolling in my browser.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.620
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah, nice.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.120
ALEX DANILO: Another
feature that we

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.330
brought into the standards
is the battery API.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.370
So from a web page,
I can actually

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.100
detect the status of my battery.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.540
So I can choose to
throttle back if I

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.640
know I'm not on the charger,
and stuff like that.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.010
So the capabilities
coming to the browsers

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.070
are getting closer what's
available to native app

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.100
developers.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.700
But this is all coming
through standards development,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.229
and not through some kind
of proprietary edition.

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:25.770
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I assume, then,

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.900
if I'm building according
to those standards,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.760
it's going to run on the browser
on multiple platforms also.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.180
ALEX DANILO: That's right.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:31.650
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So I don't need

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.780
to build one app for
Android, one app for iPhone,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.159
and one app, maybe,
for other platforms.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:35.460
ALEX DANILO: Exactly.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.470
That's the beauty of the web.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.799
You build it one place, and
it runs on all the devices.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.434
No compilation necessary.

00:08:40.434 --> 00:08:41.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: Very cool.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.206
Now one of the
things that-- it's

00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:45.580
been a few years since I was
a web developer, I'll admit.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.360
But one of the things that,
when I was building the web,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.510
it was like I had to
have standards not just

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.510
the back of my mind, but
I had to have standards

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.870
at the front of my mind.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.390
But sometimes, it
felt like somebody

00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:00.080
was imposing a way of doing
things onto me without being

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.900
part of my natural workflow.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.596
Now do we have tools or things
that will help developers

00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:06.970
through that, and
help developers

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.720
so that they can make the
most of building to standards?

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.856
ALEX DANILO: There are
quite a number of tools.

00:09:11.856 --> 00:09:13.730
One of the things of
developing the standards

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.789
is that we have to build tests.

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.580
These days, when we
bring in a new feature,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.190
we have to prove
that it's testable,

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.740
and we have to write the tests.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.580
And so part of that
is also the W3.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.420
So you have a site called
validator, [? dot ?] W3.org.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.910
And it's an online
validator, where

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.299
you can put your mockup in,
and it will check it for you

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:33.590
and tell you if you're adhering
to the standards, which

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.144
at least saves you
time as a developer.

00:09:36.144 --> 00:09:38.310
They have a bunch of other
tools that check success.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.690
They also check mobile
sites that will actually

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.130
render in different
screen sizes,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.770
and give you the
result so you can see

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.110
what your site will look like.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.260
So there are a lot
of things like that.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.039
There's also a community effort
called Test the Web Forward.

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:51.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh,
Test the Web Forward.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:52.620
ALEX DANILO: Test
the Web Forward.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.470
So this was started
a few years ago.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.770
And what it is is it's kind
of bringing the developer

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.900
community together to multi-day
events where we sit around

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.990
and we write tests
for browser features,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.650
specifically testing things that
don't work across the browsers.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.750
So the whole point
of a test is write it

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.730
like this works in Safari,
this doesn't work in Chrome,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.690
or something like that.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.340
So these tests are
built. And we've

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.810
run them in Paris, I think
in San Francisco, in Tokyo,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.310
in Sydney.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.776
All over the world, right?

00:10:21.776 --> 00:10:23.400
And this is kind of
a grassroots effort

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.100
to make the browsers
more compatible.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.830
And the more compatible
the browsers become,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.750
the easier your life
is as a developer.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: And the easier
life is as a consumer as well.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.060
ALEX DANILO: Absolutely.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you don't
have any of that differences.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.810
So one of the things,
then, is how about Google?

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.629
We do have some developer
websites, right?

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:39.420
ALEX DANILO: We do.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.086
We have web fundamentals,
which contains

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:42.606
a lot of great guidance.

00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:44.230
There's quite a lot
of focus on mobile.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.146
What to do for mobile.

00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:47.850
But just general web
development stuff.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.990
So there's a lot of
resources like that.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.860
And of course, Google
sends engineers

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.140
to all sorts of
standards bodies.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.530
I work with the
Chrome engineers.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.040
Part of my role is not just
working with the HTML committee

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.939
and the group doing
the editing, it's also

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:03.230
talking to Chrome engineers
and getting their feedback,

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.370
and saying, hey,
guys, this is broken.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.630
Or hey, this would be a
cool feature to implement.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.530
And part of that's a
two-way street, right?

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.140
It's not a one-way conversation.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.098
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:11:12.098 --> 00:11:14.010
Well, we're just
about out of time.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:14.740
That was awesome.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.614
I've learned so much.

00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:18.537
And you've convinced me
to look more into the web.

00:11:18.537 --> 00:11:19.620
ALEX DANILO: Web is great.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's great.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:20.860
I know it's great.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.940
But you've convinced me more
looking at web mobile apps

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.856
as well, instead of just
building native apps.

00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:25.675
So thanks, Alex.

00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:27.050
So you have any
questions for me,

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.530
if you have any
questions for Alex, just

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.480
please leave them
in the comments

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.730
below, and be sure to subscribe
to the Google Developers

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.230
channel.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.776
Thank you.
