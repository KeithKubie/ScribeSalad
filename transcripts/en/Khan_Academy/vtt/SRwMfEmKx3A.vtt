00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:02.124
- [Instructor] We're told
Alejandro was curious

00:00:02.124 --> 00:00:05.174
if sample median was an unbiased estimator

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:07.225
of population median.

00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:11.422
He placed ping pong balls
numbered from zero to 32

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:13.828
so I guess that would be
what, 33 ping pong balls

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.485
in a drum and mixed them well.

00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:18.826
Note that the median of the
population is 16, alright?

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:22.401
The median number of course
yes in that population is 16.

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:25.165
He then took a random sample of five balls

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:27.594
and calculated the median of the sample.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.545
So we have this population of balls.

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:32.886
He takes a, we know the
population parameter.

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:36.219
We know that the population median is 16

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:40.341
but then he starts taking
a sample of five balls

00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:44.624
so n equals five and he
calculates a sample median,

00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:45.791
sample median,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.721
and then he replaced the balls
and repeated this process

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.804
for a total of 50 trials.

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:57.456
His results are summarized
in the dot plot below

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.870
where each dot represents
the sample median

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.627
from a sample of five balls.

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:04.557
So he does this, he
takes these five balls,

00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:06.458
puts them back in then he does it again

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:08.348
then he does it again and
every time he calculates

00:01:08.348 --> 00:01:10.439
the sample median for that sample

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.323
and he plots that on the dot plot so,

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:15.285
and he will do this for 50 samples

00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:18.617
and each dot here represents
that sample statistic

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:21.798
so it shows that four times
we got a sample median,

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:26.216
in four of those 50 samples,
we got a sample median of 20.

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:29.662
In five of those sample medians,

00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:32.636
we got a sample median of 10

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:35.398
and so what he ends up
creating with these dots

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:39.594
is really an approximation
of the sampling distribution

00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:41.515
of the sample medians.

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:44.919
Now, to judge whether it is a
biased or unbiased estimator

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:46.829
for the population median,

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.129
well, actually, pause the video,

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:49.804
see if you can figure that out.

00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:50.751
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:51.739
Now, to judge it,

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:54.039
let's think about where the
true population parameter is,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.978
the population median.

00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:58.259
It's 16, we know that and
so that is right over here,

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.249
the true population parameter.

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.778
So if we were dealing with a biased,

00:02:02.778 --> 00:02:05.938
a biased estimator for
the population parameter

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:07.380
then as we get that,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.293
our approximation of the
sampling distribution,

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:11.354
we would expect it to be somewhat skewed.

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:13.052
So for example, if the sampling,

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:15.116
if this approximation of
the sampling distribution

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:16.501
looked something like that then we'd say,

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:18.534
okay, that looks like a biased estimator

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:20.505
or if it was looking something like that,

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.077
we'd say, okay, that looks
like a biased estimator

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:25.718
but if this approximation
for our sampling distribution

00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:27.474
that Alejandro was constructing

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:30.066
where we see that roughly
the same proportion

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.430
of the sample statistics came out below

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.581
as came out above the true parameter

00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.197
and it doesn't have to be exact

00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:41.411
but it seems roughly the case,
this seems pretty unbiased

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.033
and so to answer the question
based on these results,

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.361
it does appear that the sample median

00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:50.407
is an unbiased estimator
of the population median.
