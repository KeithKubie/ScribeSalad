00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.350
Well, there's nothing bad in being
corporate, it's just less exciting.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.230
So what I love, I love the creation.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.980
I love the doing.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.920
I love the speed.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.327
I love the energy.

00:00:10.327 --> 00:00:13.912
I love the feeling that everything is
possible and waking up in the morning,

00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:17.160
knowing that if there's a mountain here,
we're going to move it, and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.680
build it somewhere else, if needed.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.070
And I don't think you get that in
corporate, at least in most corporates.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.540
The bureaucracy,
the structure, the politics,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.110
take away most of the things
that I love in working, and

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.720
so I'd much rather continue
dealing with entrepreneurship.
