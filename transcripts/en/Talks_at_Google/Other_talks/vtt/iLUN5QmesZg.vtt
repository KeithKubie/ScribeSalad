[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:05.810
BETH NOVECK: Thank
you very much.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.140
So I am the member of
the Obama tech team

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.410
who did not work for Google, one
of the few, as a rumor has it.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.350
But many of you may be
familiar with the story that

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.500
has been that of technology's
impact on government,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.270
both here in the UK, in the
US, and elsewhere, which

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.710
is the successes that we've
seen over the last few years

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.270
around opening the data
that government holds.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.900
So I'm just curious, how many
people here have actually been

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.002
on data.gov or data.gov.uk?

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.410
Ah, not a bad number.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.160
Done any hackathons, datathons,
any kind of mashing up?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.220
Well, at least you've been
there, and you know what it is.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.000
And so that already
is part of the success

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.334
story about how technology is
beginning to change government.

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:55.250
So this is, of course--
this is not of course.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.720
This is a picture from one
of my favorite restaurants

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.295
in Chicago.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:02.420
This is probably better
known to you than data.gov.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.510
It's called Alinea.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.746
Its the top rated
restaurant in Chicago.

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:07.120
And the reason I
show this to you

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.440
is not only because I love
food, but because Chicago

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.600
is one of those places
that has a great success

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.050
story around open data, right?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.820
Typically the way a city
deals with food borne illness

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.370
is through sending out a couple
of inspectors into restaurants.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.100
They go down a
list, you know, go

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.860
through the list of the whole
restaurants once a year, right?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.360
And they inspect
them one at a time.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.700
So what does Chicago do, right?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.910
They look at the data,
the open data that

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.560
now exists about the
incidence of food

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.300
borne illness and restaurants.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.750
And they develop an
algorithm to prioritize which

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.510
restaurants to inspect first.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.170
Because Chicago, like London,
being a great food town,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.410
of course, has
thousands of restaurants

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.140
but only a handful of inspectors
to have to do this major job.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.130
And so they've been able
to dramatically reduce

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.020
the incidence of illness,
serious and otherwise,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.420
by using data to improve
how government functions.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.270
So this is just but one example
of some of the successes

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.330
that we've seen since Obama
on his first day in office,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.522
and Cameron not too long
after his first day in office,

00:02:09.522 --> 00:02:11.730
said, we're going to turn
around and open up the data

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.160
that government holds.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.300
This was part of a
three-prong strategy

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.380
to change fundamentally
how government

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.014
works using technology, right?

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:20.680
We're going to make
it more transparent.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.730
We're going to make
it more participatory.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.680
And we're going to make
it more collaborative.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.590
And that open data story
has led to a lot of success

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.750
and a lot of impacts.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.390
We're just, of course,
at the beginning

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.640
of that revolution
in data driven

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.320
government and governing.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.630
But we're seeing a lot of
ways in which data is helping

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.220
government to work
better, to become

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.760
more accountable, enabling
more businesses to get started.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.660
Google uses a lot
of open government

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.500
data in its own businesses
to drive a lot of services

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.340
that you provide to consumers.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.152
It enables consumers,
of course, thanks

00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:52.610
to some of the
innovations that you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.840
create, to make better choices
like which hospital to go

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.050
to based on the
comparative infection

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.160
rates at those hospitals--
again, something

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.070
I can get from looking on Google
but that's driven ultimately

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.840
by government data.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.340
But the lesser
developed story is

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.550
what's happening in those other
two areas of participation

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.780
and collaboration.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.530
So if the last five
years has really

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.740
have been about
beginning the revolution

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.280
in open data, the next five
years, I want to put to you,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.270
is going to be about that shift
from data.gov to people.gov,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.220
to using technology,
data driven technologies,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.030
to enable us to do
for our country,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.060
to participate in new ways, to
make our government smarter,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.400
and to make it more effective.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.600
And we can see whether
I can convince Will

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.220
that we can actually
do things better

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.930
than we can do them today.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.900
And let me say as a
caveat in the outset,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.930
and though I'm happy
to talk in the Q&amp;A

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.940
about politics--
coming from the US,

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.660
there's plenty to
talk about right now.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.530
But what I'm talking
to you about today

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.800
is what happens the
day after the election.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.190
So after Bernie Sanders,
or Donald Trump,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.960
or whoever it may be becomes
president in November,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.040
and after you exit Europe,
or you don't exit Europe,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.040
and Scotland leaves, or
it doesn't, or whatever

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.827
is going to happen
in the next year,

00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:09.410
it has to do with
what happens the day

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.200
after these political
decisions are

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.350
made that allow us to deliver
health care, and education,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.910
and take out the trash, and
solve problems of illness,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.709
and pandemic, and global
warming, et cetera.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.020
So technology is
beginning to help us to do

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.330
these things better, right?

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.640
We have for a long
time held the ideal

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.500
and known about the idea of
asking citizens for their input

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.490
into how we make decisions,
usually by asking people

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.050
for their opinion, right?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.794
We poll people.

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:38.460
Well, how do you feel
about this policy?

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.140
Should we exit Europe or not?

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.690
Should Scotland leave or not?

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.030
And technology is helping us to
do that faster and more quickly

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.590
than we've done it before.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.460
How many people
have actually signed

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.880
a petition on E-petitions?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.480
Oh, quite a number.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.580
How many people have written
a petition, posted a petition?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.780
Any disgruntled folk out
there-- on either this site

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.535
or this site?

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.680
Let me see the hand.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.430
What was the petition
that you signed,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.622
for someone who signed one?

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:08.080
There was a lot of
hands that went.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.880
I think there was one--

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.150
Nobody's willing, sorry.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.170
I don't want to, you
know-- you're in the US,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.160
of course, the two
most popular petitions,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.650
you know what they were.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.940
So the two most popular
petitions, yes, you know.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.820
AUDIENCE: Death star?

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.361
BETH NOVECK: Yes,
build a Death Star.

00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:23.260
The White House should
build a Death Star--

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.030
not the most popular,
the second most popular.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.000
First most popular?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.300
AUDIENCE: Deport Bieber?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.410
BETH NOVECK: Deport Bieber
back to Canada, yes.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.580
Very apropos with the
Grammy's this week.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.300
So I'm not sure I've
convinced Will yet.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.180
If I stop here, I
haven't convinced will

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.180
that we're making
government work any better

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.170
using technology if that's
the best that we can do.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.420
What's interesting though
is the ways in which,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.130
perhaps a little
less well known,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.930
that we're beginning
to use technology

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.940
to actually get at not what
people feel about politics,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.680
and policy, and government,
but that actually get

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.380
at what people know and can do.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.770
So we're seeing lots of
instances of the ways

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.840
in which NGOs more so,
but government beginning,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.260
are tapping into
what people can do.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.720
I don't have a
slide up for it now.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.520
But for this room,
I want to make

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.160
sure to point out to you that in
British Columbia, for example,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.330
they've created something
called the BC Developers

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.110
Exchange, which is a way that
the government is reaching out

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.950
to engineers and
techies in the community

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.980
to get help with doing
technical projects

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.430
and lending their know-how.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.120
In Sao Paulo, starting in
November, Brazil's largest

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.600
city, the government
said, we don't know enough

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.070
about tech and innovation.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.840
And so instead of
our usual method

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.480
of sending civil servants to the
civil service training college,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.960
we're going to ask people in
the community to teach us.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.376
We're going to come to you and
say, want to teach courses?

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:45.120
Want to teach
government how to use R,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.280
how to use Python, how to
scrape data, how to whatever

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.040
it may be?

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.950
You pick the topic.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.283
You tell us what we should know.

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:54.310
And now they have 24,000
government officials

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.460
enrolled in courses
taught by techie citizens

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.140
to teach them to become
more tech literate.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.490
A lot of these projects
are also not just

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.190
about kind of time and tasks,
but also about ideas, right?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.980
So if I go on Madrid
website right now,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.640
I can share my know-how
about how to create

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.770
Madrid's new transparency law.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.220
I can go to Paris
and tell the mayor

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.150
where to put more
bathrooms in Paris

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.560
or what I think we
should do better there.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.620
And we can contribute our
know-how as well as our views

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.340
about things.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.120
So I got my start in
doing a lot of this work,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.664
or the best known
project I've done,

00:07:33.664 --> 00:07:36.080
before going to the White
House, was a project called Peer

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.090
to Patent.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.890
It was designed to enable
volunteer technologists

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.480
and scientists out there in
industry and in universities

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.850
to volunteer 10
minutes of their time

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.780
to share advice and information
with a patent examiner.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.030
Because a patent examiner,
at least in those days,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.030
had about 15 hours to
do all the research

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.360
and do all the work of
examining the patents that

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.160
would get the next,
you know, 20 years

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.830
of monopoly rights over
the technology that goes

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.479
into this phone, for example.

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:09.520
Sorry, I'm not allowed to
show this phone, right?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.240
That other phone-- wee, that's
why they're in lawsuits, right?

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.260
Because you only have
15 hours to do the work.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.420
So why not reach out to the
people in this room and say,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.510
who knows about this issue?

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.760
For the patent examiner,
it takes 15 hours.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.750
For you, it probably
would take 15 minutes,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.680
because it's the thing you
work on in your day job.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.030
So fast forward
to five years ago,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.370
2011, and the federal
government in the United States

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.401
builds on this idea to create
a website called challenge.gov.

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.085
So I've tested you
on the data.gov.

00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:45.830
How many people have been on
or participated in a Challenge?

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.280
Whoa, for the record, no hands.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.920
Am I correct?

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.790
Not a single hand.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.730
So I would encourage
you to go on here.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.260
They pay you enough at
Google, so you may not

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.710
need to win the multimillion
dollar prizes that

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.220
are on here for coming up
with an idea for how to remove

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.600
the salt from salt water
to improve agriculture

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.010
and farming in the
developing world.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.970
You don't necessarily need
to earn the prize that

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.830
relates to how to use
technology to reduce the word

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.120
gap between the number of words
a rich child and a poor child

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.860
hears before he or
she is five years old.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.180
But you could.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.180
And it's a little
depressing that you don't

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.310
know about that opportunity.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.890
Maybe food is your
thing, as it is for me.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.000
You want to help the European
Food Safety Agency, which

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.947
after the controversy over
its rulings on GMO cereals--

00:09:36.947 --> 00:09:39.280
in other words, saying they're
safe when a lot of people

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.040
feel that they're
not-- they're now

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.980
moving to look at how they can
crowdsource expertise instead

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.180
of making these
scientific decisions,

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.750
controversial scientific
decisions behind closed doors.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.630
The challenge and
the problem, though,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.880
that I would put
to you, the reason

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.550
that you haven't been on
challenge.gov and the reason

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.770
that government doesn't look
fundamentally different today

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.900
than it did 10 years
ago is a problem

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.070
that technology can
help us to solve.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.000
And that is that the way
that we do participation,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.300
the way that we do engagement,
co-creation, co-production,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.850
whatever you want to call it is
through the open call, right?

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.320
Challenge.gov is,
hey, anyone out there

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.980
who has a good idea for removing
the salt from salt water

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.524
to improve farming?

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:24.690
And you don't know about it.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.520
It's a tree falling in a forest,
because the government is

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.470
terrible at marketing, right?

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.190
It's terrible it's sales.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.910
It is not very good at
doing what companies

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.870
know how to do so well, which
is to segment their audiences

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.160
and customers, right?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.600
You know exactly when to
give me an ad for whatever it

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.090
is that you're
giving me an ad for.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.600
Somebody, whoever out there is
responsible for all those ads

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.309
that I have to read, you give
me the ads that I want to read,

00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:50.850
because you know
what I'm looking at.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.570
And you know also that
because of my behavior

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.740
and my characteristics, I am
more likely to buy toothpaste

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.680
in the afternoon that
I am in the morning.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.940
And you know that with
some scientific precision--

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.540
a very well-developed trend
in companies, not something

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.030
we do well within government.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.490
Now I'm not talking about
heavy levels of data

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.890
driven surveillance here.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.760
I'm talking about doing some
very lightweight curation

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.840
of the audiences who are out
there and better apprising them

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.940
of opportunities to participate.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.740
Because right now it's too hard
to find the people who know.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.440
It's too hard to connect
you to challenge.gov.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.530
It's also very hard,
and we're not used to,

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.400
and we don't have the
cultural experience

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.660
that you know so well from going
on Stack Exchange and saying,

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.280
hey, anybody out there have
the answer to what line of code

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.860
is going to make my program run?

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.240
We don't know well how
to do that in government.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.590
Because of course,
we have a tradition

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.690
and a culture of governing
behind closed doors.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.400
If I say, in government, I
don't know, and I'm ignorant,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.830
I'm in the Daily Mail tomorrow,
right-- as the ignorant person

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.050
who doesn't know.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.730
But also, it's very hard
to formulate a question.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.610
On Stack Exchange, it's
very easy to say, you know,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.290
what is the particular
aperture for my camera

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.040
that I should use when
taking this picture?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.910
But that's not
the same thing as,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.950
how do I reduce the backlog
in veterans benefits claims?

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.720
How do I improve health
care, cure cancer?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.830
The questions that
government tends to work on

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.710
do not lend themselves
very well to Q&amp;A sites,

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.780
because they're
not very granular.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.960
And we also really
have no experience

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.640
and no legal
framework for allowing

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.390
us to get agile expertise,
for getting answers

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.860
to questions quickly.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.310
The typical way in which
government gets expertise

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.130
is through something like an
advisory committee, right?

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.260
10 people who sit on
a committee, they meet

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.820
face to face at Whitehall or in
Washington three times a year.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.130
And they produce an
enormous PDF of 100 pages.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.680
Before coming here,
I was just meeting

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.550
with an executive
from the NHS who

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.110
is responsible for quality
improvements who was telling me

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.400
about the audits that
the NHS conducts,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.850
these fabulous data driven
research studies of performance

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.610
by hospitals across the UK.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.720
But what's the biggest
problem they have?

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.670
It's the 100 page PDF.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.750
How do you take the 100 page PDF
about hip fractures and stroke,

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.700
chock full of data, and
turn it into 10 things

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.590
that a hospital manager
needs to do or three things

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.330
that the public needs to know?

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.340
We're not very good at
agile in government.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.480
So the question, and what
I want to sort of spend

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.300
my last few minutes
talking to you about,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.330
is the strategies we
might use for moving

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.190
from a world of the open
call, crowdsourcing wisely--

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.640
excuse me, crowdsourcing
widely-- hello, anyone out

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.130
there-- to crowdsourcing
a little more widely,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:45.150
where we do a small, small
job of curating people

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.290
who are out there who may be
able to supply the expertise

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.390
that we need.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.580
So imagine that we're facing a
pandemic like the Zika virus.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.830
And I will interrupt myself
and risk going over my timing

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.650
to tell you a quick
story about this, which

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.810
is I got a call last week by
a multi-national organization

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.930
asking me if I could recommend
a big data expert to help Brazil

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:10.450
with Zika, to which I just--
I almost fell off my chair.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.910
You want me to pick
one person, one person,

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.220
who is going to be person
to solve this problem.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.090
Why would you want one person
in this day and age when

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.260
I could have 100 people, 1,000
people, when I could have

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.489
a big data person, with
a public health person,

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:27.780
together with somebody who
knows the region, together--

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.600
you get the idea?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.400
We have the ability to curate
and crowd source expertise

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.680
so that when we need
creative ideas, when

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.790
we need to find the
techies, and the doctors,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.500
and the taxi drivers, and
the stay-at-home moms,

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.800
and the students, we
should be able to do

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.100
a better job of that.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.920
We have the data that
does a much better job now

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.910
of telling us what people know
that makes that searchable

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.550
to companies, to NGOs,
and to governments in ways

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.140
that we can make use of.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.180
So just to give you a
quick, concrete example

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.460
before I launch into
a few developments

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.610
in the public sector-- think
about something like HealthTap.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.452
I don't know how popular
this is in the UK.

00:15:12.452 --> 00:15:14.160
It's not even that
popular yet in the US.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.710
But you get the simple
idea that it's a network--

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.590
excuse me-- of
doctors so that when

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.860
I, as the mother
of a small child,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.790
have-- you know, my kid has
a sniffle, I can go on there

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.630
and find a doctor.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.240
I can target that expertise and
get the know-how that I need.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.000
And they're now using
this same network

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.870
to connect doctors in
the developed world

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.760
to crises in the
developing world.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.800
This is because
ultimately, and what

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.850
we could spend a long
time talking about

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.960
is the ways in which
the internet is

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.480
changing how we define expertise
and how we make it searchable.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.240
If I asked you how many people
in this room are on LinkedIn,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.186
I'm pretty sure every single
hand would go up, right?

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:54.560
I'm going to ask
you also-- and I

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.890
am sure Google has a very well
developed knowledge management

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.740
system and HR databases
that will tell you

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.140
all about what peoples' skills
are and make them searchable.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.540
And we have lots of that
relate to the credentials

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.630
that people have,
but more importantly,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.275
also to the experience
that people have

00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:11.900
or to the skills that
they have, right?

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.608
If I want to know if
a coder is any good,

00:16:13.608 --> 00:16:14.870
I look at their GitHub repo.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.720
I don't care what LinkedIn says
about where they got a degree.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.820
Because 14% of the people at
Google don't have a degree,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.350
right?

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.074
But it makes them better
coders, not worse coders,

00:16:24.074 --> 00:16:25.990
as long as I know something
about their skills

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.955
and experience.

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:28.330
Some of you may
have interacted--

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.200
I don't know if--
Panos Ipeirotis, who

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.080
spends his summers
at Google and then

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.660
the rest of the year at
NYU at the Stern School

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.150
has done some amazing work on
quiz.us, a project supported

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.350
by Google, which is,
long story short,

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.000
essentially goes to prove
that people with passion

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.120
on a particular
topic-- in other words,

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.340
a patient who has a disease
and spends a lot of time

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.620
on the Web MD, turns out to
know a lot more about a topic

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.050
than a person with a credential.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.750
And that's something that
he has set out to measure.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.490
So we're seeing lots of ways
in which we can manifest

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.609
our expertise and lots of ways
in which we can actually make

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.400
it more searchable to people.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.660
And by that, I'm referring
now to the technologies

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.740
of badges and digital badges.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.170
So if I go to NYU
and I get a degree,

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.920
I now get a digital badge,
which I can put on LinkedIn,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.869
or my website, et
cetera, that makes my

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.980
know how more
searchable to people,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.980
allowing me to showcase
my experience, my skills,

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.150
my interests, my passions from
a variety of different places,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.380
not just the place
I went to school,

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.410
but many different
indicia of the way

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.590
that I am developing my
know-how and expertise.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.500
So let me close with
just a couple of examples

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.600
of the ways in
which we're starting

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.460
to see a move towards the
use of this technology

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.900
in the public sector
in the first place

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.450
to better tap into the
know how of civil servants

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.220
and public servants, but then
also to connect government

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.690
to citizens.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.084
So I'd like-- and if it wasn't
clear from the title already,

00:18:00.084 --> 00:18:02.250
I'd like to think about
this as doing for government

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.620
what we do for dating, right?

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.786
So if you don't like the
toothpaste and the customer

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:09.260
segmentation example, think
about Tinder as the example.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.250
Dating websites are really
good at matching people,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.380
matching us for marriage,
for dating, for a hook up,

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.620
whatever it may be-- it's
to connect people one

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.470
to another based
on their interests.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.980
If we can take that
same idea and we

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.850
can take the same kinds of
underlying technologies,

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.620
we can do a better job
of actually greasing

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.852
the skids between
how institutions work

00:18:30.852 --> 00:18:31.976
and how they get expertise.

00:18:31.976 --> 00:18:32.770
[RINGTONE]

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:33.644
Sorry.

00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:38.330
[CHUCKLE] Uh, that's
that other phone.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.130
Health and Human
Services-- our ministry

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.970
of health in the
United States has

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.730
110,000 people who work there.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.610
They have the responsibility
for the very hard task

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.690
of deciding on the safety
and efficacy of drugs

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.320
and medical devices
that go out into market.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.980
They have to get
them out quickly

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.160
if businesses are
to thrive, but not

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.980
so quickly that they risk
killing people with devices

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.180
that are faulty.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.940
So they've set up now
an expert network,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.530
the kind of knowledge
management system that's

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.310
common to companies,
but to allow

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.810
them to tap into the
expertise or resources

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.880
that they have across the
department, across the agency,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.300
something that had never
been able to do before.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.600
And the hope is that that
will accelerate how they

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.970
get expertise and do their job.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.780
It's more though than
just about getting

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.310
at credentials and diplomas,
like who has what degree

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.890
or what publications in health?

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.110
It's also about getting at
what that experience is.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:33.150
So the World Bank just this year
has put its 27,000 employees

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.392
on an expert network.

00:19:34.392 --> 00:19:35.850
And finding though
that they didn't

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.830
know how to use that to
translate into better

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.340
outcomes for solving
global poverty,

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.932
they also built a help desk.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.390
So that now what
you do is you say,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.181
I'm looking for somebody
who has experience

00:19:46.181 --> 00:19:50.170
in setting up a well in
this part of Burkina Faso.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.570
And the help desk will in
turn use the digital tools

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.340
to help you navigate
knowledge within the Bank

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.260
in order to allow them to
source the expertise that they

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.260
have internally that they
don't even know that they have.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.740
The mayor's office
in New York City

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.530
does something similar
for finding people

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.700
who have the ability to speak
Albanian, or Serbo-Croation,

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.194
or whatever it may be at
the time that it's needed.

00:20:10.194 --> 00:20:11.610
And we're starting
to see examples

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.410
of this kind of
technology coming

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:14.810
into public institutions.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.040
Half the civil service
in Canada is now

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.040
connected on GC Connects.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.910
But we're just at the beginning.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.370
And you have calls both
in the United States

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.860
and in Britain, of course, for
using more technology to better

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.470
tap into the human capital that
we have in the civil service.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.550
I don't have time today
to go into many more

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.400
of these examples.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.369
I'll just end with one or two.

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:37.160
But if you are interested
in some of these,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.310
or know about more, or want
to share more about what's

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.347
going on in the private
sector that people

00:20:42.347 --> 00:20:43.930
in the public sector
could learn from,

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.360
we are trying to collect
some of these case studies

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.580
at a website called
Smarter State.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.900
So let me just close by talking
about the ways in which we are

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.140
making the transition
from connecting

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.250
civil servants better, creating
better organizational learning

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.900
and better teams in
public institutions,

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.000
to looking at how this affects
our ability for institutions

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.220
to change how they
work with citizens.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.490
There are lots of these
knowledge networks beginning

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:12.580
to creep up.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.490
Vivo Web is connecting
over 200,000 academics.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.220
And Agra Vivo is now creating
the spin-off for people

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.720
with agricultural expertise.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.590
And we're seeing also
again some movement,

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:29.670
very early, towards looking
at how do we actually do this,

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.520
going beyond traditional
credentials and research

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.440
networking, you know, going
beyond what Google Scholar can

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.400
do in terms of telling me
what my publications are

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.880
and my citations, to
looking at how we tap

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.000
into the skills of
people in a community

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.240
so that we can get
engagement that isn't just

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.310
cerebral and credentialed,
but is also about boots

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.990
on the ground, getting people
to help and participate

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.920
in new ways.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.360
Podemos, the upstart
political party in Spain,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.960
has created something
called Banco de Talentos

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.270
to start to inventory the
skills and ability of the people

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.670
in their own movement,
in their own party,

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.460
in the hope that they can better
figure out ways to tap into it.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.027
So the last example, and
probably the most powerful one,

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:11.360
and there is-- I've been using
this example for a while,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.470
because there continues
to be none better.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.060
But I think it's the
beginning of what's possible.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.390
That is the ability
again to use technology

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.320
to target a single skill,
in this case, the ability

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.650
to perform CPR and
use a defibrillator.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.340
So if you were in Mountain
View in California,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.390
and before PulsePoint
came along,

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.570
and you had a heart
attack, these dots

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.370
represent the police,
and fire, and ambulance

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.150
who would come and save you in
the event you had an accident

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.490
or had a heart attack.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:46.370
Come PulsePoint, open
data feeds from 999 or 911

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.110
in the United
States, geolocation

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.760
using my cell phone or any
cell phone, I might add,

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.630
that allows one to know where
I am vis a vis the victim.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.500
And suddenly my coverage
in terms of first response

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.020
looks like this, right?

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.100
And for every second the victim
of a heart attack-- excuse me,

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.870
every minute the victim
of a heart attack

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.110
gets bystander CPR,
gets aid sooner,

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.040
doubles the chances of their
likelihood of survival.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.640
1,400 communities now in the
United States use PulsePoint.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.750
And as of four months
ago, the same service

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.250
called GoodSAM, a
service of the London Air

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.580
Ambulance out of St.
Mary's Hospital here,

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.350
provides the same
thing in London.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.520
So if there's no other
message that you take away

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.370
from me today, it's
please sign up for this.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.470
Please sign up and save a life.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.840
Because there is a way now
for us to use technology

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.290
to target people's ability
and willingness to serve,

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.290
the supply of expertise
with the demand for it,

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.340
namely people who
can perform CPR,

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.430
who can use a defibrillator,
with a very real outcome,

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.222
which is to save a life.

00:23:51.222 --> 00:23:52.680
So we should talk
in our discussion

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.430
about how do we get
from here to there?

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.380
There's a lot that we have to
do if we're to actually enable

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.820
these kinds of platforms,
if we're actually

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.770
to enable these
kinds of processes.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.820
We've got to want to do
it, first and foremost.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.610
And we have to overcome
a lot of legal hurdles.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.910
I won't get into the minutiae
of US law or British law.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.790
But suffice it to
say, we don't have

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.070
the legal frameworks that allow
us to do this very well yet.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.770
We have to have the digital
badges and credentialing

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.510
systems that allow us
to actually do a better

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.060
job of finding expertise.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.660
So I've given you a
bunch of examples,

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.580
but we're just at the beginning
of actually making searchable

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.862
what people know.

00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:32.320
And companies like
Google have been

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.160
at the forefront, along with
foundations like Lumina, trying

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.720
to sponsor the creation of more
liquid badging systems, skill

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.290
based systems, digital
credentialing systems

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.080
so we can do that
kind of matching.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.630
LinkedIn is involved in this
here in Manchester, et cetera.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.790
So right?

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.750
This is your HR guy.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.790
We don't care about
degrees anymore.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.090
That means we need the
tools to better find out

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.350
what skills people have
and what they know.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.500
Those same kinds
of platforms that

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.757
are getting developed
for industry,

00:25:03.757 --> 00:25:05.590
that are getting developed
to better connect

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.120
job seekers to
jobs, can also help

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.750
us now to connect people
to opportunities to serve

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.720
and to govern better as we
build more of these credentials,

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.890
as we build more
of these networks,

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.530
and as we try more
to see what works.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.100
So finally, Will, I don't
have all the answers.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.450
I don't know what works.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.780
I know that we need to do
a bunch of experiments.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.600
We need to compare, you
know, whether the thing

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.590
that the Health and
Human Services is doing

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.420
to find experts to
examine medical devices

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.180
by targeted expertise works
better than the system

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.470
that the Environmental
Protection Agency is putting

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.080
in place to post projects
and say, hey, anyone

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.460
out there with these
skills within the agency--

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.170
does that self-selection
work better?

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.740
Does the targeting work better?

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.760
We're going to find
out as we do it more.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.340
We're going to find out
as more people volunteer

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.310
to make themselves more
findable and more searchable

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.660
so that we can solve the
problems that we face.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.716
Let me close by saying,
we have to do this.

00:26:02.716 --> 00:26:04.250
This is not a nice-to-have.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.140
This is not about the, oh,
democratic participation

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.920
would be nice, because
it builds legitimacy.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.580
That's a good thing, right?

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.350
And if you are a
democratic theorist,

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.230
or a participatory
democrat, or just a citizen,

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.350
you really care
about the legitimacy

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.550
that comes from
citizen participation.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.990
Maybe you had to read
your Habermas in school.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:27.270
And you know how important
legitimacy building can be.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.380
But I would argue it
is a false dichotomy

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.520
to suggest that participation
is simply about legitimacy,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.490
and then the
bureaucrats over here,

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.500
the people behind
the closed doors,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.520
they're the ones who
get the real work done.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.420
And when you want to
effective outcomes,

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.600
you have to do that
behind closed doors.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.180
We know better than that today.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.290
We know that we
have to produce--

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.840
if we wanted innovation, we
have to produce it openly.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.450
And if we want to deal with the
challenges of global warming,

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.330
and immigration, and Europe,
and all these hard problems

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.330
that we deal with in
the political realm,

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.120
we have to have a machinery of
government that does a better

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.640
job at stewarding
those conversations

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.450
and of bringing
in that expertise.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.870
Credentialed know-how,
boots on the ground,

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.690
and people doing
tasks-- either way,

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.010
tech will help us over
the next five years

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.020
to build participation.gov,
not just data.gov.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.060
So thank you very much.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.280
I went on too long,
but I hope that you

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:27.410
will challenge me, disagree
with me, ask me, et cetera.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.600
Eager to hear.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.315
So how do we-- disagreement
particularly welcome.

00:27:35.129 --> 00:27:36.520
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.220
This all sounds good except
that to make a difference,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.490
it feels like you need to
get into government first

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.970
and then do something
in this direction.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.070
So to that extent, how
do private institutions

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.717
or how do individuals
contribute to the government

00:27:49.717 --> 00:27:51.300
or help the government
in implementing

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.542
this strategy or these things?

00:27:54.542 --> 00:27:56.000
BETH NOVECK: So
what are the things

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.822
that private institutions
can do to help?

00:27:57.822 --> 00:28:00.280
I think there are a number of--
there are a number of ways.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.940
So first, one of the things
we've started to see--

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.860
and I'm talking about a lot
of tech-enabled, smaller

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.490
forms of participation.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:11.590
But one of the ways we've
created the pathway for this

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.360
is now by building--
many governments

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.820
have created,
fellowship programs

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.320
where they're taking people who
are coming from industry who

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.890
will work for a year-- The
Presidential Innovation

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.370
Fellowship in Washington,
the Presidential Innovation

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.210
Fellowship in Mexico City.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.480
Cities are copying this.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.104
So there's lots of
ways in which people

00:28:28.104 --> 00:28:31.197
can give of their time on
a more systematic basis

00:28:31.197 --> 00:28:33.530
to get involved, and to help,
and to bring that know-how

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.690
to bear.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.440
That's one way, but that's
a very major commitment

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.690
and only involves a
handful of people.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.320
And that has its shortcomings.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.660
The second way, I think, is
as companies and employees

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.150
of those companies
make their skills

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.680
and expertise more visible and
searchable-- in other words,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.960
if we can persuade Google to
make some of what they collect

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.120
about you, with your
consent, of course, more

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.540
visible for civic purposes
and public purposes,

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.720
then we can do a better job
of tapping into those skills.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.920
So Bill Gates, in his New
Year's letter this past year--

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.640
so Bill and Melinda Gates put
out a letter, their foundation

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.614
at the end of the year.

00:29:13.614 --> 00:29:15.780
He said, we're going to
commit to spending the money

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.690
to build a global database
of citizens to fight poverty.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.800
So presumably, that's going to
come also with the commitment,

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.040
I would like to think, of
making the know-how of Microsoft

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.340
employees more available
for public good and public

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.740
purposes, whether that's, again,
making those skills searchable,

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.150
giving people the time that
it takes to do those tasks.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.960
I think that's going
to be a big way.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.570
And then the third way is
also building the technology.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.710
So at GovLab, in order to try
to inspire some of these ideas,

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.680
we've been tinkering
around with creating

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.950
some platforms to do this and
to show what might be possible.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.660
But, you know, we're
not in a position

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.170
to build the tools, to
build that global database

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.090
of citizens that Gates wants
to get everybody networked

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.440
so that we can fight poverty.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.460
If we want to
build networks that

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.110
cut across countries with
people with expertise

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.630
in given fields or the
networks of people who

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.120
can perform CPR or volunteer in
the event of a disaster, that's

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.960
going to take a lot of
private sector tech,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.120
I think, to do and a
commitment and a willingness

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.630
to adapt the
platforms that we're

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.100
building for private purposes
to also use for public purposes.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.720
So I think there's
a range of things

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.584
from giving of one's
time, sharing information,

00:30:26.584 --> 00:30:28.000
to actually building
the platforms

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.958
and tech to enable other
people to participate.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.160
Other comments, questions-- yes.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.105
Oh, and if you wouldn't mind
also, sorry, saying who you are

00:30:38.105 --> 00:30:42.730
would be very nice and
anything about yourself.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.970
AUDIENCE: I'm Glen.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.350
I contribute a lot to
open source software.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.139
But I never done any
government projects.

00:30:48.139 --> 00:30:49.930
And while I like the
idea of pulling people

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.770
from a common pool, the reason
I will not join the pool

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.680
is because there
is no open process.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.150
And there is no shared
standard of collaboration.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.780
So what I am saying is,
before we can do this,

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.400
at least on the techie
side, we need not

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.145
Tinder, but rather GitHub.

00:31:06.145 --> 00:31:07.750
BETH NOVECK: Ah, so
I can commend you,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.480
the work-- so there is, by the
way, a lot of GitHub activity

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.210
for government, including
GitHub's use for lawmaking.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.190
There's also-- so
first of all, there

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.920
are-- let me take that
apart in a couple of ways.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.350
There is obviously
in many places

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.980
now a move towards embracing
open source and open standards

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.810
in government in a way
that I didn't think

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.440
was possible a few years ago.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.900
I literally got up in front
of an audience like this

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.430
when I started within
the White House,

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:41.295
and I said-- and I used
the analogy of open source

00:31:41.295 --> 00:31:41.920
for government.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.730
I talked about creating a
more open source government.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.080
I was called into the
general counsel's office.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.950
And I was grounded, essentially.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.700
Do not-- whatever
you do, do not use

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.410
the word open source in public.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.340
Quite literally, that's
what was said to me.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.170
We have come a long way in
five years where now there

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.810
is a dramatic about face in
terms of embracing open source.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.490
I was just asked to testify last
week before the New York City

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.450
Council, which is adopting
a bill-- I think it probably

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.010
passed-- which was a sort
of radical, only open source

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.450
unless you can avoid it move.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.960
So first of all,
just to say that

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.840
from the perspective of--
there is a dramatically deeper

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.910
understanding of the
importance of open source

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.270
and open standards
in the public sector.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.030
For all of these
processes, though, I

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.480
would like to think that
what I'm talking about

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.240
is essentially bringing
open standards to engagement

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.180
in some sense.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.370
Right now we don't
have well understood

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.710
pathways or mechanisms
for how to participate.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.842
And so your analogy,
if you want to call it

00:32:42.842 --> 00:32:44.550
that-- I think you
mean it both literally

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.570
and as an analogy-- is
exactly what we need to do,

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.930
is to make it much
simpler, much easier

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.720
to create open
forums of engagement.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.230
And that's exactly
what this is about.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.760
Right now, the way
government gets

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.610
expertise for the most part is
a very, very closed process.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.740
And we need to think
about how we open that up.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.609
So I'm not sure if that was--
there's a probably deeper,

00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:06.900
more detailed response to this.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.032
But tell me if that-- if
I'm convincing you at all.

00:33:10.032 --> 00:33:10.740
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.960
That's a good response.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.750
Just to give you
an example for what

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.542
worked in the tech
industry, before GitHub,

00:33:15.542 --> 00:33:16.458
there was SourceForge.

00:33:16.458 --> 00:33:17.300
BETH NOVECK: Yup.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.120
AUDIENCE: And that worked
more on the pool model.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.710
So there was no open process.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.250
The collaboration was open.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.300
But all of the development
happened behind closed doors.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.520
And what GitHub brought on was
the openness of the process.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.220
And with that gave us is, rather
than the talent pool model,

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.870
is that people would
contribute themselves.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.239
They would nominate themselves
to specific projects.

00:33:41.239 --> 00:33:42.780
Because the process
was open, so they

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.810
could get a feel of
what it was like to work

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.470
on a specific project
before committing themselves

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.675
to being an expert or being a
consultant on certain things.

00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:52.300
BETH NOVECK: I think
that that's right.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.840
And so as a
practical matter, you

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.090
are seeing a lot more
government tech projects which

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.180
are using GitHub as well
as government law making

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:06.065
projects using GitHub, so both
as a model and as a reality.

00:34:06.065 --> 00:34:07.690
And if you're interested
in this topic,

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.300
there's a wonderful professor
at the University of Regina

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:15.699
in Canada who has written some
wonderful articles on GitHub

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:19.810
for government and studying
how one can actually,

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:24.060
literally, not as a metaphor use
GitHub to make government tech

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.564
work better, but also to
design government services,

00:34:27.564 --> 00:34:28.480
and do lots of things.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.605
So I think we're moving
towards more its open model

00:34:30.605 --> 00:34:31.889
and processes.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.330
And a lot of this
is about, look,

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:36.320
this is about creating many,
many more forms of engagement,

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.360
some of which may be
very small and granular,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.230
10 minutes of your
time, and some of which

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:45.770
may be a much more significant
commitment backed by funding,

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:47.330
or a prize, et cetera.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:52.980
So we just need more variety
in the opportunities.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.290
So there's a hand all
the way in the back.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.639
I don't know if we have to-- oh.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.940
Thank you, mic runner.

00:35:03.664 --> 00:35:04.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.610
So I'm, I guess, a
computer scientist

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.380
is how I describe myself.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.100
I'm not sure, by
the way, I accept

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.625
the thesis that the tech
industry is that successful

00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:14.190
or a model for government.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.490
But even supposing I did,
what about responsibility?

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.570
One of the key things
I want from government

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.582
and which the tech
industry is frequently

00:35:20.582 --> 00:35:22.665
accused of not having is
a sense of responsibility

00:35:22.665 --> 00:35:26.190
and mechanisms of
responsibility.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.930
How do you see
that being grafted

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.290
on these quite open
platforms where, you know,

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.270
anyone can swarm in and write
something on Stack Overflow,

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.700
and maybe it doesn't work.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.356
Or maybe it's self-serving.

00:35:36.356 --> 00:35:38.480
BETH NOVECK: So let me say
that in the first place,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:44.370
I am not suggesting--
well, I want

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.150
to-- let me-- there
are ways in which

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:52.090
and places in which we have
seen radical devolution of power

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.740
and authority downward to
citizens and much more bottom

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.940
up processes.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.770
So take, for example,
participatory budgeting,

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.710
where small portions
of municipal budgets

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.430
in about 1,500 different
cities around the world

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.730
are handed to a
group of citizens,

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.380
in a fully transparent
deliberative process,

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.770
to decide how to spend
instead of the city

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.920
councilmen and politicians
who would usually

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.510
make that decision.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.650
I am thinking here,
though, about making a move

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.820
towards more open
forms of engagement,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.330
not necessarily by
abdicating or getting

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.385
rid of government in this case.

00:36:29.385 --> 00:36:31.510
So in the Peer to Patent
project that we worked on,

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.470
we didn't get rid of
the patent examiner.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.720
There was a very important
role for that person

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:41.570
to play as essentially the
arbiter of the legal standards.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.370
Because a patent examiner--
patent examination

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.490
involves two pieces, a lot of
technical know-how and then

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.070
the ability to apply a legal
standard about the relevance

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.090
of that technical know-how to
the decision about the patent.

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.950
There was an ultimate
decision-maker

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.590
who remained at
the center and who

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.700
was the arbiter, essentially,
of the information

00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.830
that was coming in.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.970
So in many cases, this
is about maintaining

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.720
those pathways of
decision making and power

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.000
but doing a better job of
bringing evidence, and data,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.190
and know-how into how
those decisions get made.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:16.170
One more kind of answer
by way of analogy-- I

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.460
had a guy who worked
for me last year.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.420
He was responsible for small
business policy in the White

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.380
House before he
came to work for me.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.860
He was 24 years old when he
worked for me and 22 years old

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.280
when he worked in
the White House.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.310
He had never owned
a small business.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.580
Now he was very smart.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.560
And he had an Ivy League
degree or two by that point.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.540
But he had no know-how
and no experience and had,

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.360
you know, a couple
of days to formulate

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.280
what would be a national
policy affecting

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.830
large numbers of people.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:46.914
That's how decision making
gets done today, right?

00:37:46.914 --> 00:37:48.871
I don't know how many
people have seen-- what's

00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:50.770
that great movie about--
with Peter Capaldi

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.844
about the British government?

00:37:52.844 --> 00:37:54.010
AUDIENCE: "The Thick of It."

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:54.400
BETH NOVECK: What?

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400
AUDIENCE: "The Thick of It."

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.530
BETH NOVECK: "In the Thick
of It--" "The Thick of It"

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.320
was the TV show.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.029
The movie-- "In the
Loop," "In the Loop."

00:37:59.029 --> 00:38:01.569
So I don't know if you remember
the scene where Peter Capaldi

00:38:01.569 --> 00:38:02.830
walks into the White House.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.380
And this, like,
12-year-old kid comes in.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.860
And he orders coffee from him.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.760
And he explains, no, no, no, he
is the senior policy adviser.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.320
That's very typical to
how government gets made.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.540
Here they call them the SPAD.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.750
We call them the
special assistant.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.320
Whether you're 22
or 52, the ability

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.350
to have all the
knowledge that you

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.430
need to make the decisions
which government does

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.320
is very, very limited.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.190
So the point is,
how do we open up

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.320
the decision making processes,
bring in more information,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.640
and still maintain the pathways
of accountability that we have,

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.210
that government can be
quite good at doing?

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.590
So sorry, that's a long,
perhaps not-- I don't know.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.739
You're looking quite skeptical.

00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:44.780
You're looking skeptical.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.071
And then what you should be
saying to me is, well then,

00:38:47.071 --> 00:38:49.560
but doesn't that still-- if
you keep those same decision

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.790
making pathways, then
can't I simply ignore

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.700
all the evidence and just
make whatever decision I want?

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.870
Well, that's the problem
of politics, right?

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.900
But at least if we
have a paper trail,

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.420
at least if we have a
record, at least if we have

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.210
the evidence out there,
and the data available,

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.530
and the conflicting
opinions, you

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.130
will have to do a better job
of justifying your desire

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.460
to make a decision that flies
in the face of that evidence.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.400
Right now, the 22-year-olds get
to make those decisions without

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.870
the benefit of that, so--

00:39:29.042 --> 00:39:31.500
AUDIENCE: I was then imagining
the 22-year-old is sat there

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.800
with 10,000 submissions from
angry members of the public.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.920
I'm wondering how we're
going to-- perhaps

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.400
we need more people
on the government side

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.531
in order to be able to deal
with this participatory decision

00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:45.030
making.

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:48.400
BETH NOVECK: So
that's why we have

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.960
to move away from two things.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.490
One is asking people how they
feel and the open call, right?

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.030
If I ask you how you
feel about small business

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.500
policy in the
United States, what

00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.730
are you going to say to me?

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.063
Well, you're not going to say
anything, because you have

00:40:02.063 --> 00:40:03.279
a job to do, and you're busy.

00:40:03.279 --> 00:40:04.820
But the person I'm
going to hear from

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.540
is the person who
is nothing else

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.330
to do besides tell you what
a crap job you're doing,

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:11.950
essentially.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.480
So I am the person who
has the misfortune,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.740
if you want to call it that,
of coming into government

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.350
on the first days of the
Obama administration in 2008

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:26.700
and being so inclined, said,
we should have a WordPress blog

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.558
with comments.

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:30.366
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.220
Yeah.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.900
Well, I got my picture
in the "New York Times,"

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.980
not for the reason
that you would want to.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.220
And I will just tell you
that the next day, they

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.570
put a sign up on my door--
when I came into work,

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:47.750
the sign on my door said
"Area 51, Director of--"

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.460
what was it-- "Director
of Intergalactic Affairs."

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.110
Because I was getting so
many nut jobs telling me

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:56.120
about Martians landing,
and President Obama's birth

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.890
certificate, and the
birth certificate

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.025
that was on Mars
with the Martians.

00:41:00.025 --> 00:41:01.635
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:01.635 --> 00:41:04.010
And no, they were not all from
Donald Trump at that time.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:08.990
But the point is, if you just
do the open comment process,

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.610
that is what you will get.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.590
You will not get
info that's helpful.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.070
You'll get "Deport Justin
Bieber Back to Canada."

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.240
And though you may think
that is an important area

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.290
of national policy
making, I would

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.770
like to think that that
naked suggestion by itself

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.750
doesn't help us to
make better decisions.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:28.340
If you want me to deport
Justin Bieber back to Canada,

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.310
then you should tell
me how to do it, right?

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:35.120
We need better expertise about
how to implement policy, not

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.660
just how to make that policy.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.500
So the point is that
everywhere along the arc of how

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.970
a service gets delivered
or a problem gets

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.410
solved, starting
from just identifying

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.990
with the problems are, to coming
up with possible solutions

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.150
to those problems,
to deciding how

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.330
to implement those
solutions, those are

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:56.210
all opportunities for input.

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:57.850
But we know better.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.750
And this is where I mean
about learning a bit from how

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.260
other people have done this.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.110
It's not because I
think we should run--

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.880
unlike some people, I don't
think we should turn Washington

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.280
into Silicon Valley.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.147
There are many people
who believe that.

00:42:10.147 --> 00:42:11.855
But because we can do
a little bit better

00:42:11.855 --> 00:42:14.737
a job of structuring how
we ask people, right?

00:42:14.737 --> 00:42:16.570
Ask people a hard
question, and you will get

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:20.280
a hard answer is the wisdom.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.860
Ask people to do
the heavy lifting.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.350
Don't just tell me to deport
Justin Bieber back to Canada.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.370
Don't just tell me to
build a Death Star.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.990
Give me the blueprints,
and then I'll

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:29.710
build you a Death Star, right?

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.830
Otherwise you get
1,000 suggestions

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.770
like this and no more hours
in the day in which to do it.

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.220
But if you give
me the blueprints,

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.065
I'm much more likely-- and a
budget-- I'm much more likely--

00:42:40.065 --> 00:42:40.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.982
--and the money,
then I'm much more

00:42:42.982 --> 00:42:44.440
likely to build
you the Death Star.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.490
So I'm being half facetious.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.910
So let me-- I know you
want to-- there's rebuttal

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.190
coming in the back.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.820
But let me see if there's
any more new commenters

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.274
or questions before we--

00:42:54.274 --> 00:42:55.690
AUDIENCE: Well, I
have a question.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.689
BETH NOVECK: --I let him
have at me in a second.

00:42:57.689 --> 00:42:58.990
Because--

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.710
AUDIENCE: Big companies and big
charities are, by the nature,

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.670
international.

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:07.515
Governments and their users'
data, their citizens' data

00:43:07.515 --> 00:43:08.700
have borders.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.520
What's being done to bridge
the gap, and what can be done?

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.900
BETH NOVECK: So I think--
so favorite example here,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.750
I was trying to
remember the name.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:21.140
So it's a little town
in Texas, Manor, Texas.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.800
It's a suburb of-- when I tell
you it's a suburb of Austin,

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.890
it sounds less glamor--
less cowboy like.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.910
But just take my word for it.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.670
This is a very
small town in Texas.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.410
I've been there.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:34.030
It has about 5,000
people who live there.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:37.180
5,000 people-- that's not
a lot of room for creating

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.350
a public service, right?

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:41.700
So you had the guy who
became the deputy mayor.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.320
He was about 24 years old.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.380
He was also the CFO.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.980
He was also this, and also
that, and also the other thing.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.720
And he had some computer
savvy, whether it was

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.830
formal training or otherwise.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.880
And so he had the good idea
that the best way to tackle

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.360
Manor's challenges, of which
there were many in a small town

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.020
with a high rate
of joblessness, was

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:06.130
to use a challenge platform
to look for good ideas

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.200
to solve particular problems.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.160
And knowing that prizes often
create an incentive for people

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.980
to participate,
prizes were things

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.280
like if you solved problem
x in the school system,

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.107
you would win a cowboy hat.

00:44:20.107 --> 00:44:21.690
If you dealt with
problem y, you would

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.940
get to ride along with
the Sheriff for a day--

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.180
and other things like that.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.750
What happens?

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.242
He starts getting great
ideas for how to govern

00:44:29.242 --> 00:44:30.200
better and differently.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.741
But the ideas are
coming from Europe.

00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:33.060
They're coming from China.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.630
They're not coming from Texas.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.300
And quite literally,
he said to me--

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.680
and I think we published
this somewhere-- the hardest

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.172
problem I had was how to
mail a cowboy hat to Beijing.

00:44:42.172 --> 00:44:44.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.770
So I think you hit on
a very important point

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.620
that I had wanted to mention--
is that ultimately when

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:54.450
we start to recognize and
take seriously the distributed

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.860
expertise that we have and
to look at ways that we can

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.640
connect it better to
how institutions work,

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.130
we quickly realized that
citizens, number one,

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.040
are smart.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.720
They can do more than just
vote once every year or once

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.580
every four years-- and
also that citizenship

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.190
is not geographic, right?

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.890
It does not need to be
limited to where you live.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.760
If in fact your
expertise, your passion,

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.850
your know-how may be
around climate change,

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.090
or maybe it's around
dementia, the idea

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:31.000
that you might become part
of a global network of people

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.750
working on the
problem of dementia,

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:37.270
or diabetes, or climate change--
we can create the mechanisms

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.620
that I think allow us
to channel expertise

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.760
wherever it may belong
and wherever the need is.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.940
So just to give you another
analogous example, talking

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.980
to the doctor today
about the 100 page PDFs.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.740
I said, so what
happens when you get

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:55.570
that 100 page PDF with
all the data about stroke

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.530
across UK hospitals,
and you have

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:00.380
to turn that into a
set of recommendations

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.290
for what a hospital
should do differently?

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.660
I said, who writes
those recommendations?

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.790
He said, well, the
people who do the audit

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:12.040
of the data about stroke
in different hospitals.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.820
I said, well, you know, if
this about how to better use

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:16.920
medical technology.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.510
Or better conduct
an intake process,

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.820
or do something in
a hospital, do you

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.670
talk to people who
are in industry?

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.130
Do you talk to people who
do organizational behavior?

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.810
Do you talk to
computer scientists?

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:31.400
Do you talk to social and
behavioral psychologists,

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.040
who know things about nudges
and priming behavior, who

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.280
may have creative ideas for how
to solve the same challenges

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.540
better and differently?

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.840
Not to say that doctors
don't have really good ideas,

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.010
but they don't have
the only ideas.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:46.020
And sometimes the best
solutions to a problem

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.370
come from very unlikely places.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:52.090
So anyway, you've given
me a-- you've opened up--

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.220
you've let me drive a truck
through the hole you've

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:58.510
given me here in terms of my
answer to say that yes, this

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.520
takes the geography
out of citizenship

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.210
and allows us to
think more globally

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:04.320
about where we can
contribute our expertise

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.980
that it's most needed.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.670
So apologies.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.460
OK, see, I delayed
as long as possible.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.480
But now you're back.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.120
I'm afraid.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:12.810
AUDIENCE: Rebuttal is boring.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.476
This is a completely
different question.

00:47:14.476 --> 00:47:15.550
[SIGH]

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.720
Are you concerned about the
question of incentivization?

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.850
So you talked about
prizes, for example--

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.180
BETH NOVECK: I'm sorry,
did you say centralization?

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:22.770
AUDIENCE: Incentivization.

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:23.870
BETH NOVECK: Oh,
incentivization.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.230
AUDIENCE: So you talked
about prizes, for example.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.510
BETH NOVECK: Yes.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:26.620
AUDIENCE: That's one example.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.286
But it does sound
like you want a higher

00:47:28.286 --> 00:47:31.360
quality of contribution
than we've seen in the past.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.190
And that's going to
take more effort.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.870
Are you worried about who
will have the spare energy

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:37.910
or will have other motivations?

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:40.546
Are you concerned about how you
avoid capture by the lobbyist?

00:47:40.546 --> 00:47:42.920
Or do you think there's so
much free expertise out there,

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.836
because there's so much
unemployment-- I mean,

00:47:44.836 --> 00:47:47.872
so much spare time that
this won't be an issue?

00:47:47.872 --> 00:47:50.480
AUDIENCE: Uh, so I'm
going to ask you back

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.550
about 20% time, the demise
of 20% time in a moment.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.113
So be forewarned.

00:47:56.113 --> 00:48:01.680
So first of all, you know,
this is-- the incentives

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.060
for engagement.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.370
When we did the Peer to Patent
project-- Peer to Pay-tent,

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.120
as you would say--
and we asked people

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.404
why they were
participating-- so,

00:48:12.404 --> 00:48:13.570
you know, this is anecdotal.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.490
Because you're asking
people to self-report.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:18.580
There are the people
who participated

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.380
in debunking a Microsoft
patent application because they

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.590
were open source.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.000
Those were the days when
Microsoft was Microsoft.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.290
Remember those days?

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:29.037
And so you hated Microsoft.

00:48:29.037 --> 00:48:30.120
You were Richard Stallman.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.080
You hated Microsoft.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.330
You were open source fan.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.550
So they would just
pile on anything

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.420
that said Microsoft on it.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.530
So that was one
motivation-- hatred.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.720
Competition,
another motivation--

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.570
you worked for IBM.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:50.740
IBM told its employees, you can
on company time participate.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.590
Because we want you to go and
pile on Microsoft's patent's

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.050
applications-- perfectly fine.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:00.580
People did it though because
of professional distinction,

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.590
so the ability to
put on their resume

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:05.440
that they had participated
in examining patents.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.570
And we gave them badges.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:12.059
We said, if you contributed
prior art that helped a patent

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:13.850
examiner to make a
decision about a patent,

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.910
we gave you an award
called the Prior Artiste

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.280
Award and a t-shirt.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.800
People will do a
lot for a t-shirt.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.157
So people-- but right?

00:49:24.157 --> 00:49:25.364
It's 10 minutes of your time.

00:49:25.364 --> 00:49:26.420
It's 15 minutes for you.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.587
It's a lot of time
for somebody else.

00:49:28.587 --> 00:49:30.170
But it was a
professional recognition.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.139
Why does Stack Exchange work?

00:49:32.139 --> 00:49:33.680
I mean, why does
Stack Exchange work?

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.320
What do you get
on Stack Exchange?

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.070
AUDIENCE: So your
argument is empirically,

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.472
there is a sweet spot.

00:49:39.472 --> 00:49:40.930
You're saying,
empirically, there's

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.596
a sweet spot where you get quite
a lot of bang on the government

00:49:43.596 --> 00:49:49.680
side and the motivations to the
citizens are cheap as chips.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.430
BETH NOVECK: Yeah.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.170
I won't say that
on video, but yes.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.957
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.540
They're going to put
this on-- they're

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.956
going to put this
on YouTube, man.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.070
And then I'll get bleeped out.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.800
Yes, because there's-- so
there's a lot of that spare,

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.620
you know, cognitive surplus, as
Clay Shirky likes to call it.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.530
But also, in some
cases, the prizes

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:12.030
are monetary and financial.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:16.360
So challenge.gov has
really solid cash prizes.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.220
And, you know,
Nesta here in the UK

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:22.539
has sponsored the
anti-microbial resistance prize.

00:50:22.539 --> 00:50:24.580
I think that's 1 million
pounds, or at least it's

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.190
a very large amount of money.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.850
Google XPRIZE, right?

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:29.890
There's big dollars
involved sometimes

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:31.340
and some kinds of engagement.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.630
But sometimes the level of
participation is very small.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.490
Or the ability,
particularly for a person

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:39.050
at the start of their
career, a junior person,

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.070
a PhD, a post-doc, somebody who
has a lot of depth of knowledge

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:44.340
because they're very
immersed in a field,

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:48.690
and could really use the
kind of certification,

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:54.285
or the reward, or the
glory and helps them

00:50:54.285 --> 00:50:55.785
with their professional
advancement.

00:50:55.785 --> 00:50:57.210
Do you know how
many resumes I get

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:59.700
from people who write-- who
have their wiki Wikipedia

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:04.640
entries on their resumes, right,
as an indicator of service--

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.060
who put their Stack
Exchange score, right?

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.886
It allows you to
get a better job.

00:51:08.886 --> 00:51:10.010
So there's lots of reasons.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:11.690
And it also is social.

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:16.430
And why do people do GoodSAM
or do PulsePoint, right?

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.170
To save a life.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.670
You don't do it
because you're going

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.310
to charge the person after
you use the defibrillator.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.150
So that's a kind of
spare cycle that allows

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.410
you to do well by doing good.

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.560
And there's a lot of
that to go around.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.600
But I don't mean to
suggest, in conclusion,

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.950
that these are all voluntaristic
opportunities, right?

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:36.260
It's also about changing how
we fund grants, and contracts,

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.420
and create more paid
opportunities for people

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.260
to engage as well.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.150
So that's another piece of it.

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.570
But the incentives
are a spectrum.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.689
AUDIENCE: What if
IBM were big tobacco?

00:51:47.689 --> 00:51:48.980
That's a really nasty question.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.610
I think you've sold me
on the low hanging fruit.

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:50.900
BETH NOVECK: What if--

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.160
AUDIENCE: But what if IBM
were big tobacco saying,

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.350
go and participate and help
derail the consultation?

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:56.810
BETH NOVECK: Their stock
prices are in a common place

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:57.690
right now, I think.

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:00.890
But we explain, what if
IBM were big tobacco?

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:01.890
Yes?

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.290
AUDIENCE: Well, you were
saying IBM was happy for people

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.650
to take company time,
employees to take company

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:08.450
time to attack Microsoft.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.170
What if the example
were big tobacco saying

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.470
that they were happy
to incentivize people

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:16.340
to participate in a health
consultation or a public policy

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.040
consultation?

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.580
BETH NOVECK: So this gets
back to where design matters.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:24.340
So what we did not do in that
particular process was we

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.880
did not ask people how
they felt about the patent.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.349
If I asked you how you felt
about a Microsoft patent,

00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:32.390
you would have told me
what you thought about it.

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:34.950
And it would have not been--
we couldn't put that on YouTube

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.330
either.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.170
What we had asked were
a highly structured set

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:43.600
of questions in which we said,
tell us exactly-- point us

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.930
exactly to the bibliographic
reference, chapter

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.610
and verse in the
scientific literature,

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.600
or in a piece of code.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:56.050
And point us then to
the exact provision

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:58.720
in the patent application
to which this applies.

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.829
And show us why
this is relevant.

00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:02.370
That sounds more
onerous than it was.

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:04.800
But we essentially just
had a structured form

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.920
that said, give us a
bibliographic reference.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.210
It has to be between
this date and this date.

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:11.050
And tell us why it's
relevant to the patent.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:11.830
And it's open.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.430
And other people can
rate your submission.

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:16.980
It prevents a lot-- we
spent a fortune of money

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:20.960
on trying to prepare
for abuse and gaming.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.414
And we had zero.

00:53:22.414 --> 00:53:24.080
We had zero, because
of the transparency

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.480
and because of the structure.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.490
It scared away a lot of people.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:29.870
We didn't have millions
of people participating.

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:30.950
But we didn't need them.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:32.910
What we needed were
five or 10 people

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:35.210
who knew, and had the
relevant information,

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:37.300
and could type it into a box.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.097
So that's a very
specific example.

00:53:39.097 --> 00:53:41.180
And patents, in that sense,
are low hanging fruit.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.430
Because it's a very
structured process with a very

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:45.620
defined kind of
informational request.

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.010
But there are a lot of
places and opportunities

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:49.840
where government is
trying to figure out,

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.700
if they're going to
build the Death Star,

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.769
they need to know which
part to use for this

00:53:54.769 --> 00:53:56.310
and which technology
to use for that.

00:53:56.310 --> 00:54:00.260
I'm going to milk this
metaphor till it's dead.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.730
It's not a good one.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.940
But if I'm trying to
come up with 10-- so

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.000
if I have a data set on the
instance of hip fracture

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.320
in UK hospitals and
I want to turn that

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.080
into 10 recommendations
for how to avoid that,

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.630
I can ask you a set of three or
four questions that guide you

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.710
as to how I want to
hear back from you,

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:20.030
what the information is
that I want to get from you.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.170
And therefore, I will
hopefully avoid your

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:25.400
telling me how you feel
about hip fractures, which

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.040
is useless.

00:54:31.485 --> 00:54:33.110
So we can't end on
the note of useless.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:36.230
So now I'm going to ask you
back a question before we close,

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:41.121
which is about 20%
time. [CHUCKLE] So

00:54:41.121 --> 00:54:43.200
what's the current stance?

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.330
And what is the ability--
I'm just curious in terms

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:49.260
of people's voluntaristic, or
civic, or other engagement,

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.930
what that sort of looks
like for people in the room?

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:53.030
How engaged are you?

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:57.190
And what do you think Google
should do more of-- we

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:02.440
can turn off the microphone--
that would enable more

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.550
kinds of public engagement?

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:07.500
And I don't mean just
directly with institutions

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.040
of government, but
also in civic context,

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.870
anything that has
to do with solving

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:14.180
a public problem or a problem
in the public interest.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.820
Am I allowed to
ask you a question?

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.000
All right, yeah.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.420
You have the mic.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.920
[CHUCKLE]

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.660
AUDIENCE: How many actually
have 20% projects about that?

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.784
BETH NOVECK: Say it again?

00:55:28.784 --> 00:55:31.160
AUDIENCE: How many people
actually have 20% [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.310
BETH NOVECK: Well, so I'm just
curious, in the first place,

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:34.950
about whether you still
have 20% projects?

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.280
I thought they were
sort of phasing out.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.860
How many people
have 20% projects?

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.449
OK.

00:55:41.449 --> 00:55:43.325
AUDIENCE: Or 120% projects now.

00:55:43.325 --> 00:55:45.576
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:45.576 --> 00:55:46.950
BETH NOVECK: I
see, I see, I see.

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:48.727
OK, all right.

00:55:48.727 --> 00:55:50.310
I'm asking the
question the wrong way.

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.435
So do we want to know from
the people who have them

00:55:52.435 --> 00:55:54.040
or the people who
don't have them?

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.360
Let's start just with somebody
who has a 120% percent project.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.770
Just tell us for a
minute what it is

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:05.250
and what can be done better to
enable that kind of engagement.

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:07.580
Is anybody doing a kind
of public interest project

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:12.920
in their spare time,
I guess we'd call it?

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.420
Please.

00:56:17.596 --> 00:56:19.780
AUDIENCE: I help in
educational program--

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.530
BETH NOVECK: Yeah.

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.113
AUDIENCE: --for
Polish teenagers girls

00:56:22.113 --> 00:56:25.060
to encourage them to have an
interest in computer science.

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.090
Because apparently
in Poland, it's

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:31.030
a very male dominated field.

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.552
BETH NOVECK: [LAUGHTER]
Not only Poland, I think.

00:56:33.552 --> 00:56:34.051
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:34.051 --> 00:56:35.640
AUDIENCE: Actually, there
are countries where it's not,

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.010
or it's kind of equal.

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:38.843
BETH NOVECK: And so
what are you do-- what's

00:56:38.843 --> 00:56:40.590
your-- what are you doing?

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:43.761
AUDIENCE: We basically try to--
we try to teach them coding.

00:56:43.761 --> 00:56:46.260
BETH NOVECK: Oh, you're actually
doing teaching in training.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.430
OK.

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:50.280
AUDIENCE: Kind of try to
show them that it can be fun.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:50.910
It can be easy.

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:52.400
It can be doable by them.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.560
Because there was a research.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.620
There were a pilot
program last year.

00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.780
And it shows actually the lack
of confidence in their skills.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.429
So actually, we try
to improve on that.

00:57:01.429 --> 00:57:03.470
BETH NOVECK: To boost
people's confidence-- well,

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.080
the President of the
United States last week

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.205
announced, you may have
heard, the computer science

00:57:07.205 --> 00:57:10.290
for all, that every high school
student in the United States

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:12.260
is going to learn
computer science.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.290
That's not going to happen--
British Columbia also announced

00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:16.350
it the week before.

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:19.930
And I'm sure other places have
done so or are following suit.

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.220
That's not going to happen
out of the White House.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:25.260
It's going to happen because
of you doing this and more

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.480
people doing this.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.370
Without a much broader
distributed network

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:32.332
of people helping people,
we'll never achieve that goal.

00:57:32.332 --> 00:57:33.540
So it's a really interesting.

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.140
It's a really, I
think, great example.

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:38.640
And can you-- do you want more
of these people to help you?

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.767
Or do you have to speak Polish?

00:57:40.767 --> 00:57:42.350
AUDIENCE: I think
this is one limiting

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:45.880
thing, and to young people.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.430
So they usually don't
speak English that well.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:51.080
So it's limited for the
Polish speakers mostly.

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.420
BETH NOVECK: And so do you
have the ability to query--

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.322
can you go to Google
HR and say, give me

00:57:55.322 --> 00:57:57.030
a list of all the
people who speak Polish

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.920
so I can ask them to help?

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.260
AUDIENCE: There is a group here.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.270
And it was like open
question, whatever

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:03.860
you would participate in it.

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.240
They were just minor things.

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.750
And I volunteered.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.047
Because that's not my idea.

00:58:08.047 --> 00:58:08.880
It was someone else.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.421
BETH NOVECK: That
was someone else's.

00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:12.480
So was that self-selection,
post the project

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:16.260
and allow people to self-select,
which the right channels, works

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:16.830
very well.

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:20.200
And just from one person before
we close who is not-- Will,

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.670
are you doing a
20-- 120% project?

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:26.680
Well, this is one,
hosting me here.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.620
But why not?

00:58:31.532 --> 00:58:32.990
Or because you have
done your time?

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.270
AUDIENCE: Well,
there's a few things

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:39.000
that have to be in place.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.330
You have to have
the time to do it.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:41.560
You have to have
the time that you

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.790
can commit in the
appropriate way to do it.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.920
You have to the idea.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.680
You have to have the
people that do it with.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.572
I was working on one before.

00:58:48.572 --> 00:58:50.530
But at the moment, I'm
not working on anything.

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:52.620
And what I was working on before
was just an internal tool, so--

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.656
BETH NOVECK: It was
an internal tool.

00:58:54.656 --> 00:58:56.280
And is there something
that the company

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.510
could do more or differently
that would change your--

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:01.350
that would change this?

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:02.890
Or just an idea
has to come along.

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:03.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah, 20%
project or something

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:05.530
which are very
definitely on the side,

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:09.460
I think-- and for most
people, it would--

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.440
your focus is on
your primary duties.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.380
If there was a specific
message from the company

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.170
that they wanted you
to do 20% projects,

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:21.774
if your performance reviews
included a strong aspect

00:59:21.774 --> 00:59:23.190
of your 20% project,
for instance,

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:25.915
then I guess that would
encourage people to do it.

00:59:25.915 --> 00:59:29.850
Otherwise, you're
incentivize to do your job

00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:31.600
rather than do
your 20% projects.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.580
BETH NOVECK: So I think that's
probably a good note to end on.

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.390
And it gets back to the
question about incentives

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:37.410
and the questions about what
companies can do more of.

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:39.860
And it's not just companies,
but also universities, right?

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.900
Because even for academics,
who you would think

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.990
would be sort of more
public-minded and what

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:47.160
not, they are evaluated
and reviewed every year.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.160
And right, and their
budgets are contingent

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.620
upon your publications
and your teaching.

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.670
But public service is
not a part of that.

00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:56.420
And it isn't typically
for most companies

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.940
the ways in which
people are measured.

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.340
So I think there is
an opportunity here,

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.170
not for imitation of
the private sector

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:06.840
by the public sector
or vice versa,

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.330
but rather for much greater
collaboration around sharing

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:12.940
data, around sharing know-how,
around sharing technology,

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.260
and ultimately about
sharing a common motivation

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.680
to commit to public service.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.260
So sign up for GoodSAM.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.920
Sign up for PulsePoint.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.830
Save a life.

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:24.430
And thank you for having me.

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:27.780
[APPLAUSE]
