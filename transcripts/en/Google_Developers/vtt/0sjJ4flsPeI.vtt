TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.040
and welcome to another
episode of "The Developer

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.829
Show," a special, on the ground
at Google I/O 2016 edition.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.120
In this episode, we're going
to talk about Android Pay.

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:23.050
All right, Hana.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.665
Tell me about Android Pay.

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:26.920
HANA CHANG: Android Pay
is a really easy way

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.990
to use your phone to
actually pay for things.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.110
You don't need cash.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.060
You don't need to fumble around
in your purse for your wallet.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.185
All you need is your phone.

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:34.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
like the simplicity

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.870
of Android Pay, just sort
of reducing complexity

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.600
throughout my day,
something I really enjoy.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.837
And all I have to
do is tap my phone.

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:41.030
HANA CHANG: Easy as that.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
at Google I/O 2016,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.860
we had some announcements
around Android Pay.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.590
What were they?

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.140
HANA CHANG: We had a couple
of really great announcements.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.220
One of them is that
Android Pay is an easy way

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.060
to pay in InstaMaps, which is
also a product we announced

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.924
at Google I/O. We are also
doing a partnership with Bank

00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.090
of America, where you don't
actually need your debit

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.150
card to get cash out.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.160
You can simply tap your phone
and it acts as your debit card.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.550
The other thing is that
we're bringing easy payments

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.090
to the web.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.640
So right now, it's only
an in-app experience.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.050
We actually want that
to be everywhere,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.100
so we have a new
product payment request

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.684
where Android Pay will be an
easy way to pay on the web.

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:16.975
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:20.000
HANA CHANG: We're also live in
our first international market,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.900
which you hear cheers
around the world, in the UK.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.740
So you can now use Android Pay
to pay in places like Starbucks

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.784
and also riding the Tube, which
is different from the subway.

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:30.732
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:31.206
HANA CHANG: Which I've learned.

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:32.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I've heard.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.420
Well, should we use
this opportunity

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.254
as an excuse to get
some schwag from I/O?

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:37.045
HANA CHANG: Always.

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:39.585
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's do it.

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:40.930
Can we have these two shirts?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.406
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.592
There we go.

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:49.237
That was great.

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:49.945
HANA CHANG: Easy.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:51.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.869
So here's our cool shirts.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.410
Thank you for showing
me Android Pay.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.970
HANA CHANG: Anytime.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
See you next time.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.560
