00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
This is a bit different for a Sixty Symbols video in that

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.140
actually it's a sort of meta-video

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.980
in that is not actually about science, it's
about sixty symbols itself and the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.849
exciting news is that there is the
opportunity for somebody new to get

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.170
involved in the whole project

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.199
somebody to come and join the team start
making some of the videos start doing

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.980
some science

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.949
the whole point of this series is that
they're kind of bits of science being

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.529
described by scientists and so we do
want somebody who is a professional

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.859
scientist getting involved in this but
what's a bit different about it is that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.830
you'll notice most of the people doing
the videos are getting on a bit these

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.460
days we've been doing them for a while
and so what's exciting about this is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.610
we're gonna get somebody at a much
earlier stage in a scientific career

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.329
involved in the whole project so that
not only can they talk about the science

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.480
but obviously one of the questions we
get asked quite a lot of the time is you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.629
know what's it like to be starting out
of the career in science for us that was

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.950
all a fair while ago

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.590
so having somebody who's actually going
to that process now could talk about

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.649
what it's like to be starting in a
career in science as well as talking

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.980
about the science itself is part of what
we're trying to do so it's called the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.410
sixty symbols ogden fellowship is what
we've managed to create and there are

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.340
different parts of that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.220
so let's start at the back end
fellowship basically means this is a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.430
postdoctoral researcher who can do
whatever they like

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.729
so kind of the distinction between just the general postdoc and a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.299
fellow is that fellows really dictate
their own research programs so we want somebody

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.659
to come in who's going exciting ideas
about what science they want to be doing

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.970
anywhere within physics or astronomy

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.880
this is a real research position you
know it's going to be to get two-thirds

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.820
of the time doing research one third of
the time maybe doing outreach-type

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.869
things but it's fundamentally a proper
research position and very exciting

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.079
opportunity because as i say the
person is coming in really will get to

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.950
to define what their research program is
so that's the fellowship bit the bit in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.220
the middle ... uh well the bit at the beginning
is sixty symbols that's the easy bit

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
the bit in the middle the ogden bit is
because obviously this takes money and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.479
we've been looking around trying to find
somebody to support this idea and the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.350
ogden trust which is a charitable trust
that kind of promotes physics in the UK

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.549
has agreed to fund partly fund the
position

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.210
so part of the job will actually be
supporting the kind of the ogden trust's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.740
agenda of getting out in the community
talking about physics encouraging groups

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.649
of people who don't typically go into
scientific careers to go into scientific

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.220
careers

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.789
what are they going to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.239
have to do with sixty symbols or do we
well I guess I have some say in that too

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.319
you'd probably get to say about that i mean my
initial idea was really that they just

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.349
they fit in with the team so they start
making the kind of videos that we make

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.590
generally obviously they'll bring their
own particular interest so hopefully

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.159
some new areas of physics that we
haven't been covering but also to talk

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.400
more generally about what they're up to
what it's like to be doing the job that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.909
they're doing you know when they start
applying for their own funding and those

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.730
kinds of things they can talk about all
that just talking about things from that

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.849
early career perspective that the rest
of us don't really have a little feature

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.760
in the videos and you know if they have
particular skills they want to bring to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.760
bear that we don't currently use then
that would be fine too

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.180
so it is a postdoctoral position which
means that one of the requirements of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.129
the post is you have to have a PhD

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.299
that's that's really it though and so
we're looking for somebody who's

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.689
probably just at the point of completing
a PhD now or completed it within the

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.950
last year or so who's looking for their
first sort of serious research position

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.799
I want an astronomer but that's just because I'm an
astronomer and if you talk to Phil

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.299
Moriarty he wants a you know

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.139
a nice nanotechnologist so I'm sure
we all have our own idea as to exactly the

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.459
right person for the job is but there
is no there is no there is no set person

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.000
though is there?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.729
there is no real... no there's no
agenda no hidden agenda here we haven't

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.909
got somebody lined up already it's a
completely open competition when we are

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.970
appointing postdoctoral researchers the
main thing we look at is you know their

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.639
CV and publication list and all those
kinds of things are going to ask for all

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.900
those those things but obviously this is
a bit different and so the other thing

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.019
we're asking people to do is to make a
video themselves

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:39.180
no more than two minutes duration just
explaining some piece of science they do

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.930
not really not necessarily in the style
of sixty symbols but kind of at the level

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.870
of sixty symbols so just to kind of
demonstrate they have that ability to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.470
explain what they're doing in the kind
of way that we explain things

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.409
and the other thing to stress about that
is when we come to kind of assess those

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.400
videos

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.909
we're not going to look at the technical
quality of your... you know assuming the

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.760
video is viewable and the sounds audible
and those kinds of things we really not

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.189
going to be critiquing them because you
know we have an entirely adequate

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.880
cameraman [laughing] so

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.510
was that you said? [laughing] the position is funded
the two years so it's a two-year

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.260
position

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.710
obviously we're hoping that it will be a
huge success and everyone will be falling all

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.590
over themselves to continue funding it
but it will be guaranteed for two years

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.200
at least you know a lot of reasons why
we're excited about this it's a new

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.020
thing with pushing the project in new
directions

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.170
it's an opportunity to do some new
science and I guess what's most exciting

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.710
about that is it's an opportunity to do
new science that wouldn't have happened

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.710
at all if it wasn't for sixty symbols so
actually the science that comes out of

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.410
this is science that wouldn't have been
done if it weren't for the sixty symbols

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.520
videos

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.520
so which i think is really quite
exciting aspect of the whole thing

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
yeah me too

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.270
vastly restrict the amount of light
coming in to isolate exactly the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.130
wavelengths that we want

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.410
so it turns our wide filter into a
filter with a width of just a nanometer

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.870
or so and it's tunable so it's got two
little plates inside a reflecting

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.680
material
