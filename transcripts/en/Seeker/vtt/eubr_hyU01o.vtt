00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.370
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you're
a smoker who's been trying to quit, then boy

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.230
do we have good news for you!

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.040
I mean, relatively.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.700
Anyone who's participated in DARE, or read
a scientific article, or been alive on planet

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.420
earth for more than a second, knows that cigarettes
are bad for you.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.221
On average, smokers die 14 years before non-smokers,
and half of the smokers who don't quit, are

00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.820
eventually killed by their habit.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.940
So clearly, they're terrible.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.120
But, you may be wondering, what happens after
I DO quit?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.660
Can the effects of smoking be reversed, and
how long would it take for that to happen?

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.650
Before we answer that, let's examine the 2
major ways that cigarettes affect your lungs.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.470
The first thing they do, is destroy cilia,
which are tiny little hairs that live in the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.850
mucus lining of your lungs.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.540
When you inhale pathogens or dirt, they get
trapped in that mucus, and the cilia is what

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.880
pushes them back out.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.670
When you smoke cigarettes, the poisons in
them paralyze and destroy those cilia, making

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.860
it harder for you to avoid infections.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.890
BUT, within just a few days of quitting cigarettes,
those cilia will start to regenerate.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.780
And they'll continue to get better - until
eventually, your lungs return to their original

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.050
functioning capacity.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.210
So that part - you absolutely can reverse.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.150
Studies have shown that people who quit smoking
- and stay that way - reduce their risk of

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.780
lung cancer to that of a person who has never
smoked, within 10-15 years.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.310
However - there is caveat.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.340
Cigarettes can permanently damage your lungs'
alveoli, which are the tiny little air sacs

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.760
that absorb oxygen into your bloodstream,
and release carbon dioxide.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.750
People who have been smoking heavily, or for
a very long time, are at much greater risk

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.620
for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.300
That includes chronic bronchitis, which is
a potentially reversible inflammation of the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.830
airways, and emphysema - which destroys your
alveoli, making it difficult for your lungs

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.990
to absorb the oxygen they need.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.149
Unlike cilia, alveoli cannot regrow themselves,
so emphysema is a permanent - and devastating

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.149
- disease.

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.080
Even so, the effects of quitting smoking - begin
the day you stop.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.720
Within a month, you'll feel like you can breath
significantly better than before - and within

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.930
a year, your risk of having a heart attack
is reduced by 50%.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.140
According to the American Cancer Society,
smokers who quit before age 35 prevent 90%

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.640
of the risk of health problems from smoking.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.150
And a smoker who quits before age 50 halves
their risk of dying within the next 15 years.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.440
Norman Edelman is the chief medical officer
of the American Lung Association, and he says

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.750
that a smoker's risk for developing smoking-related
diseases, is directly correlated to the total

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.990
number of cigarettes they've smoked in their
lifetime.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.590
The metric they use, is called "pack years"
- and it's the average number of packs a person

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.620
smokes, per day - multiplied by the number
of years they've been smoking.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.870
The greater your pack-years, the greater your
risk.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.041
And according to Edelman, people who have
50 pack-years or more under their belt, even

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:57.260
if they quit - will never completely reduce
their risk of lung cancer back to that of

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.260
a non-smoker.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.840
Of course, genetics also play a huge role
in how cigarettes affect you.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.100
Up until a few months ago, my dad smoked 2
packs a day for 55 years - and never once

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.739
experienced any adverse breathings effects.

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.390
But on the flip side, there are people in
their 20s, who smoked for 2 years and died

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.480
of emphysema.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.340
So it really is different for everybody.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.790
Also, dad - I'm really proud of you for quitting.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.370
Enough about me though, what do you guys think?

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.390
Are you a smoker who's been trying to quit?

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.910
Or are you not convinced that the effects
can be reversed?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.590
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below, and as always - thank you guys for

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.910
watching.
