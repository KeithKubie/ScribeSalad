1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,390
The Joe Rogan experience.
Are you,

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:07,230
you're aware of a Elon Musk's
neuro link chair technology?

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,770
How much do you know about it? I know a
decent amount in my friend Brian Johnson,

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:11,760
he has a company kernel.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,190
There's a few different companies that
are trying to think about these brain

6
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,320
machine interfaces and
what are they trying to do?

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,720
Basically what they're trying to do is
to find a way to connect our brains to

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,500
our machines and there's a little
bit of of progress in our brains are,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,340
they're incredibly complicated and
they're messy. I mean if there,

10
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:31,590
there's a lot that's that,
that that's happening,

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,980
but we are increasingly figuring out how
to connect our brains to our technology

12
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:42,720
and so people are imagining a time
when we can do things like download,

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,370
download memories, download ideas or
Upload Memories and upload that he hasn't,

14
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:52,260
there's some very early science that is
suggesting that this will be possible,

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:56,870
but it's still the very early
days, the very early days. But he,

16
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:01,620
Elon was giving the impression that some
time this year they're going to release

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,750
something. You know, they
may release something,

18
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,480
but it's not going to be something that's
going to change the world because this,

19
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:06,751
this,

20
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:11,751
that technology is way more nascent
than even the genetics technology that,

21
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,400
um,
that I've been talking about.

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,410
So it's not like that there's that it's
it all remotely possible that this year

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,920
you're going to be able to like upload
a full memory or download a full memory.

24
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:25,680
But there, there are little things
that are happening, but every,

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,030
every journey begins with a step.

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,530
But the technology is fairly transparent
is term in terms of like where the

27
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,760
state of the art is right now.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,800
It is in that it's extremely early.
This stuff is real.

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,950
So when you think of like about
systems that we understand,

30
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:44,190
I had mentioned that we, you
know, we understand just a
little bit about genomics.

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,620
Um,
we know less about the brain.

32
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:49,770
The brain is kind of the great
unknown of this universe.

33
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,520
We know more about the oceans than we
know about our brain. I mean, it's just,

34
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:54,180
we know very,
very little.

35
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,630
We understand that if you kind of stick
an electric current in somebody's brain,

36
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,810
like that's going to be, if you kind of
shoot a spike through somebody's head,

37
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:04,870
but really understanding how the brain
functions, we are still in the very,

38
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:05,704
very early days.

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,050
So do you think the Kurzweils off with
this idea that you're going to be able to

40
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:12,180
download your consciousness
into a computer?

41
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,850
Cause that's one of the most controversial
ideas that he's come up with.

42
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:18,850
So I think he's, I think he's off. Um,

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,810
based on your use of the word your,

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,550
so I mentioned that a month ago I was
in Kyoto, uh, and I was at this, um,

45
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,630
at this stem cell lab,

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,470
but I also went to another lab
of a guy named Hiroshi Ishiguro,

47
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:34,830
who's the world's leading
humanoid roboticist.

48
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,300
And so he's the guy who was on the cover
of wired and he's created these robot

49
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:43,770
avatars. And like I had a conversation
with this, this robot woman, Erica.

50
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,700
And it was really interesting cause I
could see that. Like if I would smile,

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,340
she'd smile and lean forward.
And if I had like a, you know,

52
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:51,900
overexaggerated sad face,

53
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,940
she'd like change her expression and
she can have like, you know, basic,

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,380
basic conversations. Wow. But
we're still a long way and so from,

55
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:07,270
from having full robots, but I had
this, uh, fro about human interactions,

56
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,430
but I had this, this debate, um,

57
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,720
with issue guru and he was saying that
he thought that the future of humanity

58
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,000
was nonbiological that we are going
to kind of unload ourselves, um,

59
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,390
to these non biological entities and that
is how we would gain our own mortality.

60
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,910
And [inaudible] I argued
something very different.

61
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,280
I feel like we are biological beings.

62
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,260
I think we'll fully integrate
with our technology,

63
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,680
but if we ever become
entirely nonbiological,

64
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,660
then that's not us either.

65
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,430
We will have committed suicide
as a species or these, um,

66
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,040
robots are there.
That will have killed us because even if,

67
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,840
let's just say that I could download
my entire consciousness to some kind of

68
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,730
robot unless it's say that was possible,

69
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,150
that robot would be me for that first
exact moment when the transfer happened.

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,950
But then beyond that,

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,630
they wouldn't be me anymore
because there'll be a whole
other set of, of expense.

72
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,270
But we're,

73
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,800
but certainly our interaction or
connectivity with this tech is going to be

74
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:10,480
greater. And so even if Kurzweil isn't
exactly right, he's directionally right.

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,970
Yeah. The problem would be
that you would be locked in a,

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,330
if they downloaded your
consciousness into some sort of a,

77
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:21,730
a bank of computer somewhere, right. Where
are you if that's your consciousness,

78
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:25,990
your consciousness and these
ones and Zeros. Yeah. We, I mean,

79
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,390
that's terrifying. Terrifying as
some didn't like you. And they said,

80
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,950
I'm going to make one version of you
suffer for all eternity. Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:37,630
And I'm going to just, I don't load
you while you sleep. It's true.

82
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,170
But I have something worse
than that. Okay. Death.

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,940
And so I think that nobody
is going to say, well,

84
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:47,941
I'm going to be Joe living a life or I'm
going to like not be Joe and I'll just

85
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:52,930
have my consciousness downloaded someplace
else. And so if the comparison is,

86
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:56,080
well, I've lived this life
and I don't want to die.

87
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,310
And so I'd rather kind of be
here in some kind of version,

88
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:04,780
and even if it's not me, to
something really, I think
some people will want that.

89
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,750
Not Everybody. Some people will, but they
don't know what they're getting. Right?

90
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,450
Yes. In terms of you don't know what that
experience is going to be like. Yeah.

91
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,510
Nor do you know if there is some sort of
a chemical gateway that happens in the

92
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:20,080
mind when you do expire and allows you
to pass through to the other dimension

93
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:24,550
that you're, your consciousness and your
soul longs to travel to. But no, you've,

94
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,650
I hope, I hope you're right about
that. Am I? If I'm not, yeah,

95
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,710
I've written about this in
my novel. It's like, yeah,

96
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,810
but I think kind of when you're dead,
you're just dead.

97
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:35,220
And the good news for you that though,
well, just because I think that you,

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,750
this kind of immortality because,

99
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,160
because time stops time
is this relative concept.

100
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,890
And so at the moment that you die,

101
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,320
that's immortality for you because
time stops flowing for you. Time is,

102
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,980
that's what Einstein taught us. Time
is this relative concept. Other people,

103
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,840
they're legitimately,
and there's no way to prove it,

104
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:57,410
feel that we have this soul and this soul
can travel to other, other dimensions.

105
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:02,330
I happen to believe that we are biological
beings and our experience of the soul

106
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:06,440
or whatever is connected to our biology.
When our biology stops functioning,

107
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,090
those experiences, whatever they are,
stop being accessible, at least to us.
