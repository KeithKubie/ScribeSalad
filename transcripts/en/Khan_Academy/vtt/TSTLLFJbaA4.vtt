00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
let's think about the market for a
certain type of bush or a certain type

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.019
of tree that people can plant in their
gardens and here's our quantity of that

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.410
tree planted planted each year 1 million
2 million maybe this is nationwide these

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.550
are fairly large numbers for a
particular type of tree 4 million and so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.740
forth and so on and then here let me put
the price so this is the quantity

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.669
quantity per year per year planted
planted in our country and over here

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.850
this is going to be our dollars per tree
dollars per tree and maybe this is ten

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.840
dollars this is 20 this is 30 this is 40
and our marginal cost curve for our

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.559
supply curve would look just to even get
that first tree planted to get someone

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.449
to to plant it and grow it and then
replant it in your garden you're gonna

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.920
have to pay them at least ten dollars
and then each incremental tree is going

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.680
to get a little bit more expensive and
so our marginal cost curve will look

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.530
something like that
that's our marginal cost or supply curve

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
and then our demand curve that very
first tree someone's going to get a huge

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.700
benefit from it and then each
incremental tree people might get a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.729
little bit lower and lower benefit so it
might look something like this our

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.540
demand curve would look like that demand
and this is the market for a certain

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.960
nice tree nice tree and just let the if
you just let the market happen the way

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.280
it's happening right over here we get to
a very natural equilibrium quantity it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.880
looks like it's about 2.7 million trees
planted per year and our equilibrium

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.759
price is about $20 per tree and we
generate we generate all of this total

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.320
surplus that's that split essentially
between the consumers the people who are

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.210
buying the trees and the people who are
producing the trees now let's say that a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.520
research study comes out and this
particular breed of trees the nice tree

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.100
it turns out has all of these benefits
to it so let's say that it's it does it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.599
has you know some it's somehow related
to pest control maybe all the pests that

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.050
people don't like when they eat this
bark they go away or something

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.130
that the mosquitos go away and you know
do you get less disease let's say it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.520
also improves air quality air quality
and let's say on top of that it's just

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.680
it's just nice-looking so you know even
even if it's not your tree you pass it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.890
by in a neighborhood it just calms your
nerves and makes you feel better about

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.960
the world so they are just nice nice to
look at to look at and this study that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.800
these researchers conduct they
determined that the benefit of all of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.760
these things of the pest control and the
air quality and the just the aesthetic

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.950
benefit of society at large comes out
over the life of a tree to ten dollars a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.140
tree so it is ten dollars ten dollars
per tree per tree benefit so the is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.950
essentially saying that above and beyond
the benefit that the owner of the garden

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.060
gets there's a societal there's an
external benefit and so you can imagine

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.110
we're now talking about positive
externalities there's an external

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.540
benefit of planting the tree that
amounts to ten dollars per tree so how

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.950
would we factor that in how do we
determine if just right just given this

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.640
equilibrium price and quantity whether
we we really are we do really have the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.739
optimal number of trees in society well
in the past we in the last few videos we

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.239
had a negative externality we had a
external cost and so we added that cost

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.620
to the cost curve now we have an
external benefit we have a positive

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.620
externality so we can add this this
benefit to the marginal benefit curve so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.400
essentially this is the benefit that the
buyers of the tree are getting and to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.690
that let's add the benefit that society
is getting so society is getting ten

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.500
dollars more benefit so this for
millions a tree or it's actually a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.560
little bit lower looks like it's about
three and a half million three there's

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.100
ten dollars of benefit but if you
combine it with society's benefit so

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.209
another ten dollars you would get up
here and so you would essentially and

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.690
this first tree it looks like it's
almost fifty dollars of benefit but if

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.590
you add society's benefit it's actually
closer to 60 dollars a benefit and so

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.560
you're essentially taking this demand
curve and you're shifting it up by ten

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.110
dollars when you are factoring in the
benefit when you are factoring in the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.370
benefit to society
so that up there and you could call this

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.550
you could call this the marginal benefit
plus the external plus the external

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.470
benefit curve so it's factoring in all
of the the benefit that society is

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.340
getting by these trees planted but when
you look at that curve you get a

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.210
slightly different equilibrium price you
get a slightly different equilibrium

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.190
price the equilibrium price goes all the
way out here so now the equilibrium

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.510
pressure goes up to this the equilibrium
price looks closer instead of $20 at $27

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.630
and the quantity the quantity actually
produced looks closer to 3.3 million and

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.370
so if we just let the market happen
without factoring in this benefit in

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.450
some way we're essentially leaving all
the table leaving on the table all of

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.810
this all of the surplus that could have
happened if we just let the market

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.740
settle in on its on it's natural price
in equilibrium and equilibrium quantity

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.760
equilibrium price and equilibrium
quantity we're going to produce this 2.7

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.990
million and so the total benefit to
society is going to be this whole curve

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.370
right or you can say society's benefit
is going to be this right over here the

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.630
consumers benefit is going to be is
going to be this part right over here

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.010
and then actually this part all the way
over here because our equilibrium prices

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.830
gets right over there and then the
producers surplus is this is that right

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.080
over there but we're leaving some
societal benefit on the table we are

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.720
leaving if you think of it from
society's point of view you can view

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.040
this orange area as a deadweight loss
we're leaving that on the table if we

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.660
don't somehow create an incentive for
more of these trees to be produced and

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.690
so in this situation a way to make the
optimal quantity produce in order for

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.920
society to get this surplus what they
could do is in the case of a negative

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.690
externality we imposed a tax that
factors in the negative externality now

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.780
we could put some type of a subsidy we
could say hey if you plant a tree if if

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.260
someone plants a tree plants a tree buys
and plants one of these trees you will

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.470
get a $10 tax credit $10 tax credit so
it's essentially saying whoever plants

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.470
one of these trees their taxes are going
to be $10

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.190
lower than what they would have
otherwise had paid and so essentially

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.190
they're saying look whatever benefit you
were going to get from the tree we're

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.310
going to give you ten dollars more
benefit for that and so you're

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.940
essentially you're essentially making
sure that the optimal quantity is being

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.500
produced now in that circumstance you're
essentially giving all of the marginal

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.570
benefit that extra $10 benefit you're
giving it you're giving it to the people

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.920
who are planting the trees so
essentially all of this all of this

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.370
becomes their benefit as well because
they are going to get the ten dollars

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.990
but the good thing is at least at least
that positive surplus is getting is

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.820
going to someone it's not being lost
you're not giving up you're not giving

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.850
up on this orange area right over there
