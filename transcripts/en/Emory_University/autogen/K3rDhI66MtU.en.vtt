Third Eye Blind okay closing what's
striking about rhesus monkeys is that

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059
striking about rhesus monkeys is that
 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.180
striking about rhesus monkeys is that
it's not clear to us that the sexual

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190
it's not clear to us that the sexual
 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.979
it's not clear to us that the sexual
relations that occur within rhesus

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989
relations that occur within rhesus
 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.660
relations that occur within rhesus
monkeys are associated with any of the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670
monkeys are associated with any of the
 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.750
monkeys are associated with any of the
kinds of emotions that we actually see

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760
kinds of emotions that we actually see
 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.910
kinds of emotions that we actually see
in humans so in one sense relevant to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920
in humans so in one sense relevant to
 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.979
in humans so in one sense relevant to
the movie you might actually think that

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989
the movie you might actually think that
 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.809
the movie you might actually think that
the sexual relationship in rhesus

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819
the sexual relationship in rhesus
 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:02.750
the sexual relationship in rhesus
monkeys is like friends with benefits

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
monkeys is like friends with benefits
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.030

there's not a long enduring sexual

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040
there's not a long enduring sexual
 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.790
there's not a long enduring sexual
relationship they don't even last from

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800
relationship they don't even last from
 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.890
relationship they don't even last from
year to year

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
year to year
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.680
year to year
they're very brief so what this means is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690
they're very brief so what this means is
 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.330
they're very brief so what this means is
that the social environment can actually

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340
that the social environment can actually
 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.430
that the social environment can actually
have a big impact on whether or not sex

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440
have a big impact on whether or not sex
 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.340
have a big impact on whether or not sex
occurs the context determines very

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350
occurs the context determines very
 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.440
occurs the context determines very
strongly where we have sex and when we

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450
strongly where we have sex and when we
 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.000
strongly where we have sex and when we
have sex and the same is actually true

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010
have sex and the same is actually true
 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.490
have sex and the same is actually true
of rhesus monkeys that if they're in a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500
of rhesus monkeys that if they're in a
 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.430
of rhesus monkeys that if they're in a
situation where there are negative

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440
situation where there are negative
 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.190
situation where there are negative
social cons consequences for engaging in

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200
social cons consequences for engaging in
 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.470
social cons consequences for engaging in
sex then it becomes very limited because

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480
sex then it becomes very limited because
 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.480
sex then it becomes very limited because
of the social structure in the social

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490
of the social structure in the social
 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.660
of the social structure in the social
context females essentially control what

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670
context females essentially control what
 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.000
context females essentially control what
goes on in a rhesus monkey group they

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010
goes on in a rhesus monkey group they
 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.220
goes on in a rhesus monkey group they
outnumber the male's they have tighter

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230
outnumber the male's they have tighter
 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.520
outnumber the male's they have tighter
social bonds female female bonds the end

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530
social bonds female female bonds the end
 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.900
social bonds female female bonds the end
result is that they control pretty much

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910
result is that they control pretty much
 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.550
result is that they control pretty much
everything including sex human culture

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560
everything including sex human culture
 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.969
everything including sex human culture
still is designed at best it's a parody

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979
still is designed at best it's a parody
 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.919
still is designed at best it's a parody
between males and females and I think

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929
between males and females and I think
 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.709
between males and females and I think
the sense is and sort of one of the

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719
the sense is and sort of one of the
 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.529
the sense is and sort of one of the
themes that's in this in this movie

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539
themes that's in this in this movie
 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.809
themes that's in this in this movie
friends-with-benefits is how difficult

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819
friends-with-benefits is how difficult
 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.020
friends-with-benefits is how difficult
it is once humans engage in sex to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030
it is once humans engage in sex to
 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.420
it is once humans engage in sex to
disengage from the intimacy that the sex

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430
disengage from the intimacy that the sex
 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.320
disengage from the intimacy that the sex
produced and so I think rhesus monkeys

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330
produced and so I think rhesus monkeys
 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.300
produced and so I think rhesus monkeys
are perfectly capable of being friends

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
are perfectly capable of being friends
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.949
are perfectly capable of being friends
with benefits there are no long-term

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959
with benefits there are no long-term
 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.220
with benefits there are no long-term
consequences of it I think that in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
consequences of it I think that in
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.460
consequences of it I think that in
humans it's a much more difficult

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470
humans it's a much more difficult
 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.119
humans it's a much more difficult
situation because sex changes everything

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129
situation because sex changes everything
 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.630
situation because sex changes everything
it's not simply just one other physical

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
it's not simply just one other physical
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.170
it's not simply just one other physical
event

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
event
 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.449
event
it actually has emotional consequences I

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459
it actually has emotional consequences I
 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.289
it actually has emotional consequences I
think that a common theme between what

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299
think that a common theme between what
 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.410
think that a common theme between what
we know from rhesus monkeys and what we

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420
we know from rhesus monkeys and what we
 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.220
we know from rhesus monkeys and what we
know from humans is that sex actually is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
know from humans is that sex actually is
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.650
know from humans is that sex actually is
not a behavior that can be taken lightly

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
not a behavior that can be taken lightly
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.780
not a behavior that can be taken lightly
even though rhesus monkeys don't form

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790
even though rhesus monkeys don't form
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.059
even though rhesus monkeys don't form
sexual relationships even though they

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069
sexual relationships even though they
 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.949
sexual relationships even though they
may actually be promiscuous by human

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959
may actually be promiscuous by human
 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.259
may actually be promiscuous by human
standards in terms of their sexual

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269
standards in terms of their sexual
 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.319
standards in terms of their sexual
activity sex is actually still a very

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329
activity sex is actually still a very
 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.000
activity sex is actually still a very
difficult and challenging aspect of the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
difficult and challenging aspect of the
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.509
difficult and challenging aspect of the
social life of rhesus monkeys it

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519
social life of rhesus monkeys it
 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.039
social life of rhesus monkeys it
threatens the social structure it

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049
threatens the social structure it
 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.099
threatens the social structure it
threatens mixing up the social structure

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109
threatens mixing up the social structure
 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.379
threatens mixing up the social structure
and so they've had to develop behavioral

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389
and so they've had to develop behavioral
 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.690
and so they've had to develop behavioral
ways of dealing with sex and I think the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700
ways of dealing with sex and I think the
 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.750
ways of dealing with sex and I think the
same is true of humans the preceding

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
same is true of humans the preceding
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.449
same is true of humans the preceding
