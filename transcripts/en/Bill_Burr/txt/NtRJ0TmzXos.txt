Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 24th, 2017. How's it going? Oh, why are you doing, how's your week? Obs? Sorry, the podcast is a little late. I traveled today. I flew back from Boise, Idaho. Not Boise. Everybody. There's an s in there. That's what I learned when I was up there. Boise, Idaho. And uh, you know, it was hilarious when we, when we landed, we landed it, it um, you know that uh, the fucking shooter, you know on the plane, the shooter, I don't meet with the gun cause you can't get guns in the planes unless you make one like a, what's his face there? John Malcovich and that Clint Eastwood movie. What was it called? Gun. Is that what it's called? He made like that little plastic gun

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       until I get some goddamn respect and he fucking hung up the phone. Um, now this, I'm not talking about a gun. The fucking, the shooter, the guy, the wedge breaker. It's like the second they ring, that Little Bing Bong mean you can take off your seat belts. Some guy from 12 rows back, like runs up to the front of the plane. So of course he stops right on my routes and I can't get up and I'm looking at his dad jeans and he was wearing flip flops. Alright, so I got to give it up to the guy. All right, you don't have to show that kind of quickness with like, you know, a third of a shoe on, was it? It was impressive. So this fucking guy who was in the row behind me diagonally across starts fucking chirping in his ear. It was like the fucking NHL playoffs.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       I'm like, are these guys going to drop the gloves? I see him talking to the guys, see the guy, you know the flip flop guy looking over his shoulder, right? It's basically a guy with really nice shoes and Polka dot socks in first class, which is where I sit. I, that's I, I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck for, I'm flying to Las Vegas. I sit in the front of the fucking plane. That's just how I do it. All right? I spent 20 goddamn years in the back of the planets. What do you call them? Not good, but they just spilled a fucking tee all over the point of they put anything on. What are the odds that I was putting my wallet on the fucking string to the teabag and in this shit's just going to go all over the place. It's just, I swear to God I'm having a hell of a like fucking four days here.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       We got damn thing. It'd be little cunty thing that can go wrong. You know, first I break my computer screen Ed and then the tea bag comes out. I mean, Jesus Christ, that's going to take me at least 11 seconds to clean up or I just kind of wipe it up with my sock. Oh, what a fucking animal. I said stop it from going down the side of the table. Don't judge me. So anyways, let's get back to the Polka dots. Polka dotted socks. All right. Fucking gentlemen worked his way up to the front of the fucking plane. Or maybe he was born into money. I don't know. I don't think this guy was because he was fucking all over this fucking animal with his flip flops. Who was coming up from, you know, the fucking, the section of the plane where this guy deserved a bait.

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       All right, telling you right now, that should be your guys' goal in life. You got to get to the front of the fucking plane and that, that's not a metaphor. That is it. Literally you have to get to the front of the fucking plane. Unless you don't travel that often, then just, you know, suck it up. Who gives a shit? But if you travel at time, you have to get to the front of the fucking plane. And I'm telling you, the only difference between the front of the plane and the back of the plane is they just, they treat you like a human being. That's it. That said, it's not like it used to be where, you know, there was fucking broads up there and you know, they'd meet you in the Eastern Airlines fucking lounge afterwards and they, you know, you have like a fuck it, whatever the fuck happened in the 70s, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Is that incredible meeting of pubes that that decade was. Um, so anyways, this guy is fucking in the guys who like, I, you know, I got my fucking, the free fucking Bose headsets, the wireless ones that those postcards gave me. And then I found out this spying on you if you have the APP, I had to delete the fucking APP, Jesus Christ. And then I found out those guys at blue apron are, I like going down to farmer's markets. They go, hey, you don't want to, you don't want to be with these guys. Come over to us. You know what I mean? But a bunch of pussies, if that's what they're doing, allegedly that's what they were doing. Why don't you fucking go do that and that Goddamn Ralph's do it in a supermarket, right. Stay in your own weight class.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       You colored apron cons. It's fucking hilarious. As Farmers Barker guy was going off on him, it's going blue apron. They eliminate the middleman. He's like, Aww, hello. You are the middleman. You're dumb cunt. We eliminate it. We farmed this shit. We're going right to the people. Um, anyways, I probably just lost the sponsor there, but I don't give a fuck right. If that's what they're doing. If you weren't doing it, I apologize to everybody that uh, you know, wears an apron. The color of my balls right now. Okay. I apologize. Anyways. Um, taste bill. Can he get to the fucking fight? All right. All right. Sorry. I'm a little distracted. I don't like doing this podcast on days that I traveled on my, I'm a little, I'm a little scatterbrained there more so than usual. All right. Before you make a joke, God damn, I knew computer screen is gleaming.

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       I'll tell you. Underrated breaking. You have fucking computer screen. You know, you take it down. You never go to the apple store. Don't ever go to the apple store. The apple store is like flying coach. Okay. You're going to go in there and they're going to treat you like a fucking animal, you know, and they, as they put themselves on a, on a higher plane, walking around genius, right on this shirt. What does your shirt say? Says Nothing. Right? Like you have no fucking thought in your head and you've got to go down there and go talk to those fucking wirey cuts. Um, anyways, no, you've got to just some local fucking place, you know, they charge you a little bit more, but you go in there, okay. And you get treated like a fucking human being. So I go in there and you know, and they see the busted computer screen. They know what the fuck happened, you know, and I'm not going to lie to him like, Ah, you know, uh, I got a little one at home and she knocked it off the table, but you know, doing that shit, I didn't do that. They go, what happened to him? I said, I stabbed it with my phone.

Speaker 3:          00:06:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:27       So they start laughing. They go, why'd you do that? I said, because, uh, eight, I'm an impatient person and I'm not good at these things. And uh, it seemed like the right thing to do in the moment and I immediately regretted it. So now I'm here to give you my money if you can fix this. And they were like, absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       know what's funny is I always have a piece of tape. I have a piece of tape over the fucking camera. So I don't want people watching me fucking jerking off to porn. I don't want, I didn't want to watch people meet, muttering, walking around, talking to myself in the hotel room, trying to come up with new joy. I just don't want people watching me self. That's the first thing I noticed. I was like, wow, this screen is really clean and fucking big brother can see what's going on. You know, I don't mind if they can hear what's going on. I just don't want them to see it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       So anyways, there's this guy, he's got polka dot socks on his fucking, you know, smart pair wingtip shoes on and he's just fun given this Guy Shit. So I take off my Bose headphones, you know, which they probably downloaded the entire argument. Let's fucking spine cuts, right? So I take them off and he's right mid sent to Jay. Just walk right up here. Yeah, hit me with your bag. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? And I can't hear what the other guy's saying, but this other guy, the guy in first class, you'd think he'd say some fucking guy with little soft hands, you know, never worked a day in his life. He's fucking all over this guy to the point, the guy who, who, uh, you know, the flip flop guy just turns his back and doesn't want to say anything. And this guy just keeps going, go. And he goes, what do you do next? You're going to push down a kid, you know, hey, you might want to brush your teeth too. He started giving the guys shift from bad. His breath stunk. I was like, I've five fucking love this guy.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       Fucking loved the guy, just fucking, just the entire time it took them to get the goddamn jetway over. This guy is just in his fucking and his fucking ear and the guy wouldn't drop the gloves, would not drop the gloves during the playoffs. Unbelievable. You know, like he's some star player. Right. And he's gonna, he's gonna. He thought she hurt the team fee fucking sits down the shooter. Man. You don't have wished would happened. I wished he grabbed, I grabbed him by his backpack cause I don't give a shit. If you have, if you fucking have a black belt in every martial art, um, discipline. If you have on a backpack, it's fucking over. Cause all the person has to do once somebody just grabs your backpack and starts running the other way. There's nothing in Jujitsu. There's nothing in a kito. You just, you can't, you know, that's why if you watch the UFC and Joe Rogan will tell you this, that they do not allow backpacks into the octagon for that specific reason.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       You know what I mean? The backpack, it's like the gun as far as like, just, just throws the black belt right out the window. You know what I mean? You know, like all karate movies, like nobody can have a gun cause then it's just kinda like, well yeah I can just shoot yet. You know, it's the coward way up or the CINCI way out. Do you remember that meeting? Oh, you could do it at Cinci. That's what I was a little kid. That was a word that just disappeared, meant easy. I guess it's a cinch became Cinci I just figured that out fucking 48 years later I finally get it. Um, anyways, I just wish I reached up, grabbed his backpack and yanked it back past into the polka dotted sock guy and everybody just passed him right back to his fucking row would have been tremendous. You know, and I know a lot of your young was through this podcast and I could lie to you and say that pre nine 11 that was the America that I, that I lived in, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:10:11       Well No, you know, like you could sit in my house and not have to worry about somebody from the Geek squad watching me fucking rub one out. You know when the privacy male Goddamn home, I have tape over every fucking thing I could find. I they can listen, but the kids, see that's the deal. If there's no video, it's just like the podcast, no fucking video and my living room right now that got, I got, I got my TV, they got little fucking camera up there. Not fucking doing that. I want to look at some fucking pimple faced, do and play a war of the worlds. Whatever these kids do, you know, or the world's waterways with fuck, Warcraft, Minecraft, mind head. What is it called as a video game transcended video gamers to the point that I actually know isn't it wasn't witches of Eastwick. What does that, what does that fucking game that everybody loses that by when it comes out. It's not war craft. Something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       I, it'll come to me. No one or whatever. That's how you just guess. I'd get out of your own stupidity. That's such a great phrase. Ad will come to me. What an, I know that back in the day when I was in math class, you know, what is the sine, cosine and tangent of that fucking iPod news? Uh, Mr Burn. Oh, it's uh, uh, don't tell him though. I, you know, it'll come to me. It'll come to me now my teacher today, fair enough. Then maybe I would've have to go to summer school two out of four years. I should have gone all three. Fuck, I should've got all four years. You know what I mean? My Sophomore teacher let me off the hook and gave me a d minus, and then senior year I was like, well, what's the point? What's the fucking point? What am I getting to a better community?

Speaker 2:          00:11:55       Yeah. It didn't make any fucking difference. You know what I mean? It's like when the fucking outfields play in, in, you know, and then the guy up to the plate, he hits it over the guy's fucking head. He doesn't go get it and she just runs it. That's why I treated some schools my senior year, not fucking doing that shit. What's the point when I can go out and get hammered, drive drunk and do what you did in the 80s just driving around, hammered, hammered. You'd go down to the fucking liquor store. The packy is, we called it ain't go down a package, get me a sex at dote, we'd go down to the package store, right. And you just stand there out front, you know the hands in your pockets looking as conspicuous as possible and then you just fucking walk up to adults and be like, Hey, could you buy me some beer?

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       You know? And there was no fight. There was no cameras back then. It television, it just been invented. I mean, and then nobody knew how to work these things and people would do that. They would actually like not even think about the liability. They would go out and they, you know, you try to judge like get a buyer. That's what it was. You tried to like tried to like pick the right person. Somebody look cool. You know what I mean? Anybody in a suit, you're like, fuck that guy. I'm not asking him. You don't ask a mom, you know, didn't ask any women, you know what I mean? Unless she hoard it up a little bit. You like, you then you gotta make the judgment call. How involved in her life was her father? Uh, I dunno. I Dunno now I'm not doing it though.

Speaker 2:          00:13:21       I'm not doing it. Then you just wait for somebody a little bit of long hair, you know, some fucking shitty little mustache. It looks for a dirtbags basically what you did, someone who would have no concern for people under age driving away with alcohol and um, and that's the way it was done. I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. You know what? As I got these fucking helicopters in my ears, can you hear that? Think they're like hovering right over my house. They have an a big parade right now on a parade or a or something. It's a, the Armenians, the recognizing or remembering everybody who, uh, died in the genocide, you know, you know, I just realized that just really just fucked up my relationship with the Turkish funny bone. I probably won't be getting any weekends out there for well

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       that in Kazakh or stay in wherever the two countries are that try to act like that. We didn't, we never did that. Ah, that never happened. Yeah. Well the rest of the world knows it did. So you could just sit there and deny it all you want, but are you fucking Bernie Madoff? How long are you going to fucking lie about this shit? Um, I actually watched this documentary, speaking of just despicable, horrible things to do to human beings. You know, I don't know anything about Turkish people, but I'll tell you right now, if they will probably scared shitless of Armenia. It's, you know what I mean? The fucking tough people. That's probably what it was. They got all nervous to some shit. I don't know what it was. It's a lot of Armenians in my neighborhood and I swear to God, like every other one of them you look at you like, is that, is that a UFC champion? They fucking jacked the heads of shaped. Every one of them just looks like they could kick the shit out of you. I Dunno, maybe Turkey got nervous. I have no idea what happened. I don't know how you could fucking do that.

Speaker 4:          00:15:19       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:15:20       I don't know. The older I get, the older I get, the more a second. And human behavior becomes not saying I'm some fucking sink, but I still, for the life of me do not understand how war is legal. I just don't, I don't get it.

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:37       let, let's, let's, let's wait into international waters here without really paying attention to anything. I don't, you know, I don't even watch the BBC, you know, that's what a lot of stuck up cons over here. Do. I just want to get another perspective? Um, so Syria gases, some of its own fucking people and then we shoot missiles at them. So my thing is where do the missiles go and who died?

Speaker 4:          00:16:04       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       How accurate are those missiles? Was it just some guy selling popcorn on this quarter? A buzz Syria in a Kazakh is Stan, you know, and he's upstairs. The FREIDA X, right? There we go. Then we're like, oh, sorry about that. Sorry about that. We would try to get the guy that did the thing that we didn't like.

Speaker 4:          00:16:29       We frowned upon.

Speaker 2:          00:16:32       We would like to apologize to anybody at the food court. I have no idea. Or our missiles that good. I don't know. I have no idea. I just don't get how that works.

Speaker 4:          00:16:45       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       Yeah. Warren's just really, I just don't, I don't understand it. We're going to murder more your people before a, you murder all people and then when we win, we're going to say that you guys are evil, right. The only way it is if somebody just starts with you, if they started,

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:17:04       then you've got to finish it. I guess that's how it works.

Speaker 4:          00:17:07       You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:17:09       Did Sean Connery make a speech about this and the untouchables or something like that?

Speaker 4:          00:17:14       I don't fucking know,

Speaker 2:          00:17:16       but I don't, I don't get why we're all up in arms about that hairless fat fuck over there and

Speaker 4:          00:17:20       Korea. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       I just don't, I don't understand why this guy can't shoot off his fireworks at his own fucking country. I mean, we do that shit all the time. Who gives a fuck? What is that fucking

Speaker 4:          00:17:35       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       Take [inaudible] got a dope.

Speaker 5:          00:17:40       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:41       that's what he's built. Like he's built like a journal. He just has like a fucking, yeah. I these adorable, if you would just stop with the, I'm going to blow up fog in the United States that he, she got admit the guy. He's kind of adorable, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:17:59       I dunno, I have no fucking idea. But anyway, so I was watching this thing on Europe, uh, right after World War II and uh, then I, it was so fascinating to me. What the fuck was going on that I actually, I went on, I actually got on the Internet, I didn't have my laptop because I stabbed it with my phone, but my phone was still working, so I was checking out, you know, a couple of websites and this one website put exactly how my mindset was, how I believed World War II right after was like, right. I mean, I knew in Germany that obviously they had the fucking rebuild, you know, obviously Japan. Hello. That was a rough one, right. I knew that they, you know, we're rebuilding, but everybody else, I kinda thought, hey, you know, everybody was all in a good mood and shit and skipping down the fucking street because it was over. Is this website put at the end of it was sailors kissing nurses and fucking times square. That was it. And evidently it was not,

Speaker 4:          00:18:57       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       in a lot of ways, like people were acting exactly the way against the people they were fighting. It was fucking brutal. If there was all kinds of rapes, murders, people settling scores,

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       All Germans that were all around Europe that, you know, we're not in Germany. They were getting fucking killed and sent back to Germany, couple of little mini genocides, which, you know, between people in eastern fucking Europe, it was just like, Jesus Christ. And I have to take some of these, the fucking Nazis too. Every time I think like, I've heard the worst thing they ever did. It's like you literally can't even watch it. I just found out something else they did. I'm going to tell you, it was so fucking disturbing. I'm not even going to repeat it. I can't stop fucking thinking about it. And then they were showing the Goddamn Nuremberg trials and those fucking Nazi consists sitting there with this arrogant look on their face like, well this is fucking bullshit,

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       and then I'm thinking, how could you think that? How could you not be like wow yeah that got a little, yeah we guess we got a little sideways with that plan. Have the fucking sitting there. You know what these look on their face like [inaudible] like, like this is fucking bullshit. And I'm thinking like how could they possibly think that cause their PR and I'm thinking they think, well if we fucking won you guys would be sitting here. All right, what about when you fire bombed Dresden about that shit? And then we can just be like, well you know we wouldn't have done that if you wouldn't do what you are doing if you weren't doing what you were doing. All right, Mister Blonde. They just done what I told him that though no one would've been dead. That's what we were doing. If you didn't do what the fuck you are doing, we wouldn't have done what we did.

Speaker 2:          00:20:45       And then they would say, well, we what we, we learned from you with what you did to the native Americans. And then we would say, well, you know what? That wasn't us. We weren't alive when that happened. And then they'd be like, well, you know what? You're still alive and a lot of m is still alive and you're not doing anything about it. And whether we like, all right, fair enough. You know what? We'll set some emotion to eventually give a mark casinos. The Nazis would be like, ah, you know, fair enough, fair enough. And that's it usually stay in all his fucking footage of them hanging these fucking guys. Just a nonchalant way. They did it there. This is 42 this guy, I don't know what the fuck it was. It was like, it was just a board. It was like a do it yourself, fucking hang the guy right in court.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       The fucking tie. The guy's hands behind his back. They lay him down on this board. It just goes like to a 45 degree angle. They hoisted guy up, they put a fucking rope around his neck and he's sitting there fucking all in them up. Right. And then a guy with gloves just covers the guy's eyes and then they let go of them. And as the guys slides down, he breaks his neck. And the guy with the hands just, he just moves his hand with the guys had seen ever see his fucking eyes, you know, cause they didn't want to upset people in court. It's fucking insane. Fucking insane. And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       Jesus Christ. I gotta be honest with you. I really wish I didn't watch it because there was this woman testifying and that, that, that, you know, if you want to see it, I can't remember. Remember the program. I'm sure you can find it on the fucking Internet. You know, just Google. What the fuck was bill talking about? World War II. I'm sure somebody will find it and um, you got to see them like, you know, um, all right. This is just not funny anymore. All right, let's plow ahead. Let's talk about something else. Okay. So I was in, uh, I was in Boise. This, um, uh, Jesus Christ, sorry, I'm typing in my password here. I was at boy, you know what, uh, does anybody seen uh, Joel Macintyre's new show,

Absolutely hilarious, right? So I was supposed to do a podcast with them to help promote his shell.

So I fuck, I was gonna fuck it up. He was fucking hilarious. And the guy who plays is a agent is great. I don't know what his name is. I'm on the IMD page. I'm going to fuck all of this stuff up. Everybody on the show is hilarious. Jamie Dembo who I also worked with in the heat.

Speaker 6:          00:24:05       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:24:08       Who else was in Donnie Wahlberg? All of these guys were just, it's really fucking funny, thank Christ. Cause I was already sitting there going like, fuck, I fucked this guy over. I didn't show up. And then I'm going to watch you showing him like, Oh God, what if it's terrible? Then what do I do? I got to sit there and cross. Wow. It's a great show. This I can actually tell you it's a fucking great show. I don't know what network it's on. I'm going to fuck the, but I'll know by Monday. All I know is it's not on the comfy network, but it's fucking hilarious. Just look it up. It's really, really well written. And uh, the guy who plays his agent is a fucking beast. Um, kills it. And uh, I don't, I actually found it interesting too, like what his life is like, you know, cause it's based obviously on his life and does so much like creepy older women wanting to come up and hug them.

Speaker 5:          00:24:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:59       And now he's got to kind of just allow them to do it. Um, I found that hilarious just because I don't like people touching me. You know, I just, after a while I just like, I so understand how even Dell, you know what I mean? Just as people always wanted to come up and touch him and then like what if he wants a fucking sandwich and all those hands, he just shook all that DNA. He could literally start his own country with what is on his fucking hands. And when you really start thinking about that, you know, that's, I don't know. Like my favorite time to meet people is during the winter when I'm back east and you already have gloves on. I love winter. When you're in New York, you know you can go on the subway, you can grab on to shit and you can finally hold on, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:25:51       Yeah.

I am going to talk hockey, but I'm, I'm trying to avoid the pain. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       I'm trying to avoid the pain. Okay. I just thought about Carlito's way it comes to debt. I read that Ad. Kleinfeld is my friend. Um, that's, that's one of my favorite roles Sean Penn ever played. I fucking love him in that. I love them with the fucking Perm and the receding hairline, you know, he's doing the fucking blow. Cop comes in, says all that crazy shit to him, trying to scare the shit out of him. He just looks at the cop and goes, Dun, Dun, Duh. Fucking hilarious. I don't want to love Sean Penn. You know, sometimes I pray for a flood just so I can see him coming up in a boat just to rescue me. He's that Kinda guy. Um, anyways, um, so I'm up in Boise, Idaho working the Egyptian theater at a great fucking time, despite the fact for the first time in like 12, 13 years, I had to kick somebody out of the show and I never do that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       And I told the guy, I don't want to do that. I think it's a pussy move by a comedian, deal with the heckler. And that's it. But this guy was just, he just was, you know, he wasn't even remotely coherent. And, uh, I dunno, I offered to pay for his tickets and all that. I was just like, dude, you just, you've got to go, you've got gotta fucking go. And I gave him like a one more word. You could just shut the fuck up. And he's still [inaudible] I couldn't, I couldn't even respond to what he's saying cause I couldn't understand them. And it was getting, uh, it was getting ugly. It was getting ugly. So, uh, you know, I apologized to the people there and if the guys listening, you know, just come back next time sober. All right. That's all. I didn't want to do it all right.

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       I'm sure you woke up today all fucking mad at me. Um, you know, when they threw him out, they found 14 beers, empty beer cans underneath is a underneath the seat. I Dunno know if they're trumping up the charges. I don't know if, cause he was in the front row, a bunch of Rosa beers cans rolled down to him. I have no, I don't pretend to fucking know. But anyways, I was, um, I was performing at that theater and uh, one of the coolest things anybody has ever done for me, the people at the theater heard that I played drums. So they rented a drum kit and during the day I got to go into the theater, the theater and just fucking, you know, put it on my Walkman, whatever the fuck you call it, the iPod thing, my phone, my little handheld stereo and just fucking, just rock out man. I had a, I had a great time. And whoever the, whoever tuned up those drums, they sounded great. The snare was fucking unbelievable. He's that guy. It was like a marching, I don't know what the f how deep it was. It was like six and a half by like, uh, what's the next size up? I'm sorry, it was like 14 by six and a half. What's the next size up? Is it eight inches deep? Nine inches deep. But this isn't a point here people I'm fucking asking.

Speaker 3:          00:38:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       Was incredible. Incredible fucking sound. And that was his old Ludwig's and they didn't even have like the usual, I'm like lugs on them. Whatever the fuck he called the things you unscrew and you're tuning up and tune it down. The drama, whatever tensioning tensioning the drum, whatever the fuck he supposed to say it. They just had screws that were all stripped so it's got this great kid. But to adjust it, I had to take out a pair of pliers that came with the drug kit. Um, so it was a five piece, broke it down to the four piece, set up the Steven Adler fucking setup that I fell in love with when appetite for destruction came out. You know, when I was going down the slippery slope of I won as many drugs as possible cause I was listening to iron maiden. And then Steven Adler came out. I'm like, this fucking guy's getting more music out of these four drums and half these guys out with these fucking 15 piece kits.

Speaker 4:          00:38:49       So, um,

Speaker 2:          00:38:52       I just say I had, I had the greatest fucking time and uh, was up there with the Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe Barnett, who fucking murdered all week and a Monday morning podcast, uh, produce producer, producer said he said extraordinary Andrew Stimulus was up there. And uh, we made a tour. We did a tour of, uh, Boise. When we fuck that, we got everywhere. We got fucking everywhere. We went on the blue field, we went up to the fucking table rock. We will all over that fucking town. We had a great time. Um, so that'll be coming out. The San Jose one is almost done. And then I also got another one for a San Antonio that's coming up. So a, I'm just going to start doing those fucking things. I don't know why I like doing them. They're fun, you know, plus it makes me get up and do shit. You know, I've been to Boise a number of times. I never got up into those fucking hills, you know, so all right. I think I've avoided it long enough. Let's talk about the NHL playoffs.

Speaker 7:          00:39:52       Woo.

Speaker 4:          00:39:56       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       you know, you want your team to make the playoffs until they lose a playoff series, then you dislike. Oh, that sucked. Shouldn't they just not have made the playoffs? They could just rip the emotional bandaid right off. Um, congratulations of saying this through gritted teeth. Congratulations to the Ottawa senators. Looks so well flight series. I had nothing to show out racetrack for you guys in your organization. Good luck in the next round against the New York fog. Good Ray.

Speaker 4:          00:40:26       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       And uh, and I gotta you know, you know, they always do the star of the game. I mean, at some point you got to give it to those, uh, all those Ottawa locals, you know, there were refereeing those games, particularly game three, game five, and even a little bit of game six. You know, I'm not saying if, you know, I'm not saying that's why we lost, but Jesus fucking Christ, all I wanted was a little consistency. You know it is a deal. A ref can fuck in one game, but you know when it's like three out of the sex Jesus cry. How many times did we have to win game five before they feared at school? Like two fucking goals. If fucking sit in the crease covering the puck up in the crease, not the goalie. Okay. For those who don't watch hockey, that's, I've been watching hockey for 37 fucking years. That's a penalty shot.

Speaker 4:          00:41:20       Cool.

Speaker 8:          00:41:21       They have replay. I don't know how they met our uh, after further review where the defense man put his hand over the Puck, we could no longer see the, so it was inconclusive as to whether it was underneath his or not.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       So we actually won game five, despite the fucking Ref's trying everything they possibly could to give Ottawa chance to fucking win it. Game three, was it the bottle?

Speaker 4:          00:41:45       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:41:47       end of the third period. I can't remember the fuck it was. Someone on auto just stood up and punched one of the Bruins in the face and we got offsetting ruffings. We both got two minutes for roughing the auto guy for punching the do in the face and I guess the Bruin for not ducking. I don't know what he, I don't know what, we've got two minutes for not ducking for allowing yourself to be punched in the face. I have no, so it was us. I was like, all right, that's what he's gonna do. When I saw that, I was like, okay, this ref is like, it's going to be even strength. I'm not going to be a part of this horse shit. Okay. I don't know why he punched him in the face. Maybe some other shit happened right before that. And this is retaliation. I don't have time for you fucking bullshit children. You both sit down and it's going to be even strength and no one's going to know my fucking name at the end of this, but that's not how it went down. Cause then in the fucking overtime, a lot of what comes in fucking smash is us in the face. Nash punches the guy back in the face and we get two minutes. They go on the power play in the fucking Beatles.

Speaker 2:          00:42:40       I Dunno. I'm not even saying that we would have won the fucking thing, but it's just like, well, what? Why do that to me now? I've got to think of that the whole fucking summer. Can't you just let auto a beat us? They were going to beat us. Maybe they weren't. I don't know. I don't fucking know. But Jesus Christ, I even thought that last, that last one. I mean, I'm, I'm, maybe I'm looking at this through fucking black and gold fucking colored glasses, which of course I am. I'd love to hear what you think of even like that fucking, you know, they want on the power play again on some ticky tack fucking horseshit. It looked bad, but when you looked at the fucking, when I did anyways, let's be honest, when I looked at at the, at the instant replay, it's like pasta duck was trying to get to the guy with the puck who's entering the offensive zone, Aka a fucking scoring threat. The fucking auto. A guy turns around, looks at Pasta, knock and initiates the contact pasta, reached out, grabs the guy and he just sits on his ass. Two minutes for fucking holding fucking 30 seconds later. Hey, enjoy your golfing. But you know what,

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       what do I do? I mean I actually, I have no fucking, I don't give a shit about Ottawa at all. I go there, I have a good time. I do shows they've never done anything to us. For some reason they decided to trade shower to us. So thank you for that to God bless you on your fucking wing. But now I get this, but you know, something is sad is that was

Speaker 4:          00:44:07       mmm,

Speaker 2:          00:44:08       I was equally happy for the New York Rangers. Not Cause I like, I don't dislike the rangers. He, I actually liked the rangers. Um, it's one of the few New York teams that actually kind of a, see I really love, I actually love the Knicks and I love the rangers. Unless they play in us then I don't like, and it's not really even them. It's so we always comes down to the fence. So I was extremely excited that the a range is knocked out. The Montreal Canadian Canadians, of course, I cannot give a hundred percent credit to the New York Rangers. Uh, I do have to thank the fans of Montreal who were in the Montreal forum. The second forum on that fateful night, when you guys absolutely humiliated Patrick Wa to the point he gave you guys the fingers, right, number, that then he went over and he sat on the bench and he looked at your owner and I've read his lips. He said, listen, you motherfucker, I'm never played for you. Cons again. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       trade me to whoever the fucking Nordiques are now. And that's what happened. That's exactly what happened. He called it and then he went on any one, two more cups, I believe in [inaudible] 96 and in 2001 or was it 2000? I can't fucking remember. Alright. And the greatest thing ever is Mont the Montreal Canadiens never won another cup. The end. That's it. That's how the story ends as a right now.

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:33       That's how it's going to end.

Speaker 2:          00:45:37       I love it. That dead. Do you believe is, I'm literally, I've route for a franchise. It has six cups, you know, but we want in 2011. So that gives me, that gives me rights. You know, whenever Montreal fans talk about their fucking all the cups they want, I just started singing glory days. That's all I do. It's really obnoxious. It annoys the shit out of them. They start wiping the tears away with their little Hanky, say up in the front sport coat pockets. Um, I was actually talking to Barton and host of puck off and I was trying to tell him I was, you know, saying that I was going to root for Toronto. So of course then they get the old right there, Fred from fucking the capitals. Um, by the way, hey bill, who do you think's gonna Win The cup? I think the penguins repeat. That's what I think. That's what I think. I think they're gonna have an amazing fucking series, um,

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       against the, uh, the capitals. And then they'll probably face the fucking rangers. And, uh, who are they going to face in the West? Well, who the fuck knows now? Nobody saw that four game sweep against the Blackhawks. And I mean Noah saw that shit coming fucking people in Nashville, you know, they actually got this such not hockey fans. They actually showed up for game five. They didn't know how many games you had to win at such a cheap joke. But I enjoyed it. Congratulations to Edmonton. Who else moved on Anaheim and I'm fucking kicked the fuck out of somebody's St Louis Blues. You know, I guess I got a roof for the blues again. I'll root for the blue save and fuck, they've never won a cup. And um, but anyways, I was talking to Bartok, Joey Budnick and um, a lot of people don't this, um, cause the May beliefs have not won since 1967.

Speaker 2:          00:47:33       And I was surprised when I was going back one day just going down some fucking hockey history, rabbit hole. And uh, do you know in 1967, like if you asked somebody like who the greatest hockey franchise, the most successful one of all fucking time, it would still would have been the Canadians. Right? They'd still won the most cups. But a lot of people don't know this. In 1967 the fucking maple leafs for only one cup behind the Montreal Canadians, they are now 10 cups behind him or something like that. 11 cups, I believe. Yeah, 24 to 13 in 1967 the fucking Toronto Maple leafs won their 13th Stanley Cup to be within one of the Montreal Canadians. So that's like Celtics Lakers, except the maple leafs weren't lying about any of their titles. They didn't win one in some other fucking hockey league, you know, and then they called it a Stanley Cup championship, you know. Anyways, so they went in in 1967 all right, the Katy is have 14 leaves, have 13 that breathing down their fucking necks. If they went to war, right? All of a sudden they're the greatest fucking franchise of all time. That's how fucking clothes they wear.

Speaker 3:          00:48:53       Good.

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       And once again,

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       they aren't, they won the cup in [inaudible] 67 the end. And that's the end of that book. It's fucking unbelievable. And then the Canadians, they want it the next two years in a row. 68 69 then the Bruins one at 70. Oh God, here we go. This is from memory. There's so much of a fucking nerd. I am 71. The Canadians wind 72 [inaudible] 73 Canadians win. Then the flyers went back to back in 74 75 and then they fucking had, the Canadians had a dynasty 76, 77 78 79 when Larry Robinson beat the shit out of Dave Schultz. You know, both of them rocking the same fucking perm. Both of them, I believe had a mustache. I mean, it was, it was 1976. You watch it now. They look like a couple of roided up hipsters. But back then, that's what men look like. And he stood up to them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       And that was it. That's one of my favorite fucking moments, by the way. That's as a Bruin fan. I love that fight. You know, just cause you know, I don't know. I, I've, uh, I just don't like bullies. And I'm not saying Dave shelters or bullets like you're playing fucking hockey for fuck sakes. Me. We do mean to me, you know? But whenever they would call the bullies, so it was just something about it. Like I just saw him pulling people's hair and shit in. It was just like, uh, you know who's kidding, who? I love Dave Schultz. But after while you went so many fights, you just start rooting for somebody else anyways. Then they want an 86 then they won in 93 they want 10 more fucking Stanley cups and just, they just disappeared over the horizon. It was like when Armstrong, look back at that guy, you know when he went on, went on to win the Tour de France like seven fucking times. I still can't believe they took those titles away from it's so, it's so fucking ridiculous. It's one of the dumbest things ever that whole fucking sport is, is on drugs. They're all on drugs. So it was a level playing field.

Speaker 4:          00:50:48       Okay. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:52       I'll tell you right now, if they all at the same people raised okay and they all went clean, he's going to win it again.

Speaker 4:          00:50:58       Right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:59       He's the best guy. If they're all on drugs. It was even, I don't know, that whole thing fucking annoys me. You know why? Because everybody fucking shits on the guy. But everybody made all this money off of them. You never saw anybody give any of the fucking money back, did you? Oh, they were so fucking outreach. Like the fucking cops who run this, the sport of cycling didn't realize what the fuck was going on.

Speaker 4:          00:51:19       You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       If someone were, if somebody you work with, if you're in a restaurant and somebody on fucking heroin at the staff, you know the people in the restaurant don't know, but you fucking know because you work there. They let that guy when seven in a row blow up the fucking sport and then they took it away from, and then they all kept in fucking money. That's exactly what happens as far as I'm concerned. You know, why isn't Trump go shoot some missiles at them?

Speaker 4:          00:51:44       Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       Um, anyways, I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Let me, let me, uh, let me fucking type in my goddamn passport, passport, password. All the screen is just so cool. I never fucking wiped down the screen fucking animal. I am never do it. I just, I'd rather squinty for some stupid reason. All right, let's do a couple of questions here. All right, big eyes follow up. Uh, Hi Bill. I listen to your podcast. When you were going, when you were googling big eyes and heard you mention the fiasco that occurred, which you dismissed, assuming that it wasn't the same artist and actually there was a fraud involved. The husband took credit for the wife's artistry, which came out after the images were licensed. Love your podcast. Love you. Go Fuck Yourself. And by the way, I am a 62 year old woman. Oh God bless you sweetheart. Um, yeah, I actually looked it up. Yeah, that guy was a fucking creep. Well, we should put a link up to that. It's a crazy story. Um, my favorite part of that story was, uh, I forget there was some big fucking, you know, one of those things that like social lights show up to those people who are just, you know, they just did famous because people, they go to, these parties were famous, people are there and day only. They just have a great conversation.

Speaker 4:          00:53:02       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       You know, they go in there and they talk about fucking hot air ballooning or just something just, I don't know, they just, people just find them fascinating cause they can go from subject to subject, you know, while eating appetizers and not getting anything between their teeth. They just, I don't know what it is about fucking rich people. They are fascinated. I did say got so much fucking money. They just get bored. Right. And God knows they're not talking to their wives anymore. You know, they went out and they got themselves a mattress that, you know, two different kinds. Right. Fucking banker. He probably wants a heated one. The reptilian cunt. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       so I think, I don't know if it was the world's fair, I don't know what it was, but they fucking bought, they had all the, they bought some big, one of those big, I'd fucking kid paintings in somebody in the New York Times and one of these fucking papers that all these fucking socialite icons want that respect, trashed those drawings saying they're creepy there hacky. It's awful. It's terrible art. The what happened was they just became too mainstream and people got sick of them and they trashed him and then they immediately took it down after they think they commissioned her to fucking paint the goddamn thing. Um, I mean, what a fucking shame. One article. It's like, you like that shit. You like that shit. And then you walked, you commissioned that artists, you told her how much you fucking liked her and you appreciated her work in one little fucking article. What did you do? All of a sudden you were like a fucking kid in high school who wasn't strong enough to say, yeah, I'm friends with that snot nose kid over there. Right. And stayed with them. You know, you didn't, they just stepped away and they watched dead lady gets stuffed into a fucking locker with all the goddamn paintings have to, what the fuck happened? Her and her husband. I'll tell you right now. That's reprehensible.

Speaker 4:          00:54:51       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       All right. Captain America. Everybody a Billy Bruce Banner. I don't imagine you're sending, spending your free time reading comic books. Yeah, I can't get into them. I really liked the way they're drawn the um, and I also like the superhero is always have like fucking, they have like the hottest girlfriends. At least the ones that I read. Spiderman's girlfriend was fucking ridiculous. Jesus Christ, the fucking titties. Acid legs. I mean she was, she was fucking amazing. Beautiful, beautiful God damn woman. Um, that's why I don't like the movies, you know what I mean? Cause nowadays, nowadays they take, they got to make sure they can't go to fucking pretty now or also the fatties get fucking upset. That's an impossible image. Check out in the fucking gym. Do I fucking cry when Brad Pitt takes his shirt off? Maybe I do, but I don't tweet about it. All right. I don't imagine you spending your free time reading comic books bill. But I thought I'd share some news with you, man. Uh, it was revealed months back. Uh, the captain America was actually a Hydrus by all these years. Hydra is basically the Nazis.

Speaker 4:          00:56:06       What?

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       All right. It was assumed that they would write it in that he was actually, he wasn't actually a spy this whole time, but was pretending to be, well this month they decided to make it so that captain America is and has always been a guy. This story l elements, they're adding our trash. So it's not even a cool twist. Oh, I love, oh, is there anything better? Is there anything better than the, than the fucking, the pissed off comic book reader with the direction they've taken the story you like dead fucking Dolores, Clayborne, whatever the fucking name is. Uh, misery, whatever the hell her name was. I whoop. What else are they supposed to do? He's been a good guy for 100 fucking years and I'm to tell you right now you fucking comic, but I'm might even going to read the rest of us. You guys have I, you know, out of respect. I'll read the last few.

Speaker 4:          00:57:06       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:57:06       sentences here he goes, I'm not a staunch Republican. The fuck did my screen go. I'm not a staunch republican or a wild southerner. I'm just a guy who is tired of this self hating trend once with people hating traditions so much that they can't stand a hero. Just being a hero. Oh, I see. You went in different directions. This is good. Why red? Okay. I think you'd like some of the newer comic titles, pictures and words and some good stories makes for an easy stimulating read. Just don't read Captain America. Love you. Love Nia. Congrats on the little lady. Thank you sir. What's your dealing with? The here is money. That's why they're doing it. They have exhausted every fucking possible story, storyline. You know what I mean? Like you remember the Brady bunch when they had to bring an Oliver, right? Remember like remember happy days, like after awhile, like Ron Howard. He did. They did. He just left. It's just like there's nothing left to do with this character. I'm Outta here. And all of a sudden funds, he started wearing suits. He was teaching a mechanic class. He became a teacher.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       It's fucking hooligan, riding a motorcycle. Next thing I know, he's pulling up in a station wagon teaching this fucking guy with blonde hair, how to fucking two and a carburetor and he's actually helping them with their problems. All of a sudden it became like welcome back Kotter. It's cause they, they were out of ideas that it had run its course. And I hate to tell you this, but captain America has run its fucking course. All right? They're going to get themselves out of this. All right? They'll do the classic thing that, you know, it wasn't actually the real captain America, it was fucking somebody else. But the thing is, dude, um, you are, who you should really blame is, is Al Gore. He's the reason that this is all going down because as we all know, Al Gore invented the Internet. He said it himself, he said it himself and he said it again, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:58       The man invented the Internet and the Internet, you know, gave birth to fucking Napster, which gave birth to all of these things where people could watch movies and shit for free. Right? Napster obviously was music, but the other shit, people go on Pirate Bay, they just watch all these movies for free. So what happened was that killed the, the fucking 30 million to $70 million movies. Like they just went away. So then everything became either super fucking cheap or $100 million Superhero fucking movie where it's like, all right, we're going to just spend all this money and people are going to go, cause they're gonna want to see special effects in, you know, at the movie screen. That's what happens. So, and they made 9,000 of these fucking movies and, um, there's nowhere else to go with them. I think they made a couple of captain America movies, didn't they?

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       I don't fucking know. But now what they're gonna do is they're going to set this up that now this guy is actually a fucking Nazi, you know, and, uh, who was doing all this great stuff in America? I don't understand. He was like saving children while spying on us. I don't know if they could somehow going to try to explain all of that shit. I have no idea. But eventually he's going to fight Batman. All right? We all know that Batman has one professional fight under his belt and he's all for one, right? He launched a superman, so before he gets another shot at the title, I think he has to fight somebody else. Who's he going to fight? You know, it can't be Lex Luther and and fucking the octopus guy. I mean those guys that played out all right, they're all punch drunk, spite of man's been fucking them up for years.

Speaker 2:          01:00:36       If they need somebody know, so this is the only way to go. All right? I would be surprised if Vince McMahon does not sue them for this storyline because he did this with Hulk Hogan like 50 times. You know? You knew how Kogan was was. You knew when he was the bad guy. I love because he would die the side of his beard. He would die that fucking black and then he would have the fucking blonde mustache, which by the way, I thought look really cool. He had a great fucking fool man shoe. He still does. Um, do you ever see guy go bald more gracefully than that? He just kept pushing it back like Richard Rawlings and every time he did it, it was a little further back, you know? Then he started wearing the fucking, the scarves. It always come off [inaudible] I dunno. Tanned his head up. He looked great. Then when you say that, how Kogan went bald very gracefully. What'd you say?

Speaker 4:          01:01:32       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       You don't think so? What's wrong with you today? I feel like you don't like me. I mean part of being married. Some days you're not going to like me. I feel like that's one of these days.

Speaker 4:          01:01:44       No,

Speaker 2:          01:01:47       I don't understand how you're so loud with slippers on.

Speaker 4:          01:01:53       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       She just said, that's why I don't like you. All right. Princess Kate finds parenting hard. Well, I imagine when they try to play hide and go seek in that castle, it's going to take forever. Hey Bill, get a lot of this crap. Kate Middleton, a fucking princess did a speech in which she says she's finds it hard being a mom. Now I'm sure she has a busy schedule, but for Christ's sake she has servants. I know she doesn't even have nannies. She has servants. She, it may have one of the easiest jobs in the entire world. She wasn't born to royal tree, she married into it. So all she needs to do is not be a con for the next 50 to 75 years. Stay married and she's all set. Attached is a link to her full speech. You can listen to it. Uh, if you care to listen to it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:39       I'm not listening to shit. She's trying to promote mental health awareness, which is nice. But did she really need to try to tell us that she finds parenting difficult? Huge fan from Newfoundland, Canada. Thanks. And don't forget to go fuck yourself. Um, yeah. I mean, you know, this is the thing when a kid comes into your life, yeah, there's an adjustment period. So she was sitting there getting fan by feathers and all of that shit. Right. Having somebody bring her old Dagwood sandwich. Is she sitting on, you know, the, the Louis, the 15th fucking, I dunno, Ottoman. Is that a word? Is that a piece of furniture that is, isn't it? Or is that an empire? Um, yeah. And then all of a sudden the kids there and she has to pretend to give a fuck about, you know, I think it just makes her photo shoots more difficult. What did she name her kids. He probably gave him some old white guy's name, like Winston Ebeneezer. The fucking 19th or some shit. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:03:42       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:42       The, I have to be honest with you, like, that has to be the most boring fucking life you could ever fucking live. Okay. Being a fucking princess, at least when you're a prince, you know, you get to eat. He kept fucking guy goes around, he flies helicopters. He was in the Goddamn army. You know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          01:03:59       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       Goes out. He does shit right tags out with the boys. He smoked cigars. What do you do as a princess once you fucking married, you know, you broke down on the white horse, she had your fucking, your wedding, right? Everybody shows up, you know, all the women in the crowd giving you the evil eye because they wanted to be a princess. All the haters, you know, there's, there's nothing good about that ride in, you know, cause it's either going to be haters or people just sobbing because that dream's never going to happen for them. So that's how he sees people stare and stare and fucking daggers at you next to fatties and fucking Weirdos like,

Speaker 7:          01:04:33       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:04:33       she's so beautiful. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:04:37       yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:38       I would think it would be hard to be a princess. The steam mind numbingly boring fucking life that you're going to live, you know, to the, to the fuck. This is when you know your board is when you promote a cause, you know, you're so fucking bored. You have to go out and help. Somebody was so fucking all set is not what the, there's nothing to do.

Speaker 7:          01:05:02       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:05:02       You know, there's nothing you, we got everything you fucking want. It's, it's, yeah, the end game over now what are you doing now? You got to fucking, you got to go down to some third world country and start installing plumbing or some shit. [inaudible] got it. You have to do something. Either that or you just fucking, you just become like one of those Dudley Moore characters. You just get shit faced every day.

Speaker 4:          01:05:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       That's what I would do. Take up like archery and shit. I just be in the backyard, just fucking shoot and stuff. Walking around with some fucking ridiculous cognac. I would be such a piece of Shit, you know? I really would be, I, I, if you know, can you get written out of the will? Can he get unfucking print x prints or something like that? Excommunicated from that. I, that's exactly how I would do, oh my God, I would have all the fucking sports packages. I'd go to all the fucking games. All right. I wouldn't give a shit either. I would be, I would be fucking ridiculously blowing the money and like, that would be my goal in life. Like, how over can I be with the English Tax Pique People's money that they're there? What am I trying to say? The English taxpayers' money. There you go. You ever seen somebody like dyslexic when they're just talking about you? You think I'm trying to read this shit. Like always flip words around. Um, and by all means, all of you who aren't doctors, please diagnose me and tell me what sort of fish oil and I don't need to take the cure it. Um, that's what I would do. I would just like, my goal would be by the time I'm 42, I want them to, I could easily do that. I can easily do that. I could get x fucking, you know, you no longer at Duke,

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       you know.

Speaker 2:          01:06:44       Oh, you know what would be great. It'd be great to, people would actually love you. I want to say we've done Hayden. You the second you walked into a pub, you have no more security anymore. You just come walking in and now, yeah, you're, I fucked that one up there yet pat, you'd be like, yeah, I did. I had a great time though. The fuck was I supposed to do? I was living in a castle. You'd fucking week. You know, that would be it. The next, you know, you sit in the bleachers right in the fucking pit at the footy games. Just being a regular guy, getting fucking hammered, eating fish and chips and just laughing, just laughing at how bad you fucked up your life and all those fucking sad sex. They'd love you.

Speaker 2:          01:07:25       Um, anyways, fat yoga instructor. Hey Billy. Read Sec. Uh, I don't know why that struck me so funny. I mean, I see it everyday. You think that that would be an old joke. Uh, I work out here in La as a personal trainer and teach them yoga classes here and there. Um, I've been teaching yoga at this studio for over four years and I got this fat ass confer, a manager built, she's gotta be 80 pounds overweight. And despite being around all this healthy lifestyle, she has done nothing to improve herself. I'm talking donuts and cookies in this. I fucking loved this person. Oh my God. I love both of these people. I love that you call on a route for being fat or him out. And I love that this person's sitting there fucking eating donuts in a yoga, a yoga shop. What do you call it?

Speaker 2:          01:08:13       Studio Studio. A dojo crib. Uh, I'm talking donuts and cookies in the studio lobby around people that are there to avoid these temptations. That's fucking hilarious. Anyways, I've kept my mouth shut for years, but recently we had our annual class review with a manager comes and sees how, how you class, how your class is put together and how you are with the students, et Cetera. Uh, this whale couldn't even get through the first 15 minutes. She was beached on our mat belly. She was beached on a mat belly up, gulping fucking water. Oh, she went into, yeah, she went into whale pose.

Speaker 5:          01:08:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:08:58       Then afterwards she had the nerve to criticize my class that it wasn't challenging enough. Oh my God. And you didn't say anything. Okay. This is their reason that grudge is being held. Okay. The, the, it should say, the reason, the reason the grudge is being held is that my aunt, my annual raise was a mere 30 cents. And I wonder if that criticism effected it. Give me that Billy Burger philosophy on the, the situation. Love the podcast. Congratulations on the baby. It was great hearing her on the podcast the other day. Uh, go fuck yourself. Fire Nips. Um, Jesus Christ really coming at me with the fucking red head shit today aren't yet. Um, I think the whole thing is fucking hilarious. Um, I gotta ask you something. All right? You've been doing this shit there for over four years. Uh, why don't you eventually start your own thing at this point, you know, get out from that.

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       This is what, you know, what I would do if I was, you get an a good grace has been, you know, just start bringing a donuts. I bring a fudge, you know, and just, you know, I don't know if the cops could prove it, but you just killer killer with what she loves. Kill her with kindness. Okay. There you go. Kill her with kindness. Just keep what she gotta do. Okay. This is the thing about those fatties is that they can handle doughnuts, all right? But I'm telling you right now, nobody can handle fudge. Fudge is like, it's like a, it's almost a hundred percent sugar. It's like a solid form of cotton candy with like chocolate in it. I mean it is fucking, you can't even eat it. Like you'd hope face puckers up. This is what you do. You come in, you make a tray of fudge, all right?

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       You cut a piece out. This is what you do, okay? You cut a fucking piece out. All right? And just, you know, give it to the birds or some shit, right? I think sugar's good for them. I can't remember. See the good or it kills them either way. Just give it to the fucking birds, right? Then you bring the fudge in this and now it looks like somebody already took a piece of, she's not going to feel guilty and I guaran fucking tee you. I guarantee you do in the sugar is going to fuck with the joints. All right? Then you come in with some bacon sub sandwiches. You just keep going. Sugar, salt, sugar, salt, sugar, salt. Okay. And just, you know, that 30 cents they should have given you, you take 30 another 30 cents out of your fucking check every goddamn hour, all right? And, and you, you put it towards giving this person food that'll slowly kill him. There you go. Or you get a new job.

Speaker 2:          01:11:43       I Dunno. I just, I just think killing her. Be Funny. All right. Just your daughter, a Billy Bathgate's. Uh, would you ever disown your daughter if she brought home a. Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Dot. Hack comic. Oh Jesus. Think of the hackiest type of comic you can think of. And in the future, she brought him home talking about how she loves him. And now he's the funniest comic ever. Uh, Oh God. He's got a youtube channel, tells jokes with the lampshade on his head. It's Cetera. She asks you what you think of him. Uh, you tell her is a hack she gets mad at you, tells you you don't understand him and how he's funnier than you. Uh, would you dishonor and tell her she can't bring the hack into what's out now? No jokes. Leaf. Yeah. Joke. Thief. He can't come into the house. You can't come into my house is a fucking joke. Thief. Um,

Speaker 9:          01:12:40       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:12:40       Uh, I, this is what I would do. You know what? Even even if he stole fucking jokes, I know he's going to get caught and people are going to call them out on it. I wouldn't say anything, Eric. Cause I'll tell you this, I, I've seen how that goes down when you say you don't like somebody that you kid, like, you know what I mean? And uh, then there's all those in law problems. All right? This is your job as a parent is you gotta Trust your kids. Decisionmaking all right? They love the guy. You just got to go with it. You know what I mean? And then if they get divorced, you can't be like, hey, you know, I was, you know, cause if but why did you fucking say something? Cause you'd hate me. Um, Jesus, why would you bring that up? I'm, I'm just, I'm three months into this. I want to enjoy my, my daughter growing up. Jesus Christ. You already got me picture of being at the fucking wedding.

Speaker 2:          01:13:32       You know the guy would have some fucking crazy colored fucking bow tie. The cumber Bun. All right. I don't know Jesus Christ. What a way to end. Um, by the way, uh, how about the Celtic sound coming back when in two games, how lucky did we get with Rondo going down Jesus Christ, by the way, he pulled off a short sleeve suit. I don't know how he did it. He actually fucking look cool. I think you had to have a cast on to make it work though. Like he did. He fucked up his stomach assumption. All Right Patrice, dear Billy, big tits. Hey, I'm losing weight yet. Con found this on youtube almost shit myself laughing. I thought you'd appreciate this. Some classic hope you enjoy and go fuck yourself. I will definitely retweet this. Um, thank you for sending that in.
