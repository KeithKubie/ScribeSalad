1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:10,970
Okay.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,870
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:14,870
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,620
February 29th,

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,540
2016 happy leap year. Oh,

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:28,541
happy leap year and a happy birthday
to the poor said conch who only have a

7
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:32,570
birthday once every four years, you know?

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,741
Good Lord.

9
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,540
Can you imagine going on that first day
with that broad bitch and about that?

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,940
I always feel left out.

11
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:42,290
It was like everybody else had
a birthday every single year.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,090
It was like I would zero than
I was four then I was eight.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,073
Okay.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,460
You know she'd be in
good shape though. Huh?

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,840
He been fucking 75% less birth. Birthday,
birthday cake every year, right?

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,390
No. Wait. How does that math work out?

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,410
If in four years you had
four slices of cake, right?

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,790
But you were born in the leap
year. You only had one. Yeah.

19
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,270
That percentage doesn't work
because you know you have one.

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,180
Somebody else says two, they got
100% more than you got. Right.

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,080
They got all provided the there
equals slices. Now Jesus Bill,

22
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:19,520
you're going to do, you
going to break out fractions.

23
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:23,010
I think I'm gonna steal a little
birthday cake. Fractions. All right,

24
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:26,120
so they're getting fucking
300% more kick than you are,

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,480
man. I be, you know something. I've been,

26
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:34,190
anybody who's born on February 29th is
either a miserable cunt or just one of

27
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:38,870
the coolest laid back people like,
you know, oh my God, another birthday.

28
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:42,380
Aren't the years flying by?
No. No, they're not. Actually,

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,080
to be honest with you,
that's kind of weird.

30
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,260
So like when the fuck
are you actually like,

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,330
like say when you're 29
you know that doesn't work.

32
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:57,380
Do you 28 it's gotta be forced,
right? Wait, you're zero.

33
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,660
Jesus Christ. It should
be fucking annoying. Zero.

34
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,940
If you had a baby born on
the 29th right year, if

35
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,840
you're zero the first year. All right.

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,210
One, two, three no, four be back
again for right. I don't fucking know.

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,900
All I know is it's somebody's birthday
today and it hasn't been their birthday

38
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:23,170
since 2012 so happy fucking
birthday. What does that work out?

39
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,530
16 1514 1312 would be five years.

40
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,350
I can't fucking do it. I don't know
when it was. So once every three years

41
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,403
[inaudible]

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,310
oh, Jesus.

43
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,520
Anything that happens every four years
usually sucks to people's birthdays on

44
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:43,120
leap year of World Cup soccer,
the Olympics. You know,

45
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,220
I actually like Olympic hockey,

46
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:47,850
but then I hate all those fucking
do shit who never watch hockey.

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,370
And they'd be like, see if it was like
this, I would watch it all the time.

48
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,900
What? Only two weeks long with no
fighting. You fucking do shit. Beat it.

49
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,340
Nobody cares whether you
watch it or not. We stayed on.

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,910
At least I don't. So, um, anyways, I
apologize for the, uh, you know what?

51
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,430
I don't apologize. Oh,
I okay. I will, I will,

52
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,250
I'll apologize for the
podcast being this late.

53
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:13,210
I was going to do it on Sunday
when I was up in Foxwoods. Joe,

54
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,840
this go to the fucking casino. Wild
in the middle of words, you know.

55
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,710
Um, I was going to
record on Sunday, but uh,

56
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,010
[inaudible] got some tickets to see
the Yukon, uh, Houston cougars game up,

57
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,800
uh, you know, big fucking program by
the way, man. How about the fight?

58
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,760
You know, very quietly. I probably
shouldn't say very quietly.

59
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,630
I just don't pay attention to the
sports ladies hopes. You know,

60
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,410
I knew that fucking, uh,
Tennessee with pat summit, right.

61
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,380
Was fucking crushing it.
And I know Yukon was,

62
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,620
I thought they were doing all right,

63
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,980
but I thought it was mainly fucking
pat summit. And then I went to the

64
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,160
Goddamn Yukon game. I got a picture
of it here on my phone. You know,

65
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,190
somebody sent me a picture
of a friend of, uh,

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,340
a hairless pit bull that had freckles.

67
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,800
So most adorable thing you
ever seen in your life,

68
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,120
but the person said it look like me.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,913
Okay.

70
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,460
Ah, I like a good tweet.
You know, I don't get,

71
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,000
I didn't give a shit if you break my
balls, if it makes me laugh. All right,

72
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:18,650
so the fucking lady,
the lady huskies. Well,

73
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:20,840
let's do it in order here.
Let's do the guys first.

74
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,520
Considering they have way less. You know,

75
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:26,180
you always want to build towards your
closing bit. All right, the guys,

76
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,210
the fellows have won four
national championships since 1999.

77
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,271
All right.

78
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:37,271
The Yukon men's huskies have one 1999
2004 2011 2014 that's very fucking

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,170
respectable. Is anybody want
more than that? I don't know.

80
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:46,310
I'm not going to look it up. Kentucky
or Duke, I would guess. Maybe not Duke.

81
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,100
Right. Do Go. All right. Um,

82
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,950
but the ladies,

83
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,180
they want at 95 they want it in 2000
2002 2003 2004 2009 then the fucking God

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,190
damn poor excuse for speakers.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,500
Hang it from that fucking
building that they have with it.

86
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,860
Do the ceilings peeling is in the way.
The next two banners, they want it.

87
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:16,130
2014 2015 now I've got
to fucking look it up.

88
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,510
Well, as far as what I can see here on
the phone, that's one, two, three, four,

89
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:26,150
five, six, seven, eight and there's
two other banners behind that.

90
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:30,200
That's gotta be a championship one. Yeah.
National Champions. What an asshole.

91
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:33,860
What a fucked and I walked down and take
it correctly or maybe look it up before

92
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:38,420
I did this. All right, hang on a
second. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

93
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,860
Oh, Jesus. No, I'm typing on my phone.
This is gonna take for fucking ever.

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,120
I looked at the up the most
random women's huskies.

95
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,540
Why would I write that? That's
not going to get me there.

96
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,683
Okay.

97
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,500
Yukon.

98
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,430
Okay.

99
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,620
Huskies

100
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,660
championships. All right. Give me
the ladies. Give it the ladies,

101
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,230
but to come up for us. Uh,

102
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,810
the men's do you sexist
motherfuckers national championships?

103
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,860
Do you fucking hang on ladies,

104
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,623
ladies?

105
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,773
[inaudible]

106
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,650
there we go. Connecticut
women's basketball. I apologize.

107
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,810
I even know if I had an,
if had any fucking decency,

108
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:25,750
I would edit most of this out,
but I'm not gonna all right.

109
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,860
National Tournament champion
[inaudible] Conference Championships.

110
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:31,030
Jesus fucking Christ.

111
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:36,031
Nobody cares about any of this elite
age final four tournament champions.

112
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,790
95 2000 2002 2003 2004 2009
2010 2013 2014 2015 one,

113
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:51,100
two, three, four, five.

114
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:56,101
They wanted five out of the last six
fucking years and since the year 2000 Kona

115
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,260
bit, they've wanted one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

116
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:05,980
nine fucking times total domination.

117
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,430
Fuck a dog snoring. You
know my dog's getting fat.

118
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,340
I don't know what's going on
with that. He's changed his food.

119
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,310
We started getting her an extra can
cause she's always fucking coming over,

120
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,540
licking the bowl there. You know,

121
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,140
we felt bad for her and then I should say
she looks like a fucking state worker.

122
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,040
Right? Tennessee lady falls.

123
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,520
Alright, here we go. Come on
Wikipedia. Where the fuck are you

124
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,020
lady ball? Wait, what do you say? What
do you think? Because we think guys more.

125
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,640
Huh? I get it. Go was Connecticut
at that point of dull?

126
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,890
This might be the most boring
podcast ever. Well what do you do?

127
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,150
You get what you pay
for. All right, fuck it.

128
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:49,660
I'm not looking it up at the moment. My
eyes are seeing, I'm seeing double here.

129
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,910
I'm very impressed. But both of them,
man, they're, they're quietly crushing.

130
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:58,700
It's a nice small campus. They play
in this little ass building with,

131
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,080
with Shit Pale in from the ceiling.
The student section was hilarious.

132
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,310
You know when they
introduce the other team,

133
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:06,070
they sit there reading the newspaper.
I thought that was funny. Now,

134
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,390
I'm sure somebody going to say, well,

135
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,530
L K oil cord fucking university used
to do that. I don't give a shit.

136
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,640
So first time I saw it, it
was funny to me. Um, dude,

137
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,590
there was a guy sitting behind like
classic New England Sports Fan.

138
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,080
I never heard a guy like anytime the
ball didn't go in for the Huskies, he,

139
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,410
he had an a reason every fucking time
down the court and this is what killed me.

140
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,540
So I'm like, all right, this
guy's a total hoop head. Right?

141
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,160
And I turned around and Yaz on
a red sox hat and tee shirt toe.

142
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:40,820
He's basically a sports maniac, right?
The guy missed a shot. He'd be like, Eh,

143
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,190
didn't follow through. Next time they
come down the court, the DBA guy, the guy,

144
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,660
he should've been rotating around.

145
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,290
It's the second day I the double JB
should have been rotating around.

146
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,580
Next time down the court,
somebody slips. What?

147
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,150
Is there something wrong with the
floor? And I just kept nudging versa.

148
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,070
He would, he would go on like, like
the, like the fucking lady huskies here.

149
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,160
He would go on like four or five,
four or five hour runs there,

150
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,170
except instead of winning championships,

151
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,230
he'd be like bitch moaning
and complaining. And at
one point he made a point,

152
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,980
you know,

153
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,830
they threw it to their big goof there
and that guy fucking missed the ball.

154
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,350
And uh, the guy goes, you know,
if he had a pair of hands,

155
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,750
he would've had two there in front as
he turned around goes, you know what,

156
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:19,560
you're right.

157
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,140
And the guy just looked at him with
like an angry look like he was,

158
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,490
he was so pissed that Yukon was
losing. And we actually, uh,

159
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,310
you know, I know they're only
having a mediocre year this year.

160
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,030
I mean he can't fucking
win it every year. But um,

161
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
you could sense when you
were in there the level,

162
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,790
how seriously everybody was taking it.
Cause [inaudible] he kept saying like,

163
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,680
wow, these people take this
shit really seriously here.

164
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,930
And I just kept pointing up to
all the banners. I'm like, uh,

165
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,390
I would say at this point
they kind of used to winning.

166
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,670
So I guess they're having a
disappointing year, I guess.

167
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:52,280
I have no idea. I didn't look it
up. I just started talking about it.

168
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:57,190
It's what I did. But that's why
the podcast, um, was not ready. Um,

169
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,860
I had a great time up
at a Fox Foxwoods, um,

170
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,710
resort casinos, by the way. I
want to thank them for having me.

171
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:08,180
It was their 24th anniversary,
right. So they say to me, um,

172
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,400
before I get there, they said,

173
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,930
is there any way before your first
show if you could come down, um,

174
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,370
there's a big dinner or something
we'd love if you could meet the, uh,

175
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:23,150
the tribal council and just
stop by and say, hello. Right.

176
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,940
These are my employers for the weekend.
What am I going to say? No. So I'm like,

177
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:26,774
absolutely.

178
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,670
I want to meet these native Americans
that fucking beat the white man, you know,

179
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,110
and got their own fucking casino. Right?

180
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:39,980
So I go down there and I just thought
I was going to swing by a table and say

181
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:43,100
hello to somebody, thank them for
the Gig. And next thing you know,

182
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,731
they got this whole,

183
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:47,630
this is like fucking eyes wide shut
fucking dinner going on. You know,

184
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,660
the shining kind of shit in
the bowels of the casino.

185
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,550
There's some band and there's a stage
and it's like this Guy Smiley looking

186
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:58,340
fucking political guy on stage
and next thing you know he's,

187
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,510
he's given me an intro. I had
no fucking idea I was going on.

188
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:04,850
I have no idea what these
people are at. Furthermore,

189
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,650
these people had no idea who I was and
I just walk out and I go up. We have,

190
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,920
we got a local 40 man. Yeah, this weekend
please welcome comedian Bill Bern.

191
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,180
I was standing there going,
is he bringing me up?

192
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,130
Is he bringing me up and I
just fucking walk on stage.

193
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:17,330
I'd take the mic and I was like,

194
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,570
I'm looking out at all these old people
and shit and they just stare at me.

195
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:24,410
I was like, uh, the cardio
had no idea. I was a,

196
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,790
I was going to be brought
up here, but um, you know,

197
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,160
congratulations on 24 years.

198
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,660
I'm sure most of you people here know
who the next four presidents are going to

199
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,180
be on behalf of regular people.

200
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,610
If you could do something
about the population problem.

201
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:45,050
I really appreciate it and all of
this shit is getting nothing. Right.

202
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,960
I just started talking to them like they
will run in the world and they're just

203
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:52,550
looking at me like I got fucking
10 heads and I just said,

204
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:56,830
I just sort petered out and I
went and uh, onward and upward.

205
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,710
I just handed it back to Guy Smiley and
that was just like a little smattering

206
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:07,370
of plause and I just walked back into
the hall with the promoters will walk

207
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:12,190
away. I was like, what the f? What the
fuck was it? And he's like, I don't know.

208
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,270
That's how we talked. Sorry, I didn't,
no one was around doctoral. True ORC.

209
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,800
I won't [inaudible] you know,
nobody knows anything. Right.

210
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:25,390
And they just fucking wheel you around.
Um, yeah. And then we just fucking,

211
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,140
I think we got on a golf cart
at that point. We, no, no.

212
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,440
We walked through the halls and then they
walked me by the crowd that was going

213
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:36,220
into my show. So I looked like
a complete jerk off. I fucking,

214
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,820
I love seeing people after the show. I
fucking hate seen people before the show.

215
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,390
I don't know why. I don't if it's a
superstition, it's just weird to me to be,

216
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:47,680
for me to just be walking by
like the first time you see me,

217
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm just walking down the fucking
hall. Oh, there's that jerk off.

218
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,130
And then you just start looking at
why did I pay to see that look at him.

219
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,250
Okay. But anyways, we had a, um,

220
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,610
we had a great fucking time. I had a
bunch of family and friends coming out,

221
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:08,330
people I hadn't seen in years. Do
you don't mind. My first best friend

222
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,490
and then I ever had in life
actually came up to the Gig. And um,

223
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,410
I hadn't seen him in 36 years. And um,

224
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,520
I was actually thinking the last time
I saw him, you know, the reason why I,

225
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,580
my family, we moved away from the
town that we had lived in. And um,

226
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,120
I just remember we were
both, how fucking old was I?

227
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,050
I think we were like seven or eight.
And you don't know how to say goodbye.

228
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,830
You know, I'd probably been friends
with the kids since I was like four.

229
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:42,680
So basically half my life I
was friends with this kid.

230
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,730
So we loaded up the moving van the last
time like we would do in the u hall

231
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:49,010
thing, you know, we'll do it ourselves.

232
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,010
And we just made like 900 fucking trips
in this thing and we were loading it up

233
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:58,310
for the last time. And uh, he
lived across the street from me.

234
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:02,570
So I walked down my driveway and he
was out there and he knew this was,

235
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,110
he knew it was it, I knew it was it and
we were just too young. Didn't know.

236
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,580
Yeah, you know what to say. It's seven.

237
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:11,450
So some kid rode by and had
just written buying a bike.

238
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,400
And I remember he just said
something to me like, Oh yeah,

239
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:16,110
that kid was trying to say
that, blah, blah, blah, blah.

240
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:20,470
I couldn't remember anything. I was like,
Oh yeah, you okay? I was like, Oh, I,

241
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,730
uh, and he just started to walk away and
I walked away in the other direction.

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,370
And then we both looked over
our shoulder at the same time.

243
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,260
And then that was it. I got in the
fucking u hall and that was it.

244
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,510
He came back to the neighborhood
like four years later.

245
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,730
I saw him one of the
Times. So yeah, 1980. Yes.

246
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,510
Cause I left in 76 some in 80 and then
I hadn't seen him since then. So, uh,

247
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,140
we got caught up talking about
the old fucking times. Man.

248
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,030
We didn't even get into it
either. Man. Jesus Christ,

249
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:51,240
some of the shit we used to do, you know,
we used to play with fucking matches.

250
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,420
That's what you used to do
back then when there was like,

251
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:56,330
like playing with matches
was like, I don't know,

252
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:59,690
like having a game boy or whatever
these fucking kids do nowadays.

253
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,300
And His dad had these things we would,

254
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,430
they would call them monkey matches.
That was just a book of matches.

255
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,510
And for some reason they,

256
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:11,960
it just had a picture of a monkey
like wearing like a hat. Like,

257
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,360
like that was like
highbrow humor back then,

258
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,450
like dress and monkeys up
like human beings, you know.

259
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,570
And also having pictures of
dogs playing poker and Shit,

260
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,860
passing cards underneath the table
with their paws and shit, you know.

261
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,170
So his dad for whatever reason,

262
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:30,200
always had these matchbooks that had
pictures of monkeys that would like,

263
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,200
you know, dress like dentists, you know,

264
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,060
like lab coats on and shit or just
some stupid fucking hat, you know.

265
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,060
And uh, so we would,
this is what we would do.

266
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:46,061
We would go over and we would
like basically underneath
the tree we would bunch

267
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:51,101
up a bunch of pine needles and you would
just light it on fire and just look at

268
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:56,300
the fire and then try and
put it out. And um, you know,

269
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,520
sometimes you put it out,
sometimes you didn't.

270
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,620
Sometimes a neighbor would
come run it over cars.

271
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,420
Let the fucking you kids though. Yo
Dahlia don't. Um, I did that one time.

272
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,540
I lit it and all of a sudden it
just got completely out of control.

273
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,500
And this guy came running
over the giant trashcan.

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,100
They had filled up with water.
Thank fucking Christ and um,

275
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,150
and then somebody else in
the neighborhood, I remember
fucking lit it on fire.

276
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:25,100
Let the whole fucking woods
on fire. And uh, I know,

277
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,210
I know it was two because he rode
down to the fire station and,

278
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,900
and said that he didn't do it,

279
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,590
but he knows that he knew that my friend
did it and he fucking ratted out my

280
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:33,921
friend.

281
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,680
And I'm sure the fire department was
looking at the kid looking at him like,

282
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,940
listen, you little rat, we know
you fucking did it. Right. Um,

283
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,330
so whatever was cool to see him. And um,

284
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,200
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. I,

285
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,170
I hate doing this thing after I've
been on a fucking plane, you know. Oh,

286
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:53,420
you know, I watched on the
plane for the second time,

287
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:56,150
I saw the movie a black mask, you know,

288
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,210
I know that that Kinda got mixed
reviews. That's one of those movies.

289
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,760
You got to see it more than
once. See it the second time.

290
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,640
The Johnny Depp is fucking
unbelievable in that movie.

291
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,710
He's unfucking believable. And, um,
there's a couple of actors here.

292
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,200
I got to get their fucking names.
They were absolutely amazing, but, uh,

293
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,300
I liked it the first time. I loved
it the second time I saw it. So, um,

294
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,880
you know, I know I, but most people
I heard from were from Massachusetts.

295
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,890
They're like, dude, fucking xs. You
just shut the fuck up. You know,

296
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,580
when I went to Fargo, they were bitching
about the fucking accents in Fargo.

297
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,380
Does that mean Fargo is a bad movie?
I want to, why don't we hire you,

298
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,640
who's not an actor?

299
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,350
We'll have you fucking do it and
we'll see how that works out. But, um,

300
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,380
I just felt, you know, the second time
when I saw it, like the pacing of it,

301
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,190
I felt like they tied it in to like the
absolute sociopath main character that

302
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,360
they will try, you're fucked up is
I'm nervous about talking about this,

303
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,960
the level of power that those
fucking guys had. Um, his,

304
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:57,330
he reminded me of the Shawshank
redemption where a lot of people,

305
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:00,510
I know the first time they saw that
they didn't like that movie because they

306
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:04,470
felt it was so long and was dragging
on and on and on and on. But, um,

307
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:05,920
my,

308
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,870
my theory on that movie was they were
giving you the sense of what it was like

309
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:14,310
to do time where it becomes
like this open ended thing.

310
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,230
No beginning, no middle, no end.

311
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,350
It actually sounds like I'm
shitting on the movie, but it just,

312
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,400
the way it would fade down and then
just fade up and every time in the crowd

313
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,630
you'd like be anticipating that there'd
be this major turn and it was just

314
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:31,950
another day in prison.
A few years later. Um,

315
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,600
I kind of felt like they were trying to
do that with the weighty bulgy character

316
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,210
where, um, you know, they were saying
like, he was a sociopath, like they,

317
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,220
and how he slowly drew in the FBI guys
to the point that they were entangled in

318
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:50,310
his bullshit. Um, and he
insulated himself that way.

319
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,420
I really, I dunno, maybe I was too dumb
to get all of that shit the first time,

320
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,820
but the second time I
watched it, like I said,

321
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:01,500
I went from liking that movie to fucking
loving that movie. So, um, whatever.

322
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,360
Give it a shot if you haven't,

323
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:08,390
but I'm speaking of which
the fucking Oscars well,

324
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:14,310
last night, huh? White
guys fucking crushing it.

325
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,410
Oh, we fucking sweet.
Cleaned up last night.

326
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,130
I'm just fucking with you man.
That was a, a, I only got to see,

327
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:31,920
I got to see Chris Rock's opening
monologue, which I thought was great.

328
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,140
I thought he handled the
whole thing fucking perfectly.

329
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,793
Um,

330
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,630
and uh, what else did I see?

331
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,700
I didn't see a lot cause right as
it started, the show was starting.

332
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,730
I think we had a nine o'clock show. We
started a little bit after eight, but,

333
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,860
um, I have no idea who won what.

334
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,810
I know the Boston movie about the
fucking pedophile priest. I heard that,

335
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:54,644
that thing one,

336
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,203
um,

337
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,890
that was it. Nobody fell
down. Nothing else happened,

338
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,063
right.

339
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,280
Oh, very quietly. The
first, uh, Asian director,

340
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:11,480
I believe ever fucking won something. Is
that what I saw? I don't know. This is,

341
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,880
you know, just a recurrent thing.
I'm not going to look anything up.

342
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,840
I'm just going to start talking about
it and uh, you know, that's gonna be it.

343
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,550
Okay.

344
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,840
You know what, I don't understand.

345
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:25,010
Like I don't understand the weight
that people put on the fucking Oscar.

346
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:27,720
So I really got to tell you that
though. You know what I mean?

347
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,160
Okay.

348
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,920
I just don't, I don't fucking get
it. I was joking this weekend,

349
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:37,070
like just sitting there watching a bunch
of adults running around wanting to win

350
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:40,370
a trophy. It's like, well, what
are you fucking little league

351
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,090
trophies are for kids, aren't they?

352
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,230
You have ribbons and shit and it makes
them feel good and you'd take them out

353
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,740
for a fucking snow cone and then that's
it. You know, you put them to bed,

354
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:54,400
you get yourself a whiskey and you sit
there and you stare at the wall and

355
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,010
that's basically your life. I mean,
why would he, how old are you?

356
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,890
You need a fucking
trophy. Um, yeah. I don't,

357
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,050
I don't give a shit about like
that type of stuff, but I,

358
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:05,200
I definitely think that there should
be opportunity for everybody. You know,

359
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,490
I'd like to hear everybody's stories. Um,

360
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,430
so I had no problem with
any of that shit. Um,

361
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,000
but I do just think it's funny that
people fucking flip out and start crying

362
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,740
about winning a goddamn trophy. And
this trophy means more than natural fee.

363
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,490
This one's more prestigious.
Um, alright, let's,

364
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,180
I gotta do a couple reads here for this
week. The fuck am I clicking on there?

365
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:32,940
All right. Um, Jesus Christ,

bar.

450
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,710
All right. And with that, it's
mercifully over smart. Softly over.

451
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,450
Um, all right. I don't
know if you guys know this,

452
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:49,470
but I guess they're working on cars that
are going to drive themselves in the

453
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:52,830
future. Um, I don't know why.

454
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,940
I mean, how fucking lazy are
people going to get? I mean,

455
00:26:56,941 --> 00:27:01,020
it's going to be great for drinking and
driving. It just be drinking and riding.

456
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,830
You know, you, all of a sudden you'll
always have that fucking thing, right?

457
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,690
I don't, I don't like this man.

458
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,920
I don't like how everything's
becoming fucking automated. You know?

459
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,730
I feel like rich people have
gradually phasing us out,

460
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,343
you know,

461
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,640
cause you know God damn well the only
reason why they allow us to exist is

462
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,850
because they need us to farm, right?

463
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,720
They need us to deliver shit. They
need us to do a bunch of shit.

464
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:29,760
And I guy could add another
example. I don't know,

465
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,980
dance around like a monkey
at a fucking casino.

466
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,690
Come downstairs to say a couple of words
that your little fucking Illuminati

467
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:39,000
party in the basement.
They need us to do that.

468
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,040
But once everything is automated and
it just handles it, it's fucking self.

469
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,870
Okay.

470
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,370
Do you think you could
be a part of that group?

471
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:50,130
What if you were part of a group that
was just going to slowly fucking just

472
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,920
phase everybody else out? You know,

473
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,830
and some hours would
happen in your lifetime.

474
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,380
All right

475
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,690
Mike, who would you keep these
free Hitler s type questions.

476
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:06,050
But this is the type of fucking madness
that I think everybody's capable of.

477
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,750
You know, especially, um, I don't
know if you travel on the road,

478
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:13,230
some of the dope should fucking meet out
there. Watch people getting stirred up.

479
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:14,460
You know, in all honesty,

480
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,700
I can't stand like the choices that we
have for president right now, you know,

481
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,830
is it starts to go towards
as a fucking torpedo, uh,

482
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,710
that fucking St Bernard Looking Guy,
Bernie Sanders, right? His javas.

483
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,200
Um, as a torpedo, his fucking campaign
and all democrats are walking around,

484
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,420
he can't win. He can't win.
I love that. I love it. Yeah.

485
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,930
Cause you're too much of a pussy to
fucking vote from. That's why, right?

486
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,640
So you're going to vote for this fucking,

487
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,410
this clammy fucking crook or this guy
who isn't saying anything, but like,

488
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:44,490
I really believe that, you know,

489
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,130
you could talk people into fucking
wiping out everybody on the planet.

490
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,340
He very easily just
listening to Donald Trump,

491
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,240
his speeches where he just says
absolutely nothing. Do you know,

492
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:56,930
he said today he was talking to college
graduates and he's literally go with

493
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,750
[inaudible]. I'm going to bring jobs
back to the United States. You wait,

494
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:04,570
there's going to be more jobs
here by the time I'm done.

495
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:07,150
It's going to make your head
spin. I'm going to have,

496
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,300
I'm going to have apple
bring manufacturing jobs
back from China to here.

497
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,060
Okay. And people clapped.

498
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,890
He never has to say how
he's going to do all,

499
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,850
I'm gonna plug up the hole in the
ozone layer. Water's going to be clear.

500
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,290
I'm going to get rid of all terrorism
and that's going to be the first week.

501
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,273
Woo.

502
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,710
I like this guy. This guy makes
sense. He's making it great again.

503
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,160
You know, and then you
got Hillary. I'll just,

504
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,690
just talks through her fucking
teeth. It's like she, you know,

505
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,210
she looks like she should be
doing like a ventriloquist act,

506
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,530
but the puppet isn't. Um,

507
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,070
that's cute. Fucking, I dunno.

508
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,820
I have no, I don't know. I
don't fucking know. No idea.

509
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,200
And I don't even know
who the other guys are.

510
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,640
I just heard a couple of them talking,

511
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:03,370
trying to trash Donald Trump and
they just, they sounded pathetic.

512
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,730
Just not good speakers. This is just a,
this is a bad one is a bad one. Yeah.

513
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,410
I've got bet people
watching, you know, you know,

514
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,500
if you've got a great college program
and a bunch of seniors fucking graduate

515
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,590
graduate and you just, you know, you
just go through a bad four year period.

516
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,050
I think that's what we're coming
through. We're coming out of right now.

517
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,960
You know, like this one guy who was seen,

518
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,090
he was going to get rid of
Obamacare if he was elected.

519
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,150
And people like applauding, like
I, I just, I don't fucking get it.

520
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,360
I don't get why I don't
even, I don't have Obamacare.

521
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,720
I guess my tax dollars paid for it, but
I don't have any problem with somebody.

522
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,910
Like, I don't want it.

523
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:40,310
My fellow countrymen walking around
with a fucking toothache, you know,

524
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,280
they just spleen removed. Fuck
you. Figure it out for yourself.

525
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,730
Why don't we help each other out a little
more? You know, why can we do that?

526
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:51,730
And if felt like anybody
needs this, split them out.

527
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,470
Donald Trump, I bet I could run.

528
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,050
I could run for president if that's all
you gotta do is just say you're going to

529
00:30:58,051 --> 00:31:00,060
do all this awesome shit.
You never fucking do it.

530
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,650
Everyone will have healthcare and
it will be free. All right. Um,

531
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,330
okay.

532
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,090
Oh, this weekend, by the way,
all the self driving cars,

533
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:10,350
let's get back to that fucking thing.

534
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,870
So evidently some self
driving car hit a bus,

535
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,520
which is fucking tremendous
for anybody who loves driving.

536
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,330
That is such a tremendous fucking thing
that happened today or yesterday or

537
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:26,300
maybe last year. All I know is
I just found the fucking story.

538
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,950
I'm so fucking psyched.

539
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,870
So the self driving car hit the
fucking hit the fucking bus.

540
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:35,210
I mean it even though it was only
going like two miles an hour,

541
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,230
it's just so fucking great
because it hit a bus.

542
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,950
So all you gotta say is just, you
know, just be like, well what if,

543
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:47,360
what if there was a bunch
of kids on that bus? Right.

544
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:51,200
And then that'll delay it a
good 20 fucking years. Um,

545
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,680
let me see if I can find
this story. Self driving.

546
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,950
Google says it bears some responsibility
after self driving car hits bus.

547
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,470
Okay.

548
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,150
Can you fucking believe
that? What was there,

549
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,950
was there a person driving the
bus? I would say that you, you,

550
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:08,730
you have all the fucking responsibility.

551
00:32:08,731 --> 00:32:11,130
Unless this guy literally
drove into the fucking thing.

552
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,080
Alphabet incorporate, incorporate
a Google set on Monday.

553
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:21,030
It bears some responsibility after one
of its self driving cars struck a menu,

554
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,690
municipal bus in a minor
crash earlier this month,

555
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,910
the crash may be the first case of one
of its autumn autonomous cars hitting

556
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:33,240
another vehicle and the fault
of the self driving car.

557
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,510
Dude, this is going to be a shit show.

558
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,850
This is just one and had
already hit a fucking bus.

559
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,940
You know what I mean? That's fucking,
that's lunacy. It's fucking lunacy man.

560
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,860
I will tell you it. I
mean I think it'll, it'll,

561
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,720
it will cause people to drink like
they've never drank before. I mean

562
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,860
have most nights. I don't drink
out of here because I, you know,

563
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,800
I drive myself places, you
know, I don't fucking Uber.

564
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,890
Well that'll put Uber
out of business. Right?

565
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,820
Well I guess if you don't
have a fucking car, I dunno.

566
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,820
Don't you guys like driving?
I'll be at like the option,

567
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,640
my thing is how is the
Insurance gonna work?

568
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,730
Cause you know God damn well there's
no way the insurance company's going to

569
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:24,110
take that fucking liability on and that
they're claiming they're going to get

570
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:27,530
rid of. There'll be no more
deaths from car accidents.

571
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,990
It's going to be no more
accidents. It's just going to be,

572
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:33,530
it's going to be like just accident free.

573
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,240
This is amazing to me that this debt,

574
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,850
it's gotten this fucking far considering,

575
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,640
you know that like the amount of times
they tried to kill the electric car,

576
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,700
right? And you know, big oil
companies, that type of thing.

577
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,030
You mean you fucking with it. They have
blue blood money going out. Having that,

578
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,930
let's go electrocute an elephant to show
how fucking dangerous these cars are.

579
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,640
Right? So

580
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,310
like this is the only thing I can think
of what these insurance companies,

581
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:09,350
they're making enough money to go down
there and whack somebody at ABC Inc.

582
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,130
Right? You know, they
fucking do shit like that.

583
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,720
And you go to a diner and all of
a sudden you stagger outgoing.

584
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,960
They poisoned me and he'd do a face
plant. Then your invention disappears.

585
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,240
Oh I'm going down the rabbit hole.

586
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,500
This is why I think they are letting
this one go through cause they're

587
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:27,650
eventually going to get rid of all of us
and when they do that they're going to

588
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:31,820
have no more limo drivers. So
they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

589
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,130
What are we going to do in the
future if we want a Rudge somewhere?

590
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:41,131
I mean I'm not going to drive my
car and soil my wealthy hands Elmo.

591
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,310
And then somebody is like,
well what if we just had,

592
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,310
we'll just make the cars drive themselves.

593
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,900
Oh, okay then. Okay. Kill
them all then. Yes, thank you.

594
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,020
Poison them, remove them
from the point on it.

595
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,300
Um, I wonder if they got rid of everybody,

596
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:59,630
how long it would take for this
phone, you know, to go back to,

597
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,670
normally you have to take all the
nuclear waste, right? Just send it out,

598
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,110
you know, out in the fucking
space. Right. Send it towards Mars.

599
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:13,610
Just make sure you don't hit the moon
and all you do is just fucking chill out.

600
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,230
Nearly a little house. And when I
along it would take to undo all Abbott.

601
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,310
All is shit that people
leave behind. You know,

602
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,980
fucking going to deal with all of that.

603
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:28,120
That's all going to go into
the soil and take a, he ain't,

604
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,270
I wouldn't happen in your
lifetime. Jesus Christ.

605
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:35,210
I am all over the place, man. What
the fuck am I talking about here?

606
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,360
The murdering people, self driving
cars used to see this fucking car.

607
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:42,400
By the way, this fucking self driving car,

608
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,660
it makes the Volkswagen beetle
look like a Goddamn Lamborghini.

609
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,910
People on the Simpsons drive a better
looking car than that fucking thing.

610
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,440
Oh, you know, they're all gonna be
the exact same fucking one, right?

611
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,430
You'll have your options of like
three different colors, like white,

612
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,140
black or beige.

613
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,250
Oh Man, this is not uplifting. I'll
tell you what's uplifting. March 5th,

614
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,530
this weekend, UFC one
96. Conor McGregor, um,

615
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,220
UFC one 96. What are they
calling this one? Did they,

616
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,110
did they stop naming
them though, by the way?

617
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,730
To have they come up with
196 adjectives that, that,

618
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,910
that describe how fucking tremendous
that sports, that sport is.

619
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,550
You know, you have c 12, the
redemption, the revenge or whatever.

620
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:38,280
They always had like these cool fucking
names up to once you get up to like one

621
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:41,280
96, they gotta be running out. Right.

622
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,860
Let me see what they got here.

623
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,960
UFC one 96 Conor McGregor versus some
Guy Dia's I wish I knew these guys names

624
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,860
better. You know, there's only so
much shit I can pay attention to.

625
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,890
Um, these taking on late replacement,
Nate DHEAS. Ah, Jesus. What happened?

626
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:03,360
He was supposed to fight somebody else.

627
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,310
Rafio I'm not going to fucking insulted
Latinas by trying to pronounce it,

628
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,930
although I could give
you a good laugh here.

629
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,370
Rafi el Dos anules Raphael sign yells.

630
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,300
I'm was from his showdown against
Connor with a broken foot out.

631
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:24,750
F it the fuck. Do you know I was
reading something on McGregor today?

632
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:27,000
Do you know? I don't understand. I
don't. Somebody in the fight game,

633
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:31,770
please explain this to me. That guy
walks around at one 70 and he shredded

634
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,910
and then before his fight
for whatever fucking reason,

635
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,400
he's got to go down to one 45.

636
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:44,330
Now I can understand if the other guy
just walks around at one 45 or maybe one

637
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:48,540
55 and Connor for whatever reason,

638
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,030
just wants to beat the
fuck out of the guy.

639
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,690
So he's willing to starve himself
down to one 45 for the love of God.

640
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:59,070
Can anybody in the fight game that
let that does this, why can't,

641
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,053
you know,

642
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,360
if Carter walks around at one 70 and the
other guy's walking around at one 65,

643
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,580
why don't they just fight it like one 60?

644
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,240
Why do they got to bring everybody
all the way the fuck down there? I, I,

645
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,050
I just don't understand why
they got to do that shit. Um,

646
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,780
check out the sports illustrated
article on, uh, on Conor McGregor.

647
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,280
They got like this whole thing where
the only briefly talk about it, uh,

648
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,970
but they're talking about cutting weight
and it actually sounds in a lot of

649
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:33,620
ways, worse than the fight, like talking
about the pain and the agony of it.

650
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:34,940
And it's, I, I can't even, uh,

651
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:37,960
I'm not going to be able to do it
justice because I just read it.

652
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,130
I have a very poor memory and I've
never gone through it. But, uh,

653
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,360
Holly Holmes also fighting
against, uh, Meesha tape and, uh,

654
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,750
I'm taking the night off of stand
up and I'm going to fucking hang it.

655
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:49,450
You know what's great?

656
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,630
This is the one sport that I
can really watch my wife like,

657
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,750
she likes going to live hoop too,
but she loves the fucking UFC.

658
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,710
She gets into it like at a crazy level.
Like that time when that guy kicked, uh,

659
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,420
kicked the other dude and he had
the compound fracture, you know,

660
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,000
and his fucking leg bent all
the way back. I was just like,

661
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:10,300
I walked out and my guy done
done. I can't watch that. She,

662
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,390
she was rewinding it, wanting
to watch it again and was like,

663
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,350
like literally interested in it. Um,

664
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,570
which means she either should have
been a serial killer or gotten into the

665
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:22,960
medical field because if you
can fucking stomach that, um,

666
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,550
either way I can, I'm, I'm really
excited to see this shit this weekend.

667
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,280
I like it. Even if they're quick
fights, even though if it's a bad thing,

668
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,000
does it make you at least want to workout?

669
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,530
You see those guys and fucking
women getting in there,

670
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,940
they're all fucking jacked.
You look down at yourself,

671
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,010
usually finishing off
a pizza. You're like,

672
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:42,220
what the fuck am I doing going
down to Home Depot tomorrow?

673
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:45,370
I'll get a sledgehammer and
a big fucking tire, you know,

674
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,890
and you know what you're doing for
a couple of days and then you quit.

675
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,360
And that's why you're not a champion.

676
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,270
Like what you're going to see on
fucking Saturday. There you go.

677
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:57,070
There's my promo for
the UFC. Um, all right,

678
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,070
let's, uh, let's, let's read some
fucking letters for this week. Shall We?

679
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:03,340
Everybody, chances are because

680
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,080
Cleo, you're losing
your figure sweetheart.

681
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,290
Glad you didn't walk the red carpet
at the, uh, at the fucking Oscars.

682
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:18,940
They would've been all over you. All
right. Leaving the country of Trump wins.

683
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,010
Dear Billy elect,

684
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,940
what's your take on people who say
they're going to leave the comp country if

685
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,950
Trump wins, uh,

686
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:30,310
besides the potential for lanes
to open up on the highway?

687
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:33,850
I just hope the people that say
they're going to leave leave,

688
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:38,410
so I don't have to point out
who's allying sec is shit. Um,

689
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,470
they're obviously joking. No one's
going to leave this country, but, uh,

690
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,880
it's just, you know, he's a
very extreme guy. You know.

691
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:47,530
I think people said that when Obama,

692
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,880
they definitely said it during George
Bush with some famous stars set it.

693
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:55,030
I remember, I thought it was like funny.

694
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:56,980
Then of course Fox News
is launch your league.

695
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:01,450
Why don't you get the fuck Outta here?
You know, like fucking lunacy. Um,

696
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,800
what do I think about people say that? I
think it's kind of Hacky at this point.

697
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:07,240
I think that's what everybody says.

698
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:12,220
When there's somebody that's on the
fringe on one side of the other,

699
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,410
somebody always ends up going
and you have to go, fucking went,

700
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,800
I'm going to leave. Where are you going
to go? This is what people forget.

701
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,580
When you, uh, when you
leave this country, you,

702
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,250
you immediately become an immigrant
who's taking somebody else's job in the

703
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:28,300
country that you're going to and
you get treated as such. You know,

704
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,240
even if you white, they don't want,

705
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,430
but they don't want Americans moving up
to Canada fucking with their population,

706
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,590
taking their jobs. You know,

707
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,220
all of a sudden you're standing this
drive and a spike into a tree to take out

708
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:43,730
some maple syrup instead of the
other guy. They don't want that.

709
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,860
They don't want that
at all. Um, all right.

710
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,520
Yeah, I just think they're just the
saying. I mean it's, it's fucking scary.

711
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,010
I mean, it's supposed scary.

712
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:59,480
I think Hillary is a fucking lion
sack. A Shit, a totally dishonest.

713
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,540
And I think a Donald Trump
is a reality show star.

714
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,740
That's the best we can fucking
do. I just don't fucking get it.

715
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,270
It keeps getting worse.

716
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:13,523
Okay.

717
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,840
Jay's is fucking the last guy.

718
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,150
Okay.

719
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,350
The last guy that I thought was decent
was the first George Bush. You know,

720
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,180
I like when he went into Kuwait and
then like he teach it. All right.

721
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:28,260
That's enough. That's enough.

722
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:30,770
He didn't go off fucking nuts
and we got the fuck out of there.

723
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,820
Okay.

724
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,330
You know, and then fucking
Clinton came in. I,

725
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,940
what the fuck down was a big frat party
where he's getting his dick sucked.

726
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:43,930
He's lying about shit. People got stuff
on them, mysteriously die. I mean,

727
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:44,860
it was fucking nuts.

728
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,370
Then he bombed some people to get
out of a fucking blow job accusation.

729
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,860
The whole fucking thing was, I don't
know. It's been crazy ever since. Um,

730
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,110
I don't know shit about politics. Don't
listen to me. All right. Boyfriends,

731
00:42:56,111 --> 00:43:00,670
smoking habit. Hey Mr Burr, love
the podcast and the stand up.

732
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,320
Come to Rochester, New York soon. Uh, I
would love all, you know what, you know,

733
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:09,820
what is a buffalo date and a
Syracuse state in the works.

734
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,590
Yes ma'am. Yes sir. Whatever. Wherever
this is writing this shit. Um,

735
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,440
uh, with the F I just scroll down,
sorry. Love the podcast and the stand up.

736
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:21,550
Come to Rochester, New York.

737
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,270
I would appreciate some advice from
yourself and the lovely Nia if she's

738
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:28,380
available. Uh, she ain't
here today, man. All right.

739
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,050
I've been with my boyfriend for
almost two years and since day one,

740
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,570
I knew of his daily weed smoking habit.

741
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,670
He doesn't let her let it hinder
his life. Still very social,

742
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,200
faithful, going to, going to
work every day. Uh, he scheduled,

743
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:47,320
he eats healthy and he goes to
the gym four to five days a week.

744
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,770
I've tried getting used to it, um,

745
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:55,270
since it's something that he does and
it, it isn't a problem in his life,

746
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,080
but I've never wanted
to try drugs or alcohol.

747
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:02,770
So I don't know what the feeling of
being under the influence of something is

748
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:06,280
like now because now, because of that,

749
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:11,281
my problem is unless I see him during
the day and even then he'll take a hit,

750
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,090
he's not sober.

751
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,710
Is it wrong of me to be concerned
that whenever he sees me,

752
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:20,530
he's under the influence of something? Uh,

753
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:22,870
whenever we go to the
movies or a comedy show,

754
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,040
he'll bring half a cookie so we
can quote, enjoy the show more.

755
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,220
And why don't I want him to relax after
work by vaping a and hanging out with

756
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:36,420
me. Considering this habit hasn't,
hasn't hindered his life in any way.

757
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,320
Do I have a reason to be uneasy about
this? I understand why he does it.

758
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,970
And he tells me it doesn't affect his
feeling about feelings about me and about

759
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:48,390
us being together, but it still makes
me uneasy whenever I know he's high.

760
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,783
Um,

761
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,330
yeah. Well, I mean if you don't like it,
you don't like it. And if he enjoys it,

762
00:44:55,331 --> 00:44:57,850
he enjoys it. So you both
know where you stand.

763
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,343
Um,

764
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,770
I gotta be honest. I mean, if
someone was drinking every day,

765
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,140
there would be probably
an issue with that.

766
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,850
Although there's no medicinal
purposes for a alcohol is there,

767
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,080
unless they're taking an
arrow out of your back,

768
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,190
don't think like rubbed some
on your gums or some shit.

769
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:18,470
I can't remember how it goes. You
take a shot. Is that what it is?

770
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:21,680
You bite down on a fucking
garden hose? I don't remember.

771
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,813
Um,

772
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,820
yeah. I mean if these getting fucking
begged all the time and he always,

773
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:31,120
you know, so he'll enjoy it more. Yeah,
that's a little bit of a red flag,

774
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:31,811
you know, honestly,

775
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:35,020
if you fucking doing it every day and
you're never really sober and you just

776
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:39,130
sort of constantly just sorta hi, um,

777
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,550
that's probably not a good way to go
through life, but it is his choice.

778
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,210
I would just tell him, just be like,
look, I'm not saying you can't smoke,

779
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:50,470
but like if you're high
all the time and I'm sober,

780
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,560
so I'm constantly talking
to a buzzed you and,

781
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,060
um, it bothers me.

782
00:45:59,450 --> 00:45:59,570
Okay.

783
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,810
I would just tell him that and I,

784
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:05,390
I think that it's gonna bother him
because when you fucking smoke weed like

785
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:09,600
that, it's a religion, you know what
I mean? It's not like, you know,

786
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,210
every day he comes home and
he does this one little thing,

787
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:15,450
puts his shoes in the
wrong spot or some shit.

788
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:19,110
This is like you're talking about his
state of consciousness when he's around

789
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:22,350
you at all fucking times. Basically.
You want him to alter that.

790
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:24,480
So that's some kind of a major change.

791
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,223
Um,

792
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,800
you didn't tell me how old he
was, but, um, I don't know.

793
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,730
I don't know much about weed. I know
some people say they get productive when,

794
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:40,400
when they're, when they're using it and
that type of stuff. But, uh, I dunno, I,

795
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:44,880
I really feel that, you know,
and this is somebody who's like,

796
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,090
realized that his drinking
is out of control again.

797
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:49,740
So I just thought I've stopped
for the last fucking three days.

798
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,303
Um,

799
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,520
I mean, I really have to
watch it with myself. Okay.

800
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:59,660
Because I have the kind
of job where, you know,

801
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,370
I can get fucked up every night
basically, and then sleeping the next day.

802
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:09,371
Now granted my career would suffer and
I wouldn't get anywhere and eventually,

803
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:11,930
you know, but I mean, I
could do some stuff before,

804
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:15,380
like I might career totally did a
fucking nosedive provided I didn't like,

805
00:47:15,381 --> 00:47:17,060
you know, do something stupid
like fucking, you know,

806
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:19,790
get behind the wheel of a
car, fucking assault somebody.

807
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,940
If I was just getting
drunk every day. Um, yeah,

808
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,260
that would affect where
I was in the business.

809
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:28,940
But it'd be like a long seven
year, like tapering off, you know,

810
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,260
back to doing the comedy vault
at Remington's in Boston,

811
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:35,200
which doesn't exist anymore. But, um,

812
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,940
you know, I, I don't
know, I just personally,

813
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,470
I know I really got to watch it in my, my,

814
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,590
my finger about people who smoke weed
is the fact that they could be on it and

815
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:50,630
nobody really knows. Like, you know,

816
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,250
when once they're high all
the time they're experienced
being high and they can

817
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:58,510
just go to work being high and,
uh, you can't do that drunk.

818
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,720
He can't go to work like, you
know, shotgun a beer and walk in.

819
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:05,620
People just know it just doesn't work. Um,

820
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,210
but I'm not exactly a hundred percent
exact against it the way I used to in the

821
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,100
early days of this podcast when
I didn't know a lot about it.

822
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:14,750
Now I'm understanding that
there's certain people,

823
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,810
you don't have to have really active
minds. They need to fucking chill out.

824
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:21,190
It's actually a great
thing, um, for them. But I,

825
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:24,110
I really think if you're doing it all
the fucking time like that, yeah. Like,

826
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:28,580
this is probably cause for an issue
there, you know, to bring it up like, hey,

827
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,750
you kind of fucking basically wasted
every time I talked to you. And then also,

828
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:35,660
you know, that whole thing, you know,

829
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,510
he brings half a cookie
so he can enjoy the show.

830
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:41,600
It's like you can't enjoy it
sober. Like those are kind of some,

831
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,960
um, red flags.

832
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:46,730
Hmm.

833
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,960
I Dunno. And I also think that you can
get addicted to that shit. You know,

834
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,240
I think, I think it guy is, to be
honest with you, people always say Nah,

835
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:59,290
you're not really addicted to it. Oh
yeah. You just do it every waking moment.

836
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,410
You can't fucking enjoy something
unless you're under the influence of it.

837
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,030
There's something there.

838
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:07,990
It's just because it's such a
mellow thing and it's not like a,

839
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,720
you know, I guy a bug and a buddy
of mine from back in the day, dude,

840
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:16,980
he's completely fucking
addicted to that shit. He says,

841
00:49:16,981 --> 00:49:21,480
I love weed cause it turns
my life into a movie. And um,

842
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,930
no, basically been high since we
were sophomores in high school. And,

843
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:32,680
uh, without a doubt it's fucked with
his memory. Without a doubt. Its,

844
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,810
it's fucked with his drive, you know,

845
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:41,450
I dunno, I understand.

846
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:46,100
Wanting to get fucked up every
day. Personally. It's fun.

847
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,700
It's think with weed, it's so easy,
a couple of puffs and then boom,

848
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:55,010
you're there, you know,
drink. It takes it off. Gee,

849
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,750
I've got to stop talking about
this. I'm going to have a drink.

850
00:49:56,751 --> 00:50:00,170
I'd set up to take a week off here, so.
All right, well good luck with that.

851
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:04,990
I would just, I would just say how you're
feeling and um, if it gives, you know,

852
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,950
gives you shit back, I'd just
be like, look, give me, I'm,

853
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,840
I'm not being an asshole here.
You just like, you high every day.

854
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,650
Can you just like not be
high a couple of days a week?

855
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,830
Like how do you do that and not feel
like you're infringing on this guy's

856
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:20,380
fucking lifestyle? I mean, it's, I
dunno, I would bring it up to him.

857
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,010
As I said 20 minutes ago before
I meandered my way through that.

858
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:27,190
Sorry about that. All right,
I fucked up. Please advise.

859
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,340
Dear Billy ginger cakes. I
have a 26 year old fucking

860
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:37,340
lady who is a tremendous fan of your
work in all its glorious forms. Well,

861
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:38,330
thank you very much.

862
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,900
A that seen enough as for family with the
dad balls when bill is stuck under the

863
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:47,540
bed is the funniest fucking thing I've
ever seen. Brilliant. Well thank you.

864
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,510
I appreciate that. Um, I did.

865
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,700
I did something really then.

866
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:57,701
All capital's really dumb and I would
greatly appreciate your insight because I

867
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:02,350
know you will tell me the ever elusive
truth. I won't tell you why I won't.

868
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,420
I'll tell you what I think is the
truth, whether it's the right answer.

869
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:07,010
You got it. You got to
decide that for yourself.

870
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:10,640
I had been friends with this guy for
about two years and now you're fucked them

871
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,220
in. You ruin the friendship. That's
what I'm, that's what I'm guessing here.

872
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,710
We met through a larger group of friends.

873
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,510
There was chemistry between
us immediately. This guy,
his Sophie's married,

874
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,950
try and see where, how, how the, how
this can go off the rails. This are,

875
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:28,010
this is reading in the beginning, like
one of those dating sites, you know,

876
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:31,700
they play that stupid piano.
Hulu do, but do, do that stupid

877
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:35,343
woo

878
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:40,730
dumb shit. Let's see. Area killer.

879
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,820
This could be a sex
offender. I don't know.

880
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,960
No. Whoa. Uh, we met
through a larger, larger

881
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,960
group of friends. There was
chemistry between us immediately.

882
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,830
This guy is so funny and so
smart and fun to be around.

883
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,810
The problem is he has two penises.
I'm kidding. She didn't write that.

884
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,920
But he's also a complete
and total whore. Oh, Jesus.

885
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,570
Crushing it and good for him, but
exactly the wrong guy to get hung up on.

886
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,270
I knew I liked him too
much. I couldn't help it,

887
00:52:11,271 --> 00:52:14,840
but I thought I could handle being
friends, friends with him. And eventually,

888
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,660
eventually the feelings
would pass. Nah, Nah.

889
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:22,400
You can't be around guys like that. This
guy's a pussy getting son of a bitch.

890
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,960
Right. Dracula would be like, God
damn it. That guy's got game right.

891
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,970
And all the, all the ladies Love Dracula.

892
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,090
He'd come up and start knocking on
their fucking necks and that was it.

893
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,290
Tournament to lady bats. Right.
Then he kicked him to the curb,

894
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,380
get himself another
chick the next day. Um,

895
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,390
we started hanging out a lot, at least
two or three nights a week. Sometimes.

896
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:47,150
He said things that made me
think maybe he liked me too.

897
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,010
Then on my birthday we got
drunk and had sex called it. Oh,

898
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:56,480
Jesus. She says, let me
be clear. He started it.

899
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,800
I just didn't stop it even
though I knew it was a bad idea.

900
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,270
So like a little kid, he started it. Um,

901
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:10,070
the worst part is when I woke up the
next morning in his bed, in his bed,

902
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:14,570
he was gone. Oh Man.

903
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,390
He fled the fucking same bill.

904
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,160
The dude shaped hole in the door.

905
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,950
One told that he was freaked out.

906
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,860
The dude shaped hole in the door. He mean
even like Lilly ran through the door.

907
00:53:33,861 --> 00:53:36,440
I think he left some words out or
I'm too fucking old to understand,

908
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,170
is that some new slang. Uh,

909
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,490
told me he was too freaked out and decided
and I decided to give him some space.

910
00:53:43,491 --> 00:53:45,020
He called me four days later.

911
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,380
I don't remember the
conversation or were you drunk,

912
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,380
but he said he'd call me back.
That was four months ago.

913
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:54,710
Clearly he doesn't give
a shit. I get that,

914
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:59,510
but I cannot understand how we could be
so much in my life and then just never

915
00:53:59,511 --> 00:54:03,020
fucking talk to me again. The fuck dude.

916
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,510
The fuck you sound cool as
hell. By the way. The more,

917
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:10,400
the more immediate problem is that in
a few weeks a mutual friend is having a

918
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:13,640
birthday party and dude is going
to be, is going to be there.

919
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,150
What the fuck do I do, Bill? How
do I face him? Do I confront him?

920
00:54:17,151 --> 00:54:22,060
Do I ignore him? I'm bugging out. Please
help me. Thank you with any advice.

921
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,500
Um, the has got a God, I wish
she was here this week. Um,

922
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,630
all right, here's the deal.

923
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:31,680
Yeah.

924
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,770
All right. This isn't about him.
This is about you. All right.

925
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,820
Be honest with yourself. He kind of
said, you knew what this guy was.

926
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,380
You knew who he was. All right?
But he just had that fucking thing.

927
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,090
All right. He just had that fucking
charisma or whatever. And two years,

928
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,650
two years into it, you'd drunk.

929
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,190
He started it and you went
through with whatever, you know.

930
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,540
He got freaked out and confirmed what you
knew all the time and he fucking left.

931
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,610
All right. That'd be honest with
me. Do you want to fight that fight

932
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,830
before you met this guy and you
fantasized about the man you were going to

933
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:12,110
marry? Was this how it was
going to play out? Was this,

934
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,440
does this something that you
want to fucking deal with?

935
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:19,090
You realize you're going to have to like
trying to bring this fucking fish in

936
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,680
the amount of heartache,

937
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:25,090
the amount of extracurricular activities
and all that fucking shit that comes

938
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:28,840
along with a guy like this?
Well, why would you do that?

939
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:33,190
Why would you do that to yourself?
You don't need this shit. All right.

940
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:34,830
Okay.

941
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,350
The problem is is you're trying to, like,

942
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,500
you're trying to like figure out the
sanity in somebody insane behavior.

943
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,953
Okay?

944
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:52,730
You knew what he was and then he
confirmed it and now you're like, dude,

945
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:55,190
does he mean this? He said,
how could he just do that?

946
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:57,860
Because he's a fucking load
of tech. He's a load of tech.

947
00:55:57,861 --> 00:56:02,510
Who knows because his dad ran around on
his mom because his mom took off on his

948
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:05,330
dad. Who the fuck knows
cause they his bullshit,

949
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,920
his giant truck load of
fucking bullshit. Okay.

950
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:12,530
That he is still not
even begun to deal with,

951
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,530
which is why he's behaving
like that around you.

952
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,920
You don't fucking need that Jesus Christ.

953
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:24,160
All the guys in the fucking world go
to the party and have a good time.

954
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:26,120
Hm.

955
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,790
Just tell him just, you know, if
you see him, just say what's up.

956
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:33,140
No need to be weird.
Okay. It's over. Whatever.

957
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:36,370
Where we had a good time. It's
fucking over. I knew you were nuts.

958
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,970
Now you confirmed it. All right.

959
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,700
Stop fucking looking at me like
you've seen it go like I just,

960
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,500
I would just go there and have a
good time. I wouldn't ignore him.

961
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,390
I wouldn't confront him.

962
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,960
I would just say hello and then
I would go on what's happening?

963
00:56:50,961 --> 00:56:53,180
If he wants to talk, talk
to him. If he doesn't,

964
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,280
just go on with having a good
time. If you bumped into him again,

965
00:56:56,281 --> 00:57:00,200
say hello again, but don't let that
fucking guy ruin your good time.

966
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,773
All right.

967
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,120
And quit fucking wasting mental time
trying to figure out his bullshit.

968
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,310
He's not worth it. Fuck them. All
right. There you go. Fuck them. Hey,

969
00:57:13,311 --> 00:57:15,350
who knows? She might meet
Mr Right at that place.

970
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,723
Ooh. Wow.

971
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:21,480
Great everlasting love.
A documentary suggestion.

972
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,240
Dear Billy Boo,

973
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:28,440
if you haven't seen the documentary on
Netflix about the Ukraine revolution,

974
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,920
you should definitely check it
out. I would love to see that. Um,

975
00:57:31,921 --> 00:57:33,750
it's called winter on fire.

976
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,140
That sounds like a really bad 80 song.

977
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,573
Okay.

978
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:40,940
Where Gerrard Fi

979
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,920
what does that sell? Say it almost fire.
How I can fight some fucking Russians.

980
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,860
I don't like Vladimir Putin. I'm sorry.

981
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,360
And the immortal words of Ron
Burgundy. Wow. That escalated quickly.

982
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,670
My singing or the Ja, the documentary.

983
00:57:58,671 --> 00:58:03,230
It starts with some activists
deciding to congregate in one place,

984
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:08,150
which started as an event sent out on
Facebook and ended up replacing their

985
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:08,984
president.

986
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:11,943
[inaudible]

987
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,700
yeah. Every time I reached you like this,

988
00:58:13,701 --> 00:58:18,701
like I am amazed at the human spirit
and also feel so fucking lucky that I

989
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:21,380
haven't had to experience
that in a country. You know,

990
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,600
I I the country I live and we haven't
gone through some shit like that.

991
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,990
Hopefully it will never fucking happen
because I don't think I could stomach it.

992
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,260
You know, hearing when people
running up and down the street,

993
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,880
you're just sitting there in the house.

994
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,030
Okay.

995
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,500
Who was in charge?

996
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,250
Um,

997
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,990
the idea is so foreign to us and I think
most people don't understand just how

998
00:58:42,991 --> 00:58:45,930
crazy it is. Yeah. I mean I don't,
I'm trying to wrap my head around it,

999
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:48,390
but you are really good
at seeing crazy shit.

1000
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,730
No one notices that is
right under our noses.

1001
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,960
So I think you'll be floored by this.
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. What?

1002
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:57,790
Thank you for the a, the recommendation.
I will definitely try to, uh,

1003
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:01,410
check that out as soon as I can. Is that
all the shit? Is that all the fucking

1004
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:07,140
what am I up to here? 58
minutes and 56 seconds.

1005
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:12,000
I think I can bullshit for another
minute and call this a God damn day.

1006
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,600
Was there something else that I had
to talk about here on the podcast? Um,

1007
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,610
oh yeah. I decided, uh, I ran
into a buddy of mine and he, uh,

1008
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,540
told me his new year's
new year's resolution was,

1009
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:27,230
he wasn't going to argue with his wife
this year and he's made it all the way to

1010
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,280
February. I was like, you know what,

1011
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:33,260
that's a really cool resolution and
I haven't made any this year. So, um,

1012
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:38,000
I'm not giving up arguing with my
wife, uh, for two reasons. One,

1013
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,840
it would destroy my act into I'm
a selfish son of a bitch. Um,

1014
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,670
at first I have no control of my fucking
emotions. I don't, it's shameful,

1015
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:50,030
but I don't. Um, so I decided
instead of I'm going to,

1016
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:53,630
I'm trying to get back
into learning French. Uh,

1017
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:58,430
I feel like as I'm approaching, you
know, the mid century mark here,

1018
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:00,290
if I don't fucking do it
now, I'm going to be fucked.

1019
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:04,460
I'm never going to learn how to do it.
Um, so I'm fucking, I'm back into it.

1020
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:07,700
I'm on duo lingo. I've done it
three days in a fucking row.

1021
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,390
And the only reason why I'm announcing
it to you guys is because, yeah,

1022
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,770
if you don't hear me talking about it,

1023
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:15,770
please break my balls and say that
I fucking quit again. I'm a loser.

1024
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:19,120
And all that type of Sheldon wonderful
positive shit that you guys can see in

1025
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:24,350
knowledge anonymously
on the Internet. Um, oh,

1026
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:28,250
by the way, you know, you know it's
funny in this fucking business,

1027
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,780
like they never tell the performer shit.
Right? So I'm on stage this weekend.

1028
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,020
I got to ask you if there's
any doctors out there.

1029
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,540
I'm fucking onstage and I'm doing my
act. I don't even know what night it was.

1030
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:46,460
It might've been the first show last
night and the whole time I'm doing my act,

1031
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:47,750
everything I fucking say

1032
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,230
some guy in the crowd is just like
repeating it or commenting on it,

1033
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,640
you know what I mean? Like
not like heckling, it's more
like, like black church,

1034
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:01,880
like call and response. I
was like, yeah, you know,

1035
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:04,220
I was walking down the street the
other day and he says like, yeah,

1036
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,090
well I mean down the street, you know,
doing that shit the whole fucking time.

1037
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:12,410
But he's not so loud that the
rest of the crowd can hear it.

1038
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,940
Some hoping if I just ignore him,
he's going to stop and he does it.

1039
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,640
And finally after like a half
an hour, it's like, dude,

1040
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:20,690
will you shut the fuck up? You don't
have to fucking comment on everything.

1041
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,670
He like, all right. All right. All
right. He's just doing that shit,

1042
01:01:22,671 --> 01:01:23,390
but I love you.

1043
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:26,990
It takes saying shit like that and you
know I was trashing them and all that

1044
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:27,824
shit.

1045
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,920
So afterwards I ended up meeting him
after the show and he ended up telling me

1046
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:37,540
that he had Tourette's and then
somebody on the show go, yeah, yeah,

1047
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,470
you had Tourette's. We didn't know if
you should throw them out. It's like,

1048
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:43,760
why don't you fucking tell me that before
I make a fucking ass out of myself?

1049
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:47,300
I felt terrible. But here's my
question, is that a form of Tourette's?

1050
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,020
I thought Tourette's is either you're
cursing your brains out or you make weird

1051
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:54,500
noises or you do some
sort of physical tick.

1052
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,790
I didn't know that you fucking, all of
a sudden we're doing that, you know,

1053
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:01,220
I'm in a Baptist church, you know,

1054
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,370
except doing it in a way that
egs on the fucking speaker.

1055
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:06,950
It actually annoys the shit out of
it. Well, maybe that's my temperament.

1056
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:09,020
I have no idea. Um,

1057
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,380
that's my question for somebody
out there in the medical field,

1058
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:17,381
is that a form of Tourette's or was
he just trying to make me feel bad?

1059
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:22,350
I'm literally yawning here like
a fucking idiot. Um, all right.

1060
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:25,200
That's the podcast for
this week. Oh, Biz Billy.

1061
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:29,000
No booze bag is back on the
fucking wagon again. Um,

1062
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,860
I gotta tell you as much as I fucking go
up and down with that shit, at least I,

1063
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:36,300
I do nip it in the bud, you know?
I, uh, I just drank too much.

1064
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:41,070
Was it Friday night? Woke up,
fucking hung over, tired as shit.

1065
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:45,180
I was just like, what the fuck am I
doing to myself? This is stupid. And, um,

1066
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:49,500
then I watched black mask and I was
watching them drinking Budweisers in 1970s

1067
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:53,760
pull tab cans. And I was like, God,
I miss that. I miss it already.

1068
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,740
All right. All right. That's a
podcast for this week. Sorry. Uh,

01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:03,180

1075
