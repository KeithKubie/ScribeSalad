If you're on a hike, or caught in a survival
situation, it's really helpful to have containers

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.990
that are lightweight and weather resistant.
So in this project let's turn a couple of

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.550
empty soda bottles, into compact, lightweight,
and waterproof, soda cap containers.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.590
Let's start this project with a hotel key,
and a couple of plastic soda bottles. The

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.430
first thing we need to do is cut the tops
off, and if we turn them upside down and clamp

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.079
them in a bench vise, it should be incredibly
easy. Now if we use something like a hacksaw,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.539
we can use the bottom side of the flange as
a cutting guide, and the goal here is to make

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.629
the cut as clean as possible. When we're through
to the other side, let's double check the

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.530
flange to make sure it's completely flat,
and if there are any ridges, we can easily

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.510
shave them down with the saw blade. Now we're gonna need a second cap, and this time

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.409
I'm using a bottle with a black lid just for
a little variety. This should allow us to

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.549
color code the two ends of our container.
Now depending on your purpose, it could be

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.989
extremely important that the lids sit perfectly
together. And to make sure that happens, let's

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.719
go ahead and sand the bottoms with something
like 150 grit sandpaper, until they're perfectly

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.609
flat. They don't have to be smooth though.
In-fact, the rougher they are, they better

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.270
they're gonna bond with an epoxy. While
we're here it's a good idea to roughen both

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.500
sides of our hotel key as well, so let's go
ahead and do that, then carefully trace around

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.649
one of the caps with a marker. As we cut it
out, you can see we'll end up with a plastic

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.159
disc the exact same size as the caps, and
this will become the divider that splits our

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.250
container into two separate compartments.
Now to make this as strong and lightweight

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.960
as possible, let's try bonding it with a 2
part epoxy. This will need to be blended thoroughly

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.729
for about a minute to make sure it sets up
properly. Now, without wasting too much time,

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.729
let's apply a liberal amount of epoxy to the
base of the caps, then carefully set the round

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.659
divider on top, and press it into place. If
you already have epoxy on the other cap, just

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.899
join it to the other side of the divider,
and simply leave it to harden. In about 2

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.539
hours, your container will be firm enough
to handle, and a few hours after that, it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.359
should be fully ready to use. Now for an even
stronger bond, try clamping both caps so they

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.100
set together under pressure. If you don't
have a bench vise or a set of bar clamps,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.450
try using a rubber band to keep things tight
until the epoxy hardens. You can see here

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.690
how the epoxy at the bottom has completely
sealed everything off. That means this container

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.310
will hold two different items, and keep them
completely separate. Now I added some special

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.360
ingredients to mine and tucked it away in
one of our first-aid kits to help out in emergency

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.920
situations. This will give us the power to
ignite a survival fire, without ever having

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.700
to strike a match. Look for how this works
in the matchless survival fire project.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.200
I also tried another variation and found the
simplest container could be made with 2 caps

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.840
and some hot glue. It won't be as strong,
but you can make them start to finish in under

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.310
3 minutes. This version is still super lightweight,
water resistant, and will work really well

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.930
for storing things like pills or small candies.
You can see it's hollow all the way through,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.060
so the contents can be accessed from either
end. This works well to protect your matches

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.019
from the elements, or even make improvised
hide and seek containers for geocaching. If

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.599
the container ever does get wet, everything
inside will be kept safe and dry. Now both

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.280
variations weigh only half an ounce, or about
14 grams, but they can they still hold up

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.299
to 10 ml of fluid, which is the same amount
as both of these glass bottles put together.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.189
By the way, if you epoxy the two bottles end
to end, you'll have another variation that

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.430
still looks really cool, and will last for
a really long time. Well now you know how

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.950
to turn two empty soda bottles, into lightweight,
multipurpose containers, that don't really

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.310
cost anything to make, but will do a great
job protecting your stuff. Well that's it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.079
for now. If you liked this project, perhaps
you'll like some of my others. Check them
