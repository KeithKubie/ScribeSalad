00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.610
These issues and difficulties can result in requirements

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.780
that show various problems. Two particularly relevant and

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.880
common problems are completeness and pertinence. Or better,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.750
the lack of completeness and pertinence. Completeness refers to

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.560
the fact that it is often extremely difficult

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.370
to identify all of the requirements. That is it

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.890
is very difficult to have a complete picture

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.780
of the purpose of the software. So what happens

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.540
is that incomplete requirements are collected and the software

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.500
is missing functionality that is important for the user. Pertinence

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.720
conversely has to do with the relevance of the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.770
requirements. To avoid completeness problems developers often end up collecting

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.640
a lot of irrelevant when not conflicting requirements. In

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.060
these cases what can happen is that the software could

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.120
either end up being bloated that is it might

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.290
contain a needed functionality. The functionality represented by these extra

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.120
requirements or it might even be impossible to build the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.480
software due to the conflicting additional requirements. And to make

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.920
things even worse collecting all of these requirements sometimes doesn't

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.390
even solve the completeness issue. So you might end up

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.800
with a set of requirements that is not only incomplete

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.740
but it also contains extra information that can be harmful

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.450
to the system. So again the bottom line is that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.310
gathering an adequate, accurate, complete,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.500
and pertinent set of requirements that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.100
identify the purpose of a software system is an arduous task.
