00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.070
We're asked to
graph the function

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.710
f of x is equal to 5x minus 4.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.540
And we'll do it by really
just sampling some points

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.825
from the domain and seeing
what value our function takes.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:13.450
And then we'll just
graph those points.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.620
And then we'll connect the
dots and see what forms.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.040
And there's other
ways to do this,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.391
but this is the most simple
or the most basic way.

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:22.390
So if you look at this
function right over here,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.320
it's actually defined
for any real number

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.760
that you stick there for x.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.080
So when we talk about
sampling the domain,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.631
we can actually pick
any real number for x.

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.464
I'm actually going to
pick real numbers that

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.960
are fairly small in magnitude
so that they're easy to graph.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.080
So I don't have to plot 8
billion on a number line

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.630
over here.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.740
So let's draw ourselves
some simple graph paper.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.780
Let's call that the x-axis.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.050
Let's call that the
y-axis, or, actually, I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.820
should call it the y
is equal to f of x.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.590
Whatever my x is, I input it
into this function definition.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.650
It'll tell me what
the function value is.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.640
It'll tell me f of x.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.050
And we're going to say
y is equal to that.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.000
Now let's draw a little table
here to try out some values.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.910
So let's say that this is x
values and then this is f of x.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.610
And I can even say this
is my y values, which

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.010
are going to be equal to f of x.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.210
So let's start with-- I'm
going to try negative 2,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.390
negative 1, 0, 1, and 2.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.300
So let's try negative 2 first.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.810
if x is equal to negative
2, what is f of x?

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.330
Well, f of x is going to be
5 times negative 2 minus 4.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.230
So it's 5 times
negative 2 minus 4,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.220
which is equal to negative 10
minus 4, which is negative 14.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.880
So let me plot that over here.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.550
And let me-- actually,
maybe I'm going

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.950
to have a slightly
more scrunched up scale

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.860
on the y-axis.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.130
And, actually, let me
give myself some space

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.560
so that I can go further down.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.450
Let me clear this.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.350
Give myself a
little bit of space.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.975
So I have a feeling that I'll be
using a lot of negative values

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:06.270
since I just got all the
way down to negative 14.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150
So let me go further down here.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.590
And then let me mark off
some increments over here.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.580
So let's say that
this is negative 5.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.780
This is negative 10.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.650
And this is negative 15.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.590
And then this would
be positive 5.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.240
And then this would
be positive 10.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:39.710
So we have when x is negative 2,
f of x is equal to negative 14,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.070
which is right about there.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.580
So that is negative 14.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.720
So that right over there
is the point negative 2,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.400
negative 14, which we
got right from that.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.990
Now, let's try another point.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.861
Let's try negative 1.

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:58.900
When x is negative 1, f of x
is 5 times negative 1 minus 4.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.160
5 times negative 1 is negative
5, minus 4 is negative 9.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.200
So when x is negative1,
f of x is negative 9.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.640
So negative 9 is
right about here.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.610
So this is negative 9.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.950
So this is the point
negative 1 negative 9

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.910
that is on the graph of f of x.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.900
And now let's try 0.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.780
When x is 0, f of x is going
to be 5 times 0 minus 4.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.950
Well, that's just 0 minus 4,
which is equal to negative 4.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.850
So when x is 0, f of x
is equal to negative 4.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.660
So that's negative
4 right over there.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.326
And actually, our point is going
to be sitting right over there.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:43.835
That is 0, negative 4.

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:45.510
I wrote it to the
left of the point.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.070
Let's keep going.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.290
Let's what happens
when x is equal to 1.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.490
When x is equal to 1, f of x
is equal to 5 times 1 minus 4.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.050
5 times 1 is 5 ,
minus 4 is equal to 1.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.190
So we get to the point 1,1.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.440
So 1 and then 1 is
right about there.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.840
So this is the point 1,1.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.750
And then let's
just try one more.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.590
Let's see what happens
when x is equal to 2.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.370
Then, f of x is 5 times 2
minus 4, which is 10 minus 4,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.090
which is equal to 6.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.630
So we have when x is equal
to 2, f of x is equal to 6.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.590
So it's right about there.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.340
That's 6 right there.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.140
So this is the point 2, 6.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.680
So once again, these are just
sample points from the domain.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.057
This isn't the entire domain.

00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:41.890
But it gives us enough
points to kind of see

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.490
the general structure
of the graph.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.700
If we connect the dots,
we see a line forming.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.560
So If we connect the
dots-- let me draw.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.130
So if we connect the dots,
it looks something like this.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.240
And my shaky hand makes it
look a little bit curvy,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.510
but it should be an
absolute straight line.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.760
If I had this on
really good graph paper

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.260
and I have had a
ruler, you will see

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.468
that this is a straight line.

00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:05.704
And it would keep
going on and on and on.

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:07.370
And I want to make
it clear that we just

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.012
sampled points from the domain.

00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:11.470
But we could take any point in
the domain, which we already

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.630
said is all real numbers.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.880
So if we took right over here.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.060
If we said 1.5 you could see.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.780
And if you graph
1.5, f of 1.5 it

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.610
should sit on that
line right over there.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.230
If you graphed f of negative
0.5-- so this is negative 0.5.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.180
If you graphed f
of negative 0.5,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.785
it should sit on the
line right over there.

00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:30.410
But we're done.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.520
We have graphed the function
f of x is equal to 5x minus 4.
