progress on printed text but we when we
got nowhere for handwritten text and so

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600
got nowhere for handwritten text and so
 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.060

were comparatively simple so we rushed

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289
were comparatively simple so we rushed
 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.980
were comparatively simple so we rushed
to implement this and well first we had

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
to implement this and well first we had
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.749

of those were in research and 30 of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430
of those were in research and 30 of
 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.270
of those were in research and 30 of
those were in machine learning so you

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280
those were in machine learning so you
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.569
those were in machine learning so you
probably recognize several of the names

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579
 
 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.020

your criteria to classify then you would

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950
your criteria to classify then you would
 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.220
your criteria to classify then you would
probably say the X belongs to green but

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230
probably say the X belongs to green but
 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.660
probably say the X belongs to green but
if you understand that these points are

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670
if you understand that these points are
 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.120
if you understand that these points are
actually real points on the surface of

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130
actually real points on the surface of
 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.230
actually real points on the surface of
the earth and it happens that the green

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
the earth and it happens that the green
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.140

ones are on border and the red ones are

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150
ones are on border and the red ones are
 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.720
ones are on border and the red ones are
on land and you could change your

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730
on land and you could change your
 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.160
on land and you could change your
criteria and say we take level above the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170
criteria and say we take level above the
 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.920
criteria and say we take level above the
height above sea level as criteria in

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930
height above sea level as criteria in
 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.600

which case the problem becomes trivial
so this point is actually on land so it

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860
so this point is actually on land so it
 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.780
so this point is actually on land so it
belongs to the red class anybody see

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790

then this year these were the actual

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:38.510
then this year these were the actual
 

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.140
then this year these were the actual
competitors so this is convolutional at

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.150
competitors so this is convolutional at
 

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.060

to boosting in a minute then different

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:50.630
to boosting in a minute then different
 

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:56.410
to boosting in a minute then different
variations so here for example K nearest

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:56.420
variations so here for example K nearest
 

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.930
variations so here for example K nearest
neighbor of course has one big flaw so

00:10:58.930 --> 00:10:58.940
neighbor of course has one big flaw so
 

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.600

if you just take the Euclidean distance

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:00.610
if you just take the Euclidean distance
 

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.410
if you just take the Euclidean distance
as your metric as we did here then if

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:05.420
as your metric as we did here then if
 

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.210
as your metric as we did here then if
you shift two characters which are

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:07.220
you shift two characters which are
 

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.900
you shift two characters which are
active

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:07.910
active
 

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.300
active
the same by a few pixels then the

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.310
the same by a few pixels then the
 

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.710
the same by a few pixels then the
Euclidean distance starts to become

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720
Euclidean distance starts to become
 

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.800
Euclidean distance starts to become
enormous so it doesn't really measure

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:14.810
enormous so it doesn't really measure
 

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.500
enormous so it doesn't really measure
how close to or how similar two

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:17.510
how close to or how similar two
 

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.600
how close to or how similar two
characters are very well so here the

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:19.610
characters are very well so here the
 

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.400
characters are very well so here the
idea was that let's instead of using the

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.410
idea was that let's instead of using the
 

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.870
idea was that let's instead of using the
Euclidean distance let's do the same

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880
Euclidean distance let's do the same
 

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.060
Euclidean distance let's do the same
thing and used to Euclidean distance but

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:25.070
thing and used to Euclidean distance but
 

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.710
thing and used to Euclidean distance but
not on the pixel space but in the

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720
not on the pixel space but in the
 

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.140
not on the pixel space but in the
uppermost feature map and that boosted

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.150
uppermost feature map and that boosted
 

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.140
uppermost feature map and that boosted
the performance quite a bit

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.150
the performance quite a bit
 

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.640
the performance quite a bit
tangent distance was another one of the

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:36.650
tangent distance was another one of the
 

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.670
tangent distance was another one of the
ideas we talked a lot at a time another

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680
ideas we talked a lot at a time another
 

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.830
ideas we talked a lot at a time another
clever trick to increase the performance

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:41.840
clever trick to increase the performance
 

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.890
clever trick to increase the performance
of K nearest neighbors so if you picture

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:44.900
of K nearest neighbors so if you picture
 

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.170
of K nearest neighbors so if you picture
each character to be a point in a very

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:47.180
each character to be a point in a very
 

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.360
each character to be a point in a very
high dimensional pixel space and you

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:49.370
high dimensional pixel space and you
 

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.210
high dimensional pixel space and you
start doing some perturbations to it

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.220
start doing some perturbations to it
 

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.370
start doing some perturbations to it
without changing the actual character so

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:54.380
without changing the actual character so
 

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.320
without changing the actual character so
you rotate you delete a little bit is

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.330
you rotate you delete a little bit is
 

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.790
you rotate you delete a little bit is
shifted you grow the stroke a bit then

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800
shifted you grow the stroke a bit then
 

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.970
shifted you grow the stroke a bit then
that forms a surface around that point

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:03.980
that forms a surface around that point
 

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.400
that forms a surface around that point
and if you don't deviate too much from

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:06.410
and if you don't deviate too much from
 

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.020
and if you don't deviate too much from
the original point and you can model

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:08.030
the original point and you can model
 

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.050
the original point and you can model
that as a plane and the tangent distance

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:11.060
that as a plane and the tangent distance
 

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.900
that as a plane and the tangent distance
is simply the Euclidean distance between

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:13.910
is simply the Euclidean distance between
 

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.310
is simply the Euclidean distance between
two such planes so clever idea was a lot

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320
two such planes so clever idea was a lot
 

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.470
two such planes so clever idea was a lot
of prior knowledge of the problem built

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480
of prior knowledge of the problem built
 

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.750
of prior knowledge of the problem built
into and that also gets very good

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760
into and that also gets very good
 

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.330
into and that also gets very good
performance and optical margin that's

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:25.340
performance and optical margin that's
 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.910
performance and optical margin that's
essentially an SVM and so what's

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920
essentially an SVM and so what's
 

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.320
essentially an SVM and so what's
interesting is that they all have the

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:29.330
interesting is that they all have the
 

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.530
interesting is that they all have the
exact same performance the only one that

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:32.540
exact same performance the only one that
 

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.120
exact same performance the only one that
actually improves the performance was

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.130
actually improves the performance was
 

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.430
actually improves the performance was
boosting which is kind of a different

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440
boosting which is kind of a different
 

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.620
boosting which is kind of a different
type of approach so here you train

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:38.630
type of approach so here you train
 

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.330
type of approach so here you train
multiple networks you train the second

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:40.340
multiple networks you train the second
 

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.400
multiple networks you train the second
network on the mistakes of the first one

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.410
network on the mistakes of the first one
 

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.920
network on the mistakes of the first one
and you train a third one on there

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:44.930
and you train a third one on there
 

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.040
and you train a third one on there
refers to disagree so you get multiple

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.050
refers to disagree so you get multiple
 

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.600
refers to disagree so you get multiple
expert that specialize on different

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:49.610
expert that specialize on different
 

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.970
expert that specialize on different
parts of it of the training sentence so

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:51.980
parts of it of the training sentence so
 

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.350
parts of it of the training sentence so
it's not too surprising that that

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360
it's not too surprising that that
 

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.530
it's not too surprising that that
actually would increase the performance

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:55.540
actually would increase the performance
 

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.990
actually would increase the performance
so what Larry said in hindsight is that

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.000
so what Larry said in hindsight is that
 

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.690
so what Larry said in hindsight is that
well it's not too surprising that they

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:01.700
well it's not too surprising that they
 

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.410
well it's not too surprising that they
would all perform the same because they

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:04.420
would all perform the same because they
 

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.230
would all perform the same because they
everybody was doing the same type of

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240
everybody was doing the same type of
 

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.330
everybody was doing the same type of
approach in exploring them the best

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:10.340
approach in exploring them the best

capacity of their learning system by
 

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.820
capacity of their learning system by
doing the learning curves the one thing

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:15.830
doing the learning curves the one thing
 

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.250
doing the learning curves the one thing
that stands out in my mind is the SVM

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:18.260
that stands out in my mind is the SVM
 

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.650
that stands out in my mind is the SVM
because that has no bit prior built-in

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:20.660
because that has no bit prior built-in
 

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.040
because that has no bit prior built-in
knowledge about the tower

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:22.050
knowledge about the tower
 

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.579
knowledge about the tower
at all there all of the others to

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:27.589
 
 

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:29.569
 
classification rate is not the only

00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579
classification rate is not the only
 

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:31.579
classification rate is not the only
thing that you should actually focus on

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:31.589
thing that you should actually focus on
 

00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:33.679
thing that you should actually focus on
of course it's also memory consumption

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:33.689
of course it's also memory consumption
 

00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:36.679
of course it's also memory consumption
which is not on this chart training time

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:36.689
which is not on this chart training time
 

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:38.780
which is not on this chart training time
and inference time so all of the memory

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:38.790
and inference time so all of the memory
 

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.960

this is localization based on HD maps

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:17.549
this is localization based on HD maps
 

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:20.750
this is localization based on HD maps
and then this here is perception based

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760
and then this here is perception based
 

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.470
and then this here is perception based
as planning this is actually what comes

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480
as planning this is actually what comes
 

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.049
as planning this is actually what comes
out of our group in New Jersey so what

00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059
out of our group in New Jersey so what
 

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:28.759
out of our group in New Jersey so what
New Jersey group is doing there we

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:28.769
New Jersey group is doing there we
 

00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:34.399
New Jersey group is doing there we
contribute into this layer here and our

00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:34.409
contribute into this layer here and our
 

00:18:34.409 --> 00:18:37.100

goal is to solve the heart and unsolved

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.110
goal is to solve the heart and unsolved
 

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.779
goal is to solve the heart and unsolved
problems and I think there's a lot of

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:38.789
problems and I think there's a lot of
 

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:40.850
problems and I think there's a lot of
those in self-driving car so I think

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860
those in self-driving car so I think
 

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.279
those in self-driving car so I think
back to character recognition if we

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:43.289
back to character recognition if we
 

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:46.879
back to character recognition if we
can't even program handwritten character

00:18:46.879 --> 00:18:46.889
can't even program handwritten character
 

00:18:46.889 --> 00:18:50.259
can't even program handwritten character
recognition then it's very likely that

00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:50.269
recognition then it's very likely that
 

00:18:50.269 --> 00:18:54.980

going to be solvable by just programming
 

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.180
going to be solvable by just programming
so we concentrate on these hard problems

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:02.190
so we concentrate on these hard problems
 

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.460
so we concentrate on these hard problems
for two reasons one is that we want to

for two reasons one is that we want to
provide algorithmic diversity so in a

we're about 45 miles from New York City

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:51.750
we're about 45 miles from New York City
 

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.620
we're about 45 miles from New York City
and there's train connection and ferry

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:54.630
and there's train connection and ferry
 

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.530
and there's train connection and ferry
so a train is about 60 to 70 minutes and

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:57.540
so a train is about 60 to 70 minutes and
 

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.050
so a train is about 60 to 70 minutes and
if areas faster actually can take the

if areas faster actually can take the
 

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:05.170
if areas faster actually can take the
shortcut so it's around 40 minutes so

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:05.180
shortcut so it's around 40 minutes so
 

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.090
shortcut so it's around 40 minutes so
what is the typical case where rule

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100
what is the typical case where rule
 

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.760
what is the typical case where rule
based systems struggle well this seems

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:10.770
based systems struggle well this seems
 

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.470
based systems struggle well this seems
clear so we can detect these lane

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480
clear so we can detect these lane
 

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.600
clear so we can detect these lane
markings localize the car within it and

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:14.610
markings localize the car within it and
 

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.820
markings localize the car within it and
then have a pass planner and the

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:16.830
then have a pass planner and the
 

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:22.730
then have a pass planner and the
controller and drive but just about 100

meters further up on this road the

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:24.420
meters further up on this road the
 

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.330
meters further up on this road the
situation looks like this so it's much

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.340
situation looks like this so it's much
 

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.580
situation looks like this so it's much
harder now so it is you have to double

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:28.590
harder now so it is you have to double
 

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.040
harder now so it is you have to double
yellow line marker paint it and then the

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.050
yellow line marker paint it and then the
 

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.950
yellow line marker paint it and then the
center one is almost gone

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960
center one is almost gone
 

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.420

you can still solve it of course you can

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:35.430
you can still solve it of course you can
 

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.130
you can still solve it of course you can
build a deck too for this curve what a

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140
build a deck too for this curve what a
 

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.110
build a deck too for this curve what a
fence you may be able to reconstruct

fence you may be able to reconstruct
 

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.090
fence you may be able to reconstruct
this yellow lane marking then you can

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100
this yellow lane marking then you can
 

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.490
this yellow lane marking then you can
measure the distance here and decide

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500
measure the distance here and decide
 

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.230
measure the distance here and decide
that this is actually wider than on line

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240
that this is actually wider than on line
 

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.640
that this is actually wider than on line
this is probably two lines and I'm

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:46.650
this is probably two lines and I'm
 

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.440
this is probably two lines and I'm
currently here so I'm going to assume

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:48.450
currently here so I'm going to assume
 

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.800
currently here so I'm going to assume
that there's a virtual Lane here and I'm

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:51.810
that there's a virtual Lane here and I'm
 

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.510
that there's a virtual Lane here and I'm
going to drive there and then you have

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520
going to drive there and then you have
 

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.760
going to drive there and then you have
solved the problem for tests for this

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:55.770
solved the problem for tests for this
 

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.190
solved the problem for tests for this
scenario and then around the corner it's

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200
scenario and then around the corner it's
 

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.610
scenario and then around the corner it's
different again

00:21:59.610 --> 00:21:59.620
different again
 

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.529
different again
so you have to start all over and then

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:01.539
so you have to start all over and then
 

00:22:01.539 --> 00:22:06.180
so you have to start all over and then
again and again so it seems a big

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:06.190
again and again so it seems a big
 

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.950
again and again so it seems a big
advantage if we can build a system that

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960
advantage if we can build a system that

advantage if we can build a system that
can derive the domain knowledge from

can derive the domain knowledge from
 

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.680
can derive the domain knowledge from

somebody telling it what it actually
 

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.560
somebody telling it what it actually
should look for in this scene so what we

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:19.570

so one of our internal goals is to be

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:14.890
so one of our internal goals is to be
 

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.010

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.810
 
so one of the things I mentioned before

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:51.820
so one of the things I mentioned before
 

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.440
so one of the things I mentioned before
that it's important that or an important

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:55.450
that it's important that or an important
 

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.540
that it's important that or an important
aspect of our work is to learn by

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:57.550
aspect of our work is to learn by
 

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.400
aspect of our work is to learn by
observing humans not by manually

00:28:59.400 --> 00:28:59.410
observing humans not by manually
 

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.800
observing humans not by manually
programming things into the system but

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:01.810
programming things into the system but
 

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.480
programming things into the system but
nevertheless we want to understand what

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:03.490
nevertheless we want to understand what
 

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.580
nevertheless we want to understand what
it actually learned so here we analyzed

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:05.590
it actually learned so here we analyzed
 

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.280
it actually learned so here we analyzed
what what it's looking at is these two

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.290
what what it's looking at is these two
 

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.980
what what it's looking at is these two
green regions these are the regions that

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:10.990
green regions these are the regions that
 

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.640
green regions these are the regions that
the network is sensitive to and you see

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:14.650
the network is sensitive to and you see
 

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.700
the network is sensitive to and you see
that it learns to recognize detect these

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:17.710
that it learns to recognize detect these
 

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.580
that it learns to recognize detect these
line markings which is interesting

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:20.590
line markings which is interesting
 

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.410
line markings which is interesting
because we never labeled a single line

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:22.420
because we never labeled a single line
 

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.720
because we never labeled a single line
marking during training or here in a

marking during training or here in a
 

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.700
marking during training or here in a
residential street it learns to look at

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:26.710
residential street it learns to look at
 

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.740
residential street it learns to look at
the cars but if you look closely it

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:28.750
the cars but if you look closely it
 

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.280
the cars but if you look closely it
ignores the trees here or on our campus

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.290
ignores the trees here or on our campus
 

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.990
ignores the trees here or on our campus
if there's no clear line markings it

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000
if there's no clear line markings it
 

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.120
if there's no clear line markings it
learns to figure out to detect a road

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:36.130
learns to figure out to detect a road
 

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.780

edges through other means so this is an

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:39.790
edges through other means so this is an
 

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.760

important very important debugging tool

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:41.770
important very important debugging tool
 

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.150
important very important debugging tool
for us here's a short video you see a

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:45.160
for us here's a short video you see a
 

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.910
for us here's a short video you see a
line much so while the driving on the

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:47.920
line much so while the driving on the
 

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.320
line much so while the driving on the
highway it's looking at both line

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:49.330
highway it's looking at both line
 

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.300
highway it's looking at both line
markings but this one will disappear in

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:51.310
markings but this one will disappear in
 

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.540
markings but this one will disappear in
a moment and now instead of looking at

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:54.550
a moment and now instead of looking at
 

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.850
a moment and now instead of looking at
both of a doubly wide lane is actually

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:56.860
both of a doubly wide lane is actually
 

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.550
both of a doubly wide lane is actually
just following this one until the right

00:29:59.550 --> 00:29:59.560
just following this one until the right
 

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.590
just following this one until the right
one comes close enough so it becomes a

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600
one comes close enough so it becomes a
 

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.320
one comes close enough so it becomes a
single line again and it picked that up

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:04.330
single line again and it picked that up
 

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.390
single line again and it picked that up

with some open challenges my mind T's

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:36.850
with some open challenges my mind T's
 

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.460
with some open challenges my mind T's
are well they have tons of open

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:38.470
are well they have tons of open
 

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.140
are well they have tons of open
challenges but these are two of the big

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.150
challenges but these are two of the big
 

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:40.620
challenges but these are two of the big
ones

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:40.630
ones
 

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.930

so if you imagine you want to learn to

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:45.730
so if you imagine you want to learn to
 

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.430
so if you imagine you want to learn to
merge onto a highway and you have a car

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440
merge onto a highway and you have a car
 

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.260
merge onto a highway and you have a car
right next to you then you can either

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:49.270
right next to you then you can either
 

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.660
right next to you then you can either
speed up and go in front or you can slow

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:51.670
speed up and go in front or you can slow
 

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.420
speed up and go in front or you can slow
down and go behind but you can do the

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:54.430
down and go behind but you can do the
 

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.009
down and go behind but you can do the
average

00:30:56.009 --> 00:30:56.019
average
 

00:30:56.019 --> 00:30:58.690
average
so how we how we deal with that how we

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:58.700
so how we how we deal with that how we
 

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.609
so how we how we deal with that how we
can learn from there as more than one

00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:00.619
can learn from there as more than one
 

00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:03.729
can learn from there as more than one
possible correct way of driving but you

00:31:03.729 --> 00:31:03.739
possible correct way of driving but you
 

00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:06.909
possible correct way of driving but you
only ever get one one one of these

00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919
only ever get one one one of these
 

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:08.739
only ever get one one one of these
possible options in each example and

00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:08.749
possible options in each example and
 

00:31:08.749 --> 00:31:10.299
possible options in each example and
then the other one is learned from

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:10.309
then the other one is learned from
 

00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:13.299
then the other one is learned from
imperfect behavior so we have a ton and

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:13.309
imperfect behavior so we have a ton and
 

00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:16.509
imperfect behavior so we have a ton and
ton of data but currently we need to cut

00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519
ton of data but currently we need to cut
 

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:18.969
ton of data but currently we need to cut
out all the imperfect driving you don't

00:31:18.969 --> 00:31:18.979
out all the imperfect driving you don't
 

00:31:18.979 --> 00:31:21.279
out all the imperfect driving you don't
want to teach the network to cutting

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:21.289
want to teach the network to cutting
 

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:23.919
want to teach the network to cutting
corners and such and and it does learn

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:23.929
corners and such and and it does learn
 

00:31:23.929 --> 00:31:26.200
corners and such and and it does learn
what you what you do so it may make

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:26.210
what you what you do so it may make
 

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.049
what you what you do so it may make
Stevens so if we can get around and

00:31:29.049 --> 00:31:29.059
Stevens so if we can get around and
 

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:31.629
Stevens so if we can get around and
figure out how I can learn on its own

00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639
figure out how I can learn on its own
 

00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:33.579
figure out how I can learn on its own
what it actually should look at and

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:33.589
what it actually should look at and
 

00:31:33.589 --> 00:31:35.560
what it actually should look at and
bodies for their outliers then we would

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:35.570
bodies for their outliers then we would
 

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.389
bodies for their outliers then we would
have a ton more data that we can work

00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399
have a ton more data that we can work
 

00:31:37.399 --> 00:31:42.070
have a ton more data that we can work
with and so I'll finish with this video

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080
with and so I'll finish with this video
 

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.829
with and so I'll finish with this video
here this was recorded recently in

00:31:44.829 --> 00:31:44.839
here this was recorded recently in
 

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:47.619
here this was recorded recently in
December we got new data from a new

00:31:47.619 --> 00:31:47.629
December we got new data from a new
 

00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:50.680
December we got new data from a new
sensor set of a new car fleet and so the

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:50.690
sensor set of a new car fleet and so the
 

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.899
sensor set of a new car fleet and so the
first 10 hours came in all California

00:31:52.899 --> 00:31:52.909
first 10 hours came in all California
 

00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:56.169
first 10 hours came in all California
data in the Sun very little night no

00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:56.179
data in the Sun very little night no
 

00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:59.049
data in the Sun very little night no
rain and so the first thing we usually

00:31:59.049 --> 00:31:59.059
rain and so the first thing we usually
 

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:01.029
rain and so the first thing we usually
do is we train a network we go out and

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039
do is we train a network we go out and
 

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:03.310
do is we train a network we go out and
test to see if it meets our expectation

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320
test to see if it meets our expectation
 

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.779
test to see if it meets our expectation
is this kind of an end-to-end test to

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:04.789
is this kind of an end-to-end test to
 

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:06.009
is this kind of an end-to-end test to
see to make sure that nothing's wrong

00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:06.019
see to make sure that nothing's wrong
 

00:32:06.019 --> 00:32:09.249
see to make sure that nothing's wrong
with this new data that day it happened

00:32:09.249 --> 00:32:09.259
with this new data that day it happened
 

00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:11.619
with this new data that day it happened
to snow so we were curious to see what

00:32:11.619 --> 00:32:11.629
to snow so we were curious to see what
 

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:15.369
to snow so we were curious to see what
happens and it actually performed

00:32:15.369 --> 00:32:15.379
happens and it actually performed
 

00:32:15.379 --> 00:32:17.200
happens and it actually performed
surprisingly well so all these network

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:17.210
surprisingly well so all these network
 

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.909
surprisingly well so all these network
has ever seen is California data and

00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919
has ever seen is California data and
 

00:32:18.919 --> 00:32:20.889
has ever seen is California data and
it's now driving in the snow in New

00:32:20.889 --> 00:32:20.899
it's now driving in the snow in New
 

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:24.009
it's now driving in the snow in New
Jersey or here at night on a partly

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:24.019
Jersey or here at night on a partly
 

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:27.489
Jersey or here at night on a partly
snow-covered Road with lights from

00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:27.499
snow-covered Road with lights from
 

00:32:27.499 --> 00:32:35.440
snow-covered Road with lights from
oncoming traffic you can also see what

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:35.450
oncoming traffic you can also see what
 

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.139
oncoming traffic you can also see what
it's looking at and it looks at what

00:32:38.139 --> 00:32:38.149
it's looking at and it looks at what
 

00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:40.329
it's looking at and it looks at what
seems correct features on the road here

00:32:40.329 --> 00:32:40.339
seems correct features on the road here
 

00:32:40.339 --> 00:32:42.909
seems correct features on the road here
it even looks at the threaded tire tread

00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919
it even looks at the threaded tire tread
 

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:45.459
it even looks at the threaded tire tread
markings in this now even though it

00:32:45.459 --> 00:32:45.469
markings in this now even though it
 

00:32:45.469 --> 00:32:47.859
markings in this now even though it
certainly hasn't seen that in in the

00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:47.869
certainly hasn't seen that in in the
 

00:32:47.869 --> 00:32:51.519
certainly hasn't seen that in in the
original training data and that brings

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:51.529
original training data and that brings
 

00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:53.169
original training data and that brings
me to the end thank you for your

00:32:53.169 --> 00:32:53.179
me to the end thank you for your
 

00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:53.990
me to the end thank you for your
attention

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000
attention
 

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.099
attention
