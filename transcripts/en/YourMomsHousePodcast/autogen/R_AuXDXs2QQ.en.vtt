like that yeah I wouldn't like my
 

01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:16.530
like that yeah I wouldn't like my
material would feel weird coming out you

01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:16.540
material would feel weird coming out you
 

01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:19.770

that's interesting
 

01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:29.700
that's interesting
that's a scary one you know when you

01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:29.710

01:56:29.710 --> 01:56:30.600
that's a scary one you know when you
start thinking about your biggest

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:30.610
start thinking about your biggest
 

01:56:30.610 --> 01:56:34.500
start thinking about your biggest
weakness I don't know man I

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:34.510
weakness I don't know man I
 

01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:36.720
weakness I don't know man I
is it as a performer or a writer do you

01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:36.730
is it as a performer or a writer do you
 

01:56:36.730 --> 01:56:38.550
is it as a performer or a writer do you
think do you think your strength lies on

01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560
think do you think your strength lies on
 

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:41.910
think do you think your strength lies on
stage or in front of the computer you

01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920
stage or in front of the computer you
 

01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:43.200
stage or in front of the computer you
know what I mean like some people are

01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:43.210
know what I mean like some people are
 

01:56:43.210 --> 01:56:45.090
know what I mean like some people are
born I think it's probably the weakness

01:56:45.090 --> 01:56:45.100
born I think it's probably the weakness
 

01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:46.680
born I think it's probably the weakness
is probably that in writing because I

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:46.690
is probably that in writing because I
 

01:56:46.690 --> 01:56:49.230
is probably that in writing because I
don't write physically like I used to

01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:49.240
don't write physically like I used to
 

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.690
don't write physically like I used to
write a lot and I've done the last three

01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:51.700
write a lot and I've done the last three
 

01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:55.440
write a lot and I've done the last three
hours with basically no writing just on

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:55.450
hours with basically no writing just on
 

01:56:55.450 --> 01:56:57.240
hours with basically no writing just on
stage or writing on stage writing on

01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:57.250
stage or writing on stage writing on
 

01:56:57.250 --> 01:57:01.860
stage or writing on stage writing on
stage which my only like myself you know

01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:01.870
stage which my only like myself you know
 

01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:05.880
stage which my only like myself you know
analysis and and and diagnosis I would

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:05.890
analysis and and and diagnosis I would
 

01:57:05.890 --> 01:57:07.470
analysis and and and diagnosis I would
give myself is that it's good to be able

01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480
give myself is that it's good to be able
 

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.510
give myself is that it's good to be able
to do the writing on stage but I should

01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520
to do the writing on stage but I should
 

01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.450
to do the writing on stage but I should
add more of the writing off stage to

01:57:12.450 --> 01:57:12.460
add more of the writing off stage to
 

01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:14.580
add more of the writing off stage to
enhance it because the few times that

01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:14.590
enhance it because the few times that
 

01:57:14.590 --> 01:57:16.530
enhance it because the few times that
I've been like hey what's that bit and

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:16.540
I've been like hey what's that bit and
 

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:18.210
I've been like hey what's that bit and
actually written something down it got

01:57:18.210 --> 01:57:18.220
actually written something down it got
 

01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:22.080
actually written something down it got
better though it's like a laziness where

01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:22.090
better though it's like a laziness where
 

01:57:22.090 --> 01:57:24.510
better though it's like a laziness where
I go like yeah but it's good enough like

01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520
I go like yeah but it's good enough like
 

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:25.410
I go like yeah but it's good enough like
it's working without

01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:25.420
it's working without
 

01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:28.080
it's working without
be doing that yeah but if it works it's

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:28.090
be doing that yeah but if it works it's
 

01:57:28.090 --> 01:57:30.360
be doing that yeah but if it works it's
a bad thing if it works it works but I

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:30.370
a bad thing if it works it works but I
 

01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:32.189
a bad thing if it works it works but I
do think it can work better in other

01:57:32.189 --> 01:57:32.199
do think it can work better in other
 

01:57:32.199 --> 01:57:33.540
do think it can work better in other

enough on that I do I do and like I mean
 

01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.060
enough on that I do I do and like I mean
it's hard it's hard like I admit it I

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:39.070
it's hard it's hard like I admit it I

reluctance to do the more work I do the
 

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.580
reluctance to do the more work I do the
same thing that's what I think I know

01:57:59.580 --> 01:57:59.590
same thing that's what I think I know
 

01:57:59.590 --> 01:58:01.169
same thing that's what I think I know
this ain't right on stage more than you

01:58:01.169 --> 01:58:01.179
this ain't right on stage more than you
 

01:58:01.179 --> 01:58:07.740
this ain't right on stage more than you
do I know you liberabit you right in

01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:07.750
do I know you liberabit you right in
 

01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:09.600
do I know you liberabit you right in
front of a computer now let me ask you

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:09.610
front of a computer now let me ask you
 

01:58:09.610 --> 01:58:11.400
front of a computer now let me ask you
something because I can't do it on stage

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:11.410
something because I can't do it on stage
 

01:58:11.410 --> 01:58:13.520
something because I can't do it on stage
when I write in front of a computer

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:13.530
when I write in front of a computer
 

01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:15.720
when I write in front of a computer
sometimes I get so worried about the

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:15.730
sometimes I get so worried about the
 

01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:19.320
sometimes I get so worried about the
exact words yes that my naturalness goes

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:19.330
exact words yes that my naturalness goes
 

01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:20.790
exact words yes that my naturalness goes
away because I'm thinking about the

01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800
away because I'm thinking about the
 

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.830
away because I'm thinking about the
exact words that I wrote I totally get

01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:22.840
exact words that I wrote I totally get
 

01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.140
exact words that I wrote I totally get
that do that but that's when you let go

01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:25.150
that do that but that's when you let go
 

01:58:25.150 --> 01:58:26.520
that do that but that's when you let go
of the written like I know what the

01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:26.530
of the written like I know what the
 

01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:28.590
of the written like I know what the
punch is but I know that that part is

01:58:28.590 --> 01:58:28.600
punch is but I know that that part is
 

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.120
punch is but I know that that part is
gonna be worked out on stage cuz I'll

01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:30.130
gonna be worked out on stage cuz I'll
 

01:58:30.130 --> 01:58:32.250
gonna be worked out on stage cuz I'll
find my flavors up there

01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:32.260
find my flavors up there
 

01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:33.479
find my flavors up there
I just know that that's the writing and

01:58:33.479 --> 01:58:33.489
I just know that that's the writing and
 

01:58:33.489 --> 01:58:35.100
I just know that that's the writing and
then that's a performing you'll find

01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:35.110
then that's a performing you'll find
 

01:58:35.110 --> 01:58:36.900
then that's a performing you'll find
you're fine your cadence and shit up

01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:36.910
you're fine your cadence and shit up
 

01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:39.000

01:58:39.010 --> 01:58:40.919
there that's what I think but that's so
for you you right but the punchlines you

01:58:40.919 --> 01:58:40.929
for you you right but the punchlines you
 

01:58:40.929 --> 01:58:44.030
for you you right but the punchlines you
right you right you right right yeah
