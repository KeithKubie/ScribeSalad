00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.580
Doesn't EVERYTHING cause cancer?!

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.960
Yes.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.960
It does.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.610
Even Air.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.099
*deep sigh* *oops!*

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.250
Breathers [[greet and welcome]]
Yes.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.250
Air.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.250
I know.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.250
Yes.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.410
It sounds stupid, but according to a new study
from PeerJ people who live at elevations closer

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.070
to sea level have more tumors than people
who live where the air is thinner!

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.280
EVEN OXYGEN GIVES YOU CANCER?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.230
We need oxygen to breathe, but, in breathing
air with more oxygen in it -- we may be triggering

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.730
lung cancer formation.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.290
Imperial County, California is 11 meters below
sea level (36ft) and San Juan County, Colorado

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.880
is 3473 meters above sea level (2.16m) -- which
means the amount of oxygen can vary as much

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.940
as 35 percent depending on where you live!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.550
The two researchers behind the study compared
the rates of numerous cancers across the United

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.680
States in counties from purple mountains majesty
to the amber waves of grain, and found a 13

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.600
percent increase in lung cancers for every
1,000 meters decrease in elevation!!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.670
That same increase was NOT seen in breast,
colorectal, and prostate cancers.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.220
Before you freak out and try and hold your
breath for the rest of your life, this DOESN'T

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.220
mean that oxygen CAUSES cancer; just that
higher levels of elevation correlate with

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770
lower levels of cancer.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.500
In fact, there are a number of other benefits
from living at higher elevations, including

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.920
decreased rates of heart disease, better vitamin
D synthesis, and more weight loss to name

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.920
a few.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.440
More research is obviously needed, but it
is possible that oxygen is both necessary

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.520
for Earth life and slowly killing us.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960
When we breathe in the oxygen, our cells use
it to harvest energy from food, but part of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.560
the byproduct are oxygen free radicals; called
Reactive Oxygen Species.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.060
Sure theyâ€™re natural, but they're also toxic
-- and according to research in the Annual

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.840
Review of Genetics, our own ancient mitochondrial
systems might be causing degenerative disease

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.130
and cancer!

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.290
Which brings me back to the earlier point,
does EVERYTHING cause cancer?

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.870
Breathing causes it, making energy from food
causes it, what about food?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.869
My mom would always try to cook her pork chops
with the little black crusty bits on the edges,

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.310
because it was DELECTABLE, but she stopped
when she found out the charred bit causes

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.310
cancer.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.170
According to the American Cancer Society,
some starchy foods cooked at a high-temperature

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.560
will produce acrylamide, a chemical found
in paper, wastewater, adhesives and cigarettes.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.319
Frying bacon, or grilling and smoking meats
can expose food to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.319
a chemical known to cause skin, liver, and
stomach cancer in lab animals.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.560
Fried foods have their own problems.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.130
In the end, no serious science recommends
forgoing cooked food, but moderating the amount

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.849
of grilled and blackened food is going to
decrease your cancer risk.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.849
AIR.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.849
FOOD.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.780
AND YOUR OWN BODY MAKING THOSE TWO THINGS
INTO ENERGY ALL CAUSE CANCER.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.950
So, relax, exercise and pay attention to what
you're eating, but don't give yourself an

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.260
ulcer over it.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:01.459
We've obviously got enough problems, amirite?
