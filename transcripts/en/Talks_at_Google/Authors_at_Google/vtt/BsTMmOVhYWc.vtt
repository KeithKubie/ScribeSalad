[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:09.750
MARIAN CROAK: Hello, and
thank you all for coming.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.920
I'd like to welcome you
on behalf of the Africans

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.530
at Google and BGN.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.220
And I feel very
honored to be here

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.060
and to host this rather
unique event for Google.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.700
My name is Marian Croak, and I'm
a VP in the Next Billion User

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.320
organization.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.590
And soon I will be
moving into SRE.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.400
So before we get started,
I just want to give you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.590
a couple of announcements.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.330
Right after the event, right
across this opposite Slice

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.850
Cafe, will be 23 and
ME ancestry kits.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.660
And they're for Googlers who
are interested in their origins,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.170
and especially those
of African descent,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.400
who, in line with the
story you're about to hear,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.230
want to know more about where
they may have descended from.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.500
So that's one thing.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740
Second thing, and
maybe more importantly,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.720
is also right outside
will be books,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.350
the [? "Homecoming" ?] books.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.350
And you'll hear more
about the story from Yaa.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.290
But you can buy
them, and she will

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.660
be available for signing them.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.840
And the first 100
Googlers who sign up,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.870
or who line up for the books,
will receive one for free.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.160
So you have to be quick.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.970
But anyway, I want to tell
you I was fortunate enough

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.560
to read the story.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.840
It's beautifully written.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.220
It's very painful to read.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.610
So sometimes, I would
actually have to put it aside.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.460
But it's a story that
needs to be told.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.850
And I think all of
us need to read it.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.150
It helps to understand
the underpinnings

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.610
of the racial
complexity and the times

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.680
that we are living through now.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.190
So I would encourage
all of you to read it.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.930
And I want to tell you a bit
about the author, Yaa Gyasi,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.710
who's going to join us
onstage in a few minutes.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.490
She is originally from Ghana.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.040
And she's a Stanford alum.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.480
And she also graduated
from the Iowa--

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.130
it's very esteemed-- the
Iowa Writers' Program.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.780
So we're honored
to have her here,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.920
and blessed to have her here.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.490
Her book tells the story of
two sisters, Effia and Esi.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.770
And they grew up during
the 18th century in Ghana,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.800
and they lived in two
different villages.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.560
And Effia is married
off to an Englishman

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.780
and lives in a very
palatial castle,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.370
but right below
her is her sister.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.430
And her sister
lives in a dungeon,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.770
right below this castle.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.190
And it's a women's dungeon.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.280
Of course, they also
had one for males.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.090
And she's imprisoned
in this dungeon,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.410
and is eventually given over to
people that put her on a ship

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.060
and send her off to America
to be sold into slavery.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.200
And this book, this
beautifully written book,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.440
tells the story of
these two sisters

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.800
and their descendants
over a 300-year period.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.600
So it goes through the
wars in Ghana over slavery.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.830
It then takes us to the war
in America over slavery,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.430
to the coal mines in
the deep south where

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.360
many of the freeing
slaves had to work,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.900
and then to the great
migration north,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.550
and to the 20th century
Renaissance in Harlem,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.829
to the present day.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.380
And it's an amazing,
amazing journey.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.960
And I think we're still on
that journey, as you know.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.140
But I would encourage you
all to please read the book,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.380
because it really
helps give you insight

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.410
into what's going
on inside ourselves,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.480
and inside this country,
and across the world.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.710
Joining Yaa on the stage
will be two Googlers

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.970
who are descendants
of African origin.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.070
And one is Bash.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.870
And he shares the
same lineage as Effia.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.830
And the next one is Kanika.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.240
And she shares the
lineage of Esi.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.320
And they will join
Yaa in a conversation.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.220
And you're all invited to
participate in the conversation

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.400
as well.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.490
So please join me and
welcome them to the stage.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.500
SEGUN BASH: Hi, everyone.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.840
It's so exciting to see
this room almost full.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.150
We're very excited about that.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.930
Thanks to everyone for coming.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.072
And I'm so excited to see Yaa.

00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:45.780
As she walked up
earlier, I was like, OK,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.934
I think I'm a
little star struck.

00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:54.060
So just before we get into
the conversation everyone's

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.870
excited to have about the book,
I think it's important for us

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.010
to just learn more about Yaa.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.491
So that's actually where
we're going to get started.

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:04.600
YAA GYASI: OK.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.020
SEGUN BASH: Can you give us
a little bit more context

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.710
about yourself?

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.126
We know you moved here when
you were little to Huntsville,

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:13.032
Alabama, but tell us a little
bit about the story of Yaa.

00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:16.320
YAA GYASI: So I was born
in Ghana, in Mampong.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.580
And then my family moved
when I was two to America.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.400
And we first moved
to Ohio, my father

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.765
was getting his PhD at
Ohio State, in French.

00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:29.910
And he's a French professor.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.790
And then kind of as he was
looking for a tenure track job,

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.110
we moved a lot.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.800
So we lived in Ohio first,
and then Illinois, Tennessee,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.760
and then Alabama.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.000
And we moved to Alabama
when I was nine.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.460
And I stayed there
until 18, when

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.590
I left to come to Stanford.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.990
And then, after that, I took
a year off between college

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.920
and grad school.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.070
And I went to graduate school
at the University of Iowa

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.860
at the Writers'
Workshop, which is where

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.447
I wrote most of "Homegoing."

00:07:01.447 --> 00:07:02.280
SEGUN BASH: Amazing.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.640
KANIKA: Yeah.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.165
SEGUN BASH: Thank you.

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:04.120
All right, Kanika?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.050
KANIKA: So Yaa,
I'm just thrilled

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.324
to be up here with you,
so thank you again.

00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:09.990
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.615
KANIKA: So I think,
between Bash and I,

00:07:11.615 --> 00:07:14.490
we have probably seen every
interview you've done,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.601
every article written about you,
and read a few of the articles

00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:18.600
you've written yourself.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.370
And so we know that
you've wanted to be

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.320
a writer since you were young.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.120
We're curious, what is
it that you would be

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.190
doing if you weren't a writer?

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.330
YAA GYASI: Oh, man.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.120
I don't know what I would be
doing if I weren't a writer.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.810
I really hadn't thought
of any other career

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.740
that I wanted to do.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.424
I mean, I sang growing up.

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.590
Actually, one of the people
that I used to sing with

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.110
is in this room, Adam Seaton.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.260
And so, I think, for a
brief period of time,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.810
I thought that I
wanted to be a singer.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.904
But that felt
completely unattainable.

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.320
And if you can
believe it, writing

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.809
felt like the more stable
career choice to go for.

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:57.850
So that's what I decided.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.897
KANIKA: Not the startup
that you worked at?

00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:00.480
YAA GYASI: No.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.420
KANIKA: No?

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.900
When we saw that,
we were, like, well,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.627
Google's kind of a startup-ish
with 70,000 people.

00:08:06.627 --> 00:08:07.710
YAA GYASI: Very different.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.285
KANIKA: Still trying to
preserve that startup culture.

00:08:09.285 --> 00:08:09.570
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.486
KANIKA: But I know that
you were at a startup,

00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:13.201
for those of you who don't know.

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.325
Was it right after college?

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:15.840
YAA GYASI: It was right
after college, yeah.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.760
KANIKA: And it doesn't
sound like that worked out?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.390
Just curious why it
wasn't a good match.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.973
YAA GYASI: No.

00:08:18.973 --> 00:08:23.280
I went into it knowing that
I was just taking a year off

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.900
between college and
grad school, so I didn't

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.765
feel like I was there to stay.

00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:30.390
KANIKA: Got it.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.973
YAA GYASI: And I
think I only ended up

00:08:31.973 --> 00:08:33.860
being there for eight months.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.610
And I left and started
working on the writing

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.550
that I would be doing once
I got to graduate school.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:42.659
SEGUN BASH: Awesome.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.943
For anyone in the room that's
familiar with African parents,

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:52.170
singing and writing sound
like very hard sells.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.283
I think my mom is in here, but--

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:56.902
I shouldn't say-- it felt like
I had three options growing up.

00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:59.110
I was going to be a doctor,
an engineer, or a lawyer.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.611
That's it.

00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:00.318
YAA GYASI: Mm-hm.

00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:00.870
Yeah.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.860
SEGUN BASH: So how did
that go about at home?

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.020
YAA GYASI: It
didn't go over well.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.470
I mean, I have to say, I
guess, my parents encouraged me

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.290
in that my dad's a professor
and he teaches French

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.330
in Francophone
African literature,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.450
and so books were always in our
house and a part of our lives,

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.880
and reading was always
a part of my life.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.086
And so that part wasn't really
a surprise to them at all.

00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:26.460
But then, suddenly,
I think, when

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.770
I started to vocalize that
that was what I wanted

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.380
to do with my life was
to become a writer,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.320
I faced some
resistance, I would say.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.020
And really, I think
freshman year of college

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.210
was when it kind
of came to a head.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.740
I think I was
fighting with my mom,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.160
basically, every day about what
I wanted to do with my life

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.375
and what I wanted to
be, which I understand.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:52.260
You know, you come to America,
you sacrificed so much,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.350
and you've made this very deep
investment in your children.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.370
And so if they
tell you that they

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.520
don't think that this path that
you've kind of started them on

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.930
is the one that they
want to go on themselves,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.800
I think it can be
really scary for them.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.270
But now they both have amnesia
about that whole period

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:12.776
in my life.

00:10:12.776 --> 00:10:13.942
SEGUN BASH: Very convenient.

00:10:13.942 --> 00:10:14.934
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:10:14.934 --> 00:10:17.650
SEGUN BASH: So what
was the tipping point?

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.150
I think there's a lot of
wonderfully talented folks

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.330
in the room that may be
passionate about writing,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.750
or singing, or doing something.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.690
What was the tipping
point to help

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:35.464
gain that support from family,
stop the fighting, essentially?

00:10:35.464 --> 00:10:36.880
YAA GYASI: It was
really just kind

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.250
of saying that there was nothing
else that I wanted to do.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.900
I think, in part, once
they saw how unhappy I

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.850
had been in any other kind
of path, in that startup,

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.640
I think that they realized that
that I was very serious when

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.580
I said that this was
what I wanted to do

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.740
and started to kind of take
me seriously at that point.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.550
But you do have to kind of,
I guess, be willing to say,

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.940
this is a line, and I'm
not going to cross it--

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.040
if either of you can come with
me on this journey, or not.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.490
And that's kind of hard
to do when you're young

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.590
and still kind of feeling
out whether or not

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.230
you can make it in
the world of art,

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.024
which is a difficult, difficult
world to get your feet in.

00:11:20.024 --> 00:11:21.940
SEGUN BASH: To get into--
makes perfect sense.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:27.070
KANIKA: So to quote someone,
who shall remain nameless, I

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.386
heard someone say, Yaa's
hair's always on fleek.

00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:32.710
And I agree.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.210
I agree.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.085
YAA GYASI: Thank you.

00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:35.890
KANIKA: And I was just curious.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.680
As an African-American woman,
I think we always grapple with,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.700
how am I going to wear my hair?

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.600
Am I going to wear it straight?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.850
Am I going to wear it natural?

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.710
If I wear it natural, what
am I going to do with it?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.380
And how are people
going to receive it?

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.950
Curious about your inspiration
behind the different

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.120
hairstyles that you have.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.020
YAA GYASI: Oh, I've never
gotten that question before.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.592
I went natural about
three years ago, I guess.

00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:01.300
And I'm one of those
people who had never

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.560
seen her natural hair.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.620
My mom slapped a relaxer into
my hair when I was like five,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.570
and so I didn't even
know I didn't even

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.240
know what my hair looked
like growing out of my head.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.260
And so I think I was
just in graduate school,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.590
and I felt like I had
the time to figure out

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.360
how to take care of it myself.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.750
And so I just chopped it all off
and started this natural hair

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.350
journey.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.710
I don't know if I have
inspirations for my hairstyle.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.420
At this point, I'm
traveling so much

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.890
that it's just whatever is easy,
and fast, and will kind of last

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.130
me a long time.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.960
So I do it about once a week.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.031
I wash it and twist it out,
and that's all that I do.

00:12:42.031 --> 00:12:43.780
KANIKA: I think we can
all relate to that.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.760
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.260
KANIKA: And add on to that.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.009
Anybody who's been at Google
long enough knows about every--

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:53.050
maybe every month, there's
an email that goes out

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.730
to the Black Googler
network, BGN, that says, hey,

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.274
I just moved to the Bay Area,
where can I get my hair done?

00:12:58.274 --> 00:12:58.940
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.380
Yeah.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.004
KANIKA: So if you
want to share, if you

00:13:01.004 --> 00:13:03.262
have any good spots
in the Bay Area

00:13:03.262 --> 00:13:05.470
that you'd like to recommend
and give a shout-out to,

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.110
we welcome that.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.570
YAA GYASI: No, I
can't remember where

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.611
I used to get my hair done
when I was in college,

00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:11.920
but I definitely sent
that email a few times.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.530
I think I would even look at
pictures of people whose hair I

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.490
liked on campus,
and then email them

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.805
and ask where they've been
getting their hair done.

00:13:20.805 --> 00:13:24.196
Yeah, it's kind of a
desperate situation out here.

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:24.840
KANIKA: Yes.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.460
Thanks.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.480
SEGUN BASH: I love
that targeting.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.110
We need to start
doing that with BGN.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.360
Gotta get that
list with pictures.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.080
Let's switch gears for a
sec and dive into the book.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.110
Tell us a little bit
about the inspiration,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.910
where this started.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.989
You went back home
sophomore year.

00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:43.655
Let's hear a little
bit more about that.

00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:44.321
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:47.260
So when I was at Stanford,
my sophomore year,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.227
I received a fellowship,
called the Chappell-Lougee.

00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:52.810
And they give it to
sophomore students

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.640
to complete a research or
a creative-based project

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.530
the summer between
sophomore and junior year.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.600
And I knew that I
wanted to use mine

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.240
in order to research a novel.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.580
And initially, I'd had a
different idea in mind.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.070
I thought I wanted to
write a book about a mother

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.270
and her daughter.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.590
And so I thought it would be
nice to go to my own mother's

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:19.600
hometown, which is Abakrampa
in the central region of Ghana,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.850
and just kind of see
if anything struck me,

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.490
if any inspiration happened,
which is not the right way

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:30.410
to approach accepting a large
sum of money to do research.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.030
But thankfully, a
friend came to visit.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.400
And we ended up going to
the Cape Coast Castle.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.730
And it was my first time there,
and kind of my first time

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.760
really interacting
with it in any way.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.780
I hadn't really thought
about it before.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.409
And it was while at the
castle that I took the tour.

00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:51.700
And it was a really kind of
popular tour at that point,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.680
because Obama's family
had just been there,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.040
I think, a week before me.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.862
So a lot of people were kind
of flocking to the castle.

00:14:58.862 --> 00:15:00.820
And the tour guide kind
of just took us around,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.190
and he started to
talk to us about how

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.460
the British soldiers, who
lived and worked in the castle,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.370
used to married the local
Ghanaian women, which

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.130
was something I had
never heard before

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.320
and really fascinated me.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.570
And I wondered about
the lives of those women

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.780
and how they could possibly
kind of be walking around

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.290
free above these captives,
because the next thing

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:28.722
that the tour guide did was to
take us down into the dungeons.

00:15:28.722 --> 00:15:30.680
And I don't know if they
do this in every tour,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.460
but they closed the door,
so you can see how dark

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.580
and how small it is.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.610
And there's just a
little ring of light.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.010
And so I just was
immediately struck

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.740
by that juxtaposition,
the idea of this upstairs,

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.740
downstairs thing.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.370
And I knew, immediately,
that I wanted

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.490
to write about that
place in some capacity.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.130
I didn't exactly know
what it would look like,

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.660
or how long it would take,
or anything like that.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.220
I just, I think it was maybe the
first time in my writing life

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.950
where I felt anything like
a stroke of inspiration.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.814
I just knew that I wanted
to write about this place.

00:16:06.814 --> 00:16:07.480
SEGUN BASH: Wow.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.110
That's powerful.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.776
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:16:08.776 --> 00:16:13.030
KANIKA: So Marian gave us
a lovely setup and overview

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.300
of the book, but I want to
dig a little bit deeper.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.960
And set up the context for us.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.010
Tell us a little bit about
what was going on in history

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.566
at the start of the book.

00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:24.800
YAA GYASI: So the book
starts with these two half

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.850
sisters, Effia and Esi.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.960
Effia is born into
this Fante village.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.030
And she's kind of the daughter
of a relatively powerful man,

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.310
not an incredibly powerful man.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.640
But her village chief
decides that their village

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.780
is going to become a part of
facilitating the slave trade,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.230
so they're going to kind
of be a stop on this road

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.760
from the inland to the coast.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.220
And meanwhile, her
family's also thinking

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.600
about who to marry her to,
because she's coming of age.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.040
And they ultimately
end up, more or less,

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.540
giving her away in this
marriage to the British governor

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.750
of the Cape Coast Castle,
which was the kind of seat

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.470
of British colonial power in
Ghana during that time period.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:24.020
And so she ends up moving
to the castle, living there,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.190
seems like she has a relatively
good life, loves her husband,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.940
loves her kid, but
at the same time,

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.290
is somewhat aware of
something very nefarious

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:40.280
that is happening below
her, which is Esi's story.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.300
Esi, the second half
sister is an Asante.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.810
She's born to a very
powerful warrior who

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:52.140
lives in the inland area in what
was then called the Gold Coast,

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.030
present day Ghana.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.240
And her father kind
of has led her village

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.910
into all of these
battles, and they've won.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.910
And things are
looking up for them,

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.380
until some other rival
ethnic group comes

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.330
to kind of pay retribution.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.850
And in this, a
bunch of her people

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:16.420
are captured and then
marched down to the coast.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.620
And she ends up being
sold into slavery.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.070
And so the novel never tells
you whether they intersected

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.560
at the exact same period,
but you get the sense

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.090
that Effia is living above
her sister at one point.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.180
And so then you
follow down the line,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.360
descendant after descendant,
into the present day.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.535
KANIKA: Are you guys
getting a feel for the book?

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:40.600
It's amazing.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.514
And that was just like the
first maybe two chapters, maybe?

00:18:44.514 --> 00:18:46.180
YAA GYASI: Yeah, the
first two chapters.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.910
KANIKA: And there are 15
chapters, I think, altogether.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.060
And this book has everything
that you can get elsewhere,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.080
like all the drama
that you're seeing.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:00.100
I mean, it addresses
homosexuality,

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.890
let's see, polygamy, people
cheating on their husbands,

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.790
and being a single
parent, just so much.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.510
And for me, as a woman,
there were a lot of things

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.690
that I felt impacted
women in particular.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.370
And so I was just
curious, for you,

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.750
what emotions that
this bring out

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.180
in you in writing this
book, particularly

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.630
as it relates to the
women in the book

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.420
and what they experienced?

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.440
YAA GYASI: I always
knew that I wanted women

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.860
to be very central to the book.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.770
I mean, women are kind
of central to my life.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.850
I've heard a writer
say people ask her,

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.790
why are there so many
strong women in your novels?

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.390
And she said, well, I
don't know any weak women.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.930
And that's kind of how I
feel about that subject.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:54.910
This book, because I knew it was
going to be multi-generational,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.480
I knew that I wanted to start
with women, in particular,

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.687
because my people, the
Akans, are matrilineal.

00:20:02.687 --> 00:20:04.270
And so it felt like
an appropriate way

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.000
of kind of setting
up a family, to start

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.990
with this matriarch, the
mother of these two sisters,

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.570
and then just kind of
move down in that way.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.360
But it is equal in that
half of the chapters

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.960
are narrated by men, and half
of them are narrated by women.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:28.530
But I do think that, I guess,
my interests lay with the idea

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:34.860
that women were oftentimes the
backbones to these families

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.370
and kind of exploring what
that meant as we moved down

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.716
the line.

00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:41.415
KANIKA: I feel
like I'm bogarting.

00:20:41.415 --> 00:20:43.040
Do you have a question
you want to ask?

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.280
SEGUN BASH: Yeah.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.550
KANIKA: OK, go for it.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.910
Thanks, Kanika.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.340
KANIKA: You're welcome.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:53.250
SEGUN BASH: I think, for
me, that was a very powerful

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.360
visual, to go through the
first portion you were talking

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.580
about around these
women in these very

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.440
different parts of the castle.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.510
I feel like if I ever
visit the Cape Coast

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.210
Castle, without giving
away any spoilers,

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.910
I might be looking
for something.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:15.490
But so much of the book
felt amazingly real.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.815
How did you bring that to life?

00:21:18.815 --> 00:21:22.230
I was Wikipediaing and
Googling as I was doing this.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.260
Like wait, is that real?

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.730
Is it like really there?

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.720
And these were facts that
you built stories around.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.310
How did you manage to do that
without being overwhelming,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.270
as you went through it?

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.144
YAA GYASI: Well, I was
overwhelmed every day,

00:21:33.144 --> 00:21:35.370
so I don't know if I
actually managed to do it

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.179
without being overwhelmed.

00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:38.970
I knew, kind of going
in, that it was going

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.940
to take a lot of research.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.820
But the way that I
approached it was I

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.737
made a family tree at the
very beginning of the process.

00:21:47.737 --> 00:21:50.070
And it looks a lot like the
one at the front of the book

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:54.150
now, except mine also had the
dates that each chapter would

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.410
take place in and then something
that was happening politically,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.020
historically in the background
during each time period.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.150
So for Kojo's chapter, it
was the Fugitive Slave Act.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.940
For Quey's chapter, it
was the Asentewaa War.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.700
And that kind of just helped
me figure out a starting point

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.380
for the research.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.390
And then I would spend
a little bit of time

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.350
researching whatever that thing
was, and then the time period,

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.950
and just enough to make me feel
as though I had kind of entered

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.059
the world of the character.

00:22:25.059 --> 00:22:27.600
Because I think, sometimes, when
you read historical fiction,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.350
you start to feel like the book
is just stiff with research.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.690
And it stops feeling as
though it's about the story.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.930
And I wanted to always kind
of privilege the story.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.240
And so I say if I ever
came to this crossroad

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.050
where I had to decide between
something that was true

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.800
and something that was
good for the story,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.175
I would choose
the thing that was

00:22:45.175 --> 00:22:48.180
good for the story, which
not every writer would

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.990
make that choice.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:54.270
But I did want it to be
kind of a pleasure to read,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.070
for lack of a better
way of putting it.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.700
So just, I wrote
it chronologically,

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.790
just kind of using that
family tree as a guide

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.690
and trying to remember to
focus on character first.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.610
SEGUN BASH: And that
comes through powerfully

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.490
in the structure of the book.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.350
While Kanika and I were
preparing for this,

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.308
I cheated a little bit.

00:23:14.308 --> 00:23:16.835
I had the audio book, as
well as the physical book.

00:23:16.835 --> 00:23:18.668
And I was listening to
it, and I was saying,

00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:21.360
oh, you got to check out
Chapter 14 or whatever.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.050
And she's like, dude, there
are no chapters in this book,

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.150
it's just people's names.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.050
That was a very ambitious
structural choice.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.892
Had you seen that before?

00:23:32.892 --> 00:23:34.100
What's the story behind that?

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.310
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.300
So the structure came about,
probably, about three years

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.410
into the writing process.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.810
When I first started
the book in 2009,

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.830
I had a much more traditional
structure in mind.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.580
I thought that I wanted
to write something

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.380
that would be set
in the present,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.422
and then just flashback
to 18th century Ghana.

00:23:52.422 --> 00:23:54.630
And so if you've read the
book, kind of the first two

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.213
characters and the
last two characters

00:23:56.213 --> 00:23:58.830
were the ones that I
wanted to focus on.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.050
But then the longer
I worked on it,

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.170
the more that started
to feel just kind

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.790
of not significant enough.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:09.570
I wanted to be able to kind
of watch this throughline,

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.000
be able to watch
things like slavery

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.520
and colonialism shift
really gradually

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.830
over this very long
period of time.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.910
And so I realized that that
aspect, the aspect of time,

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.440
was the most
important thing to me.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.990
And in order to
capture that, I felt

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.810
like I needed to be able to
stop in as many generations as

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.850
possible, so that it was clear
to me and to the reader how

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.600
these things came from
those things, which

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.030
came from those things,
which came from those things.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.580
And so you kind of see this
domino effect of history

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.570
as you move.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.550
And I didn't think I
could do that if I just

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.540
had a book that was set in
the present and flashed back.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.750
And I've seen a lot of other
multi-generational novels

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.310
before--

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.340
a lot of which I love--

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.730
but I knew that the particular
challenge of "Homegoing"

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.270
was that I was never
going back in time.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.860
So I was never returning
to a character.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.620
Each chapter moves
forward in time.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.910
And you'll hear bits and
pieces about a character

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.770
through their
descendants, but you never

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:13.560
have a chapter that
returns to the descendant.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.350
So that aspect of it was
probably the hardest thing

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.900
to figure out how to do.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.095
SEGUN BASH: Awesome.

00:25:20.095 --> 00:25:23.252
KANIKA: Do you want to
get to why we're here?

00:25:23.252 --> 00:25:25.710
SEGUN BASH: Yeah, I don't know
if I'm ready for it, though.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.171
It gets a little intense.

00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:27.712
KANIKA: Yeah.

00:25:32.902 --> 00:25:35.360
SEGUN BASH: One of the things
that this book spurred for me

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.360
and as we got together and I
started planning this event

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.550
to bring you to ask
you to join us here

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:49.430
was the juxtaposition of
what the impact has been.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:55.430
So Effia and Esi, if they met
at a village party, whatever

00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:00.980
it would be, would have had a
particular set of interactions.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.500
But as you go through,
you see their descendants,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.010
and those interactions
are not there.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:12.910
So we're hoping that, to get
us started with this section,

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.520
you'd read a little
bit from the book.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.519
YAA GYASI: Sure.

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:19.310
SEGUN BASH: And there
are no spoilers here,

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.220
guys, so don't worry.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.290
And just the highlighted
portion from the bottom to here.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.060
YAA GYASI: Cool.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.090
"The next day, Marjorie
sat by herself reading

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.850
'Lord of the Flies'
for English class.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.330
She held the book in one
hand and a fork in the other.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.460
She was so engrossed
in the book that she

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.370
didn't realize that the chicken
she had pierced with her fork

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.390
hadn't made it into her
mouth until she tasted air.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.270
She finally looked up to see
Tisha and the other black girls

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.344
staring at her.

00:26:51.344 --> 00:26:52.510
'Why you reading that book?'

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.070
Tisha asked.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.910
Marjorie stammered, 'I
have to read it for class.'

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.400
'I have to read it for
class,' Tisha mimicked.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.170
'You sound like a white girl,
white girl, white girl.'

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.570
They kept chanting,
and it was all Marjorie

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.900
could do to keep from crying.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.400
In Ghana, whenever a
white person appeared,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.400
there was always a child
there to point him out.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.920
A small group of
children, dark and shiny

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.430
in the equatorial sun, would
extend their little fingers

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.250
toward the person whose skin
was different from theirs

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.280
and shout, obroni, obroni.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.310
They would giggle,
delighted by the difference.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.720
When Marjorie had first
seen children do this,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.010
she'd watched as the white man
whose skin color had been told

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.400
to him grew shocked, offended.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.430
'Why do they keep saying that?'
he'd asked the friend who was

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.170
showing him around.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.900
Marjorie's father pulled
her aside that night

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.720
and asked her if she knew
the answer to the white man's

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.420
question, and she had shrugged.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.490
Her father had told
her that the word

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.640
had come to mean something
entirely different from what

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.940
it used to mean, that the
young of Ghana, itself

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.270
an infant country, had been
born to a place emptied

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.070
of its colonizers.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.620
Because they didn't see
white men every day,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.130
the way people of his mother's
generation and older had,

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:15.190
the word could take on
new meaning for them.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.050
They lived in a
Ghana where they were

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:21.100
the majority, where theirs was
the only skin color for miles

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:21.935
around.

00:28:21.935 --> 00:28:26.200
To them, to call someone
obroni was an innocent act,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.480
an interpretation of
race as skin color."

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.980
SEGUN BASH: Awesome.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.290
You wrote a really
powerful article

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.700
for "The New York Times."

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.940
And the headline was,
"I'm Ghanaian-American.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.550
Am I Black?".

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.300
As you go through that
piece about the character,

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.220
how much of that was a personal
experience you had growing up?

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.570
And how have you
interpreted your identity

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:59.470
as both Effia and Esi,
since you were born in Ghana

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.830
and you moved over to Alabama?

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.920
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.730
I mean, I think that little
interaction where Marjorie gets

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.220
made fun of for reading was
something that had actually

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.630
happened to me, not exactly
like that, but similar to that.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.950
And it was really confusing.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.990
And I think most of my
trying to figure out

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.650
identity, specifically racial
identity in America when

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.890
I was young, was about
being confused, I think,

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.730
in part, because my parents
didn't really connect

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.100
to it in the way that I did.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.200
I always say, if you
come from a country

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.630
where everybody looks
like you and you aren't

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:41.260
kind of used to thinking
of yourself as black,

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.030
it can be a challenge
to come to America

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.280
and have to start to kind
of learn the racial rules.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.580
And so if somebody said
something offensive

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.940
or used an epithet to me, and
I came home and told my parents

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.180
about it, they'd be like, well,
they're not talking about you.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.510
But of course, they were.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.220
And I think they didn't really
realize how that worked.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.220
They obviously had different
kinds of divisions.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.680
Like my mother's a Fante
and my father's an Ashante.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.380
And that was a division.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.180
But the division
of white and black

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.090
was one that they didn't
really understand.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.820
And so in a lot of
ways, I felt like me

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:20.940
and my brothers had to kind of
figure things out on our own,

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.066
which was a challenge.

00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:27.400
KANIKA: What percentage of
Marjorie would you say was you?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.290
That seemed to be the
closest character.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:29.980
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.620
I think Marjorie and Marcus,
the last two characters,

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.860
are the most similar to me.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.670
They're obviously the
closest in time period to me,

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.130
so it's kind of easier
to relate to them.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.170
Marjorie, I think,
shares the most kind

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.270
of biographical information.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.860
She's born in Ghana, but
she was raised in Alabama.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.600
But I think where she
starts to veer off

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.860
is that she has a much more
intimate, deeper relationship

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.090
with Ghana than I did.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.150
She goes back every summer
to visit her grandmother.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.160
I only went back twice.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.230
So her connection
to her homeland

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.861
is a lot stronger than mine was.

00:31:08.861 --> 00:31:11.130
KANIKA: So it's
interesting that you

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.440
talk about your experiences,
or even Margaret's

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.730
experiences in growing up, and
particularly your parents not

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.430
necessarily identifying
with black Americans

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.660
or African-Americans.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.610
There was one particular
passage in your book.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.280
It was in the Marjorie
chapter, and it

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.860
was her teacher, Miss Pinkston.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.990
And she said, "Here
in this country,

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.950
it doesn't matter where you came
from first to the white people

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:35.910
running things.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:36.960
You're here now.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.870
And here, black, is
black, is black."

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.000
And that resonated with me.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.790
Because growing up in the
States, being born here

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.459
and growing up here, I've
never seen myself any different

00:31:48.459 --> 00:31:50.250
from any other black
person, whether you're

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.220
from Africa or the Caribbean.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.380
So it always
baffles me when I am

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.010
in spaces where people
who I consider to be black

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.200
separate themselves
and consider themselves

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.690
to be different than.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:07.800
So Bash and I talked about this
and had some very interesting

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.017
conversation.

00:32:09.017 --> 00:32:11.100
I think he had a different
perspective, obviously,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.380
growing up outside of
the States and coming in.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.565
But do you want to share
some of your [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:15.565 --> 00:32:16.273
SEGUN BASH: Yeah.

00:32:16.273 --> 00:32:18.240
I think that's one of
the things that we wanted

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.950
to understand and unpack
for everyone in the room,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:28.890
is externally, as you come
into work, whether at Google

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.680
or wherever, you walk into
the room and you're black.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:38.020
And all the assumptions that
go with that blackness, that's

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.190
what's expected, right?

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.898
YAA GYASI: Right.

00:32:39.898 --> 00:32:44.120
SEGUN BASH: So as [INAUDIBLE],,
as [INAUDIBLE] Nigerian,

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.930
and I come in, if my accent
gets stronger in the meeting,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.790
it's a little bit of
a surprise for folks.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.360
And one of the things that
we've been trying to understand

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.760
is that, when you put these--

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.090
Kanika and myself-- where
you put these different types

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:05.260
of black in the same space,
the connection isn't as tight

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.510
as we might expect.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:11.170
And what do you think
is the cause for that?

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:17.761
And how do we begin to
unpack and bring that closer?

00:33:17.761 --> 00:33:18.610
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:22.000
I mean, I think,
partially, the cause is--

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.220
so in "Homegoing,"
you're looking

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.580
at this family that doesn't
recognize that it's a family

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.680
and can never recognize
that it's a family.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.980
There have been these ruptures,
these divisions, to the point

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.940
where members, particularly
on the African-American side

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.510
of things, can't
even recognize which

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.600
country from the continent
they've been ripped from.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.700
And that, to me, is
kind of devastating,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.450
that these ruptures exist.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:57.820
And so I think part of
it, speaking mostly just

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.470
for the African side, is
just recognizing that fact,

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.200
that there is this
connection that exists.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.780
Even if you have to
go back a long time

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.909
to get to the source
of that connection,

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:12.520
it does exist, and
to kind of stop

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.920
thinking about
yourselves as necessarily

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.770
separate from black Americans.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.940
Because I think that's where a
lot of the troubles navigating

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.580
race begin for
African immigrants,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.060
is this idea that we are
necessarily different,

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.219
set apart.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:34.060
But in terms of how to go
about that, I don't know.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.159
I don't know if I have
a good answer for that.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.100
It's a really
difficult question.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.120
SEGUN BASH: That is
the ongoing question.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.514
And we're going to switch
into live questions

00:34:42.514 --> 00:34:44.380
soon, and live comments.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.604
So I encourage folks that
have an opinion about that,

00:34:47.604 --> 00:34:50.020
that's the conversation we're
trying to get started today.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.980
And that's why the ancestry
portion of the event

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.280
has been introduced, right?

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.990
So we get a chance to
actually go back as far

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:01.710
as we can to the
beginning of our story

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.450
and start to connect
these two communities.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:08.470
Just as a quick show of hands,
how many people in the room

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.410
knew there was any
sort of gulf between

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:15.625
the black American community
and the African community?

00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:17.900
OK.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.590
So we have 20%, 25% or so.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.195
So for the rest of
you all, surprise!

00:35:23.195 --> 00:35:26.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.920
These are conversations
that we're

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.860
having, that we're
trying to bring to this,

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:37.040
using Yaa's platform for
us to start discussing.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.690
When it comes to
the healing, we know

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:43.970
that's a very, very hard
thing, like you said.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.190
The answers to that
question is something

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:51.200
that the community needs to
come together to talk about.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.994
But there's a portion
in your book, I think--

00:35:54.994 --> 00:35:57.160
we weren't sure we were
going to have time for this,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.800
so Kanika's going
to be very excited--

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:08.500
that speaks about regret
and how to deal with regret.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.722
Do you recall what
I'm speaking to?

00:36:12.722 --> 00:36:14.930
YAA GYASI: I don't know if
I know exactly what you're

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:15.800
talking about.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:15.850
SEGUN BASH: OK.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.224
KANIKA: A father
and a daughter--

00:36:17.224 --> 00:36:20.062
the crops did not manifest.

00:36:20.062 --> 00:36:20.770
YAA GYASI: Right.

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:21.810
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:25.140
KANIKA: And the girl was crying,
and the father was saying,

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.330
you don't need to regret.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.650
And I don't know the exact--

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:28.400
well, there we go.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.230
SEGUN BASH: So here we go, since
we have a little bit of time.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.148
YAA GYASI: Sure.

00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:36.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.910
So for us, we've
like, studied this.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.710
This is like the
Bible, at this point.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.240
YAA GYASI: It was a long time
ago that I wrote this book.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.030
"'The plants have all died,
and I could have helped them,"

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.250
she said between sobs.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.160
'Abena,' he said, 'what would
you have done differently

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.440
if you knew the
plants would die?'

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.540
She thought about
this for a moment,

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.960
wiped her nose with the back
of her hand, and answered,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.300
'I would have
brought more water.'

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.840
Her father nodded.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.620
'Then next time,
bring more water,

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.850
but don't cry for this time.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.750
There should be no room
in your life for regret.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:15.410
If in the moment of
doing you felt clarity,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:20.644
you felt certainty, then
why feel regret later?'"

00:37:20.644 --> 00:37:25.790
SEGUN BASH: That moved us,
as we thought about where

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.280
these two communities are now.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.570
And in a way, we felt like,
in present day, the Marcus

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:38.180
and Marjorie, the Kanika and
the Bash, we're the new crop.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:43.040
So our choice is how to deal
with the regret of what's

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.363
happened to us.

00:37:44.363 --> 00:37:45.150
YAA GYASI: Right.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.570
KANIKA: And with that
said, folks, we'll

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.670
open it to live
questions, if people

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:56.030
can start lining up by the mics,
for folks who have questions.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.140
And I will also get
the [? dory ?] ready.

00:38:03.568 --> 00:38:04.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.810
Thank you so much for coming.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.930
So just for [INAUDIBLE],, I'm
Haitian, so I'm Caribbean.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.840
And I feel kind of like on
the sidelines, like watching

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.890
this happen, right?

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.760
Because it's one of
those things where

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.300
I grew up knowing I'm Haitian,
born here in America, but then

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.460
also like that kind of
divide that you talk about,

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.790
but then also knowing
that even further back,

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.740
there's this ancestry
from Western Africa,

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.750
most likely, right?

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.959
YAA GYASI: Right.

00:38:33.959 --> 00:38:36.000
AUDIENCE: But what I also
realize is, growing up,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.520
especially, kind of
just after this weekend

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:43.230
and after the tragic
shooting of Jordan in Dallas,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:47.940
a young boy who was killed
over the weekend, it's for me,

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.340
personally, I just
wonder, there's

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:57.150
so much harm in not seeing the
fact that, at any one point,

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:04.620
those stories don't appear as
our skin color does, right?

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.010
And so those stories
kind of get erased

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.400
under the guise
of this blackness

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.760
and whatever, stereotypes
people might have of you,

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.800
law enforcement
will have of you.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.150
But my question is,
what do you think

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:23.070
is the benefits of these
communities coming together,

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.730
right?

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.430
What powers do you think we
might have in the collective

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.570
by understanding the very
real situation that there

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:34.840
is in this country, of walking
in America as a black woman,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.000
as a black man?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.490
And so I'd just love to
hear your dreams for what

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.365
that connection might be.

00:39:40.365 --> 00:39:41.220
YAA GYASI: Yeah.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:47.220
I mean, I think, aside from
healing, which I shouldn't

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.370
set that aside, because that's
a really important factor,

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:53.100
the ability to kind
of heal, but it's

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.520
an opportunity to kind of
protect one another as well.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.574
What you were saying
really resonated with me.

00:39:59.574 --> 00:40:01.740
In that essay that I wrote
for "The New York Times,"

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.260
I talked about the situation
that my little brother had

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.950
gotten into where he was riding
his bike in our neighborhood

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:12.480
when we lived in a predominantly
white neighborhood in Alabama,

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.330
and our new neighbors
called the police on him.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.150
And the police came and
kind of sent him home.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.490
And you're thinking,
this situation

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.830
could have gone so differently.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:28.620
And my little brother can't tell
these police officers that he's

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.420
Ghanaian, he's not black.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.656
So that kind of position
doesn't work outside when

00:40:33.656 --> 00:40:34.530
you leave your house.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.240
It doesn't work.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.380
And so the part of the reason
why this community does need

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.040
to come together is, I think,
for protection, for healing,

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.920
for kind of being able to
stick up for one another

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.060
and kind of put a better
face forward for all of us.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:54.975
SEGUN BASH: Awesome.

00:40:54.975 --> 00:40:57.350
AUDIENCE: This is going to be
a bit of a loaded question.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.720
But you alluded
to earlier people

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.310
reaching back into
the past and seeing

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.130
where they're from and all
that, the experience of getting

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.960
to know oneself
through that avenue.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.780
But the past itself is
both very fragmented,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.010
because there's this idea of
romanticizing pre-colonial past

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.089
as if it was some ideal
situation where everyone got

00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:19.130
along, when there was
clearly a lot of infighting

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.820
and migration.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.540
And that's complicated more so
by the fact that there was very

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.140
few remnants of that time
in place in the world after

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.272
colonialism, because
most people's experience

00:41:29.272 --> 00:41:30.980
of their culture,
especially where it's--

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.730
I know, in southern
Africa, for example--

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.280
come from a lot of the
'60s, '70s, and '80s,

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.460
especially into the African
culture, for example.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.730
So to you, what's the
experience of culture?

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:44.600
And what is the utility of that
culture in self-identification,

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.745
from your perspective?

00:41:45.745 --> 00:41:48.110
YAA GYASI: I think one
of the big challenges

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.290
for writing "Homegoing,"
particularly for those earlier

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.490
chapters, was just
how little research

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:58.490
I could get my hands on from the
perspective of the people who

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:01.640
had been going
through these things.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.370
All of the accounts
that I was reading--

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.953
there was a really helpful book
called "The Door of No Return"

00:42:05.953 --> 00:42:07.910
by William Sinclair
that took that took you

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:08.960
through the Cape Coast Castle.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.376
And it had a chapter
on the women.

00:42:10.376 --> 00:42:12.480
It had a chapter
on the children.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.310
But what was noticeably
absent was any kind

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.860
of chapter on slavery
and what was happening

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.570
in the bottom of this dungeon.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:25.400
And so I think one thing
that we are offered now

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.750
is the opportunity to kind
of develop these voices

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.980
through fiction, for me.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.940
I can only speak, I
guess, for my own medium.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.240
But it kind of gave me the
opportunity to lend a voice

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.170
and kind of create a
presence in a place that

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.780
had once been absent.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.000
And I think that, even
though it's fictional,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.300
I think that does kind of help
to re-establish a culture that

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.930
has been lost and a culture
that has been erased

00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:04.310
and give an opportunity to see
one way to restore something.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:07.190
SEGUN BASH: I think
one of the things

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.640
that brings up for me
and for Kanika and I

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.450
as we went through this
experience together--

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.190
like I was saying, the book was
a little bit of group therapy

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:20.540
from the two different angles,
but African slave traders

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.200
is something you don't
hear a ton about.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.150
And Kanika, if you
don't mind me sharing,

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:32.330
she was saying that, as she read
that, there was a lot of anger.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:38.080
And she asked me quite candidly,
representing the African side,

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.960
do you feel shame?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.030
And one of the
questions, I think,

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:48.740
that bubbles up for me is,
what level of responsibility

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.000
do you feel-- and one the
characters speaks to this,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.220
but I'm just curious-- what
level of responsibility

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:58.280
do you feel like the African
community should inherit,

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.590
and discuss, and take for
how these stories have played

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.290
through?

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:08.360
YAA GYASI: I guess, first of
all, just the acknowledgement

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.700
that this happened
is very important.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.290
It's something that
I'd heard about,

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.080
but people kind of mostly talk
about it in whispers, you know?

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.030
It wasn't something
that I had heard

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.340
people talk about really
explicitly, until I

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.500
went to the Cape Coast Castle.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.290
And the tour guide wasn't trying
to keep it a secret, you know?

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.210
It wasn't like he was
hiding this information.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.520
If you take the tour,
they'll talk to you

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.280
about the different roles that
the different ethnic groups

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.330
had played in this.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.930
And yet, I feel like there's
this kind of tendency

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:44.750
to really bristle if you mention
it among people that I've met.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.360
And I think that reaction
is the wrong one.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.300
How can you take responsibility,
if you won't even acknowledge

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.267
that it happened at all?

00:44:52.267 --> 00:44:54.350
And so I think that's kind
of the first thing that

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.290
needs to happen.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:57.260
SEGUN BASH: Awesome.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.582
Thank you.

00:44:59.582 --> 00:45:01.040
AUDIENCE: First of
all, Yaa, I just

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.800
want to thank you for
even writing this book.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.247
I think it sounds
really exciting,

00:45:05.247 --> 00:45:06.830
and I'm looking
forward to reading it.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.690
And thank you for
being here today.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.720
And for the organizers, thank
you for putting this together.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.620
As a man of African descent
who doesn't know what part

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.480
of the continent
I'm from, I'm really

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.442
excited to learn a little
bit more about that.

00:45:19.442 --> 00:45:21.650
And I have to pay at least
$100 for that opportunity.

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:24.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.770
My question is, do you have
any ideas or inspiration

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:31.385
for what your next project
or your next book might be?

00:45:31.385 --> 00:45:35.990
YAA GYASI: Yeah, I'm kind of at
the beginning of a new novel.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.759
I'm really superstitious about
talking about what I'm working

00:45:38.759 --> 00:45:41.360
on, so I won't get too into it.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.840
But I think it'll be
set in the present,

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.965
mostly because I don't want
to do as much research.

00:45:45.965 --> 00:45:48.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.930
And yeah, I've heard
other writers talk

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.780
about how you only really have
three things that you ever

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.400
really write about
in your career,

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.230
and you just kind of
circle those things.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:01.250
So I think a lot of the themes
that I'm fascinated with

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.890
and a lot of my obsessions
will continue to appear

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:06.630
in my work from now on.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.030
KANIKA: When can we expect it?

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:11.860
No pressure.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:12.210
YAA GYASI: Good question.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.720
That's a really great question.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.730
KANIKA: We'll all be eagerly
anticipating the arrival of it.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:17.604
YAA GYASI: Thank you.

00:46:17.604 --> 00:46:19.388
KANIKA: Absolutely.

00:46:19.388 --> 00:46:21.920
AUDIENCE: My mother and I
read this book together,

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.720
and we absolutely loved it.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.100
I was struck by your
imagery of the dominoes

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.030
of the black experience, the
African experience in America.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:35.870
And there were so many dominoes,
the passing, the unionization.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:37.610
I mean, there's just so much.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:41.270
Is there anything that
you wanted to include,

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.700
but you just couldn't, you
couldn't pack it into the book?

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.120
Is there anything or any
additional characters,

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.660
or instances, or
moments in black history

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.930
that you just couldn't fit
in, that didn't make it,

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:55.436
got cut out?

00:46:55.436 --> 00:46:56.810
YAA GYASI: It
didn't get cut out,

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:01.460
but the most noticeable absence
and the thing that people often

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.950
talk to me about is that I
don't write about the Civil War

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:04.580
at all.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:08.560
So the Civil War kind of acts
as the division between parts

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.620
one and parts two of the novel.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.990
And that was mostly
because I felt like it was

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:18.350
a good kind of halfway mark.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.990
And I felt like we all
kind of know about it.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.480
And I also just didn't feel
like I had a good Civil War

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.750
story in me to contribute.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.050
So that's probably
the biggest thing

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:34.445
that got left out of the book.

00:47:34.445 --> 00:47:36.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.020
I grew up in Ghana.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.520
I lived there for 13 years.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.750
And I went to the
castle when I was 12.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.510
It didn't really have
much of an impact on me.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.910
I grew up as a refugee in
Ghana, for that matter.

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.120
But there were
claws on the walls,

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.030
I think the room that you
mentioned, with the circle.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.100
I still have vivid
memories of that.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.860
And they said the slaves
were fighting each other,

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:08.070
eating feces, and scratching the
walls just for air and light.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:10.860
So that really kind
of struck me just now.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.110
But at the same time, I moved
to the US when I was 15.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.510
And unlike most African
stories that I've heard,

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:21.720
I was excited to meet
other black people here,

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.050
because I didn't have any clue.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:25.800
I just saw the music
videos, and I thought

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.150
they were just cool as hell.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.540
But my first day of
school, I wore a kente,

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:37.170
like my kente, my
most prized outfit.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.000
And I wore sandals.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.510
And I went to school and
got clowned on, right?

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.550
I was the darkest
kid in the school.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.230
I didn't look like anybody.

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:47.850
I wasn't cool enough.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.990
And so growing up,
unconsciously, I

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.530
fought the assimilation, right?

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:54.840
I sound different
from my family.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.990
All my family sound
African, I sound like this.

00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:59.640
Some people recognize
that I'm African later.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.970
And so it's like, what
advice do you have for,

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.130
I guess, the black
community, when

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:09.040
there are people like myself
looking to learn about them,

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:15.180
but yet we face this
hostile, negative, and almost

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.060
life-changing experience that
is still affecting me today?

00:49:21.532 --> 00:49:26.480
SEGUN BASH: I think that's
for Kanika, and Yaa, and folks

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.147
that want to speak to it.

00:49:28.147 --> 00:49:29.230
It just got a real, y'all.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:32.260
SEGUN BASH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.270
KANIKA: I'm going to
let our guest go first.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.246
SEGUN BASH: Yeah.

00:49:36.246 --> 00:49:37.980
YAA GYASI: That's
a great question.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.460
I mean, I think
part of the reason

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.430
that I wanted to
write "Homegoing"

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:46.190
in the first place was
because I had kind of always

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:50.840
felt this sense of not
being, at least for me,

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.480
not being Ghanaian
enough for Ghanaians

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.840
and not being black enough
for black Americans.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.520
And where did I stand?

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.815
If I couldn't be either of those
things, what did that make me?

00:50:01.815 --> 00:50:04.190
And I think that was something
that I grappled with a lot

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.240
when I was younger.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.070
And those questions
about identity,

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:10.230
both racial identity
and ethnic identity,

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.230
were the ones that
were kind of propelling

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:15.920
me to think about not the
divisions, but the connections.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.900
And so this book was an
opportunity for me to do that.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.860
But I don't know
if that was just

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.500
a personal kind of
therapeutic thing that I did.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:30.410
And I don't know how to extend
that out for other people.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.485
I don't know.

00:50:31.485 --> 00:50:33.860
KANIKA: I think this is going
to sound very prescriptive,

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.880
but I think it's about
education and exposure.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.810
And clearly, the people who came
across you when you came here,

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.510
they had very limited
exposure and had

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.200
certain preconceived notions
in their heads as to what

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.180
you were wearing,
what you looked like,

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.070
and what that represented,
and what that meant.

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:57.050
And so I think we, everyone in
this room and beyond this room,

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.570
we need to start
taking opportunities

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:03.710
wherever we can to
educate those around us,

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.476
to educate those
who come after us,

00:51:06.476 --> 00:51:07.850
those who have
come before us who

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.040
have these preconceived
notions in their heads,

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.480
and expose them.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.810
And so part of it is what
we're doing right now.

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:18.080
As I look around the room,
I see many different races

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.050
and cultures.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.750
And for me, it's about learning.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:23.500
And I would presume
that, for many of you,

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.620
it's about learning and creating
more understanding as well.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.100
YAA GYASI: I think that
goes both ways too,

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.840
because I had
certainly heard things

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.280
from West Africans in my
life that were totally

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.530
inappropriate and
unacceptable that they

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:40.880
had said about black Americans.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.920
And I think it's kind
of beginning to call out

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.280
those things when you see it
so that, especially when it's

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.790
happening to
impressionable children,

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:51.440
that they don't start to
internalize that and believe

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.917
those things about
themselves, not

00:51:53.917 --> 00:51:56.000
just about themselves, but
about their classmates,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.770
about their friends.

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.350
And so that's one
thing you can do

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:03.714
when you see it in your own
life, is just to call it out.

00:52:03.714 --> 00:52:04.610
SEGUN BASH: Yeah.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.570
I think, pretty much, everyone
has to read "Homegoing."

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.600
So [INAUDIBLE] starts
this conversation

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.580
for a lot of folks.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.029
And like Yaa just said, I
think it goes both ways.

00:52:16.029 --> 00:52:17.570
Augustine just shared
his experience,

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:21.380
but I'm sure there might be one
or so people in this room that

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.230
could share an experience
from the black American point

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:26.920
of view and experiences that
they've had with Africans.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.830
And one of the key
reasons we're doing this

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:32.660
is to celebrate Africa Day.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:37.230
Africa Day, little known day,
our holiday, so to speak,

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.340
that we're trying
to start to mark.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.520
And what it marks is the
creation of the African union.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.760
So when you look at
history, you actually

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.090
realize the emancipation
of black people,

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.850
regardless of what
continent they were on,

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.240
all kind of dominoed
at the same time.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.430
And as I did
research for this, I

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:04.910
realized that MLK was
actually in Africa in '57,

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.520
meeting with one of the
leaders of the African union.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.060
And I can just imagine what
that connection was like.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.060
Back then, they saw each
other as brethren fighting

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.520
for a single goal, right?

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.985
What happened in
the last 50 years?

00:53:18.985 --> 00:53:22.100
And I think that's the
challenge for us in the room,

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.830
in this community,
to say, this is

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:28.010
Google, what we do here
spreads out into the world.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:31.910
And if we can take this
challenge on and take us back

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.450
to whatever, I'm
OK with thinking

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.450
that as I sat down in the
room with the founders

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:40.190
of the African union, it
could be something truly

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:43.460
special and truly powerful.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.810
With that said, we
have about a minute,

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:48.320
so we'll take one
last live question.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.810
And then we'll get instructions
on the next portion

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.695
of the event.

00:53:53.695 --> 00:53:56.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.080
Two quick comments
and a question.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.770
First comment, thank
you for the organizers

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:07.030
who put this incredible event
together to introduce me,

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:10.240
as an African, as a
native born Ethiopian,

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.490
who didn't know about
your book or your work,

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:16.920
so will be diving in.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.360
Second comment, I'm incredibly
privileged to actually

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:22.330
experience this day today
with my dad, who happens

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.100
to be visiting and in town.

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.070
And I've got a quick
question for you

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:28.780
with regard to the
appropriateness

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.740
of handing this book
and being able to have

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:36.190
my 10 and my 12-year-old son
and daughter be able to read it,

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:40.870
because you have many times
told my story of coming

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:43.660
to this country with
a foreign background

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.810
and an accent that drives people
crazy because you can't place

00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:47.500
it anywhere.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:51.241
And it takes the shape of
its surrounding very quickly.

00:54:51.241 --> 00:54:54.160
I just wanted to kind
of get your feedback

00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:00.640
on, how would you pass this on
to a young preteen who I really

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:06.574
want to expose some of this work
to and bring the awareness to?

00:55:06.574 --> 00:55:07.990
YAA GYASI: I think
it would be age

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.920
appropriate for a
middle school child.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.810
Maybe not younger than that.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:17.079
But middle school and up, I
think could definitely read it.

00:55:17.079 --> 00:55:18.370
I mean, I've said this before--

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:20.620
I feel very much like
this is the book that I

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.500
wanted to read
when I was that age

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.680
and did have all of these
questions about identity,

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:27.980
and race, and ethnicity.

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:32.812
And so I think, yeah, if I
had had a book like this when

00:55:32.812 --> 00:55:34.270
I was younger, it
might have helped

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:37.630
to make some things
easier as I moved through.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:40.210
So I hope that you do share
it with your children.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:42.977
And thank you, for that comment.

00:55:42.977 --> 00:55:43.810
SEGUN BASH: Awesome.

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.232
Can we just celebrate
Yaa for a second, please?

00:55:46.232 --> 00:55:51.666
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.760
All right, folks, so part two.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.810
For folks that are interested
in the ancestry test,

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:05.520
you're going to have
to exit this way,

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.180
because we have another
diversity event happening

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:11.250
behind us that you should
join once you're done.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.350
But you're going
to exit this way.

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.630
And right opposite Slice
Cafe, the wonderful volunteers

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:21.510
are already there waiting
for you to get started

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.262
in that portion of the event.

00:56:23.262 --> 00:56:24.720
For people interested
in the book--

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.740
and people are booking it--

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.360
for people interested
in the book,

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.580
the book vendor is going
to be outside as well.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.880
Thank you, again,
everyone, for joining us.

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.480
Appreciate it.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.530
[APPLAUSE]
