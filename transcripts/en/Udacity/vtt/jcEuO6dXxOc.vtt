00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Both of these are true.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In class, it was shown that it is impossible

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to produce a random sequence generator,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but if we have is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence, I'm going to sketch out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
how we could use that to generate a random sequence generator.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The first thing that we're going to do in our generate&lt;u&gt;random function&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is loop through all the sequences of length n.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then for each sequence, we will run our is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence test,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and if that is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence test returns true, we will return the sequence.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We have now created a function that generates a random sequence,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which, as we've shown in class, is impossible.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Therefore, is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence is impossible.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The second statement is also true.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This result is a bit counterintuitive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The reason that this is a true statement

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is that any true random number generator must eventually produce sequences

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that fail is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Presumably, is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence would fail, for example,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a sequence of 20 zeros, but a true random number generator

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
would eventually produce that sequence, and this further shows

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the impossibility of having an is&lt;u&gt;random&lt;u&gt;sequence procedure.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
