00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.395
x is greater than or equal to 1.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.689
Let's start out by solving this the same
way we would a linear equation.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.343
So, we'll distribute the 7 to the x and

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:17.050
then to the 1 to get 7x + -7,
is greater than or equal to 5.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.690
We simplify to get 12x- 7 is
greater than or equal to 5.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.660
Add the 7 to both sides and we get
12x is greater than or equal to 12.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.940
We divide by 12 and
we get x is greater than or equal to 1.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.600
We didn't divide by a negative number,
so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.110
we don't put the equality sign,
it stays the same.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.860
Our solution set would look like this
on a number line, our circle is closed

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.290
because one is part of the solution
set and our arrow goes to the right.
