00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.901
“The Great Migration”

00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:07.540
Where’s the forty acres &amp; a mule

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.345
in the long, great getting-up
morning?

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.883
Sharecroppers asked the sun
hidden by cotton &amp; pulpwood.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.451
Hawkish agents

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:25.431
from the northern factories
trekked into Jim Crow twilight

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.961
between promise &amp; no way

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.328
as farmers questioned soil

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.868
under fingernails, the knowhow

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.570
of dreaming in the hot shine

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.973
of blast furnaces up there.

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:46.346
They crossed lines drawn in dust,

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:50.416
huddled in trains racing trees.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.721
Blues hitched a ride, washed out

00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.860
of overalls &amp; jumpers, threadbare suits

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:05.365
&amp; floral dresses, &amp; cotton-sack gowns

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.535
bleached translucent by runagate

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.971
skies at noontime.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.105
As the trains
jostled

00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:17.576
along winding tracks, tales

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.713
of the North Star &amp; rivers to cross

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:24.483
unstitched beneath heavy eyelids

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:28.688
till the electric hum of big cities

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:33.826
shone under the night’s hardscrabble.

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:42.668
A tug of the line,
a fish story on the hook

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:47.925
snagged. The steel mills, foundry smoke

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.511
&amp; hiss, stockyards, packing houses,

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:56.350
Rock Island Mine an unending song

00:01:56.485 --> 00:02:01.460
unwound like a spool of red thick
thread

00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:03.623
in the sluggish dawn.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:07.426
Someone carried the pattern

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.030
of squares &amp; triangles hand sewn

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:14.100
into a circle &amp; passed down.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:20.473
The unborn rode the rail for free.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.785
Some could still see the sanctified

00:02:24.918 --> 00:02:27.380
taken down to the muddy river.

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:31.218
Cuttings, sprigs, &amp; potato vines,

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:34.453
took root in half-gallon tin cans

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:37.990
facing the sooty south windows.

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:45.765
How could any of their children
dream themselves into doctors,

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.735
and lawyers in cold water flats?

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:53.203
Ragged tunes in their heads flowered

00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:56.441
in all-night cabarets &amp; speakeasies

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:59.478
up &amp; down the eastern seaboard.

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:03.916
Shellshock &amp; mustard gas in trenches

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:07.816
followed home some soldiers

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.038
who danced the lindy hop
with the newcomers,

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.748
while others
called them breakers,

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.861
as work

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:19.866
took another life in the words

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:23.970
of poor man porters &amp; superheroes

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.005
in the movies or on the radio,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.310
forgetting the twelve-foot long
cotton sacks,

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:34.613
as they strolled down

00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:38.818
tree-lined boulevards &amp; avenues,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.058
&amp; ghosts from the old country
hung out on street corners

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:50.896
drawn in the drifting harangue

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.433
of field hollers in the snow.
