00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.040
 
so we talked about a failed warning as a

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050
so we talked about a failed warning as a
 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.740
so we talked about a failed warning as a
Cassandra event and we tried to ask

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
Cassandra event and we tried to ask
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.140
Cassandra event and we tried to ask
ourselves in the book why did this

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
ourselves in the book why did this
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.870
ourselves in the book why did this
Cassandra event happen we find that

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
Cassandra event happen we find that
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.259
Cassandra event happen we find that
there are four overall factors there is

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269
there are four overall factors there is
 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.009
there are four overall factors there is
the quality of the Cassandra herself or

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
the quality of the Cassandra herself or
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.939
the quality of the Cassandra herself or
himself then there's the issue itself

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949
himself then there's the issue itself
 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.189
himself then there's the issue itself
and the qualities about the issue that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
and the qualities about the issue that
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.300
and the qualities about the issue that
make a warning relevant to it hard for

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310
make a warning relevant to it hard for
 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.810
make a warning relevant to it hard for
people to accept and the last is the

that convinces them and when they look

in the past have bought experts to

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:13.089
in the past have bought experts to
 

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:16.199
in the past have bought experts to
diminish the threat of global warming so

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:16.209
diminish the threat of global warming so
 

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:18.389
diminish the threat of global warming so
the question we ask is what is the

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399
the question we ask is what is the
 

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:22.139
the question we ask is what is the
critics saying for example in the case

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:22.149
critics saying for example in the case

scientist now at Columbia University who

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:27.730
scientist now at Columbia University who
 

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.509
scientist now at Columbia University who
says that sea-level rise will be much

00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519
says that sea-level rise will be much
 

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:34.910
says that sea-level rise will be much
faster and higher than the UN prediction

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920
faster and higher than the UN prediction
 

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.360
faster and higher than the UN prediction
but we asked other experts about that

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.370
but we asked other experts about that
 

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.040
but we asked other experts about that
they come up with all sorts of criticism

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.050
they come up with all sorts of criticism
 

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.069
they come up with all sorts of criticism
but they never say his data is wrong and

00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079
but they never say his data is wrong and
 

00:09:44.079 --> 00:09:46.620
but they never say his data is wrong and
so when we ask them what's wrong with

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:46.630
so when we ask them what's wrong with
 

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.500
so when we ask them what's wrong with
Jim Hansen's data they say well he's not

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.510
Jim Hansen's data they say well he's not
 

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.230
Jim Hansen's data they say well he's not
really using the scientific method he's

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240
really using the scientific method he's
 

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.639
really using the scientific method he's
making leaps of faith back to Hansen

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:56.649
making leaps of faith back to Hansen
 

00:09:56.649 --> 00:09:59.970
making leaps of faith back to Hansen
how do you respond to that and he says

00:09:59.970 --> 00:09:59.980
how do you respond to that and he says
 

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.139
how do you respond to that and he says
if I use the scientific method I would

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:04.149
if I use the scientific method I would
 

00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:06.319

have to melt Greenland

00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:06.329
have to melt Greenland
 

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:10.079

you want me to melt Greenland repeatedly

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:10.089
you want me to melt Greenland repeatedly
 

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:12.740
you want me to melt Greenland repeatedly

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.530
what Hansen says to us is when the data
is so clear that it meets the scientific

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:19.540
is so clear that it meets the scientific
 

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.190
