00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.440
It turns out that if they went completely
blind before around the age of 5-7 years old,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.580
they will typically dream without any visual
experiences.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.590
In the very few cases where some report having
visual experiences in their dreams, these

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.240
experiences are more in the abstract sense
where they feel like they were seeing something,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.870
even though they couldn’t actually recollect
or describe when they woke up what the thing

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.760
looked liked that they saw.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.650
This is similar to how occasionally in dreams
you can just “know” something, even though

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.710
there is nothing specifically that you are
experiencing in the dream which should indicate

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.820
what you know.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.090
For instance, in a dream where when you wake
up, you remember feeling like you were in

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.720
danger in the dream, even though nothing you
can recall in the dream indicated any danger.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.600
There was just some abstract sense of it.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.750
Outside of the interesting “around the age
of 5-7” cutoff for visual dream experiences,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.400
the dreams of those who are completely blind
before this age tend to be principally auditory

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
in nature.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.720
However, what is also fascinating is that,
compared to those who can see and hear, the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.330
blind report drastically increased taste/smell/touch
sensations in their dreams, not just auditory

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.230
sensations taking over for the lack of visual
sensations.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.840
Now if they go completely blind after around
the age of 5-7, the vast majority of completely

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.920
blind people will at first dream very similar
dreams to those who are not blind, albeit,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.380
once again, with more non-visual sensory experiences
than is reported by those who can see and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.380
hear.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.399
But nevertheless, their visual experiences
in their dreams tend to be quite similar to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.759
those who can see.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.110
If they had diminished vision early on in
life though, perhaps only seeing colors, then

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.009
their visual experiences in their dreams tend
to be similarly diminished based on those

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.900
visual experiences.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.709
As time passes, they typically will report
more and more prevalence of experiences from

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.680
the other senses and less and less visual
experiences in dreams.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.851
Often the visual experiences will become more
vague and “blurry” as time passes, but

00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:29.799
they do seem to remain to some extent throughout
the blind person’s entire life.
