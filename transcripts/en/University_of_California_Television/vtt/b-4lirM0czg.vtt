00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.489
- [Narrator] This
program is a presentation

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:07.823
of UCTV for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:15.495
(soft instrumental music)

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.480
- Good afternoon, I'm Andrew Serry,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.260
Dean of the Graduate Division.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.040
We're pleased along with
the graduate council

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.880
to present Robert Reich,
this year's speaker

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.400
in the Barbara Weinstock
Memorial Lecture Series.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.980
In 1902, Harris Weinstock,
a well-known businessman

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.040
of Sacramento presented the
University of California

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.940
with a fund to support
an annual public lecture

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.253
on the morals of trade on
behalf of his wife, Barbara.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.070
Weinstock was fundamentally committed

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.030
to the economic and moral
progress of humankind.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.750
He wrote many newspaper columns

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.000
and gave numerous lectures on topics

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.160
ranging from Napoleon to socialism.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.130
Inspired by Spencer and Newton's essays

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.600
on the morals of trade

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.210
which lamented the state of morals

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
in the mid 19th century business world

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.420
he argued that a man does not profit

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.810
if he gains the whole world

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.163
and loses his soul.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.150
Harris Weinstock hoped
that this lectureship

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.900
would lead to a better life for those

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900
who spent their lives
in commercial pursuits.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.857
He said, and I quote,

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:48.067
"Let men and women the world over

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:50.877
"worship character rather than wealth.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.737
"Let them do homage to the high-minded

00:01:53.737 --> 00:01:57.357
"and pure-minded rather than
the merely rich and powerful.

00:01:57.357 --> 00:01:59.687
"And the ideal age will be at hand

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:02.497
"when trade will carry
with it the badge of honor

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.417
"and the successful man of business

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:07.297
"will take the high
place hitherto confined

00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:10.880
"to the patriot and faithful
servant of mankind."

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.713
End quote.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.040
Past lecturers who have delivered

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.920
the Barbara Weinstock Memorial Lectures

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.980
on the Morals of Trade include;

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.270
Ralph Nader,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.380
member of Parliament, Neil Kinnock

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.593
and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.330
And now I'd like to welcome
Professor Karlene Roberts,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.180
the Chair of the Weinstock
Lectureship Committee

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.823
to the podium to
introduce Professor Reich.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.160
- Before I introduce
Professor Reich to you,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.210
all of you I'm sure know
a great deal about him

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.780
or you wouldn't be here.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.370
But before I do that I'd like to explain

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.050
why if you look on the
back of your program

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.540
you'll find that there has never been

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.700
a Weinstock lecturer who was
on the faculty at Berkeley

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.870
at the time he was asked to
be the Weinstock lecturer.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.360
And the reason is pretty simple,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.263
we forgot.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.140
So at our meeting to select this lecturer

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.870
as Chair of the Weinstock Committee

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.960
I said, "Look guys"

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.817
by the way it is guys except for Ellen,

00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:20.957
"we have never had a professor
who's on this faculty

00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:24.677
"and look at all the
sterling professors we have

00:03:24.677 --> 00:03:27.050
"beginning with Robert Reich."

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.930
And that was the end of that conversation.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.587
So I want to welcome you all

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.300
and Professor Reich today

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.660
and I'm not gonna say too much about him

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.580
because you have a little blurb about him

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.880
and most of you know about him

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.810
and I've seen his books flying
around here pretty well.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.210
He is the Chancellor's
Professor of Public Policy

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.593
at the Goldman School
here at Berkeley, ra!

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.575
And he was as you probably know

00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:57.308
the 22nd Secretary of Labor.

00:03:57.308 --> 00:04:00.520
He was voted by Time Magazine as being

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.163
one of the most outstanding
secretaries of labor.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.290
He's written quite a bit.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.350
I hear him on the radio quite a bit.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.770
And so I think we're all
anxious to get on with it

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.300
and listen to Professor Reich.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.800
I just wanted to tell you
something I didn't know,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.270
he graduated from Dartmouth

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.130
and then he went on to be
Rhode's Scholar at Oxford

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.130
and then he got a law degree from Yale.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.130
And he has talked to the Supreme Court

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.150
on the part of the U.S. government.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.348
May I welcome, Robert Reich.

00:04:36.348 --> 00:04:39.515
(audience applauding)

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.700
- Thank you, Professor Roberts.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.320
And thank you all for coming today.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.480
A couple of other points need to be said,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.190
about Harris Weinstock and this lecture,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.563
The Morals of Trade,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.080
many of you in this audience know

00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:03.925
that about 12 years
before Harris Weinstock

00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:06.900
endowed this lecture

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.430
and conceived of this lecture

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.430
in 1890, the great
economist Alfred Marshall

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.740
wrote his Principles of Economics.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.110
Before that time economics
was not really thought of

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.360
as a separate discipline.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.930
In most of the 19th century

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.713
it was all called moral,
political economy.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.100
And before that in the 18th century

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.503
it was all called moral philosophy.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.300
Adam Smith did not consider
himself an economist,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.700
obviously, did not even
really consider himself

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.880
a political economist.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.883
He thought of himself
as a moral philosopher.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.590
And so even though I'm going to be talking

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.810
to you a lot about economics and politics

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.910
really underlying what I am saying

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.240
are questions and ethics,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.350
questions as how we live together

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.680
as members of the same society

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.633
and members of really the same
human species on the globe.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.140
We're all reminded of that notion

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.150
that we're all together as
members of the same human species

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.000
on the globe

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.100
and what we do is inevitably

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.830
going to affect what others do,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.390
directly or indirectly,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.103
by the terrible tragedy
now unfolding in Japan.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.090
It is first and foremost a human tragedy

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.550
and also an environmental tragedy.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.200
We don't know the dimensions yet

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.640
and probably like you I have been getting

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.373
every piece of information I possibly can.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.890
But it is also way down the list

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.950
an economic tragedy.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.229
Japan is the third largest
economy in the world,

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.620
in fact of developed economies,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.210
so called advanced economies,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.600
Japan is second only to us.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.540
Which means that we
have an enormous amount

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.290
of trade with Japan.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.120
Japan owns a lot of our debt,
a lot of treasury bills.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.250
What happens in Japans inevitably,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.620
quite apart from the human suffering,

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.190
quite apart from the
environmental degradation,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.430
quite apart from these
very, very important

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.540
primary issues,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.170
there is also the economic interdependence

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.560
and the economic consequences

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.060
which I'll get to in a moment.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.090
A question I want to
address with you today

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.963
is what is going to happen
over the next few years?

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.280
In an economy, that is
the United States economy,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.030
that is having a painfully difficult time

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.550
getting out of the gravitational pull

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.510
of The Great Recession.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.260
Now if you listen

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.253
to people on Wall Street,

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.020
if you appear as I do on CNBC

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.980
or listen to, I don't know

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.930
how many of you actually watch CNBC?

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.043
Don't be embarrassed.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.633
That's about what I expected.

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:12.389
(audience laughing)

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:14.540
I debate people on CNBC

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.380
and on MSNBC and
occasionally on the networks

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.450
and what passes for
economic discussion on CNBC

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.030
is very much Wall Street's point of view.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.180
That is the issue is
what's going to happen

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.994
to stocks and bonds,

00:08:30.994 --> 00:08:32.360
it's not really the economy or at least,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.411
perhaps I should say it this way.

00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:36.980
The economy is defined as Wall Street,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.270
as stocks and bonds.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.200
And that is not to criticize
CNBC or anybody else,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.880
that's what the business
pages of the newspapers

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.130
tell us that's what many experts focus on

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.240
because so many people are dependent

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.710
on what happens on Wall Street,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.712
they want to know, their
retirement income depends on it.

00:08:56.712 --> 00:08:59.860
Their future security depends on it,

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.640
they like to know where
Wall Street is heading.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.210
And I will tell you,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.250
before the end of our 45 minutes

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.700
I'll tell you exactly
where Wall Street is going.

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:12.850
(audience laughing)

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.143
I'll do it very rapidly,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.123
so listen carefully.

00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:18.701
You may miss it because it's so,

00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:20.730
it will occur so rapidly.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.440
But that's not the economy,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.890
the real American economy is
different from Wall Street.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.560
If you listen only to the
cheerleaders on Wall Street

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.690
you see, we've had a huge bull market,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.240
things are almost back to
where they were before.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.870
The Dow Jones Industrial Average

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.780
is over 12,000.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.560
Well that's not quite
where it was in 2007,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.603
but it's still getting way up there.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.270
And on top of that corporate
executives salaries

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.350
and bonuses on Wall Street

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.223
are just about back to where they were.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.980
And things are looking very good.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.740
Yes, there is some concern

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.100
about the consequences of
the United States economy

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.800
of what's happened in Japan

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.560
and there is some worry about oil prices

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.090
given what's happening in the Middle East.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.660
But generally speaking

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.090
there's an enormous,
almost buoyant confidence

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.830
that comes out of Wall Street

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.080
and out of corporate America.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.720
Corporate profits by the way

00:10:19.687 --> 00:10:21.330
are soaring.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.178
They really have in my experience

00:10:24.178 --> 00:10:26.470
never been if you look at the major,

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.930
large American corporations

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.543
almost never this high.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.530
Big companies in the United States

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:38.530
are sitting on 1.8
trillion dollars of cash.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.050
Now those estimates vary
between 1.4 trillion

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.700
and 1.9 trillion.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.270
I saw yesterday at the end
of 2010 it was 1.9 trillion,

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.670
it's very difficult to estimate.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.710
It's hard to get, but we
know it's a very big number.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.940
There's a lot of money and
they are sitting on it,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.190
it's in the form of cash.

00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:02.030
Which means that big
companies don't even know

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.493
really what to do with it.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.110
Normally, normally after a recession

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.520
when large companies begin showing profits

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.250
they take those profits
and they invest them

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.620
in additional capacity.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.250
Which means more jobs,

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.450
not immediately.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.580
There is typically a jobless recovery,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.560
at least until businesses
start feeling confident

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.090
that consumers out there will buy

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.389
and are capable of buying
all of the goods and services

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:38.900
that those companies
are capable of producing

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.950
at full employment.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.070
But then employment cranks up

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.860
and you get a virtuous cycle
because as employment goes up

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.600
and people get more wages

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.160
and they feel more confident

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.550
and they feel more secure they buy more

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.853
and as they buy more the
economy naturally rises.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.560
Most of the business
cycle in this country,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.530
at least most of our recent experiences

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.490
with the business cycle,

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.270
by the cycle I'm talking about the cycle

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.503
of exuberance and expansion

00:12:08.503 --> 00:12:10.506
and then overshooting

00:12:10.506 --> 00:12:13.915
which leads to a kind
of downward momentum,

00:12:13.915 --> 00:12:17.574
often recession is the ending point.

00:12:17.574 --> 00:12:21.070
Most of those cycles,
those business cycles,

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.960
are really brought about by
the Federal Reserve Board.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.667
And the Federal Reserve
Board either overshoots

00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:28.500
or undershoots.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.690
The Fed either raises
interest rates too high,

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.540
trying to ward off inflation

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.090
or it keeps interest rates too low

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.810
and generates just too
much economic activity

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.930
given the capacity of the
country to avoid inflation.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.733
And that's what it is usually,

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.883
but something is different this time.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.740
Something is different this time,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.093
profoundly different.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.460
There is a decoupling

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.720
between the profits that the
big companies are showing

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.060
and the extraordinary gains
on Wall Street on the one hand

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.220
and job growth on the other.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.060
There's a decoupling between how people

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.014
at the top are doing

00:13:16.014 --> 00:13:17.270
and they are doing extraordinarily well.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.920
I'm talking about the top
1% on the income scale

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.230
or the top 1% on the wealth scale

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.420
or even the top 1/10th of 1%

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.070
to make a point even more dramatically,

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.256
they've never done as well.

00:13:31.256 --> 00:13:33.440
There's a dramatic gap
between how they are doing

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.793
and how everyone else is
doing in this recovery.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.850
And going back to Harris
Weinstock's concern

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.850
about the morality of trade

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.570
or the morality of our commercial system

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.023
something seems out of whack.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.940
And many people are asking themselves

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.833
what's going on?

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:55.666
Now again if you think of this

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:58.470
as just the normal business cycle

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.660
you would expect that when
the Federal Reserve Board

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.532
kept interest rates near zero or at zero

00:14:04.532 --> 00:14:07.690
for as long as it has

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.077
we would see a lot of borrowing going on

00:14:10.077 --> 00:14:13.393
and that borrowing would
generate more economic activity.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.170
You would think when we
had as much spending,

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.480
at least until recently,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.130
as we had at the Federal government level

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.470
that that would have generated enough

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.090
of a so-called multiplier effect.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.440
That is every one who benefited
directly by the spending

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.780
would have more money in their pockets,

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.460
they would turn around and buy more

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.020
and so on that that would
also have contributed

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.393
to a vigorous recovery.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.490
You would expect that fiscal
and monetary policies,

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.650
as those are called,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.903
would by now have kicked in.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.400
And given how deep a hole
we have found ourselves in

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.740
in this Great Recession

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.320
you would think that by now

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.605
not only would unemployment
start really dropping

00:15:00.605 --> 00:15:05.605
but also the economy would start growing.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.770
I mean if you're in a hole

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.520
to get back to the surface,

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.190
back to where you were before,

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.000
you do need more than normal growth.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.330
I mean think of the economy

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.163
of sort of,

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.270
almost a climb, a kind
of you're moving uphill.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.700
The economy is growing,

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.640
but when you fall into
a hole on that climb

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.010
then you need to have faster growth

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.230
in order to just get back to the surface

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.330
where you can then resume
the growth you had before.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.930
So what we would normally assume would be,

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.120
instead of 2.5 and or 3% growth now,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.737
we would assume four, or
five, or 6% or 7% growth.

00:15:41.737 --> 00:15:43.683
It's not happening.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.913
Mystery upon mystery.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.003
Something is different.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.410
Well I wanna talk about that

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.150
because it seems to me

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.140
that what really is happening

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:04.003
has a lot to do with
long-term structural changes

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.680
in the economy,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.183
changes that have a lot in
turn to do with inequality,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.700
of income and wealth

00:16:16.126 --> 00:16:17.760
and opportunity

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.943
and political power.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.713
No one likes to talk
about political power,

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.723
I will.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.420
And less and less to do
with the business cycle

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.412
and this is why it seems to me

00:16:33.412 --> 00:16:35.893
that people are looking in
the wrong place for answers.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.350
Don't get me wrong,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.150
I do think the Fed needs
to keep interest rates

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.760
as low as possible.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.390
I do think

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.700
and wish Washington were prepared

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.490
to expand fiscal policy.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.080
I think it's the height of folly

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.409
for congress and for
the president right now,

00:16:56.409 --> 00:17:00.060
right now to be concerned
about budget deficits.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.120
Yes, be concerned about it three or four

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.922
or five years from now

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:05.660
when we are out of the gravitational pull

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.700
of The Great Recession.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.020
But right now when we need

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.810
as much aggregate demand as possible,

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.130
when consumers are still scared,

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.430
when businesses are still
sitting on so much money

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.660
because they don't think
that there are customers

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.930
out there for their goods and services.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.120
When we have unemployment
as high as we do,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.960
nationally, 8.9%, 8.8%,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.960
but also almost 14 million
Americans unemployed,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.090
half of them unemployed for
a very long period of time.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.020
This is no time to pull in your horns

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.463
and start cutting and
whacking budget deficits.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.580
And oil prices are going up

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.430
and at the same time state
governments are pulling in

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.113
and cutting their budgets.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.770
And many of the things that are being cut

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.920
are desperately important

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.089
to the working class and the middle class

00:18:01.089 --> 00:18:03.070
and the poor who are
suffering enormously in this.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.243
Don't do it, not now.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.180
But having made that
point I want to go beyond

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.763
and talk about inequality.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.180
Here it seems to me

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.050
is the terrain that we
really need to traverse

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.200
in terms of understanding
what's happening.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.080
The typical 30-year-old man,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.760
and I'll explain to you in a moment

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.190
why I'm talking about the 30-year-old man,

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.440
the typical 30-year-old man today,

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.950
if he has a job

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.340
is earning, adjusted for inflation,

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.090
no more than the typical
30-year-old man earned

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.300
three decades ago.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.683
Adjusted for inflation.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.080
Or to put it a different way

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.920
if you look at the bottom 90% of Americans

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.800
and looked at their average wage,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.123
adjusted for inflation,

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.660
each worker would be
doing a little bit better,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.500
that is would earn this year about $280

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.083
more than he or she
earned three decades ago.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.030
That's not much to show
over three decades.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.580
The American economy is much larger,

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.290
it's twice as large as it was

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.883
three decades ago.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:33.020
And yet the median wage for
those lucky enough to have jobs

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.133
has gone nowhere and if
anything it's gone down.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.073
Why?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.370
What's going on and how does this relate

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.480
to The Great Recession

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.907
and the difficulty
we're having getting out

00:19:48.907 --> 00:19:49.933
of The Great Recession.

00:19:49.933 --> 00:19:52.470
How does this relate
to questions of ethics

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.343
and morality?

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.373
And also where did all the money go?

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.410
I mean if the American
economy is twice as large

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.950
as it was 30 years ago

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.550
and if the median wage is
pretty much stuck in neutral

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.290
then you've got to have some idea

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.693
of where all the gains went.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.850
If you're in the top 1%

00:20:27.071 --> 00:20:28.521
you are not stuck in neutral,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.100
your share of total income doubled

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.313
over the last 30 years.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.900
If they're in the top 1/10th of 1%,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.380
your share of the national income tripled

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.343
over the last 30 years.

00:20:47.425 --> 00:20:52.324
We haven't seen this degree
on concentration of income

00:20:52.324 --> 00:20:54.993
and wealth is even more concentrated,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.253
since the 1920s.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.693
More about that in a moment.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.300
How have working families
over the last 30 years

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.280
managed to maintain
their standard of living?

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.023
How have they managed
to continue to spend?

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.860
Well, one of three ways.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.423
The first way was women
going into paid work.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.800
In great numbers, starting
in the late 1970s,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.600
increasing in the 1980s,
increasing again in the 1990s.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.410
A huge number of women
in the United States

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.220
went into paid work.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.670
I wish I could tell you it was all because

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.140
of the wonderful,
professional opportunities

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.300
open to professional women

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.623
beginning in the late 70s
and starting in the 80s.

00:21:46.623 --> 00:21:48.413
No, that was not the primary reason.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.160
The primary reason that
women went into paid work

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.500
in great numbers, even
those with young children,

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.210
was because they needed
to in order to prop up

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.659
family incomes where male wage earners

00:22:01.659 --> 00:22:06.659
were actually showing declines in wages.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.650
That's the only way

00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:10.524
they could keep up their living standards.

00:22:10.524 --> 00:22:13.200
But you know we come to an
end of that coping mechanism.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.710
In the 1960s, to give an example,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.160
only about 20% of women
with young children

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.670
were in the paid workforce.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.400
I say paid, because women
always were working.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.315
The question is whether

00:22:26.315 --> 00:22:27.819
they were getting paid for their work.

00:22:27.819 --> 00:22:30.960
And 20% of American women in the 1960s

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.200
with young children were
in the paid workforce.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.214
By the 1980s and 1990s

00:22:37.214 --> 00:22:40.810
we were up to 50 and 60%,

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.330
in fact by the 1990s it
was up to 60% of women

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.770
with young children were
in the paid workforce.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.123
Well you can't go much beyond that.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.500
American families had to search

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.330
for a second coping mechanism,

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.203
a way of keeping going.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.950
And the second coping mechanism

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.503
was for everybody to work longer hours.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.110
When I was secretary of labor

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.820
I remember looking over the data

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.990
on the number of hours
Americans were working

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.860
and I couldn't believe it.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.920
In terms of overtime, in
terms of billable hours,

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.180
in terms of second jobs,
in terms of third jobs.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.450
Americans had never worked
that long, that hard,

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.840
350 hours a year longer

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.660
than the typical European.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.253
Longer even than they
typical worker in Japan.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.610
Two incomes, everybody working longer,

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:47.363
I used to have a demographic term I used,

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.120
DINS, D-I-N-S.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.973
Double income, no sex.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.630
(audience laughing)

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.930
I don't know how we
reproduced in those years.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:02.930
And then that obviously was exhausted,

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.426
that second coping mechanism

00:24:05.426 --> 00:24:06.770
because there are only a
certain number of hours

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.793
people can work.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.883
And right about then, late 1990s,

00:24:13.179 --> 00:24:15.590
a third coping mechanism came along.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.080
It was almost as if there were trapezes

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.410
and you moved from one to the other.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.310
There is just a trapeze just in time

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.280
to save us, to enable us
to keep on maintaining

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.350
our standard of living

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.830
and that third coping mechanism,

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.950
that third trapeze was
rising housing values

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.780
that enabled the working-middle-class

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.550
to refinance their homes

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.820
or to take out home equity loans

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.490
all of which enabled people to live

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.260
better than they otherwise could live,

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.033
going deeper and deeper into debt.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.810
But the rising home values seemed

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.753
an easy means of maintaining that debt.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.133
Well, that proved elusory.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.610
When I came to Berkeley in 2006

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.750
I had an opportunity,

00:25:18.405 --> 00:25:21.190
I was very, very fortunate to get an offer

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.070
from the University of
California, Berkeley

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.630
to come and teach here

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.350
leaving the East Coast,

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.250
leaving the weather on the East Coast,

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:32.260
leaving snow and sleet

00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:35.325
and horrid summers

00:25:37.337 --> 00:25:39.560
and everything that you
don't even know about

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.010
that occurs.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.070
But I bought a house,

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.530
I bought a house here in Berkeley.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.830
I think it was April, I
think it was the first week

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.040
of April of 2006.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.470
Which is important for you to know

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.430
because that was when the housing market

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.743
reached its zenith.

00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:57.870
(audience laughing)

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.850
You see my investment
strategy has always been,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.849
buy high, sell low.

00:26:03.849 --> 00:26:06.849
(audience laughing)

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.130
Those extraordinary houses
values couldn't keep up.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.500
The debt load couldn't be maintained.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.720
There was no way that,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.870
that's what turned out to
be a speculative bubble,

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:21.863
could continue.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.183
And obviously it didn't.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.280
That debt bubble burst

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.960
and when it burst the final
coping mechanism also burst.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.440
There was no way that the typical American

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.080
could continue to maintain
the same living standard

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.800
and continue to be a customer,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.340
continue to consume

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.560
in ways that Americans had
for three decades before.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.380
And without customers,

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.230
without as many customers,

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.460
without people being as willing to buy

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.450
the economy is not going
to hire that many people.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.060
Companies are not going to hire,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.010
the entire wheels of commerce begin

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.143
grinding to a halt.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.360
Now I know that the version of events

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.580
that you have in your head

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.390
about why The Great Recession occurred

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.290
has much more to do with
Wall Street's excesses

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.650
than anything I've said to you so far.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.560
And I don't want to let
Wall Street off the hook.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.014
Wall Street did over reach.

00:27:28.014 --> 00:27:32.070
And regulators who were
supposed to look at Wall Street

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.433
did look the other way.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.270
I'm just saying that
behind all of this lies

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.763
a deeper, structural story.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.550
That has more to do with the plights

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.130
of the working and
middle classes of America

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.073
and stagnate incomes.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.540
And the final failure of
the third coping mechanism

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.990
which was debt to enable
people to continue

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.483
to buy as before.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.810
Right after President Obama was elected

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:07.800
he had a meeting

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.720
of several of his economic
advisors in Chicago

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.583
and I attended the meeting.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.030
And I remember Paul Volcker was there

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.960
along with my colleague at Berkeley,

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.763
Laura Tyson and several others.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.415
Paul Volcker, as you may know,

00:28:25.415 --> 00:28:27.966
was the former head of
the Federal Reserve Board.

00:28:27.966 --> 00:28:28.890
He's very, very tall,

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.006
he's remarkably tall,
he's irresponsibly tall.

00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:34.400
(audience laughing)

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.653
I mean in environmental terms,

00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:38.540
(audience laughing)

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.890
he uses up more energy

00:28:40.879 --> 00:28:42.310
and exudes more carbon

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.263
than anybody I know.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.770
But in any event we were talking about

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.452
The Great Recession

00:28:52.452 --> 00:28:53.720
and of course this is
a very important time.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.060
The new president has just been elected.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.670
Things look like they're collapsing

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:58.870
and they were collapsing

00:28:59.782 --> 00:29:00.750
and the new president wants to know why,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.590
what's going on.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.687
And Paul Volcker I remember said,

00:29:03.687 --> 00:29:07.937
"Mr. President, yes Wall
Street has gone berserk

00:29:07.937 --> 00:29:12.057
"and exceeded the boundaries
that we expect of Wall Street

00:29:12.057 --> 00:29:13.637
"and there wasn't adequate regulation

00:29:13.637 --> 00:29:15.907
"but underlying all of
this, Mr. President,

00:29:15.907 --> 00:29:17.795
"underlying all of this

00:29:17.795 --> 00:29:19.840
"is the simple fact that Americans

00:29:20.684 --> 00:29:23.817
"spent more than they earned.

00:29:23.817 --> 00:29:26.487
"They lived beyond their
means for too long."

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.740
Lived beyond our means,

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.270
we have lived beyond our means.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.950
That's what Paul Volcker's view was

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.300
and that view you can still see around.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.185
It is a rather moralistic view

00:29:37.185 --> 00:29:39.863
to go back to Harris Weinstock.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.943
But then Laura Tyson, my colleague here,

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.920
piped up and she said,

00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:51.671
"No, Paul, I think you're wrong.

00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:53.538
"I don't think the underlying problem

00:29:53.538 --> 00:29:55.417
"is Americans spent beyond their means,

00:29:55.417 --> 00:29:56.497
"or lived beyond their means,

00:29:56.497 --> 00:29:58.117
"I think the problem is their means

00:29:58.117 --> 00:29:59.257
"did not keep up."

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.593
and of course Laura was absolutely right.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.170
Their means did not keep up
with what we would expect

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:15.223
an expanding economy, a
growing economy, to permit.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.820
Now this being Berkeley

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.380
many of you in this room, obviously,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.710
and I don't mean to
sound in any way snarky

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.860
about the comment I'm about to make.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.967
But this being Berkeley,

00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:31.060
may of you in this room
think about consumption

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.560
in a way that many people in
the rest of this country don't

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.660
think about it.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.960
That is to you, consumption
is just the acquisition

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.790
of a lot of material goods,

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.363
just filling up houses with stuff.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.200
And maybe, although I don't
really want to presume

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.500
to read your heads,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.467
maybe you may be saying to yourself,

00:30:55.467 --> 00:30:58.640
"Look, what's wrong with
us not consuming as much?"

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.850
In fact we are consuming too much.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.310
We are consuming about a quarter

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.210
of the world's energy resources.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.240
Maybe it's a good thing that
we're not consuming as much?

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.710
I want to draw a distinction,

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.040
just for you in this room

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.239
and for anybody who's
watching on streaming video,

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:19.770
(audience laughing)

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.370
between consumption and consumerism.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.740
What you may be worried about

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.623
and I worry about it too

00:31:28.623 --> 00:31:31.650
is just a mentality of consuming
more and more and more.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.130
No, I'm talking about
consumption in broader terms,

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.840
it's not just individuals or families

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.930
buying and consuming

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.700
it's also public goods.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.860
It's what we as a people,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.220
as a nation are able to afford to do.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.320
It's better education and more education.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.530
It's more healthcare
and better healthcare.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.490
It's public transportation,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.020
it's all sorts of things

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.390
that also could if we did more of it

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.123
utilize our productive
capacity as a nation.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.730
Some of that will actually
be on a better environment,

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.400
we can if we spend more

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.100
and this sounds ironic and paradoxical,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.140
but if we spend more we
might actually be able

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.603
to move away from carbon fuels.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.480
It means some investments
in basic research

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.030
in non-carbon-based fuels,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.200
you get my drift.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.270
I just want you to, in your heads,

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:36.790
I want to cut off what I
expect some questions might be,

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.920
isn't it good that we are
not consuming as much?

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.390
Again, consumerism, this is not
an argument for consumerism,

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.790
this is an argument for
having enough aggregate demand

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.420
in the system to keep the system going.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.030
And that aggregate demand could come

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.506
from a variety of
sources including sources

00:32:53.506 --> 00:32:55.904
that are public goods that
everybody in this room

00:32:55.904 --> 00:32:58.283
or most of you might approve of.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:00.853
Now,

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.220
I want to go back because

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.190
some of you may having heard this story

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.993
want to understand,

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.450
because obviously what I'm doing now

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:19.450
is trying to explain why we are
in the predicament we're in,

00:33:20.153 --> 00:33:21.040
why it's so hard to get out

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.290
of the gravitational pull
of The Great Recession.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.360
What we need to do next,

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.276
what we need to do next.

00:33:27.276 --> 00:33:29.100
What I'm trying to lay the foundation for

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.190
is that kind of next move,

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.420
how do we get out of the
predicament that we're in.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.433
Some of you may be asking
yourselves right now,

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.540
what do we know

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.540
about why beginning three decades ago?

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.180
So much of the nations income and wealth

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.683
started going to the top.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.370
I mean there must be some
reason for all of this

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.093
and did it ever happen before?

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.030
The answer is yes and yes,

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.510
there is a reason and
it did happen before.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.120
And by looking at when it happened before

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.400
we can get a glimpse at or a clue

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.890
as to why it began happening again

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:18.240
beginning in the late 70s
and beginning in the 1980s

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.900
and maybe that will give us some notion

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.450
of what to do next.

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.003
Of what we need to do next.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.530
In 2007

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:36.770
the top 1% by income in the United States

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.373
got 23.5% of total national income.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.430
Now as I said to your before

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:48.180
that was more than double
what they had 30 years before.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.210
30 years before they
were getting about nine

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.650
or nine-and-a-half percent

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:54.900
of total national income.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.060
Now go back in time in the United States

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:03.060
and ask yourself when
was it that the top 1%

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:09.210
had anything close to 23.5%
of total national income?

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.833
Was there another time?

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.090
And if you look at the data

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.370
what you see is that
there was another time,

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.030
in fact there was another year

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.330
that almost remarkably, exactly parallels

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:26.800
the peak year of 2007, in terms
of concentration of income.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.983
And that other year is 1928.

00:35:37.246 --> 00:35:38.650
(audience laughing)

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.223
And then came 1929,

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.350
now I'm not suggesting
that The Great Crash

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:49.453
and also the 2008 crash,

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.630
were necessarily only responsive

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.450
to these widening disparities

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.943
but there are very important parallels.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.870
The head of the Federal Reserve Board

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.973
between 1934 and 1948,

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.173
was a man named Marriner Eccles.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:16.020
How many of you have
heard of Marriner Eccles?

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.870
Put up your hand.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.795
I'm surprised, 17 of you.

00:36:21.795 --> 00:36:23.210
(audience laughing)

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:27.210
Marriner Eccles, in
researching my latest book

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.320
about all of this,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.270
I came across Marriner Eccles work

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.940
on The Great Depression.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.080
Marriner Eccles

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.900
came to the conclusion

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.320
that The Great Depression

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.940
was a function of widening inequality

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.957
because he said,

00:36:42.957 --> 00:36:45.287
"So much income concentrated at the top

00:36:45.287 --> 00:36:48.420
"that the only way the
vast majority of Americans

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.780
could keep spending and
maintain the economy

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.580
and the government could keep maintaining

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.080
to the extent that the government
was spending in those days

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.000
was

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.100
by means of going deeper
and deeper into debt.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:08.383
And that debt bubble
could not be sustained.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:10.843
It exploded.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.263
And it exploded in 1929.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:25.503
And so there is a very powerful parallel.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.350
What did Franklin D. Roosevelt do?

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:32.383
He did two things.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:36.953
Belatedly,

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.280
one of them he did very poorly.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.010
One of them it turned out he did very well

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.760
but he didn't know he was doing it.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.160
What did Barrack Obama do

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.893
after 2008?

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.620
Well he did one of the things

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.870
that Franklin D. Roosevelt did do,

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.820
but he did it much better

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.800
than Franklin D. Roosevelt did,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.090
but he didn't do the other thing

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.780
that Franklin D. Roosevelt did.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.435
Let me stop being so opaque.

00:38:06.435 --> 00:38:08.040
(audience laughing)

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.040
Franklin D. Roosevelt, first of all,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.670
there was a liquidity crisis,

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.930
a banking crisis.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.760
What Franklin D. Roosevelt did

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.600
and he built upon Herbert Hoover,

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.460
he basically closed the banks,

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.530
he tried to provide some more liquidity.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.540
He didn't know exactly what he was doing,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.310
there were runs on banks.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.690
You remember Jimmy Stewart,

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:27.993
It's a Wonderful Life.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.170
You're money is in her property

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.460
and her money is in your property,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.280
it didn't matter there
were still runs on banks.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.790
But Franklin D. Roosevelt did try to stop

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:39.840
the runs on the banks

00:38:40.704 --> 00:38:41.980
with pumping in more money,

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.303
not nearly enough.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.890
The Obama Administration
learned from that.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.750
Ben Bernanke was a student,

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.500
he'd written a lot about
The Great Depression

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.750
and others in the, both the
George W. Bush Administration,

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.640
but more importantly in
the Obama Administration

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.980
understand the important
of flooding the economy

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.610
with liquidity, of getting
confidence in the banks back,

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.420
even to the extent of giving
the banks, the major banks,

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.683
a taxpayer funded bailout.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.970
Now it's easy to say in retrospect,

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:20.150
but even at the time I was advising

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:28.320
that the bailout of the banks be connected

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.383
to conditions put on the banks.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.730
Conditions such as supporting legislation

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.650
that would allow homeowners
to declare bankruptcy

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.160
on their first homes and thereby give them

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.630
a little bit more leverage
in their negotiations

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.513
with lenders.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.390
Putting caps on bonuses and so forth,

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:51.770
but none of this happened.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.810
But nevertheless,

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.290
this was the lesson that came out

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.460
of The Great Depression,

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.040
what you do when you
have a banking crisis,

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.350
when you have a financial crisis.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.719
And I think that really,

00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:05.206
the Obama Administration

00:40:05.206 --> 00:40:07.406
apart from not being
tough enough with banks

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.800
did that pretty well.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.077
We avoided a meltdown.

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:16.263
Unfortunate choice of words right now.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.210
But what the Obama
Administration did not do

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.953
that Franklin D. Roosevelt did do,

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:29.800
and herein lies the very important

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.283
lesson unlearned.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.610
Franklin D. Roosevelt

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.590
took an economy in which the gap

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.900
between the very rich, the super rich

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.830
and everybody else was
growing immeasurably

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.780
and did several things that
actually changed the equation.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.110
Number one, the Wagner Act,

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.690
the National Labor Relations Act in 1935

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.790
creating a right to collective bargaining.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.690
Imposing on employers

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.087
the duty to bargain in
good faith with employees.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.790
That it turned out had a huge effect,

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:14.790
by the 1950s when 35% of
Americans were in trade unions.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.760
And those, I'm talking
about American workers,

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.650
and those were not in trade unions

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.531
benefited by the negotiations

00:41:24.531 --> 00:41:28.820
that unions created with employers

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.020
because the prevailing wages

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.750
really were set even
in the non-union sector

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:37.780
by employers who feared
that if they did not mimic

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.150
what was in those labor agreements

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.080
they would be next to become unionized.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.803
So it had an effect all over the economy.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.163
Franklin D. Roosevelt also
created a minimum wage.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:55.630
A 40-hour workweek with time-and-a-half

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.583
for overtime.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.200
Social Security

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.640
including aid for families
with dependent children,

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.493
disability came later.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.040
A long list of things that we
almost take for granted now.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.453
Unemployment insurance, 1938.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.220
All of the foundation
stones for a modern economy

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.490
based on the idea

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.003
that workers are also consumers.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.400
And there's no way in which
an economy can function

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.210
unless that basic bargain linking workers

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:44.180
and their productivity to their pay

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.180
so that they can turn around and consume

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.043
would be maintained.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.800
By the 1950s

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.670
not only did we have all of that

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.780
but we also had a GI Bill,

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.973
many Americans were attending college.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.390
We had a huge investment in infrastructure

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.400
under Eisenhower,

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.840
the National Defense Highway Act

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.353
creating the entire
Interstate Highway System.

00:43:16.777 --> 00:43:21.777
After Sputnik, investments
in the education

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.050
and training of a whole
generation of science

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.030
and mathematics teachers

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.960
and new investments in the classrooms

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.693
in terms of math and science teaching.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.603
We rebuilt Europe in those years.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.100
We rebuilt Japan.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.743
How did we do that after
the Second World War?

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.900
Well in part because our economy

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.810
was growing very fast.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:50.030
But I remember we also had a huge deficit.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.100
In fact we came out of World War II

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.380
with a national debt that was

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.420
as a proportion of our
whole national product

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.870
over 100%.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.450
The national debt was larger

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.180
than the yearly national
product of the United States

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.979
after World War II.

00:44:06.979 --> 00:44:09.390
I remember in 1950, my father,

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.990
this was my first economics lesson,

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.173
my father saying to me,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.017
"Bobby, you and your children

00:44:14.017 --> 00:44:16.477
"and your children's children

00:44:16.477 --> 00:44:18.027
"will be paying the national debt

00:44:18.027 --> 00:44:19.900
"created by Franklin D. Roosevelt."

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.350
It scared the hell out of me.

00:44:22.211 --> 00:44:23.075
(audience laughing)

00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:24.395
I remember I couldn't sleep.

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:25.413
I didn't know what national debt was,

00:44:26.883 --> 00:44:27.872
(audience laughing)

00:44:27.872 --> 00:44:28.705
but I knew it would
haunt me and my children

00:44:28.705 --> 00:44:30.023
and my children's children.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.853
But my father, who was
right about most things,

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:35.613
was wrong.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:40.273
How did we afford all of that?

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.190
Well we afforded it
because the economy grew

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.263
so buoyantly.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.630
Because that pact between workers

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:51.993
and employers,

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.130
many of the investments

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.080
that had been made in education

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.223
and infrastructure began to pay off.

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:03.670
Also the marginal income tax,

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.923
on the highest earners,

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.730
was substantially higher.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.270
Coming out of the Second World War

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.750
it was over 70%

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.260
and under Dwight D. Eisenhower,

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.593
who nobody to my mind has ever
accused of being a socialist,

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.320
Republican, former general,
Dwight D. Eisenhower,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.550
the marginal income tax on the top earners

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:28.010
was 91%.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.220
Now of the effective rate,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.040
when you got rid of all the deductions

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.890
and the tax credits, was lower than that

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.440
but still much, much higher

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.393
than anybody is talking about today.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.340
My point to you

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.760
is that the legacy of The New Deal

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.240
right through

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.993
Truman and Eisenhower,

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:55.993
right through John F. Kennedy and Johnson,

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.700
right through those years

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.620
those legacies of public investment

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.760
and shared prosperity

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.670
and shared sacrifice

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.340
and a deal, a basic bargain

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.200
between employers and employees

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:19.600
built a new American economy.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.990
That grew faster than the
economy has ever grown since

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.110
in those 30 years after the
Second World War, we grew,

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:27.943
we grew.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.340
Sometimes people ask me

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.380
when I talk about where we should go,

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.320
I talk about the principles
of shared prosperity

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.050
and shared sacrifice.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.460
I talk about public
investment in education

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.730
and infrastructure,

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:47.523
basic research and development.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:51.000
I talk about renewing the bargain

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.640
between employers and employees.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.490
People say to me,

00:46:55.007 --> 00:46:55.840
name a nation,

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.070
What are you talking
about the Netherlands,

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.141
the Netherlands or Sweden or Norway,

00:47:00.141 --> 00:47:01.400
they're not like us.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.530
Are you talking about Canada?

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.433
They're socialists up there.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:06.920
People say to me

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.220
and I get on these talk shows

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.900
and people form the Cato Institute

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.880
and the Heritage Foundation,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.360
they say, you're a socialist.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.433
You're talking about Scandinavia.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.933
And I say no, I'm talking
about the United States.

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:28.000
For the 30 years after
the Second World War

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.203
we did it here.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.260
And if we did it in the 30 years after

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.430
the Second World War

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.770
there's no reason we can't do it again.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.040
In terms of those principles,

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.530
we can't exactly replicate
precisely what we did then.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.690
We've got to do something different

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:50.630
and we can talk about individual
specific public policies,

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:51.880
all I'm saying to you

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:56.253
is that those principles have
got to guide us once again.

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:02.480
And going back to Harris Weinstock

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.200
and his concern about morals and trade,

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.920
fundamentally, fundamentally

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.630
these principles are ethical principles

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.923
about how we live together.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.900
It's just coincidental
that these principles

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.260
also support a vibrant
and buoyant economy.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.090
In other words, if we
adhere to these principles

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:25.440
we all gain.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.140
Even people at the top would do better

00:48:29.003 --> 00:48:31.370
to have a smaller percentage

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.170
of a rapidly growing buoyant economy

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.680
than they would with a larger percentage

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.230
as they have now of an economy

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:41.993
that is anemic.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.913
And prone more than ever
before to booms and busts.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.973
One final point and then
I invite your questions.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:58.180
There's a great deal of anger

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.790
in America if you haven't seen it

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:03.313
or experienced it already.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.460
On one of these talk shows
that I alluded to before

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.293
on television, not long ago,

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.210
the producer during a station break

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:17.783
said to me in my ear piece,

00:49:18.877 --> 00:49:20.347
"You need to be angrier."

00:49:21.423 --> 00:49:24.720
(audience laughing)

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.737
And I said, "I'm sorry,

00:49:25.737 --> 00:49:28.289
"I thought we were
having a very respectful,

00:49:28.289 --> 00:49:29.122
"good discussion, I don't
want to be angrier."

00:49:29.122 --> 00:49:30.380
And she said, "You have to be angrier."

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.997
And I said, "Why do I have to be angrier?"

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.527
And she said, "You have to be angrier

00:49:36.527 --> 00:49:40.447
"because people are surfing
through the channels

00:49:40.447 --> 00:49:44.067
"and they stop when people
are yelling at each other."

00:49:45.226 --> 00:49:46.059
(audience laughing)

00:49:46.059 --> 00:49:46.987
"Because it's like a gladiator contest,

00:49:46.987 --> 00:49:48.037
"it's very exciting."

00:49:49.772 --> 00:49:50.605
And I said, "I don't want to do that."

00:49:50.605 --> 00:49:51.850
And she said, "You must."

00:49:52.928 --> 00:49:55.427
And I'm afraid at that
point I lost my temper.

00:49:55.427 --> 00:49:58.427
(audience laughing)

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.550
But I think the reason that people

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:06.330
when they are surfing through channels

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.860
want a gladiator contest

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.860
has something to do with
the degree of frustration,

00:50:15.085 --> 00:50:20.085
anxiety and anger so many
people feel out there.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.270
Who want to work,

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:28.070
who know that they've played by the rules,

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.733
who feel that somehow the
game is rigged against them.

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.120
A few days ago I got a
call from somebody who,

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.080
and I checked on this,

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.603
was an organizer of The Tea Party.

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.947
And I said, "It's very
interesting to talk to you

00:50:52.947 --> 00:50:56.670
"because I know we don't see
eye-to-eye on many issues."

00:50:56.670 --> 00:51:00.200
but it turned out after
about 45 minutes of talking

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.853
I discovered that there was
a great deal of overlap.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:11.160
One of the most surprising
points of overlap

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.570
that I hadn't really thought through

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.990
but this person reminded me,

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.100
the Tea Party got it's start

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.430
in a kind of revulsion against
the bail out of Wall Street,

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:23.580
that's what started it.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:27.477
And I asked,

00:51:27.477 --> 00:51:31.147
"Well why are you so
much against government,

00:51:31.147 --> 00:51:33.927
"why are you not against
Wall Street and big business?

00:51:33.927 --> 00:51:36.450
"Why have you taken out your
ire against government?"

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:39.000
And the response I got back

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.580
was because we don't trust

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.970
that government is not
going to be in the pocket

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.570
of big business and Wall Street.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.400
Well I can't say that I became
a Tea Partier at that moment,

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.953
(audience laughing)

00:51:58.953 --> 00:52:00.790
but I at least understand
that there's a vast overlap

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.920
between progressives who are very upset

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.040
about the direction things are going

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.463
and Tea Partiers and
others who are very upset.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:13.430
And I'm not talking about the fellow

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.127
who yells out the window,

00:52:16.127 --> 00:52:18.340
"I'm mad as hell and I'm not
gonna stand for it anymore."

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.560
I'm talking about genuine, upset

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.810
that is based upon some sense

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:27.170
that the game is rigged

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.393
in favor of those with wealth and power.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.040
So what we also need to do

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:45.440
in addition to adhering to
principles of shared prosperity

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.610
and shared sacrifice

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.010
a new contract between
labor and management

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.193
and also public investment.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.680
What we also need to do

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.710
is dedicate ourselves
to freeing our democracy

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.023
from the scourge of big money.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.550
The decision by the
Supreme Court last year

00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:17.370
in Citizens United against the
Federal Election Commission

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:20.710
was one of the most grotesque decisions

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:24.632
ever enunciated by the
Supreme Court, in my view.

00:53:24.632 --> 00:53:27.799
(audience applauding)

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.080
And I have no doubt

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:39.380
that with a few new
Supreme Court appointees,

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.480
hopefully from President Obama

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:46.090
or his successor who has the same values

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.773
that case will be reversed.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:57.770
If not we are going to see
the game rigged more and more.

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:03.253
More big money from big corporations,

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.883
the attempt to reduce taxes on the rich,

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.230
the attempt to starve government

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.020
and make it impossible for people

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:19.830
to have the education
and the infrastructure

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:22.680
and the public investments
that they so desperately need.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.860
While all the time

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.990
turning people in the middle
class and working class

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:33.073
against each other,
against public employees.

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:40.873
Against the poor, against immigrants,

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.023
against unions,

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.350
against China.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:50.333
You see how many scapegoats there are?

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:55.650
We've got to get beyond scapegoating

00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:00.750
and we've got to return
to original principles

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:06.370
that we learned 75 years ago.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.092
Thank you very much.

00:55:08.092 --> 00:55:11.259
(audience applauding)

00:55:15.785 --> 00:55:19.368
