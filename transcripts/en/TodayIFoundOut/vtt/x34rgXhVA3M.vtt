00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:12.110
The Truth About Snakebites and Sucking Out
the Venom

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.940
There are a number of productive things you
can do to help a snakebite victim; trying

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.240
to suck out the venom isn’t one of them.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.789
Actually having a negative effect, potentially
further damaging the tissue around the bite

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.480
and thus helping to spread the venom, trying
to suck the venom out of a snakebite victim

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.279
is an act in futility that simply delays proper
treatment.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.200
Once in the body, snake venom quickly spreads
throughout the victim’s lymphatic system,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.050
and it is just not possible for a human to
suck fast or hard enough to remove enough

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.830
of it to have any real positive effect.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.180
Likewise, experts say applying a tourniquet
is equally pointless (it won’t stop the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.250
venom), can add to the victim’s pain, and
if left on too long, the lack of fresh blood

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.710
can damage (and even kill) the limb, among
other serious health issues this can introduce.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.900
Ice is also a common home treatment, but recent
studies have shown that it can also make the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.820
injury much worse.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.210
Another common misconception is that snakebites
are extraordinarily fatal.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.810
In fact, even during frontier times only 25%
of bites from pit vipers (think copperheads,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.380
rattlesnakes and cottonmouths) resulted in
death.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.200
One reason is that some of these snakebites
are “dry,” meaning no venom is injected.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.390
Today, the worldwide rate of deaths from a
snakebite is around 0.5-1% of people bitten,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.550
due in no small part to the development and
distribution of effective anti-venom.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.520
For further reference, approximately 8,000
people in the U.S. are bitten by venomous

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.030
snakes each year, but only about 0.2% die
from it (many more people die from allergic

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.140
reactions to wasp, hornet or bee stings).

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.790
This also means you are about nine times more
likely to die from being struck by lightning

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.659
than die from being bitten by a snake in the
United States.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.630
Even in Australia where seemingly everything
in nature seems capable of killing humans

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.170
and where 7 out of the world’s 10 deadliest
snakes live, there is only about 1 death by

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.980
a snake bite per year on average.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.050
So what should you do when you encounter a
snakebite?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.540
Several things, depending on your circumstances.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.250
Protect the person by carefully moving her
away from the snake (and making sure not to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.250
get bitten yourself).

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.570
At the same time, try to note the snake’s
appearance (so emergency responders will know

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.110
better how to treat the bite).

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.650
Call emergency responders or at the least
get to a hospital.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.020
The former is preferred so that the victim
can simply lay there and relax, to slow their

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.060
heart rate and perform other helpful actions
which we’ll get to presently.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.400
If you’re transporting, or are, the victim,
and the bite is to a limb, depending on circumstance,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.660
a splint to reduce muscle contractions can
also be helpful.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.780
If you are stuck in the wilderness and the
victim will have to walk out, first have her

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.000
sit quietly for a while until fully relaxed.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.210
This helps to keep the venom localized in
one place.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.870
Then get walking, but at a calm, leisurely
pace.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.319
In the interim between getting the needed
medical aid, try to keep the victim as still

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.090
as possible to limit the spread of the venom.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.350
This includes avoiding stimulants and other
products that either thin the blood or accelerate

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.160
the heart, such as alcohol, aspirin, coffee
and cigarettes.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.760
If possible, it is also helpful to have the
victim lie down, keeping the affected area

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.300
(usually a limb) lower than the heart.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.720
Cover the victim with a blanket and loosen
tight clothing.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.280
In particular, remove anything constricting
from the effective area, like a shoe or jewelry

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.480
(bracelets and rings, in particular).

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.599
The bitten extremity will swell and such jewelry
may then become a source of significant pain

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.710
if not removed.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.440
The bite area should also be washed with soap
and water or otherwise disinfected, to help

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.209
reduce the chance of infection.

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.750
It should also be noted that while bites from
copperheads, rattlesnakes and cottonmouths

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.350
are sufficiently painful from the start that
the victim will ask for assistance, with coral

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.020
snakes, some victims have made the mistake
of thinking the bite caused little harm.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.630
According to the National Library of Medicine,
it is common for symptoms from the venomous

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.829
bite of a coral snake to take several hours
to appear.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.900
While you’ll usually be fine, so long as
you receive proper medical care after being

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.720
bitten, there is the notable exception of
the Black Mamba.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.830
Residing in certain parts of Africa, you’ll
want to avoid these at all costs.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.729
The Black Mamba’s kill rate after a strike
is 100% unless very large amounts of anti-venom

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.699
(typically 10-12 vials) are administered very
shortly after being bitten.

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.800
You don’t have a lot of time with this one.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.990
Given how quickly its venom can kill (as quickly
as 10 minutes, though sometimes it takes a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.010
few hours, depending on how much is injected;
the average time until death after a bite

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.680
is around 30-60 minutes), around 95% of people
still die from Black Mamba bites usually due

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.199
to being unable to get the anti-venom administered
in time.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:08.449
For reference, one single strike from a Black
Mamba will deliver around 100-400 mg of venom

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.630
and only 10-15 mg is needed to kill a human.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.500
They also usually won’t just strike once,
but will continually strike whatever is threatening

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.610
them as much as they safely can before it
stops moving.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.580
If it’s a large, dangerous animal they’re
striking, they may only strike a few times

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.900
in quick succession, then may or may not follow
the animal until it dies.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.920
If they do follow, they usually will continue
to strike only when they see safe opportunities.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.650
As you might expect from this, Black Mamba’s
are near top of the food chain, outside of

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.650
humans.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.350
What’s particularly frightening about this
snake, apart from being amazingly deadly and

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.990
8-14 feet long, is that the Black Mamba can
also move as fast as 14 mph, with an average

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.020
top speed in the range of 10 mph to 12 mph.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.990
In either case, this makes them the fastest
snake in the world.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.070
They can also maintain speeds of around 6-7
mph for lengthy periods.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.400
If all this wasn’t bad enough, the Black
Mamba is considered to be the most aggressive

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.810
snake in the world.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.000
However, it should be noted that even having
the reputation of being extremely aggressive,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.930
it usually only attacks humans when it feels
cornered or when a female is protecting her

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:17.930
eggs.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.290
When it does feel like fighting, it’s incredibly
fearsome.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.919
Because of its size, ground speed, and agility;
how quickly it can strike; how fearless it

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.770
can appear to be; and how deadly its venom
is it generally takes a group of people working

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.060
together to kill one, and even then it’s
a dangerous endeavor.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.060
So you’ll not want to encounter one of these
alone, whether on land or in the water.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:48.780
In both cases, best to have someone with you
that 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:07:11.320
you can run faster than!
