you know we actually dedicated the book

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750
you know we actually dedicated the book
 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.530
you know we actually dedicated the book
it's a statistics book but we dedicated

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540
it's a statistics book but we dedicated
 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.799
it's a statistics book but we dedicated
the book to an unknown number which is

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809
the book to an unknown number which is
 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:42.940
the book to an unknown number which is
the number of people who have had the

the number of people who have had the
 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.280
the number of people who have had the
courage to come out and that's an

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290
courage to come out and that's an
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.430
courage to come out and that's an
impossible number to document or

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440
impossible number to document or
 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.700
impossible number to document or
quantify but I think it is the starting

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710
quantify but I think it is the starting
 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.979

point for the revolutionary progress

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989

liberation made that basic point that
coming out was a first step towards

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460
coming out was a first step towards
 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.120
coming out was a first step towards
greater equality because visibility

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130
greater equality because visibility
 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.719
greater equality because visibility
would lead straight Americans to

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729
would lead straight Americans to
 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.350
would lead straight Americans to
understand and accept and embrace and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360
understand and accept and embrace and
 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.750

so this movement toward acceptance I
 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.850
so this movement toward acceptance I
think is completely intertwined with the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.250
think is completely intertwined with the
growing visibility and openness and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260
growing visibility and openness and
 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.539
growing visibility and openness and
honesty that LGBT folks have embraced I

dissemination of survey results and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430
dissemination of survey results and
 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.499
dissemination of survey results and

time I think you know if we're talking
 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.810
time I think you know if we're talking
about what the single most important

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820
about what the single most important
 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.819
about what the single most important
factor might be in terms of the

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829

the media and the idea that media

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
the media and the idea that media
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.639

quibble and I think for good reason with
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.990

some of the portrayals but when you look

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000
some of the portrayals but when you look
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.080
some of the portrayals but when you look
at the overall trend just the very fact

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
at the overall trend just the very fact
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.170

healthy gay characters and committed
relationships and in a really positive

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370
relationships and in a really positive
 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.740
relationships and in a really positive
light I do think that has been

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750
light I do think that has been
 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.729

fundamental to the changes we've seen

fundamental to the changes we've seen
 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.240
fundamental to the changes we've seen
and then I also think that the ongoing

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.030
collection of data through organizations
like Gallup and the Williams Institute

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040
like Gallup and the Williams Institute
 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.300
like Gallup and the Williams Institute
is also fundamental in terms of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310
is also fundamental in terms of
 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.810
is also fundamental in terms of
reminding people but there is this trend

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820
reminding people but there is this trend
 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.750
reminding people but there is this trend
towards greater acceptance and I think

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
towards greater acceptance and I think
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.020
towards greater acceptance and I think
one you know that that growing

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400
acceptance as reflected by the numbers
 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.240
acceptance as reflected by the numbers
leads people to be more open with

same-sex marriage be be legalized as
those numbers go up I think that

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090
those numbers go up I think that
 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.920
those numbers go up I think that
reporting in turn encourages people to

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930
reporting in turn encourages people to
 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.220
reporting in turn encourages people to
reveal their inner support so there is a

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230
reveal their inner support so there is a
