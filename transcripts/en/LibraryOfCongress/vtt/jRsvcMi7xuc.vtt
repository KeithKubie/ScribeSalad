00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
&gt;&gt; Ralph Ehrenberg:
I am Ralph Ehrenberg,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.200
chief of the geography
and map division.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.490
It is my great pleasure to welcome
you here to the Library today

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.930
for our two-day conference on Facts
or Fictions, Debating the Mysteries

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
of Early Modern Science
and Cartography,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.650
which is being sponsored
by the Jay I.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.560
Kislak Family Foundation and the
Virginia Gray Family Memorial Fund.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.920
This conference was
planned and organized

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.940
by Dr. John Hessler,
curator of the Jay I.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.290
Kislak collection of archaeology
and history of the early Americas

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.480
at the Library of Congress,
and John is also the geography

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.100
and map division specialist
in modern cartography

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.520
and geographic information systems.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.610
The subtitle of our conference is
a celebration of 500th anniversary

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.960
of Waldseemuller's
1516 Carta Marina.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.660 position:56%
I'd like to comment briefly on the
Library's acquisition of this chart,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.580
one of the great masterpieces
of Renaissance mapping.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.180
Shortly after its publication,
our copy of this map was acquired

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.070
by Johann Schoner [phonetic],
a noted Nuremberg mathematician

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.450
and geographer, who bound
it together with a number

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.600
of globe gores drawn by him,
the earliest printed star chart

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.500
of the southern hemisphere
engraved by Albrecht Durer,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.670 position:56%
and Waldseemuller's other famous map
is 1507 Universalis Cosmographia,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.370
the map that named America.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.780
With the recent acquisition
of Durer's star chart,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.530
the Library of Congress has
now brought back together all

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
of the maps and charts that
were originally contained

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.370
in Schoner's bound portfolio now
known as the Schoner's [inaudible].

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.030
This portfolio was
unknown to the wider world

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.900 position:56%
for some 350 years although
Washington Irving's research in 1828

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.150
on the origin of the name America
cited Waldseemuller's 1507 map.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.500
German geographer Alexander
von Humboldt later alluded

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.140
to Irving's work, stimulating
a further search for the map.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.000
No copies were found,
however, until 1901,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.590
when the Austrian Jesuit scholar,
Josef Fischer, who we'll hear more

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.810
about shortly, located
this map while searching

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.640
for material relating to the early
Norse voyages to North America.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.360
It was found in the
Waldburg-Wolfegg family castle

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.640
in south central Germany.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.130
Fortunately, this family
had provided a safe haven

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.310
through three centuries of numerous
wars and political upheavals.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.430
As early as 1912, Prince
Johannes Waldburg-Wolfegg offered

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.250
Waldseemuller's 1507 map
to the Library of Congress

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.330
where he believed it would be more
readily available for research

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.120 position:56%
on display, but limited resources
prevented its purchase at that time.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.000
In 1977, the chief of the
geography division at that time,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.730
Walter W. Ristow, viewed
the Schoner portfolio

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.030
at the castle during a visit

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.770
with Count Maxwell
Wilbrod [phonetic] Walburg.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.050
Six years later, the
Schoner portfolio was loaned

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.430
to the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.260
for exhibition focusing
on the naming of America.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.800
The centerpiece of this exhibition
was Waldseemuller's 1507 map

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.700
with one sheet of the map displayed

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.490
at a time most frequently the one
contained in the name America.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.730
The Schoner portfolio made a return
visit to the nation's capital

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.950
in 1992 during the Columbus
quincentenary celebration.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.700
On that occasion, the Folger
Shakespeare Library's conservation

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.850
staff removed the 12 woodcut
map plates of the 1507 map

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.860
from its portfolio, binding and
reassembling them as a wall map

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.650
for the first time for display
in the National Gallery of Art.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.570
Former Librarian of Congress James
Billington began discussing during

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.950
this period with Count
Johannes Walburg

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.850
about acquiring the 1507 map.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.250
It was purchased in 2003 with a $5
million appropriation from Congress

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.220
and matching funds
generously donated

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.480
by George Topolowski
[phonetic], Virginia Gray,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.200
Gerald Landfest [phonetic],
David Kauf [phonetic],

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.490
and the Discovery Channel.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.890
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
formally transferred this treasure

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.990
to the American people
in an official ceremony

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.360
in the Thomas Jefferson
building in 2007.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:08.330
Waldseemuller's 1516 Carta Marina,
the subject of our work today,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.810
was later purchased by Jay I.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.140
Kislak along with the rest
of Schoner's portfolio,

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.320
which included Schoner's
important celestial

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.550
and terrestrial globe gores.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.980
Mr. Kislak then arranged for
the donation of the Carta Marina

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.080
and the globe gores to the
Library of Congress along

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.700
with his monumental
American Collection.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.130 position:56%
Durer's star chart was acquired late
last year with appropriated funds,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.710
which added the final piece that
compromised Schoner's [inaudible].

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.860
Thanks to the dedication and the
public spirit of these donors,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.930
Schoner's portfolio with
Waldseemuller's two master maps,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.940
Schoner's globe gores, and Durer's
star chart will remain together,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.700
available for future generations
for examination and study.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.420
Waldseemuller's 1507 map is on
permanent display in this bleeding

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.990
in the second floor gallery
along with Durer's star chart.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.780
The Schoner portfolio with the 1516
map will be on display tomorrow

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.620
in the geography and map division,
which is located in the basement

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.180
of the Madison building across
the street and will be on display

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.120
from one to three in the afternoon
along with other treasures

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.360
from the map division ranging from
Porterlain [phonetic] charts dating

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.920
from the 13th century to maps

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.190
by George Washington
and Lewis and Clark.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.850 position:56%
For those of you who aren't familiar
with the geography and map division,

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.610
the division holds
the world's largest

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.310
and most comprehensive
map collection,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.870
numbering some 5-1/2 million
maps and 80,000 atlases.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.200
We are open to the public for
research from Monday through Friday

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.900
from 8:30 in the morning
until 5 in the afternoon.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.020
Established in 1897 as the
Hall of Maps to serve Congress

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.080
and federal agencies, the geography
and map division today functions

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.550
as a national map library.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.230
It's primary responsibility
is developing the Library's

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.640
cartographic collections.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.280
An average of some 40,000
items are acquired yearly

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.620
through government deposits,
transfers of superseded maps

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.920
from federal libraries,
copyright deposits, domestic

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.960
and international exchanges,
purchases, and gifts.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.660
These range from rare globes and
maps to geospatial data sets.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.470 position:56%
Our cartographic collection is dated
as I said from the 13th century

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.020
and covers virtually all
countries and subjects.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.670
While many of the current items
are acquired through exchange

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.700
and deposits, the division relies
heavily on donors to assist

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.250
in the acquisition of rare
maps and unique collections.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.630
In 1995, we established
a public support group,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.210
the Philip Lee Phillips Map
Society of the Library of Congress

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.240
for those persons who wished to
support the work of the division.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.510
The Phillips Society
issues four newsletters

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.170
and two occasional papers yearly.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.290 position:56%
A copy of our most recent newsletter
is available at the foyer,

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.100
and I hope these were passed
out to you when you came in.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.580
If you wish to add your name to our
mailing list, please contact any

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.560
of our staff members
who are in the foyer.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.830 position:56%
And now it's my pleasure to turn
the podium over to Dr. John Hessler,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.510
who will begin a formal
program today.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:36.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.920
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well, I want
to extend the same welcome

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.280
that Ralph did to everyone.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.760
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.160
We've got kind of a
two-part program today.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.870
The first part has got a title
called Facts or Fictions,

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.450
the Mysteries of Renaissance
and early cartography.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.330
Now, the reason we kind of
paired these two things together,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.450
an afternoon on the 1516
Carta Marina and the mysteries

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.800
of other maps of the
period is simply

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.580
because the Waldseemuller maps are
also a rather large cartographic

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.270
mystery, and so we thought we
would put in one room a number

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.560
of scholars who've been working on
some of these difficult problems

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.440
in the history of cartography,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:23.350
everything from Marco Polo maps all
the way to the 1516 Carta Marina,

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.320
which I believe Chet is going to
actually solve all the problems

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.500
about today, so he's
been working on it.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.140
One thing I want to
do before we begin

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.980
and before I introduce our
first speaker is I want

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.980
to thank Ralph Ehrenberg for his
service to the Library of Congress

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.590
as chief of the geography
and map division.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.380
Ralph will be retiring sometime
in the next few months after years

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.120
and years of service
to this institution

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.920
to the national archives
and to this discipline.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.270
When I was a young student,
when I was an undergraduate,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.510
I had the opportunity to get a
fellowship at the Vatican Library

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.810
in Rome and actually at the
Vatican Observatory Library,

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.430
and there I met a man whose name
was Pietro Tucci [phonetic].

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.050
Pietro Tucci was a 92-year-old
librarian who believed

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:21.260
that doing his job, being a rare
book librarian, being a librarian

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.050
of science was one of
the highest callings.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.040
I appeared on his doorstep
as a very young man of 19.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.090
He wasn't used to having
19-year-old Americans

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.460
through the Vatican
Observatory Library.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.430
As a matter of fact, in the
three months I was there,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.990
I only saw one other human
being besides Pietro Tucci.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.330
But Pietro Tucci warmed
me and at one point

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.950
in time he called me
back to the stacks.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.610
And he said, young man, I
want to teach you something.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.410
I want to show you something
that is more important

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.960
than the work you are doing.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.260
You're a scholar.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.070
You're looking at these
books, but let's walk

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.400
down through these stacks.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.770
And he walked down
through these stacks,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.700
and occasionally he would pull
a book off the shelf and say,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.320
this person collected this.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.590
This was put up here
by this librarian.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.920
And Pietro Tucci had
come through the war.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.530
He was an Italian priest of
Polish extraction who had come

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.900
through the war, and Pietro
Tucci wanted me to know that one

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.640
of the most important things
about doing this work is the fact

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.960
that a book standing freely on
a shelf in an open library was

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.120
for him the difference
between lightness and darkness,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.360
between goodness and evil.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.980
And he said to me there were
very few people in the world

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.900
who knew this, who practiced this,
who thought this was the purpose

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.020
of a library, that this entire
enterprise was the difference

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.270
between, and he called
it, humanities last stand.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.050 position:56%
In my 35-year career of doing this
I have met few people who could come

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.800
up to Pietro Tucci's standard.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.720
One of those people
is Ralph Ehrenberg,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.880
a man who as I said has dedicated
his life to this institution

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.460
and to the history of
cartography, and I just want

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.510
to congratulate Ralph
on his retirement.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:28.040
[ Applause ]

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.510
And with that, I will introduce
our first speaker, Kirsten Seaver.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.930
Most of the people in this
audience who are involved

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.710 position:56%
in the early history of cartography,
she would need no introduction

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.120
as she is at least to me somewhat
of a legend in this field.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.330
She is a historian of
the Norse of Greenland,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.390
the history of the North Atlantic.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.550
She has written many novels.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.850
She has traveled widely,

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:57.100
participated in many documentary
films, and her novelistic talent,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.770
her talent for writing
novels I think goes deep

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.320
down into her scholarly work.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.910
She is one of the few people,
I think, who have actively

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.250
and intensely studied the
relationship of Josef Fischer,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.090
the Norse, and the maps that we
are going to talk about today.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.510
So without further ado, I would
like to introduce Kirsten Seaver.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:26.510
[ Applause ]

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:39.150
[ Background Noise ]

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.380
&gt;&gt; Kirsten Seaver: Thank you, John,
for that wonderful introduction.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:47.910
I was swelling as I was listening
to you, or at least my head was.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.650
It's a pleasure to be here
tonight, or this morning rather.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.480
I am confused because I just came
in from California last night,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.900
and it really is a good cause
because this is a fantastic thing

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.370
to celebrate, having
these maps here.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.120
Father Josef Fischer, S.J.,
the Arodite [phonetic] German

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.240
and Austrian cartographic
historian, who discovered the 1507

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.860
and 1516 Waldseemuller maps
at Wolfegg castle in 1901,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.140
some decade later became
the likely author

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.470 position:56%
of Yale's controversial Vinland map.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.720
And that situation appeared
so incongruous that I want

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.820
to talk this morning
about some of the maps

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.510
and ideas I believe
inspired both events.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:47.040
[ Background Noise ]

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.390
Although at the time of his Wolfegg
sojourn, Father Fischer was working

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.270
on his MA thesis for
the-- better, okay?

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.680
Everybody can hear me now?

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.150
At the time of his Wolfegg
sojourn, Father Fischer was working

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:07.680
on his MA thesis for the
cartographic historian

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.230
and geographer Franz von
Wieser, who had convinced him

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.730
that early cartographic
evidence existed

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.420
for the Norse westward expeditions

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.160
from the recently settled
Greenland colonies

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.480
to the North America
around the year 1000.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.840
In the aftermath of
the 400th anniversary

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.740
of the Columbian discovery, the
region the Norse called Vinland

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:40.630
or wine land was the southernmost
of the three American areas

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:46.110
that the Norse had explored,
and it was the only one

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.330
that interested von
Wieser, Fischer, and others.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.400
Although Vinland's demographic
extent is in fact unknowable except

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.670
as an area that included
Newfoundland

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:04.510
and the southern St. Lawrence
[inaudible], Fischer was sure

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.210
that it consisted of Nova Scotia
and Cape Britain combined,

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.960
and he was equally certain that
the climate a thousand years

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:17.600 position:56%
or so ago was so warm that the Norse
had traveled up both the coasts

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.870
of Greenland and learned their
country's essential shape.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.800 position:56%
He reasoned that all maps showing
Greenland would also reveal the rest

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.960
of the Norse westward exploits

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.610
as such maps must have a
uniquely German lineage rooted

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.000
in Adam O'Bramen's [phonetic]
11th century references

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.350
to the Norse presence in
Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:48.340
And he hoped to find further
evidence for his theories

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.950
at Wolfegg castle, a baroque
jewel in Baden-Wurttemberg

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:57.280
with a magnificent collection
of art objects [inaudible],

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.800
manuscript texts, and maps.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:05.320 position:56%
He would not have far to travel, nor
did he need a formal introduction

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.550
because Wolfegg's noble
owners, the Catholic family

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.230
of Altberg [phonetic], Wolfegg
habitually sent their sons

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.850
to be educated at Stella
Matutina, the Catholic school

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:20.570
in the Austrian border
town of Feldkirch

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:23.760
where Fischer was teaching
geography and history.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.830
In 1901, he wrote to the
castle librarian and asked

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.780
if the collections might include
a manuscript map showing Greenland

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:40.730
as a European peninsula
in the manner of 1482

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:48.290
and 1486 Olm [phonetic]
geography in the Olm editions.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.420
And the librarian reported back

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.150
that the search had
yielded a manuscript map

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.580
by Donnes Nicholas
Gamonis [phonetic]

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.290
that might meet Fischer's
requirements.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.800 position:56%
Fischer soon identified the Nicholas
Gamonis manuscript as the prototype

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.180
of printed maps in the Olm
editions where Greenland

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.930
and the so-called B [phonetic]
reduction is depicted as a large,

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:18.240
blunt peninsula east of Iceland and
connected to Eurasia above Norway.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.000
He and von Wieser were already
familiar with the manuscript maps,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.220
which the Benedictine
monk, Nicholas Gamonis,

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.570
had drawn for the so-called
Zamweskee [phonetic] codex

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:36.240
of circa 1467, and edition
of Ptolemy's Geographia,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.700
which had strengthened
the two scholars' belief

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.140
that cartographic evidence of
Norse exploration westward must

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.190
have existed.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.950
The Zamweskee version
shows Greenland

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:53.640 position:56%
as a pointed peninsula west of
Iceland in the so-called A reduction

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.950
but also linked above Norway
to northwestern Eurasia

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:03.920
and like the Wolfegg manuscript
indicated a second Greenland

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.760
where Norway meets
Sweden in the north.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.900
Continuing his searches in the
castle library, Fischer discovered,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.190
as we have heard, Waldseemuller's
printed world map of 1507

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:22.540
and the Carta Marina of 1516 in
a bound volume miscellany owned

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.960
by the Nuremberg mathematician
Johannes Schoner.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:32.360
As an expert on Ptolemaic maps
of the 15th and 16th centuries,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.770
Fischer was well equipped to
identify the Waldseemuller maps.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.620 position:56%
The German academic educate required

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.400
that his thesis advisor
verify the discoveries,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.960
so in the joint analysis
was published in 1903,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.330
von Wieser's name joined
Fischer's on the title page.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.780
In a book that Fischer
published in his own name in 1902

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.830
and which appeared in
English the following year,

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.890 position:56%
he enthusiastically reviewed the
cartographic connections he had made

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:14.760
at Wolfegg and wrote, this lucky
discovery was remarkable if only

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.270
for its bearing on the discoveries
made by the Norsemen as well

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.150
as on the relation to
the later discoveries

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.070
of Columbus and his successors.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:33.370 position:56%
Prior to 1901, the 1520 Petrus
Apianus world map was considered the

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:38.240
oldest surviving printed
map using the name America.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.580
Waldseemuller's 1507 map
was known to have existed

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.870
but was believed lost until
Fischer found a surviving example

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.170
at Wolfegg.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:54.290
The 1507 map additionally rewarded
him with a prominent Greenland,

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:59.100 position:56%
shaped and positioned as in the
Wolfegg Nicholas Garmonis manuscript

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.270 position:56%
and the printed Olm maps and linking

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:07.890
to the Eurasian continent
north of Norway.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.300
Waldseemuller did not
repeat the name America

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:17.270
when he made his magnificent
Carta Marina in 1516,

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.950
but like it's 1507 predecessor,

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:25.420
it featured a large peninsular
Greenland linked to Norway.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.720
Moreover, like all the
other maps mentioned so far,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.080
it had a second Greenland where
northern Norway and Sweden met

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:40.670
and provided similar place names
on the larger Greenland peninsula.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.710 position:56%
Fischer felt confident that all
these features were directly related

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:51.050
to the work that the Danish cleric
Claudius Clavus did sometime

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.690
between 1424 and 1427 for inclusion

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:01.000
with cardinal Gion Feastrus
[phonetic] manuscript copy

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.820
of Ptolemy Geographia, and the
connection is there but not quite

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.390
in the way that Fischer imagined.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.820
The Clavus map of the north,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.030 position:56%
which the French scholar Jon Lorr
[phonetic] discovered at [inaudible]

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:22.190
in 1835 is the first known
cartographic representation

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.490
of Greenland.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.160
Here it is shown as the east coast

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.570
of a peninsula called
Greenlandia Provincia [phonetic]

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:30.970
and connected eastward

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:36.020
to the Eurasian mainland via
the Scandinavian peninsula.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.210
Because Fischer credited Clavus

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.640
with envisioning a continuous
circumpolar continent,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.550
he considered the [inaudible] map
the first map to also show America.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:55.610
An opinion he developed fully in
1911, unaware that Norse activities

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.230
that far west had long been so
murky in the Danish consciousness

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.480
that Clavus had mistakenly
relegated the Norse

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.590
to the Greenland's east
coast [inaudible] west.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:12.520
Ptolemy for his part had never
referred to Greenland by any name.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.550
Therefore, Blor [phonetic]
considered both the Clavus map

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.060
and a short companion text
worthy of special attention,

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.850
particularly given that both
items were in a hand different

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.230
from that anywhere
else in the codex,

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:32.960 position:56%
and both employ the Danish letter o/
that is O with a slash rather than O

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.000
with an umloute [phonetic].

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.430
And these peculiarities
suggested to Blor

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.290
that Fiasta [phonetic] had
commissioned somebody quite well

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:47.080 position:56%
informed about these remote northern
regions, in other words that the map

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.500
and the text were the personal work

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.920
of Claudius Clavus as
claimed on the map.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.400
And Blor was right.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.060
The O with slash implied
only in Norwegian

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.230
and Danish is used correctly
throughout the map and text

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.640
with a consistency that no French

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.810
or Italian copies would
have been likely to manage,

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.610
and by the way I am a
native Norwegian speaker.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.420
There are also numerous
other indications

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.730
that Clavus had made the map
and the texts specifically

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.230
for the cardinal's Geographia.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:33.060
Nonetheless, this agreement with
Blor arose in 1835, 45 rather,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.050
when the German scholar Gee Vites
[phonetic] blindly ignoring the O

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.100
with a slash, doubted that the map

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:47.130
and the text were personal
work of Claudius Clavus.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.430
[Inaudible] believed that both the
map and the text were anonymous

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:56.180
and inferior copies of Clavus
originals was soon joined

by an equally persistent
and wrong-headed conviction

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:06.230
that post 1427 Clavus had made
an improved version of the map

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.190
that had also followed
Ptolemaic precepts closely

but that later maps unfortunately
was lost and could not be consulted.

Huh, where have we
heard that one before?

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:25.680
Clavus had left Denmark for
the European mainland before,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:31.840
or around I should say, 1413
or 14, just when Ptolemy system

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.540

embraced farther south

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.510

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.610
Had not yet reached Denmark,

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.470
but the Danish cleric was
obviously a very quick learner

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.650
because only a decade or so after
leaving home he based his map

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:02.830
and text for Feastrus manuscript
on Ptolemy systems of coordinates

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:09.630
as well as unfamiliarity with
the works of Adam O'Bramen

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.400
and [inaudible] and on what he
knew personally about the geography

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.510
of his northern home region.

[ Background Noise ]

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:25.240
While he knew from Adam O'Bramen's
history that Greenland lay west

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.030
of Iceland, his grasp on Denmark's
Scandinavian neighbors failed him

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:35.940
beyond the Dovre mountains in
Norway, and he had difficulties

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.080
with Norwegian and
Swedish [inaudible].

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.080
Only one such problem
concerns us here.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:52.160
On the Feaster [phonetic] map
but not on the accompanying text,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.670
Clavus wrote [foreign language]
where northern Sweden joins Norway.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.500 position:56%
And that became the second Greenland
on both the A and the B reductions

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:08.530
in Nicholas Garmonis' manuscript
maps and their successors.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:14.950
The known whereabouts of
Feastrus' Geographia between 1427

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.620
and 1835 show that the codex
could not have been seen

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.780
by Nicholas Garmonis but by 1467,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.800
he had nevertheless
acquired information

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.340
that inspired both his twin
Greenlands and his experiments

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:37.520
with the country's shape, it's
nomenclature, and it's placement.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.530
We must look for an explanation in
the context that Clavus is known

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.730
to have had with continental
scholars and in notes

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:51.430
and sketches necessarily made in
preparation for Feastrus' codex.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.680
Alas, the whereabouts of any
such material is as unknown

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.540
as the ultimate fate
of Clavus himself,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.710
but a trail suggesting
a Benedictine network

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:06.830
and containing many later
interpolations has yielded nuggets

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.920
of additional information that
could only have originated

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.580
with Clavus although his own
affiliations were [inaudible].

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:21.380
Next, a fantasy about an improved
companion text joined the notion

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:27.240
that Clavus had laid a second
and improved map in 1904

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.430
when the Danish scholar
Oxlong von Burenbul [phonetic]

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.790
and Carles Pietrus [phonetic]
published the interpretations

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:38.830 position:56%
of two 16th century manuscripts they
had discovered at the Royal Library

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.160
of Vienna and called
the Vienna text.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:48.000 position:56%
They argued that travels in
Greenland and other Nordic countries

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.420
after 1427 had enable Clavus
to produce both a second map

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.270 position:56%
and an improved text that became the
prototype of the two Vienna texts

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:03.200
and from which excerpts
had been published in 1515

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.670
by Johannes Schoner and in 1518
by Francisco Zerenicus [phonetic].

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:13.050
As soon as Burenbul and
Pietrus' book was out,

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.410
Fischer began a correspondence
with Burenbul that lasted

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.160
until the latter's death.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.790
He immediately assured his Danish
colleague of his own belief

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.250
that Clavus had personal
knowledge of Greenland,

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:31.470
a conviction he still held
when Burenbul died in 1911

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.070
without revealing to Fischer

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:37.760
that the Norwegian explorer Fetuv
Nonsen [phonetic] was certain

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.200
that Clavus had never
been to Greenland.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:45.840
In a short monograph on Clavus that
Fischer published that same year

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.040
in 1911, he insisted that Clavus
had explored up the Greenland coast

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.940
as far as 70 degrees 2 second
northward, northern latitude.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.790
Because of his inability
to read either the primary

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:08.880
or secondary material in Nordic
languages, plus his tendency

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.050
to rather rigid thinking,
Fischer maintained his belief

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:16.090
in the post 1427 information

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.970
by Clavus had provided
Nicholas Garmonis

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.430
with information about Greenland.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:27.040
When starting his thesis
research on the medieval Norse,

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:32.910
Fischer had relied on help from the
Norwegian historian Gustuv Steim

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:38.780
[phonetic], but Steim died in 1906,
and with Burenbul's death in 1911,

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.960
Fischer lost his remaining
source of Nordic collegial help.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:51.800
He did nothing with his beloved
Norse from 1911 until 1932

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:56.480
when he was 74 years old, and
the Swiss Austrian auction firm

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.070
of Gilhof Antrantsburg
[phonetic] asked him

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:05.120
to analyze a manuscript copied
from early Ptolemy Geographia.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.320
The volume's regional map of
Greenland, which reminded him

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.530
of Ausmiller's [phonetic] Greenland
in the 1513 Strassberg Geographia,

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.930
brought all his former
preoccupations back in full force.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.060
The Gilhof Antrantsburg
auction catalog

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:27.760
for 1934 featured both
the Geographia codex

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.850
with Fischer's analysis and
selected items from the library

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.850
of Mikulov [phonetic]
castle in Moravia,

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.790
a collection with which
Fischer was as familiar

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.590
as with the auction house.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.750
the [inaudible] were excluded from
the auction catalog but a fragment

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.100
of the Speculum Historiale

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.140
by Vincent Aubove [phonetic]
was acceptable

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.640
because Mikulov had provided
it with a new binding,

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.820
and it was in generally good
condition except for leaves seven

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.350
through 12, which had
been damaged by a nail.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.390
Interestingly, that fragment
represented the book following

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:22.830 position:56%

Speculum books that ended up at Yale

On October 11, 1965, Yale
University Library announced

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.280
that it possessed an unnamed
manuscript from about 1440

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.290
that depicted the Norse
discovery of America.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.350
The item was dubbed the Vinland map

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.480
because in the northwestern
Atlantic it showed a large island

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.570
with two legends calling
the island Vinelanda insula.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:02.340

and the [inaudible] relation
by R.A. Skelton [phonetic],

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.970

George Painter to authenticate

at the time of purchase
in Switzerland.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.110
Four dilapidated books of
the Speculum Historiale

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:37.720
in a comparatively modern binding
had turned up a little later

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.550
as a sister manuscript to the map.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:47.550
No existing cartographic record of
Vinland was known not surprisingly,

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:51.920
since the medieval Norse
neither used nor made maps.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.300
Therefore, it's appearance

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:59.050
on otherwise conventional medieval
world map was remarkable indeed.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.590
However, the Vinland map
is a demonstrable fake,

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.960
and like any other
artifact, fake or genuine,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.690
it reflects its maker's
preoccupations and environment.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:17.010
In 1974, the map's ink was found
to continue anatase crystals

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:21.880
of a kind first available
commercially around 1920,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:27.290
and analysis was confirmed in 2002.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:32.830
Amazingly, this did not settle
the authenticity issue with those

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:38.810 position:56%
of the map's defenders unable to
grasp that the additional historical

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.560
and cartographic evidence
shows that this work

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.970
in no way reflects Norse
geographical knowledge.

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:53.090
Instead, it illustrates the 19th
century preoccupation with England,

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.950
and that times mistaken belief
that the Norse experience

00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:01.790
with North American had
been a very short duration.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:07.630
Unfortunately, Skelton and
Marsten and Painter knew as little

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.400
about the history and culture
of the medieval Norse as the man

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.580
who had made the map and left
footprints so idiosyncratic

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.030
that there is no mistaking
who's they are.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:25.360
The shorter of the two legends
near the island of Vinland says,

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.690
island of Vinland discovered
by Bjarni and Leif and company.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.200
Well, the very first time that
Leif and Bjarni sailed off

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:39.210
to America together and discovered
Vinland, that was Leif Eiriksson

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:44.760
and Bjarni Hyalson [phonetic]
and that was in 1765.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:59.610
Grantz' book appears
in the bibliography

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:05.260
of the 1903 English translation of
Fischer's book on the Norse voyages

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:10.340
to America, which had
a contorted explanation

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.800
for the Icelandic [inaudible]
agreement

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.240 position:56%
on who had first discovered America.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.910
In addition, sharing
his Ausmiller triumph

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:25.480
with von Wieser had made Fischer
receptive to a broader definition

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:31.500
of joint discovery, and his hero,
Adam O'Bramen, to whom both Vinland

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.190
and Greenland were
islands had written

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:40.110
that Vinland was an island
"discovered by many."

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:47.280
The longer legend's description
of the land which byarnus

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.340
and leiphus erissonius
discovered together,

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.130
"a new land extremely fertile

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:58.560
and even having vines" echos
Adam O'Bramen's statement

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.390
that Vinland got its name because

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:08.570 position:56%
"vines producing excellent wine grow
wild there" along the unsewn crops.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:13.320
The same legend also reveals
Fischer's tin ear for German names,

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:19.370
non-German names, and his
unease with the suffix -son.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.830
He invariably referred to Leif
Eiriksson as the son of Eirik

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:29.870
in his publications, and on the
Vinland map the name is Latinized

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.210
to leiphus erissonius
as you can see.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.710
Understandably, he gave

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.600
up on a Latin patrolimic
[phonetic] for Bjarni Hyalson.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.320
Henricus [inaudible]
bishop [inaudible]

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.140
of Greenland is straightforward
but dating his arrival in Vinland

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:51.630
to "the last year of our
most blessed Father Pascal,"

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:58.820
whose papal reign was from 1099
to 1118 is not straightforward.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:04.930
In fact, this entire legend is part
of a complex riddle and reveals

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:08.540
that the map's purpose is to
demonstrate that emissaries

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.130
of the Roman church had succeeded

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:17.230
in circumnavigating the
inhabited world at an early age.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:22.100
When Bishop Eric proceeded
to "wintery east" it was

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:27.240
in the Columbian sense of to the
east, that is even so far west

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.760
from proto [phonetic] America
that he gained the farthest east

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.560
and thus completed the circle.

Father Fischer, a man of
immense rectitude and devotion

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.860
to his church would have been
appalled by the later use made

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.740
of the map he drew in the 1930's

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.170
as a private catharsis
during a difficult time.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.190
Being then old and frail,
he had reason to believe

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:59.470
that if the map turned
up after his death,

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.860
it would confront German
Nazi culture bearers

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.850
with a difficult choice.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:09.860
If they denied the early reach
of the despised Catholic church

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.760
and pronounced the map a fake,
they would miss an opportunity

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.530
to use the Norse discovery
of America as an argument

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:23.640
for expanding the Aryan Third
Reich right to our own shores.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.940
In 1944, Fischer died
at Wolfegg castle

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.200
where he had been given
refuge during World War II.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.000
He was 86 years old.

&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Just in a word
of format, we're going to go

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.990
through all the speakers,
and then we'll sit together

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.260
and have questions from
the audience as a group.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.040
Our next speaker, Ben Olshin, is
one of those people who have come

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.540
to the history of cartography
with a multitalented

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.310
and multifaceted background.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.120
Ben both studies classics
and design,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.580 position:56%
which really makes him perfect for
studying the history of cartography.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.240
He is a professor of the school
of the arts in Philadelphia,

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.910
has taught widely all over the
world, and has written a book

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.190
on what have been called
the Marco Polo maps.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:35.010
One of those maps called the
Rossi map with Ship reside

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:38.760
in the geography and map
division, and it will be on display

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.560
at the open house tomorrow.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.680
These are maps that have always
had real questions associated

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.360
with them and the family.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:52.960
Many scholars have dismissed them,
but Ben has really written a book

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:58.280
that brings these maps alive and
back into the scholarly discussion

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.210
in a measured and really
intellectual way.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:05.510
So, Ben--

&gt;&gt; Ben Olshin: First of all,
I'd like to thank the Library

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.800
of Congress for inviting me and
despite the very kind introduction,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.330
I'm actually rather humbled.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.500
As I was sitting there,
I looked over there,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.180
and I saw Chet Van Dusser,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.900
and I sort of metaphorically
tipped my hat.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.010
That's real scholarship there, and
Hester himself is a real scholar,

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.750
and obviously Seaver as well.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:43.010
So you might say I
bring many talents.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:45.810
You could also just say I'm
and amateur and a dabbler,

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.090
so it's really up to you.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.430
The other thing I wanted
to say today is

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:54.670
that this is not a
book promotion talk,

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:58.640 position:56%
but I do want to draw your attention
to the book because many questions

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.910
that people might have are
addressed in the book itself,

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.750
and so what I'm going to talk
about today refers to the contents

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.830
of the book, but you
should read the book.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.920
And I'm going to talk a little bit,
you notice the title is different

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.740
from what you might see in
your program, I want to talk

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.870
about methods and analysis, which
in a way is sort of a nice segue

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.560
from the proceeding talk as well.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.380
What do you do when you're faced
with something like the Vinland map

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.010
or like these Rossi maps?

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:32.640
However, I want to start
even before then to talk

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.150
about the book a little bit.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:37.550
My father, who is a pediatrician,
and there's another speaker

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:41.890 position:56%
who is also a pediatrician who likes
maps, my father is a pediatrician

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:45.480 position:56%
who gave many talks, and all
pediatricians have a sense of humor.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.630
And he said you cannot give
a lecture without some humor

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:54.400
at the beginning, and so I thought
about that, and I was lecturing

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.620
at Oxford in April, and my
wife, who is an accountant,

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.920
which is the exact opposite,
said do not make jokes

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.690
at the beginning of
a talk at Oxford.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.900
So I ignored her and
listened to my father,

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.380 position:56%
and I want to tell the audience, you
know, why should you buy this book

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.900
if you haven't bought it already,
and I just want to show you

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.170
because if you don't buy
it, my child will go hungry

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:21.690
because of low book sales, so--

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:25.610
I asked my daughter to
pose for that photograph.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.790
I also like to point out that sort
of in retrospect it was strange.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:33.370
I gave a talk once, and somebody
came up to me, and they said,

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:38.360 position:56%
well you speak Italian and you speak
Chinese, did you draw these maps?

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.670
And I said, no, no.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.050
But it seems like I'm
sort of a Marco Polo,

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.040
and I dug up this photo of me.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:51.590 position:56%
This is probably from about 15
years ago, and it's me with my wife,

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:55.740
who is from the Far East,
and we're standing in front

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.680
of the Colosseum in Rome.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.270 position:56%
So I like to think that I'm a Marco
Polo although the Netflix series did

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:04.510
not contract me for some reason.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:10.280 position:56%
So let me talk a little bit about
the research methods because I think

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.320
for an audience like this that's
a mix of map scholars and people

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.420
who are interested in maps,
it's kind of insightful

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.730
to see what do you do again when
faced with material like this.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.710
We don't really know a
lot about Marco Polo.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:30.780
He is so famous that he has a TV
series based on him, but ironically

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.140
for a figure like this,
we don't really have

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.930
that much material evidence.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:38.420
We have his last will and
testament, which has survived.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.750
We have a few other documents,

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.850
and then oddly there's this
Rossi Collection as it's called

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.170
of about 13 or 14 documents
related to him.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.680
But really the primary
document that we do know of is

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:58.050
of course his narrative, Il
Milione, as it's called in Italian,

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:02.580
and there are multiple
manuscripts of this Il Milione

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.980
in different languages,
and we know for example

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:13.270
that Marco Polo's text was read by
Christopher Columbus and annotated

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.430
by him, so it's interesting.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.240
On the one hand, we have a
very well-established history

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.280
of Marco Polo, of his
narrative that's very clear,

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.420
but what gets puzzling is
when we try to take that

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.570
and connect it with maps.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:33.440
Maps and charts are hardly
mentioned in the narrative at all,

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:40.140
and if you pick up a translation
of the narrative of Marco Polo,

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.580
you find that it's very
difficult to draw a map.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.030
It's very vague in terms of how
it refers to different locations,

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:51.440
to different parts of his travels,

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.480
but if you get a nice 19th
century edition and open it up,

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.920
you'll see these beautiful
maps with little dotted lines

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.260 position:56%
as if you could read it and actually
plot a trip, and you cannot.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.330
And that's one of the puzzles.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:11.280
It's made some people doubt that
Marco Polo went on these voyages,

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.530
and then becomes even more
puzzling when suddenly we're told

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:22.450
that there's actually a series of
maps connected with Marco Polo.

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:26.380
So as Hessler said, it's
called the Rossi Collection,

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.970 position:56%
and the reason it's called the Rossi
Collection is because of this man,

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:36.900
Filomeno Emmanuele Marciano Rossi,
who was an Italian immigrant

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.370
who came originally to
St. Louis and then ended

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:43.380
up in San Jose, California.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:49.200 position:56%
He brought with him probably on more
than one trip a collection of maps,

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.100
texts, and letters, and
the material likely ranges

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.240
from the 13th to the 18th century.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.960
What's interesting is
the maps themselves.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.230 position:56%
I'll show you some examples, because
they contain a very odd mixture

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:11.260
of Arabic, Chinese,
Latin, and Italian,

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.870
and very little study was
done of these, partly probably

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:18.150
because they seem kind of a
fringe element of cartography,

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:24.510 position:56%
partly because they're such an odd
range of subject matter within them.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:28.110
Leo Bagrow, the very famous
historian of cartography,

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:33.690
wrote really the only published
scholarly article in the 1940's

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.470
about them, and nothing
was really done since then,

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.750
and then the Library of
Congress still holds one map.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.060
They possessed some of
the other maps for a time.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:50.170
They did an internal study, but
nothing was really published.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.620
And then I came upon
these around 1999.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.090
I had moved back to the states,
and I tracked down the owner,

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:58.570
and I got access to them.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:03.980 position:56%
And I was really intrigued, but from
the perspective of a researcher,

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.320
what I think is so interesting is
the range of knowledge that one has

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.630
to bring to bear, and I
would be the last to say

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.950
that I have all this knowledge,
but I'd like to point out,

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.530
just in terms of methodology,
what does one have

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.210
to know to attack these maps.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.680
Again, Latin, Italian,
Chinese, as I'll show you.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.290
You have to know the context
about ancient and medieval maps.

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:31.020
You have to know about Ptolemy
and similar maps from the period.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.800
You have to know about Marco
Polo himself, his narrative,

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.550
the tradition of the manuscripts,
of the Marco Polo narrative.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:44.780 position:56%
You have to know the general history
of central Asia, east Asia, Europe.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.130
You have to know as I found
out later, Chinese legends

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.910
because there's a Chinese legend
connected to one of the maps.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:55.620
And then you have to know about
velums and inks and carbon dating,

00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:00.690
which I know much less about
and still up for discussion.

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:02.520
And then you have to
know about the history

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.660
of forgeries, which is fascinating.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.970 position:56%
You just heard about the Vinland map

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.160
and the motivations
for a possible forger.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.780
So let's look at some
of the maps themselves.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.000
I'm going to pick a few
because they have some

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.170
of the more interesting features.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.560
This is called the Moreta Polo map,

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.320
and most of the maps have
an apparent signature

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.620
by one of the daughters.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:31.920
Marco Polo was very lucky
as am I to have daughters,

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.920
and he had three daughters, and
this is in fact well documented.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.450
Seeing them connected with
cartography is quite peculiar

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:43.870
of course, but this is one of
the maps, the Moreta Polo map,

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:45.750
and anyone that's done history

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:49.750
of cartography can immediately
see this is a very strange piece

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.050
of work.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:57.260
It has gridlines like Ptolemy, but
the depictions of the continents

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.610
and the whole system
is very strange,

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:03.580
and it has these odd columns with
the number seven at the bottom

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.520
and what looks like a
Chinese seven at the top.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:11.400
It's not really clear, and then
a very long inscription along

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.700
the bottom.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.740
What's interesting then too
is what the inscription says.

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.700
Very matter of factly it
says in English translation,

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.010
journey made by Maffeo Nicholau
and Marco Polo from Venice to Acre

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.370
in Persia, from Acra finally
to Campalu in Tartary,

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:31.950
voyaging through valleys
and mountains,

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:36.780
Marco Polo drew a summu nauticu,
kind of a nautical summary,

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:41.700 position:56%
and navigated the sea up to the
eastern extremity, whatever that is,

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:46.270 position:56%
and finally a long peninsula
completely surrounded by sea wolves,

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:52.900 position:56%
luvi marini, and connected to a huge
land completely unknown, hint, hint.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.760
So it's very strange.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.060
You know, it's very strange

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:01.040
because in a way unlike the Vinland
map it makes no explicit claim.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:06.140 position:56%
It's kind of an implied claim, and
it's just very peculiar to see a map

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:10.040
with this text, with
these depictions.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.670
And what struck me in particular

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:15.810
about this collection is
that it's a collection.

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.220
There's more than one piece,
and they sort of relate

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.520
to each other but they don't.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.390
As I'll point out at the end
of the talk, the Vinland map

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:25.560
to me is fascinating
because it's a one-of.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.860
It's a single creation.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.460
These are multiple creations.

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.490
This one's called the Sirdomap
Chart because it refers

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:36.690
to what's terms a Syrian
navigator, so an Arab

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:40.690
or Islamic navigator named
Sirdomab or Sirdomap.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:43.200
It's spelled differently
in two ways.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.800
And again already you see
very strange setup here

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.480
where there is a map or chart.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.780
There's Arabic.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.100
There are Roman numerals, and
then there's a text below.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.690
And again it's all
about northeastern Asia,

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:04.000
the furthest reaches of
Asia, and here we see

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.860
that the text below
is written apparently

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.530
by another daughter, Bellela Polo.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:13.860
Again, Marco Polo did have
three daughters, we know that.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.840
And this map has a set of toponyms

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.990
and then a brief text
excerpt here says, my father,

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:25.500
Marco Polo wishes me, Bellela,
to show this world map,

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.210
it's not a world map, which
he obtained from the pilot,

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:32.110 position:56%
the navigator, Biaxio Sirdomap, who,

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:36.280
for at least thirty years sailed
the coast of Asia from Syria

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:40.230
to the Far East, trading
in seal skins.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.930
And again, from a historical
perspective, this is very odd.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:49.790 position:56%
It's a combination of story of Marco
Polo with an account supposedly

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:53.760
by his daughter talking
about an Arab navigator,

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.510
talking about the extreme
northeast reaches of Asia,

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:00.900
about which there's no
documentation in this period.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:05.520
So as a historian, I looked at
this without bias, and I was very,

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.510
very puzzled, and I
want to highlight here

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:13.760
in case I forget later, I had not
particular take on this in terms

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.430
of is it a forgery, what's
the voracity of this account,

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.260
but later when the book was
published, I got interviewed

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.830
by the media a great
deal, newspapers,

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:25.920 position:56%
the Smithsonian Magazine here in DC,

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.120
and a report from the
Daily Telegraph said,

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.640
well are they real or not.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.570
You know, that's all they want.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:35.390 position:56%
They just want that statement and I
said, you know, it's not about that.

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:38.290
For me the book is
really about the content.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:40.020
I translated these.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.980
I deciphered some of the names.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.570
He says well what can
I quote you on?

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:47.210
I said, quote me that I'm the
person who looked at the content.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:52.590
And he said that's very
boring, and I said, I know.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.890
[laughter] But that's
really the purpose.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:56.780
I wanted this as a
foundation for people to look

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.610
and discuss this further.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:04.290 position:56%
If we then analyze the content a bit
further of this chart for example,

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:09.770
we see again very peculiar
toponyms that again kind

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:15.520
of imply a certain bias within the
material itself, because if we move

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:21.160 position:56%
across the map, we see the different
toponyms have very specific names.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:26.510
The first says, peninsula de li
servi, peninsula of the Stags.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:31.110
Then peninsula of the phoca
marina, which are marine seals,

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:36.590
and then valle conzonta e giazata,
so a connected frozen valley.

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:40.560
So you really get this feeling
of remote northeast Asia.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.390
Island of women, anything Italian
has to have an island of women

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:46.990
of course, Isola delle Femmine.

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:50.130
There's a long tradition of
this mythical island of women

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:54.380
on cartography, and then
the gulf of the mangi,

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.350
or the manchuse [phonetic].

00:54:56.350 --> 00:55:02.330
So what's strange again is
you have an Italian and Arabic

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:05.000
and it implies again a
knowledge of a region

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.230
about which we have no
documentation in this period.

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:12.860
This is the famous Map with
Ship, which you will get to see

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.150
if you come to the
Library of Congress.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:19.870
Hessler himself has done some
work looking at writing on this

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:24.570
and some scratches in the
velum that also reveal writing.

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:26.760 position:56%
This is the most famous of the maps.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:31.060
If you google Rossi maps, you'll
see this because the Library

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:36.150 position:56%
of Congress put up a very nice
high-res image, and it's also famous

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.610
because it seems to
suggest something,

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:40.800
which I'll highlight later.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.240
Again, very strange.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.870
It has a faint drawing of a ship
to the left, and apparent seal

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:50.290
of the Polo family, and
then the map on the right.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:55.270
And I was most interested in
the map because it's an odd map,

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:59.620
and it has a "Chinese inscription."

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:03.970
It was kind of odd that I came
to this map speaking Chinese,

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.460
which was pure coincidence.

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.170
I did not write this.

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:11.640
One of the reasons I can tell you I
didn't write this is the characters

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.660
are not written by a
person who knows Chinese.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.950
And this was something that had
not been pointed out before.

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.120
Chinse has what's called
a stroke order.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.370
If you write any character,
there's a stroke order

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.780
which basically moves top
to bottom, left to right.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.100
There's a way of writing Chinese.

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:34.260 position:56%
If I were to hand you a Chinese menu
and say copy General Tsao's chicken

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:39.190
in Chinese, what it says, you
would draw the character sort

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.730
of copying the lines, and
it would look very awkward.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.060
The proportions would be wrong.

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.960
And in fact that's
what you see here.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.540
So whoever did this, you can
recognize the characters,

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.850
but whoever wrote this was copying

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:58.170
from some Chinese thing
sitting next to him or her.

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:01.030
So when you look at the characters
then, some of them you can make

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:03.120
out fairly well, and I did.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.030
I transcribed them.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:07.000
But they don't really say anything.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.380
There's not a sentence here.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.300
You see a variety of
characters, the character bai,

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.740
which means one hundred;
chu, which means to go out;

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:19.450
qi, seven; si, meaning four.

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:23.200
So there are characters here,
but there's no sentence here,

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.170
which is very frustrating
for a researcher.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:29.810
However, it's interesting because
whoever put these together,

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:35.340 position:56%
whether it was a forger, whether it
was someone who genuinely was trying

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:38.740
to collate some kind
of cartographic data.

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:41.190
They were looking at
something Chinese.

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:44.000
They were looking at
something that had Arabic text.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.580
And you get this very
odd amalgam here.

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:53.660
The Map with Ship, again, also has
these kind of numbered toponyms

00:57:53.660 --> 00:58:01.260 position:56%
that again refer to very similar set
of places moving towards the east,

00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:04.560
and if you look at them again,
there's this attribution

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:09.320
to the Saracens, to Arab
navigators, these remote islands,

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.240
cattigara [phonetic],
which you find in Ptolemy.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:16.980
Again, a reference to animals
that would live in these regions.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.750
Lioni marini, sea lions.

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:22.980
And then these islands connected
to the peninsula of the stags.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:27.040
You can imagine these reindeer
running across remote corner

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.120
of Siberia and northeastern Asia.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:37.320
Of course, what the media globbed
onto was the fact that this section

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.410
of the map looks just like the
Bering Strait, and if it looks

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:43.690
like the Bering Strait, it
must be the Bering Strait,

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.840
and I argued strenuously
against this,

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:51.230
and in fact going all the
way back to my PhD thesis,

00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:52.750
I have a long history of arguing

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.480
that with cartography
things may look alike.

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.920
It doesn't mean they're
the same thing.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.220
But if you go online, you'll see
this in a whole bunch of magazines

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.680
and newspapers, and I like
to show audiences this

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.450
because it's interesting.

00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:08.770
You do see this ring of
islands, which look sort

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:13.090
of like the Aleutian Islands, but
we cannot make any firm statement

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:18.020
as to the identity of what this
map is referring to in terms

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:21.310
of present day cartography.

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:27.470 position:56%
Another daughter, Fantina Polo, also
has her name on one of these maps.

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:34.330
This is a very odd map in terms
of its frame, the strange ellipse,

00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:39.900
and again it has inscriptions, and
again it has a series of toponyms.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.620
And it was this map that
struck me in a way as one

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.390
of the most interesting because
the toponyms when I looked

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:51.170
at them puzzled me
literally for several years.

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:55.300
I was like what is this because
it's Italian, Latinated Italian,

00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:00.380
but some of the words were not
even remotely Latin or Italian,

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.570
and when I looked at them, well the
first was Zipangu, which is Japan.

01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:08.700
That's how Marco Polo period
text referred to Japan.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.160
That's not strange.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.740
The first one, Serica,
that's just the word

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.600
for China, and Tartary, Tartaria.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.670
But then toponym number three Uan
Scian, you'd say it in Italian,

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:24.060
and then the next one, To Qiu.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.850
And then the next one, Da Han,

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:30.040
or in Venetian the C would
be pronounced H, Ta Can.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.870
And then Focan.

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:33.800
And the final one, the eastern sea.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.650
But I looked at those middle ones,
and I said those just sound very,

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:41.310
very strange to me, and
again I already had this idea

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:46.420
that the renderer of these maps was
trying to take something foreign

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:52.500
to him or her and put it
into some kind of Italian,

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.290
something that would be
understandable to them.

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:59.360
And it finally struck me that
the third one, the fifth one,

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.600
and the sixth one were Chinese,
and I only knew that by pure chance

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.760
because there's a famous
story of Fu Sang,

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.860
which some of you may know
about, it's this Chinese tale

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.800
of a Buddhist monk
that supposedly travels

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.700
to the distant reaches
beyond the ocean,

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:19.320
but the place names actually
are referred to sequentially

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.160
in the myth, so you have Uan Scian
[phonetic], which is Wen Shen

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:29.160 position:56%
in Chinese, and that literally means
a tattooed body, like the Ainu,

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.260
a marked body, Chen means a body.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:36.720
And then Da Han would be,
actually I explained it here.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.530
Da Han would be the great country
of the Han, of the Chinese.

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:44.650
So again you're going in
order because according

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:48.410
to the original story
in the Liang Shu,

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:51.280
in fact there's this
progression of places going

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.670
to the distant northeast.

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:57.410
Wen Shen, the tattooed or marked
bodies that may refer to the Ainu.

01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:01.740
Da Han wall [phonetic], the great
Han country, said to be east.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.680
And then finally to the
distant east, you have Fu Sang,

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.880
and that Sang refers
to the mulberry tree.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.740
So it's interesting that you
have this map that's attributed

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:18.000
to Marco Polo's daughter that has
these toponyms written in Italian,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.310
written in Venetian dialect,
and yet they're referring

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:24.310
to a Chinese story,
a mythical story,

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:26.510
and that to me was
the most interesting.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:30.490
Not in terms of proving a
voyage beyond the Pacific,

01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:33.240
but just looking at sources.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.750
And what's fascinating
is that this story

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:41.470
of Fu Sang was actually only
known in Europe in the 1700's.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:46.320
A sinologist, a kind of strange
sinologist named Joseph de Guignes,

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.870
who some of you may know,

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:53.630
he believed that Chinese characters
were based on Egyptian hieroglyphs,

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:58.700
but he was a sinologist, and
he did understand Chinese.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:04.460
He only found that text, the Fu
Sang text, the Liang Shu text,

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:11.100
he only found that in the 1700's,
and he presented it about 1761

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:17.390
in France, and he took the Chinese
names and Romanized them via French

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:18.870
through the French language.

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:23.570
So what's very strange is that
we see here it done in Italian.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:32.350
And in fact these place names
became put onto maps in the 1700's.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:36.900
This is a map, I forget the map
maker here, but he's actually drawn

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.840
across the bottom, let me see
here, he says [foreign language].

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:53.840
So it's like the root of the
Chinese to America in 458.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.430
So obviously in the 1700's people
believed this tale as a true tale

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.170
of journeys across the Pacific.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:04.520 position:56%
But what's interesting is that the
Polo map suggested somebody had this

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:09.110
idea much earlier, had read
this Chinese story much earlier,

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:12.090
and had essentially brought
it to Europe much earlier.

01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:15.960
So to me this was the most
interesting aspect of these maps,

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:21.270
a very strange synthesis of
Chinese and European sources.

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:26.200
The conclusions are
interesting since this first part

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.770
of the conference really is
about fact or fiction, and again,

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:35.340
when I wrote the book, and when
I was talking to the University

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.770
of Chicago about the book,
I said I really just want

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.070
to be the person examining
the contents.

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:43.060
I want to translate everything.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.680
I want to draw some
analogies, like I just did.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:52.890 position:56%
I want to look at content, but it's
very hard to make fixed conclusions.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:57.330
You have here some
interesting possibilities

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.930
that the content suggests.

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:02.330
You know, the book, my book
really looks at analysis

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:07.570
of the maps themselves, translation
of the text, again tries to put it

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.860
in context of other
cartographic work,

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.010
but it's not quite a
repeat of the Vinland map.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:18.420
First of all, there are more
documents, which is interesting.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:22.290
The other is that there's
connections between the two.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:25.340
They use this sort of
same toponymic system,

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.660
sometimes the same
places are referred

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.920
to in one map and another map.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.390
They're tied together by
supposedly all being penned

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:36.140
by Marco Polo's daughters.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.510
They are also different
from the Vinland map

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:40.470
in that there's no single suspect,

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.570
at least that I was
able to identify.

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:48.480
Even Rossi himself I don't think
quite had the chops let's say

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.720
to crank all of these
out as a collection.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.170
Also, it's not clear
what the motive is.

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:59.170
Usually when we look at forgeries
there may be a political motive,

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:04.160
a socioeconomic motive, just
a straight monetary motive.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.700 position:56%
You know, I am making these to sell.

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.690
And in fact it's interesting
in Rossi's history,

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:12.860
we don't have any record of him
trying to sell them to the Library

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:17.270
of Congress for example or sell
them to anyone else, so it's very,

01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:23.020 position:56%
very strange whoever created these
had some motive, but it's not really

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:27.820
in line with what we might see in
the history of other forgeries.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:32.170
Here's a picture of the
Vinland map again as I talk

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.770 position:56%
about my conclusions, and maybe
during the question session it would

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:40.320
be nice to sort of look at
what is the analogy or not.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.070 position:56%
Again, the Vinland map is
essentially written in one language,

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:48.230
has a fairly clear agenda,
one that was just elucidated

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:53.780 position:56%
in the proceeding talk, and even the
cartography itself very explicitly

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:58.030
says look here up in
this portion of the map.

01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:02.950
The Rossi maps obviously make lots
of allusions to the far northeast,

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:06.570
but there's never find of the
explicit claim, for example,

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:09.070
that Marco Polo reached America.

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.370
It's never said.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:16.400
So it's a very kind of obtuse,
very obscure agenda in those maps.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:22.380 position:56%
So the conclusions that I do draw
in the book that these may be copies

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.860
from the 18th century of something
that was genuinely earlier

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.720
because certainly the handwriting
suggests something that was written

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.210
after the time of Marco Polo.

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:34.300
There's not been a lot
of testing of the inks.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.550
There has been some
testing of the velum.

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:41.800 position:56%
But these may be something where it
was genuinely a manuscript tradition

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.940
trying to preserve
genuinely anomalous maps,

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:50.120
but there are many oddities,
there are anachronisms in terms

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.680
of the representation, you
know, this far northeast

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.430
that doesn't appear on
any maps of this period.

01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:01.990 position:56%
But obviously I felt that there were
a number of distinctive features

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:07.930 position:56%
which merited 13 years of my life to
study these maps, and then the sort

01:08:07.930 --> 01:08:11.850 position:56%
of last lesson that I like to say is
that the critics, for those of you

01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:16.290
who plan to write books,
critics are never satisfied.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:19.450
So when I presented this book,
and again if you read it,

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:22.040
it's very conservative I think.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.000
Many people said it
wasn't speculative enough.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.870
They said but look it looks
like the Bering Strait.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.960
So they weren't satisfied.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.990
Others of course said
that it's too speculative,

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:35.620
so that's a nice warning
for those of you

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.990
that do cartographical research.

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:41.050
Again, for me what was most
interesting is the content

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.730
and the fact that there's
probably a lot more work

01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.240
to be done on these maps.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.510
Thank you, and we'll have
questions at the end.

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:57.260
[ Applause ]

01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.510
[ Background Noise ]

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.810
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Thank you, Ben.

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:03.380
We are now going to, you can see

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.380
that our cartographic
controversies are kind

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.370
of forcing their way
across the ocean here.

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.870
We first started with
the Vinland map.

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:16.110
It was trying to get to America.

01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:20.180
Ben's maps are trying to cross
the Aleutian Islands and get here.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.790
Our next talk is actually going
to get here, and it's going

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:27.180
to just prove that in fact that the
cartographic controversies are not

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.010
for European historians alone.

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:34.430
The curatorship that I hold is
the history of early Americas,

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.480
and we broadly can see that.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.900
So our next speaker, Stephanie
Wood, is a Latin Americanist.

01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:44.860
She is an expert in the
Natawala [phonetic] language.

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:47.280
Her dictionary, her
online dictionary,

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.370
is used by hundreds of
thousands of people.

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:55.510
She has also worked on Nawat
[phonetic] pictorial manuscripts.

01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:57.200 position:56%
We have this a little bit in common.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.790
I spent the summer working

01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:02.470
at the Bibliotheque Nationale doing
hyperspectral imaging on a lot

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:06.790
of map manuscripts from the
Aztec post-colonial period

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:10.330
that we have no idea who
made them and what they are.

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:15.780
And so she's going to talk about
a group of maps that you may not,

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:20.740
this crowd may not
have any knowledge of.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.510
So, Stephanie, I'm just
going to let you do it.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:31.510
[ Applause ]

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:36.060
[ Background Noise ]

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.360
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Wood:
Well, they so much.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.580
It's wonderful to be back
at the Library of Congress.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:43.810
I spent some months here in
1995 in the Hispanic division.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:47.130
Almost took a job there, but
my husband is at the University

01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:52.920
of Oregon, so it was hard
to be divided so distantly.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.660
And I wanted to just thank John
Hessler and the Kislak Foundation

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.250
and in particular Arthur Dunkleman
[phonetic], who invited me

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:06.220
to be a part of this really
fun and interesting meeting.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.580 position:56%
I didn't realize, sorry, I thought I
was going to stand out as, you know,

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.810
really an oddball with these
particular manuscripts,

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.870
but now I don't think so so much.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:21.830
So [laughter] these are manuscripts
that are in the Library of Congress

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:26.350
so you could take a look at them
yourself if you have some time

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:28.720
and if you have the interest.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.120
The maps are, there
are I think 24 here.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.080
I didn't put them all up,
but I put a large sampling

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.130
so you can get a sense
of the corpus.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:40.780
There are more than
the ones that are here.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:44.660
There are some still in Mexico, but
the ones that are here are found

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:51.330
in a court case, a criminal case of
forgery from the late 19th Century.

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:56.080
It turns out that a group
of 18 men were participating

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.010
under the leadership of a
Melecio Yanez from Puebla,

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:02.760
[foreign language], a
person of mixed heritage,

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:08.160
who worked with these
other men to make the maps

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.060
and associated land title
for indigenous communities

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:15.940
in the Puebla-Tlaxcala
area of central Mexico,

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:23.200
and at least 25 towns bought these
maps and the associated titles

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.840
and some have more than one.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.140
So I don't know what happened.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.500
Maybe they made a map and the town
said no, no, no, that's not right,

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.920
and so they made them
another one, I'm not sure.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.410
I visited one of the towns
that has two, and they're still

01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:39.320
in their archives and they are so
proud of these and love these maps,

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:45.170
so what I'm about to say I'm
glad no one is here from the town

01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:47.650
because they have some oddities.

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:52.690
I'm going to be looking at, you
know, the nature of the corpus

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:55.570
in general, why would
people buy them.

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:57.380
I'm looking a lot at the content.

01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:02.110
I'm a historian and not
a map specialist myself,

01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:04.730
but also sort of the technique.

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:08.290
So my methodology in deconstructing
the maps is something I want

01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:09.700
to make clear today.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.180
And not just the maps but again
the titles, which are manuscripts

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:17.000
that include supposed
information about town founding,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.690
declaration of the
boundaries, and so on.

01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:22.780
We'll see a little bit more
about that in a minute.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.640
So what is the nature of the maps?

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.620
There are a number of what I call
subsets, groups within the corpus

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:34.340
that have shared characteristics,
so this is one subset

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.050
where there are a lot of greens and
yellows, and across the landscapes

01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:41.540
of the towns represented,
we have birds

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.630
and snakes and large human heads.

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:49.280
This is another group that has
the palette of browns largely,

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.160
buildings painted white, and so on.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.590
And here's another group that
the cartographer really liked

01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:00.040
to use sharp, notable angles.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:03.180
So I'm thinking there were
several people who made the maps.

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.320
There was a fellow named
Manuel Tello who was pointed

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.450
out in the course case
as being the map maker,

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:12.660
but I think that among the 18 men
there must have been a few working

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.960
on this.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.710
Maybe he taught some
others how to make maps,

01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:18.490
and so there are multiple styles.

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:24.750
And so one of the things I work
with students is to identify

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:28.090
when you see a map that might
be part of a larger corpus

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:30.980
to see what is it about
that map that makes it seem

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.280
to fit in with that group.

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:39.570
So I put up here for you some
other maps of central Mexico,

01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:45.120
and there's one from this
Puebla-Tlaxcala group.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.320
By the way they were
made about 1870,

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.870
purporting to be colonial
Mexican maps,

01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:54.340
and so I have some colonial maps
here, one from the 16th century

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:58.770
and two from the 17th and
one of these 1870 maps.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:01.910
And I hope that you can
see which one it is.

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:05.230 position:56%
Does anyone want to venture a guess?

01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:10.660 position:56%
It's the lower left here, so it has,
this is one of the green and yellow,

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:16.460
but it also has those buildings
painted white, and it's, you know,

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:20.650
it looks rather romantic, landscape
like compared to the others.

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:22.820
The upper left is the 16th century,

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:29.160
very much indigenous cartographic
example, and then the other two

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:34.410
from the 17th century on
the right, top and bottom.

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:38.600
So here's a closeup of the one
that was in the lower left.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.640
This is not here in the
Library of Congress.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.340
This one, a vendor of Rare
Books and Manuscripts,

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:47.570
contacted me in 2012 saying,
you know, what can you tell me

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:51.730
about this map, and right away I
said, oh, that looks like it fits

01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:58.230
with this corpus of the Yanez-Tello
Workshop that I'm calling it.

01:15:58.230 --> 01:16:01.230
Here's the document that's in the
court case here in the Library

01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:05.640
of Congress that shows the
arrest record of Melecio Yanez,

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:10.550
who was sort of the ring leader and
Manuel Tello and some other men.

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:14.510
Vicente Poblano, Antonio
Guerrero, these are typical names

01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:19.430
of urban dwelling, mixed heritage
men, probably came from Puebla.

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:24.040
Francisco Coca, now that
last name is in line

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.950
with an indigenous community elite
from one of the Townsend vaults,

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:33.790 position:56%
so it's, so there's some involvement
of indigenous people in the making

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:38.500
of these maps for indigenous towns,
but it's largely not their work.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.120
This is another document
in the court case,

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.070
which shows the profit motive if
you will and making these maps.

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:51.690
The man made maps and titles from
more than 20 communities as I said,

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.440
and in this case, for
example, made 15 visits

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.830
to one town to collect payments.

01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:03.070
And for me this is a risky
behavior because for one thing

01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.040
if you're doing something
surreptitious,

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.590
the authorities are
likely to see you if you're

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:10.120
around to different
towns collecting money.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.390
Also I work on another workshop
from the valley of Toluca, Mexico,

01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:20.060 position:56%
where the collector was in fact
murdered by a town that was very fed

01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:23.250
up with making these payments,
and the money was rather,

01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:25.640
it was expensive, and it was
hard to get the money together.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:30.970
And this document, another one,
they kept very meticulous records

01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:33.990
of all the monies they collected
from the different towns

01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:36.340
and who went and did
what, so it was very easy

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.770
for the criminal case
layer to figure this out.

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:43.500
I just show this one because it
mentions don Francisco Cahuantzi,

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:49.500
who was again an indigenous
person, an elite, and some relative

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:52.820
of his became governor of the stat
of Glasgow in the 19th century,

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:56.010
so it's really intriguing
to me who this man was,

01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:58.070
but he was lesser known

01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:01.120
than Prospero Cahuantzi,
who was the governor.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.560
So I don't know a lot about
that particular fellow.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.050
Here's an example of a map
and the accompanying titles.

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:14.500
For one particular town,
they had to pay 299 pesos,

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:19.090 position:56%
a daily wage was a third of a peso,
so this is a lot of money for humble

01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:21.850
and small indigenous
communities to come up with.

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:28.330
So they were, there was a monetary
motive to a large extent here.

01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:31.400 position:56%
The documents that go with the maps,

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.030
very fitting elements
are say a royal provision

01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:38.660
that says this town has this
territory and we recognize it,

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.520 position:56%
and then there is a process that
provides a protection of possession,

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.500
boundary survey, measurements,
and then result is a map.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.640
Now that's the official colonial
administrative kind of record.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:57.340 position:56%
Now these have, in addition to those
faked elements of the town title,

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.570
they have some more things
that they have pulled

01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:03.950
from the more indigenous
historical record tradition.

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:06.480
So portraits of town founders.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.530
A code of arms.

01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:10.400
A narrative of the town founding.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.970
A narrative of the first
church and the use of Nahuati.

01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:18.060
I'm not saying that, you
know, using Nahuati was fake.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:21.820
It was an internal thing that
many towns had records in Nahuati,

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.740
the indigenous language
of the central Mexicans,

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:29.560
but for a colonial official
record to have that was unusual.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.270
So here's an example
of one of these titles.

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:39.580
A town founder, supposedly the
portrait from the year 1623,

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:43.480
but his clothes immediately
convey that's not the case.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.900
You know, if this is a copy
of something earlier, okay,

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:51.860
made in the 19th century perhaps,

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.140
but it claims to be
a [foreign language].

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:58.710
They use these true, you
know, original and so

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:01.730
on words all the time, which
when there is copy made,

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:06.800
it was always a true and loyal copy
would be stated, so they're bending

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:11.090
over backwards to say this is not
a copy, but it's not original.

01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:14.720
And here's an example
of a coat of arms in one

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.190
of these bundles of town titles.

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.630
And they say specifically that
the town gave this coat of arms

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:24.300
to the viceroy, which is backwards
because in most communities

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.200
where they had a coat of arms
that was given to them by the kind

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.330
or the viceroy, you know,
that's the direction it went.

01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:32.400
It went, you know,
authorities to the town

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.410
and then they proudly
would, you know,

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:37.560
show it in their community center.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.750
But this one they said the
town gave this to the viceroy.

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:44.730
Well it's crazy, but
anyway, it's interesting.

01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:47.930
So here we have the boundary
measurements, the standard kind

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:52.260
of thing, but the page
itself is very odd.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.370
It says it's from 1758.

01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:56.340
The handwriting says no it isn't.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:59.160
There's a big stamp right
on top of the writing.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.310
That's not a sealed paper, official
colonial sealed paper had the stamp

01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:06.560
in the upper left corner, and
then you wrote next to it.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.860
You didn't write over it.

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:10.600
And so this is, the
stamp has come later

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.570
and been put on top of the writing.

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:14.700
The orthography full of K's.

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:18.520
The letter K came into
Mexico in the 19th century.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.520
It was definitely not there
in the colonial period

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.530
from many records I know of.

01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:25.650
So, you know, it's
just very strange.

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:30.690
So another example of the boundary
survey, the royal provision,

01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:34.050
supposedly from these
years, has three stamps.

01:21:34.050 --> 01:21:36.090
You wouldn't have a
page with three stamps.

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:38.730
Usually just one in the
upper left-hand corner.

01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:42.780
Typically too it would have then
some text that gave, with the stamp

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:48.420
that gave the years that
the paper was made and sold.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:53.020 position:56%
This is protection of possession
for one community, again full of K's

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:56.780
and so on, and misspellings
and other things.

01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:01.630
This is a peculiar signature,
a hand print and a cross.

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:04.960
Sometimes, you know, we do see
crosses in colonial manuscripts,

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.200
not so many hand prints, and I
would just think that's very fun

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.520 position:56%
if you're a, you know, a fingerprint
analyst, you could figure

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.170
out who this was, but of course
the person is now long dead,

01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:16.800
but enjoyable.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.150
Problematic dates.

01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:23.120
This is one document that
says onyo day [phonetic] 1546,

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:27.270
the year of 1546 when it's not
at all the right handwriting

01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:34.610
for that period or this statement
on a map that says, you know, 1760,

01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:38.870
and again full of K's and so on.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:43.490
And here a map, totally
original, from the town.

01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:45.640
Maps didn't say totally original.

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:49.170
They only said, you know,
totally faithful to the original

01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:53.150
when it was a copy, as we see
in the bottom example here.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:59.700 position:56%
Peculiar orthography, so again just
kind of sharing with you the methods

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:05.600
of deconstructing this syelo,
the word for sky, S, Y, E, L, O,

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.790
just unheard of spelling.

01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:10.880
You know, maybe C and
S's were substituted,

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.760
but the I for Y with
the S just strange.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:19.650
Eskritura with a K, no, no, never.

01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:20.950
And so on.

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:25.150
So Eskribano Real y
publiko, this notary.

01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:27.760
Notaries typically
abbreviated real y publiko,

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.060
they got so sick of writing.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.350
Even the work escribano
was abbreviated,

01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:33.520
so the whole thing would
be abbreviated here.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.130
It's all spelled out like a
very big amateur might do,

01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:39.520
but even that, it's just very rare.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:45.570 position:56%
A lot of these titles were tied with
ropes in legahos [phonetic] bundles,

01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:47.610
and those ropes over
the years of being tied

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:52.700 position:56%
and untied would create a lot of
wear, which this one page, you know,

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.870
looks, it looks something
like the wear that you see,

01:23:55.870 --> 01:24:00.330
but this was burned in to make it
look like it was worn by robes,

01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:04.890
and yet the page underneath is not
worn, and that would be strange.

01:24:04.890 --> 01:24:07.970
So very curious, peculiar.

01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:12.730
Here's another example of
an oddity, lined paper.

01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:15.890
We didn't have lined paper
in the colonial period.

01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:18.310
You go in the archives,
you won't find it.

01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:22.590
So very 19th century
flavor right here.

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:26.380
And going back to those seals
that I already pointed out.

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.340
These are fabricated.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:34.410
They misspell the word seal
itself, so, you know, duh,

01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:37.340
but they also made two
or three different kinds,

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:39.310
and they stamped them
all over everything

01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:41.830
in a kind of enthusiastic way.

01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:43.980
So that's a problem.

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:48.770
Also, these stamps were
made for official paper

01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:51.050
that you would write documents on.

01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:53.750
Maps were not usually
stamped with these seals,

01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:57.910
so we find that the maps have
the seals stamped all the way

01:24:57.910 --> 01:25:03.330
around the edges, and
that's not done.

01:25:03.330 --> 01:25:06.930
In looking back at the titles,
there was I think an effort here

01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:12.900 position:56%
to make them look old by making them
dirty, but smudging them with ink.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:16.460
So we see a lot of that
on a lot of the pages.

01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:21.290
Okay. I mentioned the
appearance, the use of Nawat.

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:24.990
There isn't a lot in these
manuscripts and maps,

01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:30.000
but there are some examples, which
I the suggest the map makers wanted

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.960
to blend an authenticity
of Nawat community,

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:39.190
and this is their language, and,
you know, this is what they wrote,

01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:42.020
but again it's poorly done.

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.760
It's by people who don't really
know the language very well,

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.060
they maybe know a few words,

01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:52.290
so on this map we see it says
ninteopantzin tel tochantzin.

01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:56.270
It's their church, but
it's our town, our home.

01:25:56.270 --> 01:26:00.280
Which is a puzzling,
peculiar thing to say.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.360
There may have been some kind
of dispute in this community

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:07.620
over whose church this was,
which town it pertained to,

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:12.090
but that was extremely rare
and unlikely, so I don't know,

01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:14.810
whoever wrote that might not
really have realized even what they

01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:16.810
were saying.

01:26:16.810 --> 01:26:19.490
But I do want to say
that the paintings

01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:24.930
of the churches are sometimes very
realistic as though, as I said,

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:26.250
these guys were itinerant.

01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:27.670
They went to the towns
collecting money.

01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:30.470
They also seemed to have
gone to the towns to look

01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:33.280
for legitimate local detail
to work into the maps.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.190
So the church here, the photograph
that I have is from the back,

01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:39.610
so it's not going to look
identical to you maybe,

01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:42.620
but it is the same church, so
that's kind of interesting.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:50.790
On a couple of the maps we have a
founding couple prostrate in front

01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:53.750
of the church, crawling toward it.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.880
And that's very unusual.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:00.800
I've never seen it before anywhere
else, and if you know of examples

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.750
of this, I'd like to
understand the origin,

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:06.010
where did they get this image,
and it's because it appears twice.

01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:08.000
See here's another one.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.940
Having a founding couple,
male and female,

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:13.940
is an indigenous Mexican
characteristic

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.380
of early maps and manuscripts.

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:19.550
You know, we talk about
our founding fathers.

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:22.870 position:56%
They had their founding mothers and
fathers, which is kind of refreshing

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:27.970
for the gender balance, but they
very rarely crawled like, or,

01:27:27.970 --> 01:27:31.000
you know, lay down in
front of the church.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.080
This is very typical, a couple
sitting in a cave or in a building.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:40.890
This is the usual founding couple
arrangement, male and female, yes.

01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:42.190
And here's another one.

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:46.150 position:56%
So these are legitimate 16th century
examples that I'm showing you

01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:49.810
of founding couples,
early ancestors and so on.

01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:52.710
That's typically the
way they appeared.

01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:55.830
Okay, also on these maps we
have these talking heads,

01:27:55.830 --> 01:28:00.820
which I showed early on,
and what I didn't say is

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.820
that they have speech scrolls
coming out of their mouths,

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.080
and that's an indigenous
cartographic tradition.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.450
You put people on the landscape.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.130
You put words coming
out of their mouths.

01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:13.740
The indigenous local elite was
called aglactowani [phonetic],

01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.860 position:56%
one who has the speech, the speaker.

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:24.270
And in this case, this one talking
head on the upper left is saying,

01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:28.180
you know, the patron is San
Antonio, so he's speaking

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:32.010
about the patron saint
of the local church.

01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:33.710
So that's kind of interesting.

01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:37.020
And to have large heads on
the manuscripts was something

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:40.000
in the region known on manuscripts.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.120
I showed two examples
from the Puebla area

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.450
where large heads were
put on the landscape.

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:47.680
It's pretty unique to this region.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.230
I haven't seen it a lot in
other parts of central Mexico,

01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:56.570 position:56%
but I wondered if the map makers had
seen these other earlier manuscripts

01:28:56.570 --> 01:29:00.180
and got the idea to put
these large heads out there

01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.320
from these other manuscripts.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.840
And here's another example.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.900
The large head on the upper left
here, he's saying, the father,

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:11.670 position:56%
the father, the father, which is odd
because usually it was the father,

01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.250
the son, the holy spirit.

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:19.590 position:56%
And so again they've written this in
Nawat, really not sure probably how

01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:22.210
to say the father, the son,
and holy spirit in Nawat,

01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:26.720
so they just repeated the father,
which is, again, humorous for me,

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.820
but I can see they were
earnestly trying here

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:34.480
to put something believable and
authentic seeming on the landscape.

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.480
I got two other examples of people.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:44.090
You more often would see a bust
or a whole body than just the head

01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:46.930
in many other manuscripts.

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:48.930
So I have shown you some heads.

01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:52.570
They did exist, but this
is more common in a way.

01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:57.170
Okay, another feature from
another map example on the left,

01:29:57.170 --> 01:30:00.060
we have a comet from 1816.

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:07.580
And I wonder if that comet was
maybe seen in the 16th Century,

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:12.480
Duran corex [phonetic], you know,
because it has some similarities

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.430
in the way it's represented,

01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:17.000
but again I really don't
know all the sources

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.840
that these map makers had for
trying to infuse their maps

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:26.050
with some authenticity and
typical indigenous traditions.

01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:29.740
There was a definite interest
in celestial phenomena,

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:35.700
and comets were, texts are full of
references to comets, so, you know,

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:38.050
it kind of fits in that way.

01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:43.670
One of the titles that accompanied
the maps has a reference in fact

01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:46.940
to the Aztec empire, so that's
kind of interesting again

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:50.500
that they were thinking about,
you know, trying to reach back

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:54.830
and connect to pre-Columbian
and early colonial times

01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:58.890
in various ways, and then
there's a reference to 1578 here,

01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:02.380
and definitely the hand
is not 16th century.

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:05.660
One of the manuscripts has
an eagle with a serpent,

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.490
and if any of you know the Mexican
flag, you know we have the eagle

01:31:09.490 --> 01:31:12.100
on a cactus with a serpent.

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:18.380
And so again maybe they pulled
this from an earlier manuscript

01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:22.350
and put it on the map to
give that Aztec flavor.

01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:28.400
They also put serpents, and
in this case tigre, a tiger,

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.740
which was really [inaudible]
the word in the Nawat

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:36.890 position:56%
for any kind of man-eating wild cat.

01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:42.460
So you get, I really think they
mean jaguar here because serpents

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:47.670
and jaguars were very prominent
in pre-Columbian Aztec iconography

01:31:47.670 --> 01:31:52.970
and so I also have a 16th century
map that shows a tiger on a hill,

01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:55.040
which is sort of a
glyphic representation

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:58.940
of the word Tehuantepec,
which was wild cat hill.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:03.560 position:56%
And so again maybe they saw some
earlier maps, and they got the idea,

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.430 position:56%
oh, let's put all over the landscape
snakes and tigers and things.

01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:12.820
So here are some other legitimately
colonial maps with snakes on them,

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:18.210
so you can see where they
might be trying to recall that.

01:32:18.210 --> 01:32:22.490
Now this gets more like
Ripley's Believe it or Not.

01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:27.080
They have drawn and
painted in some what appear

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.580
to be pre-Hispanic sculptures
in this one town in particular,

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:35.920
and the one on the left, you know,

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.480 position:56%
it does look as though maybe there's
something like this in the town,

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.670
and I want to go there and
see if they have any kind

01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:43.360
of sculpture that looks like that.

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.410
The one on the right
is really very strange.

01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:47.790
It looks like an alien
from outer space I think,

01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:51.630
but nothing I've seen like that.

01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:55.970
And also, you know, again like
with this mysterious Ripley's kind

01:32:55.970 --> 01:33:02.470 position:56%
of flavor, an eagle of what they say
here in the text to be 37-1/2 pounds

01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:05.720
that could life up a
sheep and carry it away.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.050
So super interesting.

01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:11.060
And here's some more
details to research locally.

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.640
I haven't gone yet to
this particular town.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:16.040
There's so many of them,
it's going to take a while

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:20.350
but there are a number of
really mysterious details

01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:25.430
on this Acapetlahuacan map, you
know, a man hanging by his feet.

01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:28.340
You know, a woman lying
bloody and dead.

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:32.020
Another head suspended from
a branch and some skeletons,

01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:35.250
so this town had a really
colorful history apparently.

01:33:35.250 --> 01:33:38.720
I just really can't
wait to learn more.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.560
Now aside from trying to
reach back and bringing

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.950
in indigenous traditions, these
map makers I think also tried

01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:50.370 position:56%
to infuse their maps with a
semblance of cartographic modernity.

01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:55.260
And so they have these features,
like, you know, a compass showing,

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:56.770
you know, the cardinal points.

01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:59.460
The slightly different one

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:02.470
to the next is again is though
there were multiple hands involved

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:07.240
in making these maps, and
some port north on the top,

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.360
and some put east on the top.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.920
So the indigenous tradition
was to put east

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.180
on the top and European north.

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.860
So that's something
further to research

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:22.310
and who might have made
which type of compass.

01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:25.330
And then this example
on the right is from one

01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:28.370
of our Pueblo-Tlaxcala maps,
and it has [foreign language].

01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:36.780
I mean that's just, I've never
seen that, and it's fascinating.

01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:43.260
And that kind of language
is probably familiar to some

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.620
of you who are cartographers.

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:48.550
And on the left I can show you
that we do have some colonial maps

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:52.510
with these kinds of
cartographic modernity beginning

01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:54.820
to appear in the 18th century.

01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:01.960 position:56%
And so it's not unusual exactly, but
it's kind of an exaggerated example.

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.030
So that fascinated me.

01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:08.970 position:56%
So European influences do, you know,
creep their way into these maps.

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:13.890
In particular, I find it in the
cartouches, in the, you know,

01:35:13.890 --> 01:35:17.350
the one on the left here,
it was incredibly elaborate,

01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:21.900
beautiful example from
a European authored map.

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:25.190
On the right are two examples
from our Puebla-Tlaxcala group,

01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:28.540
which are, you know,
not so elaborate,

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:32.920
especially the lower right is very
simple, but the upper right tries

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:38.130
to be more detailed and pleasing.

01:35:38.130 --> 01:35:42.150
Okay, just to put this one example
I'm sharing with you in a context,

01:35:42.150 --> 01:35:48.870
we have known today eight title
and map manufacturing workshops

01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:53.560
in Mexican history, and so I
wanted to show you another example

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:58.030
to give you a sense of how the
Yanez Tello group compares.

01:35:58.030 --> 01:36:01.090
Am I doing okay on time?

01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:05.050
Okay. So just a few
slides of this other group,

01:36:05.050 --> 01:36:10.720
which is led by a fellow named
Ramirez de Arellano, and these maps

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:15.810
and titles were made
around the year 1900.

01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:17.990
Again, purporting to be colonial.

01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:21.980
In this case, almost all of them
have dates something like 1639

01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:31.890
or 1609, and so they're made on
cloth some of them and on paper.

01:36:31.890 --> 01:36:38.140
And they too have this emphasis on
the cartouche that starts out mapa,

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:43.200
map, and so on, and they're all
indigenous towns in central Mexico.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.640
Some of these are copies, and
so the styles vary a little bit,

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:53.270
but they're pretty similar as a
whole as you look at the group,

01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:59.080
and the legend there, map, de
las tierras map of the lands

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.830
that pertain to such
and such a place.

01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:06.840
They have certain repeating
characteristics in the handwriting,

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.770
the D and the E being combined,

01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:13.210
the V for U. They almost
all have a town founder,

01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:16.540
a single person on the landscape.

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:20.070
At the center of town,
he's dressed quite the same

01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:24.710
in almost all these maps, holding
his hat down and his hand up.

01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:26.940
I think this pointing is an effort

01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:31.640 position:56%
to make him the platawane
[phonetic], the one who could speak,

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.000
the local ruler, because
they often showed

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.380 position:56%
in 16th century manuscripts a person

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:41.850
with the voice also
would point the finger.

01:37:41.850 --> 01:37:45.610
So I think that's what's
happening here.

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:50.510
Interestingly, in 2009 the town,
one of the towns that has one

01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:56.040
of the lienzos [phonetic], canvas
maps, they gave a presentation

01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.410
on 400 years of the validity of
their town map, and I couldn't go,

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:06.490
but I was really intrigued to note
how the town really embraces it

01:38:06.490 --> 01:38:11.080
as a legitimate valid
map of their town.

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:14.790
And so I had done a little looking
around at some of the details

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:17.200
on their map, and I have been able

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.140
to identify four different place
names that are in fact local.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:27.430 position:56%
So again, I think the makers of this
group went to the town and asked,

01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:30.130
you know, tell me, you know,
let's walk over the landscape

01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:31.660
and you identify everything for me,

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:33.010
and they would work
that into the map.

01:38:33.010 --> 01:38:37.820
So in that sense you can see
how the town would embrace it.

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:40.300
Yeah, this represents our town.

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:45.270
And here are four more examples
of this particular corpus,

01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:48.730
and they're slightly different
though they have these recurring

01:38:48.730 --> 01:38:52.520
characteristics that help
us identify them as a group.

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.350
They also are customized.

01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:55.940
So again they've been to the town.

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:57.240
They've asked the local people.

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.230
They tried to put the mountains
where they're supposed to go.

01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:01.770
If there was a body of water,
they tried to put it in there.

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:06.770
They also incorporate a few more
indigenous cartographic details

01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:11.000
such as if there's a road or a path
that is marked with footprints,

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.680
which was a pre-Columbia,
early colonial indigenous way.

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.040
And water is a current that
throws off shells as it goes,

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.880
and they tried to use that
method for replicating rivers.

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:31.580 position:56%
Okay, so to summarize and figure out
what our takeaways are from looking

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:37.210
at these kinds of mass-produced
maps and manuscripts.

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:40.960
I want to urge that we not
dismiss them outright as forgery,

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.230 position:56%
so we're looking at fact or fiction.

01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:46.320
For me it's fact and fiction.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.880
It's more fitting to say
that these are contrived.

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.100
In other words, they've taken
local input to make a vision

01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:58.730
of a community that fit what the
town itself might recognize even

01:39:58.730 --> 01:40:03.950
if they've also tried to pretend
it's early, old, which would,

01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:07.300
if it ended up in the courts
perhaps help the community defend

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.350
their lands.

01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:12.470
Towns desperately need a
documentation, so they were ready

01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:17.960
to pay these exorbitant prices
to get maps for their towns,

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.860
to fulfill that need
to defend their towns.

01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:23.220
And it wasn't such a
level playing field.

01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:27.140
In the colonial period and
especially in the 19th century,

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:30.040
there were a number of laws
attacking group-held lands,

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:34.390
and indigenous community
lands were held by the town.

01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:36.590
Use of parcels was individualized,

01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:38.870
but as a whole land
was held by the group.

01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:42.050
So in the reforms of the
second half of the 19th century

01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:45.570
that attacked group held
lands, which were mainly aimed

01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:49.750
at the Catholic church, they
affected indigenous communities.

01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:53.030
Then Maximillian of Hapsburg
came in and reversed that,

01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:56.010
but then we had a dictatorship,
Porfirio Diaz [phonetic],

01:40:56.010 --> 01:40:59.590
in the late 19th century
Mexico, where he returned

01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:04.980 position:56%
to attack a group-held land, and it
was when it was in that last quarter

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:07.110
of the 19th century, last
third of the 19th century

01:41:07.110 --> 01:41:11.350
when indigenous lands were really
alienated more than ever before

01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:15.430
and large estates were being
built up more than ever before.

01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:19.640
So it was tough, and towns were
really desparate for some documents

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.750
to defend their communities.

01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:26.760
So I call that the, you know, the
social versus the legal context,

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.470
and as I said, there were
eight such workshops,

01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:32.590
so this is a huge phenomenon.

01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:37.480
There was a recent book by Karina
Olds called "Forging the Past"

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.390
in which she looks at medieval
and Renaissance manuscripts

01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:45.500
to understand some of the
complexities of forgery,

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:50.150
and one quote I just thought
I would share with you here

01:41:50.150 --> 01:41:54.990
from her recent book
is forgeries were not,

01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:58.700
at least from the perspective of
their perpetrators, outright lies.

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.000
They were rather a recovery of
a deeper, more essential truth,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.620 position:56%
that had been waylaid somehow, or in
the case of indigenous communities,

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:11.910
maybe they never had documents
to defend their territories.

01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:18.210
And yet I don't want to be
speculative or not enough,

01:42:18.210 --> 01:42:21.970
I want to say that science is
also important, and so we need

01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:25.070
to take science to our
study of these manuscripts.

01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:31.140
We have to have a methodology
that allows us to recognize

01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:34.160
when a new map or manuscript
emerges.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.330
Does it fit in some of
these known corpuses?

01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:41.230
Does it have that kind of
style, that orthography,

01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:44.280
terminology, handwriting.

01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:49.350
We even need to look more at the
paper or the cloth and so on,

01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:52.900
and we need to seat the historical
context that produced the map

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.620
and also the history
that it conveys.

01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:57.450
We don't want to undermine
their validity

01:42:57.450 --> 01:43:01.400
for the indigenous communities,
but we can't be naïve either,

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:04.230
so we have both fact and fiction.

01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:06.030
Thank you.

01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:14.040
[ Applause ]

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.520
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well, I
want to call our speakers

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:20.370
up for a question session if
we'd like to take some questions.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.160
One of things that I found
interesting about all three

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:31.230
of our papers here is
this combination of the,

01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:36.830
both the cross-cultural context in
both post and pre-modern elements

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:41.360
that are moving into both
of these, all of these maps.

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.770
Any questions?

01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:44.070
John?

01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:49.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have one for Stephanie.

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.650
I have a question and a comment.

01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:54.510
[Inaudible] conceptual Mexico and--

01:43:54.510 --> 01:44:01.360
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.700
Was genuine civic pride
that they really wanted

01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:12.750
to show off their ancestry as
well as making land claims.

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:17.410
And then the second comment, just
a comment, that crouching position

01:44:17.410 --> 01:44:23.570
that you showed in that map, I've
seen that in a number of places

01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:28.070
with people going on pilgrimage
to pilgrimage destinies.

01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:32.190
So if these towns were pilgrimage
destinies, I've watched people

01:44:32.190 --> 01:44:37.530
down like that say going into San
Miguel del Milagro in Tlaxcala

01:44:37.530 --> 01:44:40.070
and you know Tepaoc
[phonetic] and so forth.

01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:43.060 position:56%
I'm wondering if they're saying, you
know, this is place of pilgrimage,

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:47.700
and we are going to the shrine
of our patron saint and so forth.

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.000
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Wood: Thanks John.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.760
Yeah, two really good
comments and questions.

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:56.970
First of all, pride in ancestry
I do think enters into it,

01:44:56.970 --> 01:45:02.090
certainly in legitimate internally
made manuscripts and maps,

01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:06.570 position:56%
and these [inaudible] weren't so far
removed from the indigenous heritage

01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:09.970
that they might, and again, because
a couple of them are indigenous,

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:14.310
koka [phonetic] and kawansene
[phonetic], I think they did,

01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:17.020
they were probably in line with
this not just for the money

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:20.590
but for the pride and the
ability to provide communities

01:45:20.590 --> 01:45:22.150
with something they
desperately needed.

01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:26.910 position:56%
It's interesting to me that they
don't try to replicate the genealogy

01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:29.260
across the landscape,
which is very common

01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:31.720
on many indigenous authored maps.

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.460
Putting people on the
landscape is huge in,

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.910
you know, age-old traditions.

01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:39.720
And often those people
are ancestors,

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.890
you know multiple generations
of ancestors.

01:45:41.890 --> 01:45:44.920
I haven't seen that
yet in that group,

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:48.260
but I think it wouldn't be
too surprising to find it,

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:53.370
but they were a little bit
removed maybe from that tradition.

01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:56.320
The people on the ground, you
know, pointing toward the church,

01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.050
I agree with you, it's the
pilgrimage concept definitely is

01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:01.350
worth exploring.

01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:05.930
I've been Tepeyac, for instance,
the virgin of Guadalupe shrine,

01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:10.110
where people get off the bus a
kilometer or two kilometers away

01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:13.790
and crawl the rest of the way,
and they get to the church bloody

01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:15.530
and their clothing
torn and everything.

01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:18.290
So, yeah, it really
does recall that.

01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:22.350
I mean the whole thing of
prostrating oneself before a cross

01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:27.430
or an altar, and there's plenty
of examples of that in, you know,

01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:29.640
across Europe and in Mexico.

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.490
I just haven't seen it
on these kinds of maps,

01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:36.260
but it's not a surprise
exactly, you're right,

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.570
it's just unusual on the maps.

01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:41.060
Thanks. Thanks John.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Wood: Hey.

01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:53.490
&gt;&gt; What was the result of
the attempt by these people

01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:54.860
to hold onto their lands.

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:57.910
In other words, you're
looking at these communities,

01:46:57.910 --> 01:47:00.060
what did they lose in the process?

01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:04.170
Were they successful, even
if these are fraudulent maps,

01:47:04.170 --> 01:47:07.140
did they indeed lose property based

01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:12.040
on porfirioto [phonetic]
and [inaudible] land?

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:18.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Wood: Yeah, I think the
Puebla-Tlaxcala region did find the

01:47:18.970 --> 01:47:23.310
perimeters of their territories
encroached upon increasingly

01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:26.600
in that period, but they
still held the town center,

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.780
and in the second group I
showed they were especially,

01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:34.600
and I didn't point it out, but that
whole Ramirez de Arellano set has

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:36.550
the fundo la galle
[phonetic] marked off.

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:41.990 position:56%
So in the colonial period, the crown
recognized a minimum town base,

01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:45.350 position:56%
and it wasn't just for the buildings
and the church, but it was farmed,

01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:48.530
and I've got lots of
manuscripts that show that.

01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:50.860
And I do think in the
Puebla-Tlaxcala area they

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.940
at least protected that
much a lot of the time.

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:56.750
There are some towns, I
studied, one of the maps I showed

01:47:56.750 --> 01:48:02.590
from Wahaka [phonetic] whereby the
town, only the mere core was left.

01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:07.400
The haciendas took a lot
of it away, but in the end,

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:10.280
in that particular case,
the church gave back,

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.900
when their lands were attacked,
they gave back some of the land

01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:15.670
that they had accumulated
to the town.

01:48:15.670 --> 01:48:17.140
I think that's a rare thing.

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.160
I don't think that was
common, but anyway,

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.600
whether the maps were
really effective

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.940
in defending the territories,
I'm not so sure

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:27.670
because they were denounced
as forgeries,

01:48:27.670 --> 01:48:30.970
and you know there was a trial,
and that happened a lot with many

01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:34.160
of the, many of the
workshops we've identified.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:38.480
The leaders were sent to jail,
or one as I said was murdered,

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.300
and then his widow was investigated
because she continued going

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:47.840 position:56%
around trying to get the money that
the husband couldn't end up getting.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:50.540
It didn't really matter
to them sometimes

01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:53.180
like the sacatel cotu [phonetic]
maps that are still in one

01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:56.770
of the towns in the region, they
love them, and they're proud

01:48:56.770 --> 01:49:00.060
of them, and I don't think they've
ever taken them to use in court.

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:04.180 position:56%
So they had, it's the social context
for them that is the most important,

01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:08.760
but anyway, I think a study of
late 19th century landholding

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.600
in the region would really
be helpful to see, you know,

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:14.800
just the situation for these
particular communities.

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.060
Thanks and good to see you.

01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.710
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: There we go.

01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:22.560
&gt;&gt; I've got a question for Ben.

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.570
What do you know about
Rossi's professional life

01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:30.360
or his possible motivation
for amassing this collection,

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:35.170
which I think you said
comprised much more than 14 maps?

01:49:35.170 --> 01:49:39.820
&gt;&gt; Ben Olshin: That's
a very good question.

01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:43.540
In the book, I sort of give a
little bit of background of him,

01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:48.210
and I guess you may know that the
present owner is a direct descent

01:49:48.210 --> 01:49:50.460
of Rossi.

01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:54.410 position:56%
Rossi's professional life was
interesting in that he was a tailor,

01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:56.720
and he was not highly educated.

01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.120
And that itself is kind of an
interesting point of contention

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:06.140 position:56%
because I think there's a lot of
bias that people think that somebody

01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:08.850
who doesn't have a lot of formal
education wouldn't be interested

01:50:08.850 --> 01:50:10.150
in history.

01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:14.440
But he is partially just
because he's Italian,

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.820
he's strongly identifies as
an Italian, so he's interested

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:21.250
in history generally
of the Italians.

01:50:21.250 --> 01:50:27.040
But also he's a tailor,
and yet he makes the claim,

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.900
particularly in a letter
to the Library of Congress

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:33.050
that he's descended from
somebody named Julio de Rossi,

01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:38.300
who was connected directly
with Marco Polo.

01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:42.280
So, you know, it's very
difficult to verify that claim.

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.220 position:56%
That's one of the projects that
still has to be done genealogically.

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:50.650
But apparently then he says,
you know, he's just a tailor.

01:50:50.650 --> 01:50:52.370 position:56%
He's interested in history; however,

01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:56.870
he's amassed these
manuscripts while in Italy.

01:50:56.870 --> 01:51:01.830
He comes to the United States and
then wants to have them examined.

01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:05.440
I mean he brings them literally
right here to have them examined.

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:11.280
So that's kind of his personal
history, but in the documentation,

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:14.640
and there's not a lot of
correspondence that survives

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:17.180
from him, but there's nothing
that sort of indicates again

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:21.960
that he had a particular agenda
other than kind of an amateur

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:26.010 position:56%
in the positive sense of an
amateur, you know, a lover of stuff,

01:51:26.010 --> 01:51:28.370
to find something else about them.

01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:31.050
And that's one of the frustrating
things because I kept looking

01:51:31.050 --> 01:51:35.370
for a hint that he was trying
to make money out of them

01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:37.870
or that he wanted to
make some strong claim.

01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:39.490
Really the strongest claim is

01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:43.820
that he's descended
from this Julio Rossi.

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.120
Is that possible?

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.340
Absolutely, but with
a name like that,

01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:49.950
it's going to be very
hard to determine.

01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:53.560 position:56%
And then when he passes away, what's
interesting is the maps then go

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:58.610
to an uncle, Louis Rossi, and
then finally to the current owner.

01:51:58.610 --> 01:52:02.710
So it's kind of odd that he even
in death he doesn't make a sort

01:52:02.710 --> 01:52:06.030
of strong effort to have
them preserved or anything.

01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:09.600
When I came across them,
they literally were sitting

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:13.650
in just the drawer in
this house in Houston.

01:52:13.650 --> 01:52:18.160
So kind of a long answer to
your story, to your question.

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.850
Nothing in Rossi's history
really suggests any kind

01:52:23.850 --> 01:52:26.690
of useful information at this point

01:52:26.690 --> 01:52:31.530
about the actual origins
of the map, etc.

01:52:31.530 --> 01:52:33.630
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: One of the
things about the map that came

01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:37.700
to the Library and when the group
of things came to the Library

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:40.590
and Ben said they were
analyzed, and we'll pull this

01:52:40.590 --> 01:52:45.840
out when we show it tomorrow,
the FBI crime lab is the people

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.570
who did the investigation.

01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:50.750
And J. Edgar Hoover,
there's correspondence,

01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:52.500
that he's very worried
about this map

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:56.670
as being a national security issue
because if it does in fact show

01:52:56.670 --> 01:53:00.670
that the Chinese or Marco Polo
or someone knew about America,

01:53:00.670 --> 01:53:03.010 position:56%
this would overturn western history,

01:53:03.010 --> 01:53:07.510
and so there's a letter here
form J. Edgar Hoover announcing

01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:10.590
that they are going to do
everything they can to study it.

01:53:10.590 --> 01:53:17.000
And so it's kind of a fascinating,
the power of maps really

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.630
in this collection, in
the Vinland collection

01:53:19.630 --> 01:53:23.770
and with Stephanie's workshops,
you can see the amazing power

01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:29.340
of these images in a cultural and
legal sense that the authenticity

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:31.440
and truth of them doesn't
really matter.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.080
It's just they have
these profound effects.

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:38.010
&gt;&gt; Ben Olshin: And we have to do
whatever we can to stop the idea

01:53:38.010 --> 01:53:43.240
that either Catholics or Chinese
came here early on obviously.

&gt;&gt; A question for Kirsten Seaver,
could you expand a little bit more

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.880
on your description of
Father Fischer's relationship

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:12.550
to the Vinland map and what motive
he might have to commit a forgery

01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:19.400
and why a researcher of his stature
would do something like that?

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:24.740
&gt;&gt; Kirsten Seaver: You mean what
propelled me to research it or?

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.780
&gt;&gt; No, I thought at the end
of your talk you implied

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:31.530
that Father Fischer was the
creator of the Vinland map.

01:54:31.530 --> 01:54:32.830

01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:35.100

What do you think his motive
might be and why would

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:46.620
such a professional researcher like
Father Fischer commit that forgery?

01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:50.550
&gt;&gt; Kirsten Seaver:
It's very difficult

01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:55.400 position:56%
to explain Father Fischer's
personality unless you have read all

01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:01.600
his writings, but essentially he
was an extremely Arodite [phonetic]

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:06.420
and at the same time naive
person, and he had a kind

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:09.290
of a fixed framework of thinking.

01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:13.560
Once he had hit upon an idea
an become convinced about it,

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:19.000
such as that the Norse had
left a cartographic trail,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.260
there was no budging him,
really no budging him.

01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:35.040
And so in his old age, he was in
a situation where he had retired.

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:40.990
The Nazis had taken over Austria
and of course Germany first.

01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:46.490
They were persecuting Catholic
priests, which is what he was,

01:55:46.490 --> 01:55:53.100
which is why he was given refuge
at Wolfegg, and they were trampling

01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:56.250
on some of the things that
were dearest to his heart,

01:55:56.250 --> 01:56:02.470
and that was the truth of
cartographic history and the Norse.

01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:08.870
I mean he knew that the Norse
were the Norse from the far north.

01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:10.830
That had nothing to
do with what was going

01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:13.140 position:56%
on in the so-called greater Germany.

01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:17.450
He was an educated
cartographic historian.

01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:22.770
Then in the mid-1930's, he
had completed his magna opus

01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:30.620 position:56%
on the Ptolemaic maps in the Vatican
library, early Ptolemaic maps,

01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:34.120
and the book was reviewed
by Leo Bogrov [phonetic],

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:39.510
who didn't like it at all, and
Fischer was absolutely crushed.

01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:44.130
This was the low point in his
life, with the Nazis without

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:47.310
and then Leo Bogrov's
review in front of him.

01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:55.470
And he got ahold of an old
manuscript that he could use,

01:56:55.470 --> 01:57:03.880
and he made in his quiet moments
of his life, he made a map,

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:09.600
which he was convinced at one
time actually existed in one form.

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.170
He never made it for sale.

01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:17.350
He had no personal property
as a Jesuit, so at some point

01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:20.350
when he died it would
have floated out there,

01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:22.560
and he was sure the Nazis
would have had to pick it

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:28.220
over in their own peculiar
fashion, and he put in this riddle.

01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:32.770

appalled had he known what happened

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:23.070
Maybe you could talk a little
bit about that tradition and also

01:58:23.070 --> 01:58:30.800
about the type of social cohesion
in a community that would coalesce

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:38.720
to pay for, hide, and contribute to
the manufacture of this vast amount

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:44.780 position:56%
of information and kind of one would
imagine in secret, I mean in secret

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:48.940
from the Mexican authorities
or the [inaudible].

01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:52.950
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Wood:
Yeah, thanks Arthur.

01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:55.860
Good to see you again.

01:58:55.860 --> 01:59:00.340
Yeah, with eight workshops we've
now identified producing maps

01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:04.080 position:56%
and manuscripts to defend indigenous
communities we know is a massive

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:10.060
tradition, and we're trying to
understand each group is unique

01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:12.780 position:56%
in itself in its approach and so on,

01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:18.070 position:56%
but we have for instance
primordial titles as they're called,

01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:22.540
which are written in indigenous
languages or which really try hard

01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:26.450
to suggest they came internally
from the communities involved,

01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:29.360
and yet because now
we've identified so many

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.140
of them we can see they
have recurring elements

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:35.760
that suggest mass production,
and yet, again,

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:40.980
a real effort to include local
detail, and the social cohesion

01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:43.850
in terms of acquiring
these kinds of things

01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:45.730
that people would come together.

01:59:45.730 --> 01:59:50.630
It was the leadership was
really a crucial element there.

01:59:50.630 --> 01:59:55.430
Leaders had sometimes benefited
personally from the stories

01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:58.500
that were told because their
ancestors would be featured.

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:05.470
Some titles include testaments of
town leaders, ancestors, and so on,

02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:09.880
so they would urge the community,
you know, this is really important,

02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:12.750
we need this, we need to
raise funds to buy this,

02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:16.400
and they were often doing that
for other purposes too, you know,

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.590
for religious festivals, so in the
Puebla-Tlaxcala area for instance,

02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:24.360
it was the fescales, the
indigenous community leaders,

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:27.010
who were associated with the
church, who were doing a lot

02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:31.050
of the fundraising I think for
buying these kinds of things.

02:00:31.050 --> 02:00:36.660
And you can just see
it in the way the town,

02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:41.070
the towns still do embrace these
even though they very often can't

02:00:41.070 --> 02:00:44.500
read them anymore, and they don't
even really know what they say.

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:46.830
There might be one or two people
who can read them and explain

02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:49.390
to the town, so I went
to [inaudible],

02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:54.020
which had that 400th anniversary
of the validity of our manuscript.

02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:57.100
I went, every couple
years they handed

02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:59.780
from one town manuscript
guardian to the next,

02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:02.700
and they have a big ceremony,
and they have a princess.

02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:07.070
And they have a long
recitation they read in Nawat

02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:09.760
that most people don't
understand it anymore.

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:13.030
And they get out, they
truck out their lienzo,

02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:14.470
and everybody walks around it.

02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:17.280
And they want the youth
to see it and know it,

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:19.650
and this is our town,
and this is our charter.

02:01:19.650 --> 02:01:20.950
And this is really important to us,

02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:25.730
and so everybody nods
and goes along with it.

02:01:25.730 --> 02:01:27.750
Anyway, and they also reject.

02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:31.870
They don't want to hear any of
the scientific analysis of it.

02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:35.860
So am sympathetic, I
really am toward them,

02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:38.680
but then I also, it's awkward.

02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:40.370
I'm not quite sure
how to deal with that.

02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:44.020
I have a book on this that I've
been developing for a long time

02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.070
because there are so many
different interesting groups,

02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:48.200
and they have such
interesting stories.

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:53.100
But I've been worried that
people will see it as an attack

02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:57.500 position:56%
on indigenous community landholding,
which I don't feel it's an attack.

02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.130
I mean some communities
will say we're very glad

02:02:00.130 --> 02:02:01.870
to know what you have
to tell us here.

02:02:01.870 --> 02:02:03.990
We don't want to be
naive either, you know,

02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:05.290
so we want to know what this is.

02:02:05.290 --> 02:02:08.650
Even if we like it, we
want to know it's origin.

02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:11.040
So that's a complicated,
roundabout answer.

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.840
I hope I got to what
you were looking for.

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.800
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: So
any final questions?

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.550
Wes?

02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:22.640
&gt;&gt; For Kirsten Seaver, you
alluded to this at the beginning,

02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.940
but I was a little confused.

02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.400
So if you could hit this again.

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:34.380
Father Fischer's manuscript was
created by him, remind us again,

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:40.240
remind us again how it was then
discovered and reintroduced

02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:46.830
into the world in the 1950's
or whenever that happened.

02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:50.800
&gt;&gt; Kirsten Seaver: Oh, you mean the
history of how it ended up at Yale.

02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:52.100
&gt;&gt; Yes.

02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:54.060
&gt;&gt; Kirsten Seaver: Now that's
a very interesting history

02:02:54.060 --> 02:03:01.710
because there was a book dealer,
an antiquarian book dealer

02:03:01.710 --> 02:03:09.000
from Massachusetts, who went
to Switzerland and linked

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:14.390
up with Italian book
dealer who had long operated

02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:19.340
in Switzerland as well as in Spain.

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:23.420
His wife was Spanish.

02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:29.630 position:56%
And picking over what was said at
the time about the purchase and what

02:03:29.630 --> 02:03:40.810 position:56%
in fact happened over time, this was
a collusion to make money, you know,

02:03:40.810 --> 02:03:44.750
sort of gradually, by
passing the manuscript

02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:49.310
on through various channels and
making it look like a coincidence

02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:53.840
that the Vinland map, the tarter
relation, and somehow the holes

02:03:53.840 --> 02:04:00.290 position:56%
in the Speculum Historiale in the
old dilapidated binding all matched.

02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:03.820
Well actually I've looked at the
thing, and there's only one hole

02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:06.510
that matches, and that
is one that looks

02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:10.370
like it's going straight
through like that.

02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:12.480
This is all very peculiar.

02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:17.640
The way in which the two
so-called sister texts ended

02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.960
up at Yale is also very
strange because it has to do

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:29.490
with antiquarian book deals that
sort of went back and forth with,

02:04:29.490 --> 02:04:33.020
you know, one person sells
it, the other one buys it

02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:37.450
and then sells it back
to the next person again,

02:04:37.450 --> 02:04:41.860
and it was all done
to make it look legit.

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:48.620
This is just a snake operation from
start to finish by the time it got

02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:51.770
out of Father Fischer's hands.

02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:55.960
My guess is that after he died

02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:02.130
and the Stella Matutina Library
was taken over by the Nazis,

02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:10.170
either a German soldier
stole it, you know,

02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:13.050
it looked like all might be money,

02:05:13.050 --> 02:05:17.610
or a liberation soldier
stole it, who knows.

02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:22.120
But in 1957, all kinds
of stuff surfaced

02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:24.420
because then the lid was off.

02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:28.230
You could then sell
loot from the war,

02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:32.430
and that's when it
all began to happen.

02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:35.110
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well,
thank you everyone

02:05:35.110 --> 02:05:36.410
for coming to the morning session.

02:05:36.410 --> 02:05:39.430
We will break for lunch
and resume back here

02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:42.510
at 1:00 for the Carta Marina.

02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:47.250
[ Applause ]

02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:50.900
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
