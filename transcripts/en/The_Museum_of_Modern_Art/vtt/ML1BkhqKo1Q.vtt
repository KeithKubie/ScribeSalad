00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
I'm a sculptor that's interested in the invention of form. I'm not primarily interested in the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.179
invention of images. If you're interested in the invention of form, you have to

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:22.930
understand where it came from, how it developed, how people put things together. When I first

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.779
went to the forge I asked if they could hammer the edge of the cube down to less than

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.439
10 millimetres. They'd never forged
anything this large before with any kind

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:45.420
of exactitude. I wanted it as tight as
possible. They said, "OK, you do it." They put a helmet on you with a hood.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:55.149
And it's a very thick asbestos suit that you're in. You look like you're going to Mars. And you have very big, high boots on

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:02.640
and your pants are covered, and your legs are covered, and you have big gloves on. And they put you in this bucket.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.799
It looks like a little caged square, with a hook on the door so you can open. And the crane's about

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.490
80 feet overhead. And then the crane
operator - you give him a signal - and he moves you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.210
into position in relation to the block. And then you take the right angle and you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.950
put it right up against the block so
you're facing the block and it's white hot.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.460
It's very, very hot. Now, at one
point I looked up at the crane operator

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.110
and I thought, "I hope he knows what he's
doing."

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.189
I think there's something about this piece
that I've wondered about: It's that we're so far

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.909
now in this century into virtual reality,
where everybody reads images through the virtual.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.009
That's one of the big problems that
art confronts right now - in fact,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.520
probably we all confront - is that the virtual denies tactility.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.579
It denies your physical presence in relationship to something other than a lighted screen.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:08.649
The nature of art has given way to
photographs and images - we receive

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.310
information through images - that we don't
receive art through our total senses in

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.569
terms of walking, looking, and experiencing,
and touching and feeling. And that's kind

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.769
of been lost.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.849
That's not to say it's not going to come
back.
