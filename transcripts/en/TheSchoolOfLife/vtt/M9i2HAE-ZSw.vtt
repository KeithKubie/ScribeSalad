00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
One of our great fears, which haunts us when we go out into the world

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.600
and socialize with others

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.400
is that we may in our hearts be really rather boring.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.300
But the good news and a fundamental truth too,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.400
is that no one is ever truly boring.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.100
They're only in danger of coming across as such

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.240
when they either fail to understand their deeper selves

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.120
or don't dare or know how to communicate them to others.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.700
That there is simply no such thing as an inherently boring person or thing

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.120
is one of the great lessons of art.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.280
Many of the most satisfying artworks don't feature exulted or rare elements.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.400
They are about the ordinary, looked at in a special way

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.780
with unusual sincerity and openness to unvarnished experience.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.260
Take for example some grasses

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.920
painted by the danish artist Christian Købke

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.700
in the suburb of copenhagen in 1833.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.940
Outwardly the scene is utterly unremarkable

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.160
and could initially appear to be deeply unpromising material for a painting

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.300
and yet, like any great artist,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.600
Købke has known how to interrogate his own perceptions

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.900
in a fresh unclouded, underivative manner

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.780
and translated them accurately into his medium,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.240
weaving a small masterpiece out of the thread of everyday life.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.220
And just as there's no such thing as a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.939
boring riverbank, tree or dandelion, so too

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.859
they can be no such thing as an inherently boring person.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.680
The human-animal witnessed in its essence

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.629
with honesty and without artifice is always interesting.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.820
When we call a person boring,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.500
we're just pointing to someone who's not had the courage

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.520
or concentration to tell us what it's like to be them.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.660
By contrast, we invariably prove compelling

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.880
when we succeed in saying

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.320
how and what we truly desire, envy, regret mourn and dream.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.720
Anyone who faithfully recuperates the real data on what it's like to exist,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.840
is guaranteed to have material with which to captivate others.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.560
The interesting person

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.460
isn't someone to whom obviously and outwardly interesting things have happened:

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.020
someone who's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.560
traveled the world, met important dignitaries

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.540
or been present at large geopolitical events.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.400
Nor is it someone who speaks in learned terms

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.980
about the weighty themes of culture, history or science.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.100
There's someone who's grown into an attentive, self-aware listener

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.600
and a reliable, honest correspondent

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.200
of the tremors of their own mind and heart

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.280
and who can thereby give us faithful accounts

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.660
the pathos, drama and strangeness of being alive.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300
What then are some of the elements

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.520
that get in the way of us being as interesting

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.740
as we in fact are?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.740
Firstly and most crucially, we bore when we lose faith

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.820
that it really could be our feelings

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.340
that would stand the best chance of interesting others.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.300
Out of modesty and habit

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.820
we push some of our most interesting perceptions to one side,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.740
in order to follow respectable but dead conventions of what might impress.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.200
When we tell anecdotes we throw the emphasis on the outward details:

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.640
who was there, when we went, what the temperature was like

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.460
rather than maintaining our nerve

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.000
to report on the layer of feelings beneath the facts.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.080
The moment of guilt, the sudden sexual attraction,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.740
the humiliating sulk,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.780
the carreer crisis, the strange euforia at 3 a.m.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.020
Our neglect of our native feelings isn't just an oversight,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.620
it can be a deliberate strategy to keep our minds away from realizations

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.880
that threaten our ideas of dignity and normality.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.500
We babble inconsequentially to the world

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.020
because we lack the nerve

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.740
to look more closely and unflinchingly within.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.100
It feels significant that most five-year-olds are far less boring

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.140
than most 45-year-olds.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.100
What makes these children gripping

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.700
is not so much that they have more interesting feelings than anyone else,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700
far from it,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.440
but that they are especially uncensored correspondents of these feelings.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.400
Their inexperience of the world

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.740
means they are still instinctively loyal to themselves

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.600
and so they will candidly tell us what they really think

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.700
about Granny and their little brother,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.300
what their plans for reforming the planet are

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.380
and what they believe everyone should do with their boogies.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.680
We are rendered boring not by nature so much as by a fateful will

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.800
that begins its malevolent reign over us in adolescence to appear normal.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.440
Yet, even when we're honest about our feelings

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.800
we may still prove boring because we don't know them as well as we should,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.120
and so we get stuck at the level of insisting on an emotion

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.140
rather than explaining it.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.320
We'll assert with ever greater emphasis

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.500
that a situation was extremely exciting, or awful, or beautiful,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.700
but not be able to provide those around us

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.800
with any of the sort of related details and examples

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.649
that would help them viscerally understand why.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.220
We can end up boring,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.960
not so much because we don't want to share our lives,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.580
as because we don't yet know them well enough to do so.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.100
Fortunately, the gift of being interesting

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.700
is neither exclusive nor reliant on exceptional talent.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.540
It requires only direction, honesty and focus.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.100
The person we call interesting is in essence

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.260
someone alive to what we all deeply want from social intercourse,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.200
which is an uncensored glimpse

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.920
of what the brief waking dream called life

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.720
looks like through the eyes of another person,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.980
and reassurance we are not entirely alone

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.280
with all that feels most bewildering,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.620
peculiar and intense within us.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.220
 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.360
