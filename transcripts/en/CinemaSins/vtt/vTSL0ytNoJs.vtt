00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.959
Why is DC Comics a sin?
Oh, I can't answer that one.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:19.959
You can't even explain a little bit?
No. All I can say is that if it makes you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.730
laugh, then why does it matter? And if it
doesn't make you laugh, you're probably part

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.730
of the reason the other people are laughing.
Where is that f*cking wizard music video you've

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.610
been promising us for over two months?
Okay, this one's my bad, alright? I got excited

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.070
and I started teasing early, before I realized,
like, post production and color correcting

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.610
and effects and stuff in the real world can
actually take some time. So that's my fault.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.580
All on me.
So it is coming?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.580
Yeah, yeah. It'll be here next month. July
for sure. You can book it, write it down.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.740
Will you tell us what it's about?
I can't tell you that. I mean, all I can say

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.610
is that it's based on something said in one
of our previous videos, and it's one of the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.320
most pointless things we've ever made.
Awesome. Is it at least going to be worth

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.760
all the hype? All the build-up?
Oh, no. Certainly not. Like, that would be

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.760
impossible at this point. It looks good, because
we hired a pro to shoot it, but nobody asked

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.130
for this. Nobody would ever have asked for
this.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.130
Are you and Honest Trailers connected?
No. Only in mutual admiration, and we're both

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.010
channels that make fun of movies. And we both
like boobs.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.340
Your channel is about to pass 500,000 subscribers.
How the hell did you get so many subs so quickly?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.640
That's it? That's all you got?
Well, how the f*ck do I know how it happened?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.060
You think if I knew how it happened I wouldn't
have done it sooner? I mean, it happened,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.830
and yeah, I'm pretty happy about it. I'm gonna
run with that sh*t. But f*ck if I know how

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.830
it happened.
500,000. That's really a lot of people. Like,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.080
you have half a million fans.
Eh, they clicked a button.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.130
That button click represents more than just
a click, that's their endorsement of you,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.910
they're saying, "We like you, we want to see
more of your content."

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.430
Don't you want to show them you appreciate
that? Don't you want to let them know that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.470
without them you'd be nothing?
The fans?

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.489
Don't you want to say, "Thank you?"
You know I'm not really a "thank you" kind

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.520
of guy.
They know that, dude. That's exactly why it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.520
will matter if you actually said it.
Thank you.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.730
Well, that was memorable.
Well, don't ask a cat to bark and then be

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.579
upset when it meows. Think fast.
