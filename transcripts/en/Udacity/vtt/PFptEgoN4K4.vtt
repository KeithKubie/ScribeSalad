00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.370
The solution for this equation is 5 halves, or two and a half. Nice work if you

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.942
got this one right. Again, we want to use the key idea of rewriting these with

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:16.787
the same base. I know 4 is 2 squared and I know 32 is 2 raised to the 5th. So,

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:21.104
now I'm working towards having the same base. I want to combine these exponents

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:26.190
by multiplying. So, I'll have 2 to the 2x equals 2 to the 5th. I have 2 raised

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.048
to the 2x and 2 raised to the 5th. These must be equal, so I know that the

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:38.031
exponents have to be equal, since the bases are the same. So, we'll have 2x set

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:45.128
equal to 5. dividing both sides by 2 we find x is equal to 5 by 2
