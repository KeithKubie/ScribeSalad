00:00:00.181 --> 00:00:01.828
- Hey everyone its Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:05.967
I am in Manila and one of the
best places to eat in Manila

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.927
one of the most famous
places for food is Chinatown.

00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:10.923
And in Manila it's called Binondo

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:14.963
and so today I'm going to
take you on a tour of Binondo

00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:18.297
we're gonna eat some delicious
Chinese-Filipino food

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:22.191
and just walk around and
explore this vibrant,

00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:26.358
and very interesting and
fascinating area of Manila.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.903
(upbeat music)

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:40.506
On our way first this morning
to eat some dumplings.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.256
Oh, hello fish bowls.

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:48.151
First place that we've come is

00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.266
called Dong Bei Dumpling House.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.723
This place is legendary
for their dumplings

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:54.460
and they're, I can't
think of a better way to

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.596
start the morning than
with a plate of dumplings.

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:59.917
And so i just ordered
a plate of their famous

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.500
kuchay and also pork dumplings.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:05.548
And you just walk into this restaurant

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:09.434
and you can just smell the
aroma of chives and pork.

00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:10.475
I was gonna eat inside,

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:13.048
but actually they're playing
kind of loud music in there

00:01:13.048 --> 00:01:15.336
so I decided to just get it for take-away

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:17.817
and it's hot and fresh and steaming.

00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:22.631
I added some chili oil they
are still hot and steaming.

00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:25.964
Oh yes fresh dumplings are hard to beat.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.810
Oh and I already added a
little bit of chili oil

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.113
uhm and then it's also served with I think

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:36.272
it's probably I think it's vinegar.

00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:38.765
Usually these little
sauce bags one of the best

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:42.432
methods to opening them
is to bite the tail.

00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:44.999
So that you get a little bit

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.771
oh that was like some air was released

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:51.964
that's very fragrant and garlicky.

00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:53.646
Alright oh perfect.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.391
I think this is if I can
taste those fumes alright

00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:59.632
I think this is vinegar and
maybe soy sauce and garlic.

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:02.034
Okay perfect I'm going right for that

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:04.117
top dumpling right there.

00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.778
Oh that's so fresh and
so good and so juicy.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.965
The wrapper has a little bit
of a gummy texture to it,

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.173
but what I like is that it's not too thick

00:02:24.173 --> 00:02:28.747
and it's not too thin it's
right at that medium thickness.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.237
So you can taste that
you're eating noodle,

00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:33.422
but at the same time
it's not overly starchy.

00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:35.221
And then the inside just
kind of explodes with

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.689
that juice that pork, those chives

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.439
you want to soak up as
much sauce as you can.

00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:50.782
These are the type of dumplings
you can eat a whole plate

00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:52.822
just in seconds without even knowing it,

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.351
without even thinking
about it they're so good.

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.735
And as much as I'd love
to go have another plate

00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:01.902
I think I'm gonna pace myself
today for this food tour.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.007
Something interesting about Binondo that

00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:09.812
I really wanted to share with you

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:12.308
is that it is one of the oldest if not the

00:03:12.308 --> 00:03:15.744
oldest established
Chinatown's in the world.

00:03:15.744 --> 00:03:18.797
And it dates back to
1594 when the Spaniards

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:22.937
set this area apart as
an area for the Chinese

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:27.067
to settle which is across
the river the Pasig River

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:30.110
from Intramuros which is the Spanish area

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.564
of colonial rule in
Manila in the Philippines.

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:34.323
We've only been walking
around for a little bit,

00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:37.636
but Mika is getting
hungry so we've decided

00:03:37.636 --> 00:03:40.574
to stop off and eat lunch, an early lunch.

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:43.556
This is a whole strip of restaurants which

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.500
is right along the canal.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.530
They have all sorts of Chinese food,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.326
Chinese-Filipino food here
you can order seafood,

00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:51.999
you can order lots of stir-fry dishes

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.447
and then I was watching
him as he cooks and

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:55.614
he is a master at the wok.

00:03:56.588 --> 00:03:58.758
Igniting the oil and the sauces

00:03:58.758 --> 00:04:00.812
and then just putting
all the dishes together

00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:03.283
I ordered a couple of different dishes

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:04.969
one of the things that I
really wanted to try here

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.437
is their fried frog legs.

00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:07.883
So I got the fried frog legs.

00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:10.510
They're also known for
their buttered chicken

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.962
which I have no idea the only
buttered chicken I know of

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.455
is Indian-styled buttered chicken.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.860
So this is gonna be a first for me

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.388
and then I also got a dish
of stir-fried vegetables

00:04:20.388 --> 00:04:23.655
with seafood and then
also it's squid which is

00:04:23.655 --> 00:04:26.698
stuffed with I think
it's stuffed with chives.

00:04:26.698 --> 00:04:29.644
So let's start with the
fried frog legs since they're

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.091
sitting right before me.

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:32.526
Here's a nice leg down here and it is

00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:36.016
breaded, coated and then deep-fried.

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:38.599
Going in just like a drumstick.

00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:44.523
Oh the bone came off with that pull

00:04:44.523 --> 00:04:46.773
oh wow that's pretty salty.

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:51.963
Very salty and quite oily,
but really, really crispy.

00:04:53.508 --> 00:04:57.115
And it has that crispiness
that sort of tastes like

00:04:57.115 --> 00:05:00.616
maybe cornstarch rather than just flour.

00:05:00.616 --> 00:05:04.121
It sort of has a grainy crispiness to it.

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:06.239
Next up I'm gonna try the stuffed squid

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:09.542
and you just check out this cross section.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:13.292
It's just filled with
oh that sauce is gooey.

00:05:16.153 --> 00:05:17.988
That tastes almost exactly how it looks.

00:05:17.988 --> 00:05:21.766
You've got the tender,
yet slightly rubbery squid

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:24.048
and then yeah those are definitely chives

00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:27.013
they have the chewy texture to them and

00:05:27.013 --> 00:05:29.412
really, really fragrant and really juicy.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.585
One of their specialties
here is the buttered chicken

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:34.777
and ooh is that butter
on the bottom there?

00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:37.704
There's a little pool of
something on the bottom there

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:41.787
and I can see garlic and
that must be the butter.

00:05:45.176 --> 00:05:47.064
Let me go in for a little
bit more of that butter sauce

00:05:47.064 --> 00:05:48.513
if I'm gonna eat butter chicken

00:05:48.513 --> 00:05:51.664
I don't want to skimp on that sauce.

00:05:51.664 --> 00:05:54.414
Oh yeah that looks pretty buttery

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:01.420
and that appears to be garlic as well.

00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:03.869
Alright.

00:06:09.623 --> 00:06:12.206
Yeah, that is extremely buttery

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.893
fried chicken soaked in butter.

00:06:20.788 --> 00:06:23.121
Let's just say if you love butter

00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:24.328
you're gonna love this dish.

00:06:24.328 --> 00:06:26.815
And then the final dish
is the mixed vegetables

00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:28.826
with seafood there is shrimp in here

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:33.018
there are there might be some
or maybe it's mostly shrimp,

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.305
but there might be some squid in here,

00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:37.305
yeah little pieces of squid as well.

00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:42.779
That's good and simple
not too salty actually

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.355
the vegetables are not too salty.

00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:46.474
Their style of cooking is very saucy

00:06:46.474 --> 00:06:49.313
so its almost like a soup of sauce.

00:06:49.313 --> 00:06:50.815
I'm gonna grab another piece of frog and

00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:52.821
this time I'll dip it into this tomato

00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.571
or maybe chili sauce.

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.105
Oh I can eat that whole piece despite

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:02.402
there being bones in it.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:03.805
That's like a sweet and sour sauce

00:07:03.805 --> 00:07:04.941
that does go well together because

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.124
it kind of cuts the saltiness of the frog.

00:07:08.124 --> 00:07:10.727
The food was okay I didn't really like the

00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:12.347
fried dishes that much as they were

00:07:12.347 --> 00:07:14.627
pretty oily and heavy on the breading

00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:17.294
and the ingredients didn't
taste all that fresh,

00:07:17.294 --> 00:07:20.461
but it was a nice enough place to sit.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:25.607
I like the breezy
environment under the tree.

00:07:25.607 --> 00:07:27.681
We are now off to walk around and explore

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:30.654
more of Binondo hopefully get some snacks.

00:07:30.654 --> 00:07:33.737
And actually I would just like
to say that Binondo is such a

00:07:33.737 --> 00:07:37.303
nice place to explore it's
actually very charming.

00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:39.742
And it has a, oh I gotta move,

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:42.281
whoa that's a lot of mung bean noodles,

00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:46.179
but it's very charming it has a really

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:48.968
friendly nice feel to it

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.941
and it's actually quite, at
least this time that we're here

00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:54.608
it's quite calm and not too busy

00:07:55.935 --> 00:07:58.352
and it's quite clean as well.

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.069
Uh just a normal market

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:08.236
I came in here mostly to
get their signature hopia.

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:11.681
Which one is their signature one?

00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:15.297
The hopia, alright this
is what I'm getting

00:08:15.297 --> 00:08:18.040
right here with mung bean pastry.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.612
Actually Ying bought quite a few snacks,

00:08:20.612 --> 00:08:25.534
but I just went straight for
their classic mung bean hopia.

00:08:25.534 --> 00:08:29.367
And it is heavy you can
feel how solid that is

00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:32.826
wrapped in paper you could lift weights

00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:35.076
with this mung bean pastry.

00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:42.746
I didn't grab a,

00:08:42.746 --> 00:08:44.924
oh it's cut into pieces already okay.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:47.836
Here we go they're like
into little hockey pucks.

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:49.339
I almost took a bite, I barely noticed

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:50.926
the little wax paper on the bottom

00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:53.873
which I'm assuming you don't eat

00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:56.373
let me pull of that wax paper.

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:13.342
It's a little bit dry and very dense

00:09:15.641 --> 00:09:16.895
oh it's good though.

00:09:16.895 --> 00:09:20.448
The mashed up mung beans
on the inside which are

00:09:20.448 --> 00:09:23.830
sweet and starchy it's kind of like

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.663
a really heavy cookie.

00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:31.376
It kind of has that texture,

00:09:31.376 --> 00:09:34.452
kind of that sticky texture
kind of like peanut butter

00:09:34.452 --> 00:09:35.695
where it kind of sticks to the roof

00:09:35.695 --> 00:09:38.404
of your mouth a little bit.

00:09:38.404 --> 00:09:40.022
It's kind of hard to talk.

00:09:40.022 --> 00:09:41.297
- Hi it is so nice to see you

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:43.305
I'm a fan of your channel.

00:09:43.305 --> 00:09:44.519
- Thank you
Thank you.

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.047
Are you from Manila?

00:09:46.047 --> 00:09:47.877
- Yes I am from Manila from Binondo.

00:09:47.877 --> 00:09:50.378
- We were just eating
that pastry at Ho-Land

00:09:50.378 --> 00:09:51.395
and met up with Nathan.

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:52.228
- [Nathan] Hello.

00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:53.061
- What's up Nathan?

00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:53.894
- [Nathan] Hi

00:09:53.894 --> 00:09:54.727
- And you live in Binondo?

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.560
- I live right over there.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.886
- Cool, cool and so he
is accompanying us to our

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:00.386
next place to eat.

00:10:06.862 --> 00:10:08.408
- [Mark] So this is called New

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:09.397
- [Nathan] New Po Heng.

00:10:09.397 --> 00:10:13.057
- New Po Heng and these are actually

00:10:13.057 --> 00:10:16.320
like the size of mini
burritos they're pretty big.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.472
There are a number of
different things in here

00:10:19.472 --> 00:10:23.222
she added I saw lettuce,
I saw peanut powder,

00:10:24.526 --> 00:10:26.835
what was the darker powder?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.343
- [Nathan] Oh that is seaweed (inaudible)

00:10:29.343 --> 00:10:31.544
- Seaweed okay like dried seaweed powder?

00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:32.548
- Mhmm.

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:35.097
- And then the main vegetable mixture is?

00:10:35.097 --> 00:10:36.911
- Cabbage and bean curd and carrots.

00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:38.254
- [Mark] Cabbage and
bean curds and carrots.

00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:40.591
Okay and so then they wrap it up into this

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.268
and it's all vegetarian as well.

00:10:42.268 --> 00:10:46.185
So it's all vegetarian
it's a pretty good size.

00:10:47.704 --> 00:10:49.938
Let's take a look at the cross section

00:10:49.938 --> 00:10:52.942
oh wow look at all those vegetables

00:10:52.942 --> 00:10:54.882
alright Nathan squeeze some sauce

00:10:54.882 --> 00:10:57.132
on oh it's very like thick.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.437
More?
Uh that's okay.

00:11:02.874 --> 00:11:07.041
- This sauce it almost has
the consistency of honey.

00:11:09.463 --> 00:11:11.630
Alright cheers man.
Cheers.

00:11:19.924 --> 00:11:22.786
Oh yeah, really just
packed full of vegetables

00:11:22.786 --> 00:11:26.953
it has that very contrast
of salty to sweet to it.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.013
There I think the peanut
powder is a little sweet

00:11:31.013 --> 00:11:34.300
and then also the sauce
yeah it tastes like

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.836
peanut butter like a dry
crumbly peanut butter

00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:39.846
and then also the sauce its sweet,

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:44.013
but then the vegetable mixture
is more on the salty side.

00:11:49.204 --> 00:11:51.491
This is a Chinese type
of fresh spring roll

00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:52.864
and they have it all
across Southeast Asia.

00:11:52.864 --> 00:11:56.318
I've had it in Singapore
and Thailand popiah,

00:11:56.318 --> 00:11:59.301
but I have to say that this
is one of the best versions

00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:01.245
I've ever had the ingredients,

00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:04.828
the balance of flavor,
really, really nice.

00:12:15.746 --> 00:12:17.438
Okay next up we are
walking along with Nathan

00:12:17.438 --> 00:12:18.807
and his fiancee I think we're gonna

00:12:18.807 --> 00:12:21.890
go get some fried buns, fried siopao.

00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:34.274
This place has no name

00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:37.191
so luckily Nathan escorted us here

00:12:38.881 --> 00:12:41.731
and they have a lot of Chinese snacks and

00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:46.443
different little dessert and
shumai and different things,

00:12:46.443 --> 00:12:49.205
but we came here mainly for the baos

00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:50.673
and you can actually feel in that bag

00:12:50.673 --> 00:12:54.256
how kind of fluffy and
how soft the bun is.

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:02.292
Mmmm.

00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:08.154
Wow that is awesomely
good, that is delicious.

00:13:10.477 --> 00:13:14.144
The bread is so pillowy,
so airy and pillowy

00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:18.640
and then it has some
water chestnuts in there

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.416
I can taste the crunchiness
of the water chestnuts.

00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:23.424
There are some green onions in there,

00:13:23.424 --> 00:13:27.591
it has a sesame flavor and a
black pepper flavor as well.

00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:33.768
Even though it looks kind of big,

00:13:33.768 --> 00:13:35.626
it's so fluffy that you
can eat the whole thing

00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:36.860
in a couple of bites.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.292
And I love that layer
between meat and bread

00:13:40.292 --> 00:13:41.845
where it's kind of gooey and

00:13:41.845 --> 00:13:44.512
just absorbed all of the flavor.

00:13:52.113 --> 00:13:55.558
One of the most legendary
or maybe infamous dishes

00:13:55.558 --> 00:13:58.517
that you have to eat
when you come to Binondo,

00:13:58.517 --> 00:14:01.097
oh you don't really have to eat it.

00:14:01.097 --> 00:14:03.681
It's called soup number five we got two

00:14:03.681 --> 00:14:07.836
different soups one of
them is black chicken soup

00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:10.406
and that is not the soup number five.

00:14:10.406 --> 00:14:12.750
This one is the soup number five,

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.393
but the black chicken
soup also looks awesome

00:14:14.393 --> 00:14:16.376
and it smells delicious.

00:14:16.376 --> 00:14:19.543
This is the legendary soup number five

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.460
which is a cow or bull, is it bull?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.649
- [Nathan] Bull.

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:27.239
- Okay bull penis and bull testicles

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:30.672
and that whole kind of region chopped up

00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:33.233
into bite sized pieces
and made into a soup.

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:36.927
So this is very famous in Binondo to eat.

00:14:36.927 --> 00:14:38.362
Alright, and can you get this in

00:14:38.362 --> 00:14:39.377
other parts of Manila as well or

00:14:39.377 --> 00:14:40.898
is this mostly in Binondo?

00:14:40.898 --> 00:14:43.058
- I've always had it in Binondo

00:14:43.058 --> 00:14:45.769
I'm not sure if it's
available somewhere else.

00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:50.487
- Okay, there's some ginger,
there's some go gi berries,

00:14:50.487 --> 00:14:53.904
and it has, it smells very like cinnamon.

00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:01.023
It has a cinnamon aroma to it and

00:15:01.023 --> 00:15:03.690
very Chinese herbal aroma to it.

00:15:08.452 --> 00:15:11.386
Wow it's really, really good.

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:12.498
Oh it's really, really good.

00:15:12.498 --> 00:15:15.903
It's like, it tastes
like concentrated herbs

00:15:15.903 --> 00:15:20.404
it kind of tastes like
a Chinese braised soup,

00:15:20.404 --> 00:15:23.448
braised flavor and then
should we go in for

00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:27.615
some parts next okay lets
take it right off that spoon.

00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.317
And so you can eat that
whole thing right there,

00:15:31.317 --> 00:15:33.543
there's no bones or anything in it.

00:15:33.543 --> 00:15:37.043
Alright, oh wow they are kind of slippery.

00:15:40.843 --> 00:15:43.176
Alright, cheers man.
Cheers.

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.010
It's really, really good.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.377
It's actually the texture
is exactly like tendon.

00:15:53.377 --> 00:15:54.728
- Tendon, yeah.

00:15:54.728 --> 00:15:57.732
- It's gelatinous, but at the same time

00:15:57.732 --> 00:16:00.565
it's not chewy kind of like gummy.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:06.755
The parts are good, but
that broth is insane

00:16:07.803 --> 00:16:11.323
it's so flavorful you can just taste

00:16:11.323 --> 00:16:14.340
how it's just packed with herbs.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.098
Let's go on to the
black chicken soup next.

00:16:17.098 --> 00:16:19.181
I'm going for that broth,

00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:24.621
so is this a half, wow
that's just a tiny chicken

00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:28.062
it's almost like the size
of a quail look at that.

00:16:28.062 --> 00:16:29.664
- [Nathan] It's black.

00:16:29.664 --> 00:16:33.786
- [Mark] And it is black
alright lets taste the broth

00:16:33.786 --> 00:16:37.573
and also black chicken is
supposed to be very healthy right?

00:16:37.573 --> 00:16:38.406
- Yes.

00:16:41.795 --> 00:16:43.478
- It almost tastes like
caramel when you have

00:16:43.478 --> 00:16:45.887
that aftertaste, do you
know what that could be?

00:16:45.887 --> 00:16:47.126
- [Nathan] I'm not sure what that is.

00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:50.905
- Okay, but a black
chicken is supposed to be

00:16:50.905 --> 00:16:54.066
a cure all in Chinese culture right?

00:16:54.066 --> 00:16:55.899
Cure all for anything.

00:16:57.112 --> 00:17:00.612
Actually lets just go in with our fingers.

00:17:06.974 --> 00:17:09.391
Oh that's like really creamy.

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:16.972
It's incredibly delicious, it's so tender

00:17:16.972 --> 00:17:18.587
you know it's probably
been boiled for so long

00:17:18.587 --> 00:17:20.233
that it just slips off the bone.

00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:22.900
Look how clean that bone came off

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.502
with the cartilage and all.

00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:30.190
You can eat the cartilage
and all its very tender.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.349
Do you think the black
chicken has a different

00:17:32.349 --> 00:17:33.182
- Flavor?

00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:34.015
- Flavor I guess.

00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:34.848
- A little.

00:17:34.848 --> 00:17:36.213
- It's a little bit of a different flavor

00:17:36.213 --> 00:17:37.071
- Slightly gamier.

00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:39.498
- Slightly gamier, but
you can definitely taste

00:17:39.498 --> 00:17:42.393
that it is chicken though.

00:17:42.393 --> 00:17:45.068
It kind of has that
taste of a quail though.

00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:46.267
- Or a pigeon.

00:17:46.267 --> 00:17:47.434
- Or a pigeon.

00:17:49.181 --> 00:17:53.348
I'm gonna go in for another
bit of the gelatin goodness.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.757
It's really good I'm actually

00:18:04.757 --> 00:18:07.035
hugely impressed by soup number five.

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:08.602
Of everything I've eaten so far on this

00:18:08.602 --> 00:18:12.511
Binondo, Manila food
tour- soup number five

00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.930
this is by far my favorite dish so far.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.522
It's so good, it's so herbal.

00:18:17.522 --> 00:18:20.272
This is my last piece right here.

00:18:23.632 --> 00:18:26.941
That's one of the crunchy pieces

00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:28.243
you get some many different textures

00:18:28.243 --> 00:18:30.747
some parts are very gelatinous and

00:18:30.747 --> 00:18:32.918
soft all the way through like tendons,

00:18:32.918 --> 00:18:35.751
but some are crunchy like you know

00:18:37.832 --> 00:18:39.972
when you eat a gizzard
it has the same kind of

00:18:39.972 --> 00:18:43.576
crunch that kind of like weird crunch.

00:18:43.576 --> 00:18:44.409
Thank you.

00:18:45.487 --> 00:18:48.130
Don't let the ingredients
of soup number five

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.403
through you off.

00:18:49.403 --> 00:18:51.875
It's truly a winner of a soup.

00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:53.594
I thoroughly enjoyed that.

00:18:53.594 --> 00:18:56.364
And I'm feeling very
strong and very healthy

00:18:56.364 --> 00:18:58.531
after eating that as well.

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:09.271
(speaking Filipino)

00:19:14.148 --> 00:19:17.513
This is just a really small
restaurant on the corner

00:19:17.513 --> 00:19:18.842
and what's the name of this place?

00:19:18.842 --> 00:19:19.718
- 899.

00:19:19.718 --> 00:19:22.646
- 899, what are we gonna eat here Nathan?

00:19:22.646 --> 00:19:24.588
- [Nathan] Uh, pork tongue
Pork tongue.

00:19:24.588 --> 00:19:26.335
And large and small intestines.

00:19:26.335 --> 00:19:28.460
- Awesome and it's braised?

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.710
- It's braised.

00:19:37.044 --> 00:19:39.180
- Oh nice the tongue so it's braised,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.472
it's sitting at the front
and then you order it

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.594
and they just slice it
into bite sized pieces.

00:19:43.594 --> 00:19:45.674
What's in the sauce?

00:19:45.674 --> 00:19:48.737
- It's soy sauce, vinegar,
black vinegar and garlic.

00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:51.070
- Oh okay, it looks amazing.

00:19:53.897 --> 00:19:58.064
Just look at how meaty and and
how beautiful that tongue is.

00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:05.235
Oh wow, yeah that is amazing.

00:20:08.344 --> 00:20:11.454
Tongue is just such a
wonderful is it a meat?

00:20:11.454 --> 00:20:12.384
Yeah it's a meat.

00:20:12.384 --> 00:20:15.717
It's tender, but it's not overly tender,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.727
but it has a little bit of texture to it.

00:20:19.727 --> 00:20:22.967
It's not like stringy
or anything like that

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:27.096
it doesn't have any
kind of bizarre about it

00:20:27.096 --> 00:20:28.380
being the tongue at all.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.991
It just tastes like really
the best of the best of meat.

00:20:31.991 --> 00:20:36.158
Really tender, fleshy its
a nice salty braised flavor

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.427
that they have on it and with
that vinegar garlic sauce.

00:20:44.717 --> 00:20:48.884
Oh wow, that is like a world
class snack right there.

00:20:50.788 --> 00:20:54.288
(woman speaking Filipino)

00:20:55.862 --> 00:20:57.961
Oh and here comes the large intestines and

00:20:57.961 --> 00:21:02.018
the small intestines they
look like little shoots

00:21:02.018 --> 00:21:03.443
and yeah you can definelty tell the

00:21:03.443 --> 00:21:04.634
difference between the two.

00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:07.157
These ones are much smaller in size.

00:21:07.157 --> 00:21:09.975
Let's start with the small ones.

00:21:09.975 --> 00:21:10.827
- [Nathan] The small ones.

00:21:10.827 --> 00:21:12.026
- Small intestines
these are my favorite.

00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:15.026
That little shoot, that little hose.

00:21:16.964 --> 00:21:20.169
You wanna get some good sauce on this,

00:21:20.169 --> 00:21:21.836
how's that- oh yeah.

00:21:22.932 --> 00:21:25.515
They're not even rubbery though

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:31.091
they are very tender, very, very tender.

00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:34.508
Very, very kind of smooth they have more.

00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:39.002
I can't stop, it's
something you can't stop

00:21:39.002 --> 00:21:42.240
you just want to keep on eating it.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.971
And they are well cleaned as well

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:48.869
so you don't have any
kind of foul taste at all

00:21:48.869 --> 00:21:51.029
they're just really well cleaned.

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:52.745
Look at that, that's almost like a

00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:56.245
yeah you can actually see through the hole

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.137
okay let's dip that.

00:22:07.024 --> 00:22:10.607
Wow, that's also
delicious it has a totally

00:22:11.452 --> 00:22:12.996
different texture while
the small intestines

00:22:12.996 --> 00:22:15.938
are more of a little rubbery

00:22:15.938 --> 00:22:19.905
the big intestines are
kind of creamy and fattier.

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.168
It's a little fattier.

00:22:21.168 --> 00:22:23.403
Mika we finished off
all of those intestines

00:22:23.403 --> 00:22:24.736
and that tongue.

00:22:28.344 --> 00:22:29.879
Thank you very much.

00:22:29.879 --> 00:22:32.462
That was very good, thank you.

00:22:35.431 --> 00:22:37.826
After finishing all that
food on that Binondo

00:22:37.826 --> 00:22:40.019
Filipino Chinese food
tour we just came back

00:22:40.019 --> 00:22:42.903
to this is an apartment
that Ying and I are

00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:46.249
renting here in Manila that was an amazing

00:22:46.249 --> 00:22:49.492
food tour and it was great to

00:22:49.492 --> 00:22:51.276
it was actually completely random

00:22:51.276 --> 00:22:54.035
Ying and I went to Binondo this morning

00:22:54.035 --> 00:22:55.343
and I just had a list of restaurants

00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:56.648
and places that I wanted to go and

00:22:56.648 --> 00:22:58.077
we were gonna just kind of walk around and

00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:01.043
explore and find things out on our own,

00:23:01.043 --> 00:23:04.250
but luckily we bumped into Nathan and

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.577
completely by chance and
not only is he from Manila,

00:23:07.577 --> 00:23:09.423
but he's from right in Binondo.

00:23:09.423 --> 00:23:12.350
So he knows everywhere in Binondo

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.400
so he took us to some
special spots that he likes,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.296
uh and I have to admit soup number five

00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:22.994
was the best thing of the whole day.

00:23:22.994 --> 00:23:24.928
That was my favorite food of the whole day

00:23:24.928 --> 00:23:28.224
so when you're in Manila don't forget and

00:23:28.224 --> 00:23:31.557
don't miss taking a food tour in Binondo

00:23:34.602 --> 00:23:36.740
and it's a great place to visit.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.375
