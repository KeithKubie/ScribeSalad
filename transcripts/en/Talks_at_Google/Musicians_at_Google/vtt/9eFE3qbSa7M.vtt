RYAN LOREN: Welcome,
Avery Sunshine, to Google.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.200
It's so good to
have you here today.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.227
I'm so glad to be here.

00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:06.060
AVERY SUNSHINE: Yes.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.401
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE].

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:08.742
AVERY SUNSHINE: How you doing?

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.360
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.860
I'm sorry.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.200
RYAN LOREN: No.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.000
AVERY SUNSHINE: I'm
so out of order.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.870
I'm so out of order.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.017
I'm so excited.

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:13.850
Well, you know that.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.073
You know I'm excited.

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:16.239
RYAN LOREN: I'm excited too.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.070
AVERY SUNSHINE: This is huge.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.900
RYAN LOREN: This is going
to be a great night.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.030
AVERY SUNSHINE: Yes, it is.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.280
RYAN LOREN: Just wanted to
have a little chat with you

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.260
before we get started.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.330
So, Avery Sunshine.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.105
This is your name.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:28.230
AVERY SUNSHINE: [LAUGHING].

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.370
RYAN LOREN: Can you
tell us about your name?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.760
AVERY SUNSHINE: Well, my
name-- this is so funny.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.135
My partner-- I don't know why
he's not in here right now.

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:35.800
Dana, wherever he is.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.760
But Dana and I, we
worked on-- I never

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.270
thought I was going
to be an artist.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.920
I didn't think I
sang well enough,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.600
or I was talented
enough to be an artist.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.810
And Dana was like no,
listen, listen, listen.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.290
I think you've got something.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.400
Let's just start writing
and see what happens.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.025
So the first song we wrote, and
we're going to sing it tonight,

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.630
the song is called "Stalker."

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.825
And I know.

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:57.325
I know.

00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:58.230
I know.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.220
But I wrote the hook.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.520
And I said, Dana, I'm going
to send you this hook.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.769
I can't get you out my
mind, and all this stuff.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.232
Just good stuff.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.400
I'm not the kind of
girl who'd stalk you,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
but I might call you over
and over and over again.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.380
So we wrote the song.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.210
And a good friend of
his was a house DJ.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.540
And he wanted to remix it.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.190
And he did, and it was amazing.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.780
And he said, OK, we're
about to put the record out.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.900
Who do you want to be?

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.436
I was like, what's that mean?

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:29.394
He was like, well, no
you can change your name.

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:32.628
I was like what's wrong
with Denise White.

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:33.504
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING].

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:35.294
AVERY SUNSHINE: Everybody
was like, there's

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.150
nothing wrong with
Denise White, but you

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.960
could do something
else if you wanted to.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.400
And I blurted out,
Avery Sunshine.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.219
And it's so funny.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.760
When I tell you I never thought
about being an artist before,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.510
I hadn't.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.050
At least I didn't think I had.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.050
And I think it comes from
my love two characters.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.370
First character is Shug Avery
from "The Color Purple."

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.310
And then the other character is
Sunshine from "Harlem Nights."

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.570
He'd throw it up in the air
and it would to sunshine.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.810
It's all adults in here, right?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.491
There's no children here..

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.449
But if you don't know
what we're talking about,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.765
please rent "Harlem
Nights," so you

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.017
know what I'm talking about.

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:14.600
In no way am I-- or
whatever the case.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.150
But that's how I got the name.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.460
Just blurted it out.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.770
RYAN LOREN: Well, it suits you.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.853
AVERY SUNSHINE: Thank you.

00:02:19.853 --> 00:02:20.915
RYAN LOREN: Really well.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:23.087
You know, you have an energy
that's contagious ever

00:02:23.087 --> 00:02:23.834
since I met you.

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:25.000
AVERY SUNSHINE: It's coffee.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.620
RYAN LOREN: Is it coffee?

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.530
I was going to ask.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.820
I know you've got kids.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.060
I know you're always upbeat.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.770
Is it coffee?

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.540
AVERY SUNSHINE: It's coffee.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.140
Because otherwise-- you have
to be with kids and keeping up

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.170
with what's going on.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.789
With a career as an independent
artist, you better be.

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.330
RYAN LOREN: So for those of you
who haven't heard your music,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.190
how would you introduce
people to your music?

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.690
AVERY SUNSHINE: It is--

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.940
RYAN LOREN: What's your style.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.000
AVERY SUNSHINE: My
style is R &amp; B soul.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.200
And there's that common thread
of gospel through it all.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.620
But I'm still talking about
my baby daddy, and life,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.450
and stuff.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.720
But I hope that it
makes people feel good,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.530
so I like to call it
feel good music too.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.280
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.100
AVERY SUNSHINE: So I hope it
does make people feel good.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.440
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.190
I think it does.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.680
And I was a little
surprised to hear

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.690
you say you weren't
planning to be an artist,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.967
or weren't expecting that.

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:25.300
But weren't you involved in
music at a pretty young age?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.430
AVERY SUNSHINE: I was.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.750
I started playing
piano at eight. .

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.280
And I started directing
choirs and playing

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.302
for choirs at the age of 13.

00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:36.890
So I was reading music.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.650
And I had an aunt, her
name was Aunt Tootsie.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.640
And Aunt Tootsie called my mom
one day and said, listen, Ruth.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.016
Listen, I'm working at
the Catholic Church,

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:48.390
and I can't be
there this Sunday.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.220
I got to Tahiti.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.780
Can Denise come read these this
[INAUDIBLE] service real quick?

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.900
And my mom asked me, Denise,
do you want to try it?

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.580
And before I knew how much
money it paid, I said sure.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.635
The service was one
hour, and I got $175 just

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:08.950
to go in and read some music.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.390
I was like, I'm through.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.320
That's my career.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.160
That's it.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.035
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING].

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:19.600
AVERY SUNSHINE: But I felt like
I was always behind the scenes.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.640
I was directing the choir,
or accompanying someone.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.710
And I would sing
out of necessity

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.714
if somebody didn't
show up to do a solo.

00:04:28.714 --> 00:04:30.130
That's how I would
end up singing.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.490
But never, you know what?

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.080
I'm going to sing a solo today.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.812
And I just didn't
think I-- you know,

00:04:35.812 --> 00:04:37.494
some people are like that.

00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:39.702
You go to church, you know
that one person, yeah, I'm

00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:43.160
just going to sing "The Star
Spangled Banner" for the Lord

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.370
today.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.900
We didn't ask you to do that.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.200
I was not that person.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.510
I tell you, I am such a fan
of that real, real singer.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.876
The Clark Sisters
and Stevie Wonder.

00:04:55.876 --> 00:04:57.250
And I was like,
if you don't sing

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.500
like that-- that's
what I thought.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.890
And you've got to
have a thing too.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.100
Because everybody that can
sing doesn't have a thing.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.260
And I didn't think
I had that thing.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.890
I didn't know.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.520
And when I tell you,
this is so divine,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.730
I feel like it just fell on me.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.110
And then Dana and I
met, and it was really--

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.040
Dana wave your hand so
everybody can see you.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.248
That's my partner, everybody.

00:05:20.248 --> 00:05:22.434
AUDIENCE: [CHEERING].

00:05:22.434 --> 00:05:23.850
AVERY SUNSHINE:
Yeah, without him,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.230
there would be no
Avery Sunshine.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.550
So feel free to
call him Ike Turner,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.910
Rick James, Joe Jackson.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.234
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING].

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:32.150
RYAN LOREN: Thank you.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.250
So tell me more about the last
album and what it meant to you.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.750
Well, do that first, and then
we'll go to the next question.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.090
AVERY SUNSHINE: The last
album, which was my first,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.790
it marked a point in my life.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.040
I was going through a divorce.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.050
I always say this-- I
didn't go to therapy.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.080
I probably should have.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.300
But the record served
as therapy for me.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.470
I was able to talk about
what I was dealing with.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.620
And I'm going to tell you, if
stuff is better on the outside.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.300
I just believe it.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.730
And I was able to get it out and
to make it to the other side.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.460
So that record marks
that time in my life.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.740
And I'm grateful for it.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.080
I look back, and I'm like, wow.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.650
I'm glad people
liked it, because I

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.550
was going through some of that.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.390
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.365
AVERY SUNSHINE: One of
the songs, I was crying.

00:06:24.365 --> 00:06:25.740
Dana was like, I
don't know if we

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.080
need to put this on the record.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.180
It's like, no, no, but I
just want people to fee me.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.390
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING].

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.914
RYAN LOREN: So then, what can
we expect for the next one?

00:06:36.914 --> 00:06:38.080
AVERY SUNSHINE: More crying.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.660
No, I'm not going
to do more crying.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.020
A different place.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.400
This next record is going to
be entitled "The Sun Room."

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.080
And if you have a
house, the sun room

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.590
is that place where
you go put up your feet

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.910
and do whatever it is
you feel like doing.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.094
If you feel like talking
on the phone, you do that.

00:06:57.094 --> 00:06:59.010
If you want to watch a
little TV, you do that.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.540
If you want to look out and look
at the lake, you can do that.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.800
Whatever it is you want to
do, that's your sanctuary.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.180
And I want to encourage
everybody to find that place.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.390
So this next record is
called "The Sun Room."

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.470
And whatever has been on
my mind this last few--

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.360
as well as Dana's.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.600
Our minds this last
year or so, that's

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.570
what we're talking about.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.945
But it's definitely happy.

00:07:21.945 --> 00:07:22.960
RYAN LOREN: Good.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.960
I think the last one-- it's
just interesting to me.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.590
I always thought
it was fascinating

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.354
how music is therapeutic.

00:07:29.354 --> 00:07:30.770
You said you didn't
go to therapy,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.419
but it sounds like
you sort of did.

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:33.960
AVERY SUNSHINE:
Thanks to all of you.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.560
If you have the record, you
helped me with my therapy.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.480
Thank you.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.480
RYAN LOREN: I'm looking
forward to the next one.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.810
So before we go, just a
couple of favorites of yours.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.180
What's one of your favorite
places to see live music?

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.340
AVERY SUNSHINE: Oh, what are
my favorite places to see--

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.230
RYAN LOREN: In any city.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.560
Wherever.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.550
AVERY SUNSHINE: In any
city to see live music?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.310
I have to tell you London.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.090
Ronnie Scott's.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.930
It's really, really tight.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.010
If you haven't been, please make
a trip to London and check out

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.580
Ronnie Scott's.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.630
It's half the size of
this room right here.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:12.820
And the intimacy, it's electric.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.530
I fell in love with
music again in that spot.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.600
And I hope to play
there one day.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.610
RYAN LOREN: I'm going
to check it out now.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.693
AVERY SUNSHINE: Please do.

00:08:21.693 --> 00:08:22.380
Please do.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.960
RYAN LOREN: What's one of your
passions outside of music?

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.820
AVERY SUNSHINE:
Directing choirs.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.819
That's outside of music.

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.227
RYAN LOREN: [LAUGHING].

00:08:28.227 --> 00:08:29.560
AVERY SUNSHINE: No, my children.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.880
My children.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.619
My son and I are movie buffs.

00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:35.549
So we have dates.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.975
We try to have
dates once a week,

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:42.020
he and I. And the last date
we had, as a matter of fact,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.550
my daughter was
supposed to come,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.080
and he was feeling some
kind of way about it.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.780
And was like, can you drop
her off to get her hair done,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.680
so we can really have our date?

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.730
But I'm taking it seriously.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.740
I want him to-- my dad and I
used to have dates like that.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.497
I want my son to how to treat
a woman or anybody by me

00:09:05.497 --> 00:09:07.330
spending that time with
him and showing him.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.490
Not just telling
him, but we do it.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.010
We do it.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.960
And the last movie we
saw was "Superman."

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.079
What's the name of it?

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:15.120
AUDIENCE: "Man of Steel."

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.680
AVERY SUNSHINE: "Man of Steel."

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.263
I was nervous.

00:09:16.263 --> 00:09:19.490
It was a little dark.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.770
Who did Clark Kent first?

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.520
What was his name?

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.260
Michael Reed?

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.190
Christopher Reeve.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.750
I'm sold out for
Christopher Reeve.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.856
This new stuff.

00:09:28.856 --> 00:09:30.980
That's when you know when
you're getting older too.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.950
Like, see this
new fangled stuff.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.560
I'm not that old.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.220
RYAN LOREN: So how
old are your kids?

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.700
AVERY SUNSHINE: My son is
11, and my daughter is 13.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.820
And y'all, my daughter, she
wrote a song that's going to be

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.800
on [INAUDIBLE] and
"Musiq Soulchild."

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.730
Yes.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.890
It's going to be an
interlude on the record.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.140
RYAN LOREN: That's incredible.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.680
AVERY SUNSHINE: It's nuts.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.330
Actually, she played it for me.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.170
And we listened to
the track on my phone.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.830
And we recreated it for her.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.440
And when she heard it, she
was like, it's not right.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.100
So y'all need to do it again.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.350
RYAN LOREN: That's incredible.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.095
Great.

00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:09.720
AVERY SUNSHINE: I'm
excited about that.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.470
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.460
Last thing.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.280
What was the first CD
you remember buying?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.880
AVERY SUNSHINE: The first CD.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.550
I don't remember buying one.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.250
I I tell you, it's strange.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.930
CDs came out, and I
remember waking up one day,

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.240
and there were three
CDs at the house.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.980
There was the Yellowjackets.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.640
And my parents had
the Clark Sisters.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.170
And then there was one more.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.780
Kenny G. [SINGING].

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.280
It was.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.060
What's the one?

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.970
"The Wedding Song?"

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:48.310
The sound quality from a tape
to CD made your head pop off.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.890
Am I the only one
that remembers?

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.960
To hear that, oh what is it?

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.350
It just felt like water.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.430
You just feel like there's
life to hear that sound.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:58.640
It was amazing to me.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.000
I remember those distinctly.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.130
I don't remember buying them.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.280
It's like, just one day
they were at the house.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.080
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.496
They have a way
showing up, right?

00:11:07.496 --> 00:11:09.320
AVERY SUNSHINE:
They just showed up.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.940
But I remember those
three CDs distinctly.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.640
And the sound was just amazing.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:14.900
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.191
Well, there's a fourth one
I'm looking very forward to.

00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:17.860
It is yours.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.260
So thank you for joining us.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:19.605
And looking forward--

00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:21.271
AVERY SUNSHINE: Thank
you so much, Ryan.

00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:23.190
It means so much to me.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.164
Please make some noise for Ryan.

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:26.829
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE].

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:28.620
AVERY SUNSHINE: Because
for all the artists

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.860
that are here tonight,
it means so much

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.870
for us to be able
to share what we do,

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.430
and the way we want to do it.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.350
And we just don't have
the platform all the time.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.850
And I'm speaking for everybody.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.892
We are grateful.

00:11:41.892 --> 00:11:43.350
And we're grateful
that you're here

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.620
to listen and share with us.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.870
And we thank you, because
you didn't have to.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.578
You could have said,
let me call Beyonce.

00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:51.440
RYAN LOREN: I do
sound like Beyonce.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.099
And I have her
number, of course.

00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:54.640
But I didn't.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.723
AVERY SUNSHINE: BUt you
could have called anybody,

00:11:56.723 --> 00:11:57.490
and chose us.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.830
And I'm grateful.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.139
And we thank you so much.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:01.180
RYAN LOREN: And likewise.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.900
There's a reason
I chose you guys.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.150
AVERY SUNSHINE: Aw, thank you.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.350
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE].
