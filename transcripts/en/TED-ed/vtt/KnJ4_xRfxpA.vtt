00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:08.193
Would you rather be bitten

00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:11.693
by a venomous snake or touch a poisonous frog?

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:12.943
Wait, what's the difference

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:15.942
between poison and venom, anyway?

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:17.192
Let's say you have the misfortune

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:19.591
to be bitten by a venomous rattlesnake.

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.466
When it bites you,

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.635
the snake will eject venom

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:22.869
from little sacks behind its eyes,

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.943
through its hollow fangs and into your flesh.

00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:26.554
That venom will then travel through your bloodstream

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:28.140
and all over your body.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.637
In most cases, snake venom contains neurotoxins,

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:32.728
proteins that can do all sorts of nasty stuff

00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:35.441
like make your muscles fire uncontrollably,

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.067
burst your blood cells,

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:38.774
and make you go completely numb.

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:40.071
But you might get lucky!

00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:41.320
Snakes don't always decide

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.525
you're worth wasting venom on.

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:44.358
In fact, between 20 and 80% of snake bites

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:46.108
are so-called "dry bites,"

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:47.524
where the snake is just trying

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.943
to send a message without actually killing you.

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:52.108
You see, venom takes energy and resources

00:00:52.108 --> 00:00:53.441
for the snake to make,

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:55.712
and they don't want to waste it on a warning shot.

00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:56.962
When it comes to poison,

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.213
on the other hand,

00:00:58.213 --> 00:00:59.506
there's no warning shot.

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.217
If you pick up a poisonous dart frog

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:02.858
to admire its beautiful colors,

00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:04.608
you've already gotten deadly poison

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:06.888
all over your hands.

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:08.347
As it seeps into your skin

00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:09.357
and travels through your blood,

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:11.391
the poison starts to interfere with your nerves,

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.606
preventing your muscles from contracting.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.522
If the frog's poison reaches your heart,

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:18.025
it can cause it to stop.

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:19.441
The distinction between venom and poison

00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:21.736
is purely in the method of delivery.

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:24.322
Poison has to be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed.

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:27.158
Venom has to be injected into a wound.

00:01:27.158 --> 00:01:28.775
Chemically, venoms and poisons

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.775
are both considered toxins,

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:32.608
so a snake bite is venomous.

00:01:32.608 --> 00:01:35.942
A poison dart frog is poisonous.

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:37.877
Brown recluse spiders are venomous.

00:01:37.877 --> 00:01:40.857
Lionfish and pufferfish are poisonous.

00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:43.299
And some compounds can be poisons in one animal

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.759
and venoms in another.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.014
Tetrodotoxin, a chemical 10,000 times more toxic than cyanide,

00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:50.055
is found in pufferfish,

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:51.524
where it makes them poisonous.

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:54.024
It's also found in the deadly blue-ringed octopus,

00:01:54.024 --> 00:01:56.353
where it's a venom delivered by bite.

00:01:56.353 --> 00:01:59.731
Some animals can even be both poisonous and venomous.

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:01.734
Take the Asian tiger snake, for example.

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.570
Not only does it have venom in its fangs

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.275
but it also absorbs the toxins

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:07.025
from the poisonous toads it eats,

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:08.576
and then secretes those toxins

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:10.524
from special glands on its neck,

00:02:10.524 --> 00:02:12.774
rendering it poisonous, too.

00:02:12.774 --> 00:02:14.707
Scientists are constantly finding new animals

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:17.000
that employ toxins in weird, interesting ways.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.543
Recently, researchers discovered

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:20.796
the very first venomous crustacean.

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:22.798
Out of 70,000 species of crustaceans,

00:02:22.798 --> 00:02:25.384
only this one little remipede is venomous.

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:27.469
Speleonectes tulumensis has figured out

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.300
how to create a cocktail of toxins

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.025
that it delivers through its tiny fangs.

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:34.108
Scientists aren't totally sure how this venom works yet,

00:02:34.108 --> 00:02:36.774
but they think that it causes the unwitting victims' neurons

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:39.482
to fire over and over and over again

00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:41.148
until it becomes paralyzed.

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:42.651
Then, the little remipede closes in,

00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:44.858
dissolving away the exoskeleton of its prey

00:02:44.858 --> 00:02:46.775
and sucking out the juices.

00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:49.943
But poisons and venoms aren't always all bad.

00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:51.442
For thousands of years, humans have looked for

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:54.107
ways to harness the power of these toxic compounds for good.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.913
Today, we have all sorts of medicines

00:02:55.913 --> 00:02:57.498
that come from toxins.

00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:00.127
The poison from cone snails is used as a painkiller.

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:01.753
Many poisonous plants have been used

00:03:01.753 --> 00:03:04.547
to treat everything from malaria to irregular heartbeats.

00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:06.424
And scorpion venom might one day be used

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:08.275
to treat heart disease.

00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:11.386
So, what should you do if something bites or poisons you?

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:13.107
Don't try any of the things you've seen

00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:14.766
on the internet or in movies!

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:16.525
Don't try to capture and kill the animal

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:17.686
that bit you,

00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:20.647
and don't use a tourniquet or knife on your wound.

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:23.858
Most importantly, don't panic!

00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:26.819
Stay calm, and seek medical attention.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.071
Treatment will mostly depend

00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.942
on what species you encountered.

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:31.406
But if you forget the distinction

00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:32.940
between poison and venom,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.192
and tell the parademics

00:03:34.192 --> 00:03:35.942
that you were poisoned by a viper,

00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:39.538
they'll probably forgive you and treat you anyway.
