00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.349
Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.219
Welcome to our first live Q&amp;A at MoMA.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.099
My name is Corey D'Augustine and we're going
to be taking live questions and answers for

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.840
the next 20 or 30 minutes here together.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.680
The way this is going to work is that as you
type in questions, our producers will give

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.750
me a couple but as we have a couple of questions
lined up already from previous videos and

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.330
from the Coursera Course, why don't we jump
right to it?

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.970
First question comes from Phil Chwalinsky
and Phil asked, "Who is this guy?

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.550
He really knows his stuff?"

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.950
Thanks, Phil.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.120
Well, just a couple of sentences about myself.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.229
I'm an art conservator or a restorer.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.359
I work on 20th and 21st century paintings,
sculptures.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.589
I did that here at MoMA for about five years.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.670
I have my own studio now.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.999
I've taught at MoMA for six or eight years
and I teach art history at a couple different

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.180
universities here in New York City as well
as online in the Coursera Course that many

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.110
of you know about.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.090
Next question from “PSGRIGA.”

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149
Nice name.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.700
Do you let the previous layers dry before
applying a new layer?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.220
This one comes from YouTube and the Mark Rothko
video.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.189
Sometimes.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.930
Rothko often would paint a dry opaque layer
underneath as kind of the ground coat, the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.490
base colors of his work before doing a lot
of glazing over them.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.729
And again, sometimes glazing with a lot of
medium...actually, more often staining with

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.770
a lot of solvent.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.340
Sometimes those individual stains and glazes
in the upper layers would be painted wet in

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.340
wet.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.420
In other words, not letting the undercoat
dry.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.789
But many times, he would work wet over dry.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.460
He would change his paints at times working
with a lot of different additives.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.140
So Rothko, a great technician of paint.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.810
So again, the answer, sometimes yes, sometimes
no.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.990
Next one from “ourtiempo” also on YouTube,
also from Mark Rothko video.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.300
I read that besides the turpentine burn, if
Rothko used additional additives to his paints,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.070
do you know what any of these were and the
effects they've created?

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.140
As a matter of fact, that's a great question.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.780
It's a topic of current research.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.800
Because Rothko, you know, almost in a way
like Leonardo da Vinci is someone who very

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.940
willingly deviated from the well understood
and the well canonized methods, techniques,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.450
recipes for how to make a stable painting.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.200
He didn't care so much about that as much
as he did achieving very specific aesthetic

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.860
effects.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.960
So he used very traditional things like linseed
oil.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.270
Also like egg, egg tempera going all the way
back to the Middle Ages.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.690
He would mix egg into his oil sometimes, rather
unorthodox.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.190
That's a technique called tempera grassa,
at least in the Italian Renaissance.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.980
He also worked with animal glues.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.740
He worked with acrylic resins, especially
later on in his career.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.770
He worked with a thing called Magnum.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.410
That was the first acrylic paint that Morris
Louis and other color field painters worked

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.390
with extensively.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.810
So again, sorry, not to be ultra-specific
here, but Rothko is someone who painted in

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.570
so many different ways with so many different
materials.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.370
But as you're starting to explore his paintings
looking at them really closely, very much

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.690
like a de Kooning you're going to find some
very interesting odd appearances of paint.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.190
And as you start working in the studio trying
to emulate some of them or finding your own

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.820
ways through them, feel free to experiment
quite wildly and widely.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.380
If it doesn't stick, if it cracks upon drying,
make a note of what you did and probably skip

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.250
that one next time.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.130
But certainly, we have some great artists
who have experimented very radically away

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.460
from traditional materials and techniques.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.110
Next one comes from de Kooning on YouTube.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.700
This is “EllieDenise” who asked, "Can
you use olive oil on the oil color to make

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.900
it flow?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.100
Smiley face."

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.090
Well, smiley face for me too.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.300
Not olive oil but we do know that de Kooning
actually made great use of safflower oil,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.260
that's kind of frying oil for your French
fries, something like that, in paintings especially

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.200
in the 1970s.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.850
There's a great painting in the Guggenheim,
Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection here in New

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.750
York City called "Whose name was writ in water?"

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.580
It's a 1975 canvas, it's a huge canvas.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.930
One of de Kooning's great paintings from the
70s and there's, believe it or not...you can

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.760
Google this and find an image of it but kind
of a juicy cherry red drip that is still dripping,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760
believe it or not.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.370
The painting is 40 years old.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.350
Because in that specific location there's
a lot of likely safflower oil and not so much

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.850
drying oil like linseed, it's still wet, literally.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.160
So every couple of years, if you look at the
painting again, it's going to be another half

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.000
a centimeter, full centimeter down the painting.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.600
It's kind of this ultimate elegy to the great
action painter William de Kooning, the drip

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.290
that keeps on dripping.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.480
Let's see, what do we got.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.140
Alberto from YouTube.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.540
“I work in egg and oil tempera as we were
just talking about and I've read that a few

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.440
months after the paint cures you can seal
it with acrylic gel medium after it dries.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.380
Could you continue painting with acrylic?”

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.100
Yeah.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.240
The answer here is yes.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.560
Well, as a rule of thumb, the fewer things
that you combine together, the simpler you

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.810
keep it, the more structurally sound your
painting is going to be.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.460
In other words, if you start with oil, keep
painting with oil, chances are it's going

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.160
to a strong painting from a physical standpoint
anyway.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.510
Same thing, you start with acrylic, keep on
painting with acrylic, great.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.889
Now there are certain materials that combine
quite nicely like egg and oil for example.

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.040
That works pretty well.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.600
Starting off in egg and oil, sealing it with
acrylic gel medium, continue painting with

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.690
acrylic.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.230
I wouldn't go that route because you're working
with natural materials like egg and drying

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.180
oils, linseed oils, as a rule of thumb, I
would stick on the natural side of the fence

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.080
rather than shifting to synthetic resins like
acrylics or PVAs, polyvinyl acetates.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.710
If I were working in that style, I'd work
with damar varnish rather than that acrylic

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.560
gel medium sealant.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.420
Damar is a typical traditional varnish.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.420
It comes from trees.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.560
It's a natural resin that's going to bind
more strongly with the natural resins, egg,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.500
linseed oil you applied underneath it.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.900
So whereas that acrylic approach that Alberto
mentions here, it might be okay.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.860
In the long term, I would worry about that
starting to peel or delaminate off or lead

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.300
to some cracking.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.280
It may work but I think it's a stronger solution
to work with natural resins like damar or

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.030
mastic.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.460
Another live question here.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.830
This one comes from “Boycott.”

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.830
Uh-oh.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.830
Hope you're not boycotting me.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.290
“Can you mix oil and coat paint together?”

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.520
Related question here.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.040
Yes and no.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.810
De Kooning, as you may know, did a whole lot
of things that you're not supposed to do like

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.780
for example, mix safflower or water into his
oils.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.020
Mixing oil and acrylic paint together, just
try it and you're going to know already that

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.169
you have some really uncomfortable adversaries
in your paint not working.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.370
It's not going to flow together nicely.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.580
It's going to get lumpy and chunky and even
if you have a whisk and you try to blend this

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.900
up, it's going to be rather frothy, unhappy
looking.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.790
As you paint with it, it's going to change
on the surface of a painting.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.510
It's going to settle out in a weird way as
those layers start to repel and separate from

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.510
each other.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.370
But the ultimate, you know, answer to that
question is sure.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.230
If you want to.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.180
There really are no hard and fast rules for
contemporary painters to follow.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.330
The real name of the game here is weighing
what's important to you.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.340
If it's really important to you to make a
very structurally sound, durable painting,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.389
then you probably don't wanna go that route.

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:52.580
If that weird, frothy, uncomfortable looking
texture is really what you're after, then

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.580
by all means.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.750
If that's what does it, then put your hands...put
your faith in the hand of conservators like

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.780
myself.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.710
You know, I've had a couple younger, younger
artists tell me with a straight face, "I consider

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.919
my work to be a collaboration with conservators."

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:07.919
Okay.

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:09.500
That keeps me in business.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.500
I like that.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.310
But we're pretty far away from, you know,
the times of the guild and the academies when,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.240
you know, to be a good painter, part of that
meant making a painting that lasts for a long

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.240
time.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:27.210
We're not necessarily in that moment here
in the 21st century.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.930
Next one comes from YouTube.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.870
How to paint like Yayoi Kusama, the Japanese
artist who's still working?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.169
In fact, she has a retrospective at the Hirshhorn
in DC right now.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.829
Sandy Lambert asks, "Is there a reason that
in your demonstration of creating a Kusama

00:08:40.829 --> 00:08:45.209
painting you chose to work with oil over acrylic
rather than just sticking with acrylic paint

00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:47.860
for the white application?"

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.170
Fair question.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.949
Kusama certainly made some paintings all in
acrylic.

00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:54.490
She also made a lot of paintings all in oil.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.199
For this kind of painting for me personally,
I prefer the aesthetics, the feel, the look

00:08:58.199 --> 00:08:59.579
of oil.

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:05.369
So if I had more time, I would've worked oil
over oil but as we were cranking out these

00:09:05.369 --> 00:09:09.509
paintings in a single day, I didn't wanna
work in an oil under layer because clearly

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:11.689
that wouldn't dry in the same afternoon.

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:15.990
Then I'd be working wet in wet with a top
coat which would pick up some of the black

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.720
base layer.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.240
So that was really just a method of expediency
but certainly, you could work acrylic over

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.709
acrylic, oil over acrylic or oil over oil.

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:31.629
The thing you probably don't wanna do is work
acrylic over oil because again, we have that

00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:37.839
tendency to delaminate between layers as that
painting might age.

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:44.720
Next one also from YouTube, from the actually
announcement for today's Q&amp;A.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:51.980
Joe Soonthornsawad asks, "I'd love to see
a demo on Alberto Burri's combusted plastic

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.370
pieces or more realistically, a demo on glazes
and gels."

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:02.040
Okay, those are rather disparate topics here
but Alberto Burri, the Italian postwar painter,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.050
a great artist and an artist who has a lot
to do with a lot of the artists that we are

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.050
focusing in, both on the YouTube videos and
in the Coursera Course.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.399
Burri actually was an early friend of Robert
Rauschenberg and they kinda traded ideas.

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:20.810
Rauschenberg has a retrospective just opening
tonight, as a matter of fact, here at MoMA.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.569
I would love to do that, that sounds like
a lot of fun to me.

00:10:23.569 --> 00:10:27.749
Part two of that question, demo on glazes
and gels.

00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:30.850
Yeah, we've actually had a couple of questions
about this.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:37.709
You know, glazing, it's a bit, you know, hard
to wrap your mind around it originally but

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:42.100
as you really start to get a couple of key
fundamental ideas down, it's really not that

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.050
difficult and then once you understand this
with your hands, you start going to museums

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.100
like MoMA or like the Metropolitan probably
even better, you can really understand how

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.350
some of these paintings, these...the deep,
luminous paintings are made.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.350
So yeah.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.019
I hope we can do that.

00:10:57.019 --> 00:11:01.689
Let's go to another live question from Lenny
Haskell.

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:07.369
“Which artist has been the most difficult
for you to study/understand/emulate with painting?”

00:11:07.369 --> 00:11:11.410
That's an excellent question.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:19.420
One of the things I'm working on right now
is thinking about how to emulate a Picasso

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:25.060
blue period painting for a totally different
project but maybe we'll make a video out of

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.129
that as well.

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:29.129
Any time you're painting with Picasso, tread
lightly.

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:35.129
Picasso, although he made great efforts to
paint clumsily at certain times in his career,

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:36.129
don't be fooled.

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:40.660
Picasso absolutely had the greatest hand of
any painter, any draftsman in the 20th century.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.259
So I'm a little scared on that one for sure.

00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:45.929
Difficult to study and understand.

00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:49.080
Well, I don't know.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.000
I'm not sure if I can name a specific artist.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.470
You know, these artists who are working in
very signature styles and working...handling

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.350
materials very uniquely, specifically, like
an Ad Reinhardt like a Mark Rothko who we

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.110
were just talking about.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.249
These artists are really challenging because
you need to start from the ground up.

00:12:07.249 --> 00:12:11.269
Things that you think you know about paint
really well may not apply to these artists

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:14.649
even though they're using the same materials
but they're using them in very unique ways

00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:17.589
or combined in different ways etcetera.

00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:23.730
So whereas, you know, working with paintings
after the academic period for me gets way

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.699
more interesting because there's so much more
variety.

00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:29.809
Especially as a conservator, it gets a little
bit daunting and a little bit intimidating

00:12:29.809 --> 00:12:35.339
as it gets difficult artist by artist rather
than school by school or century by century

00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:41.939
is the way that we really need to study.

00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:47.630
Speaking of Ad Reinhardt, S. Newton asked
on YouTube, "It looked like you started on

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.929
a commercially stretched and primed canvas.

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:53.610
I'm interested in the mat, no brushstroke
finish and I'm wondering if there's more to

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.309
the prep of the canvas than shown here.

00:12:55.309 --> 00:12:57.639
Can you tell me?"

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:58.639
Yes and no.

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:01.980
As a matter of fact, I did work on a commercially
primed canvas that day.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:08.369
Reinhardt did that occasionally but in fact,
most of the time, Reinhardt sized, stretched,

00:13:08.369 --> 00:13:11.089
and primed his canvas himself.

00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:15.699
His daughter actually told me she remembers
the smell of boiling rabbit skin glue.

00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:19.429
I think she helped him cook that sometimes
in the studio.

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:25.420
So he worked with very traditional size layer
before applying usually an oil ground to his

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.660
paintings.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:33.050
In my experiments working with Reinhardt type
finishes, the ground is not that important

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.660
to the finish.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.889
It's really specifically how you handle that
paint.

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:44.480
I've been able to get a pretty close surface
to a Reinhardt painting and for me I think

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.360
that the critical issue here is really the
pigment to binder ratio, drawing a lot of

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.199
that linseed oil out of the paint, preserving
the kind of a homogenous, even feel of that

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:58.889
paint but then really getting a nice light
brushstroke with a lot of solvent in there,

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:01.459
allowing that paint to settle out nicely.

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:05.610
Don't stay on it too long or you're going
to be leaving these tracks behind your brush.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.100
But here's a great example of an artist who...if
you first look at his paintings, you may think,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100
"Well, this is so simple.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.100
Anyone can paint like that.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.319
it's just flat black."

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:18.160
But it's a really unique type of beautiful
velvet quality of paint and it's actually

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.300
very, very difficult as I'm sure all my students
on Coursera who have gotten that far in the

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.489
course can attest.

00:14:23.489 --> 00:14:27.389
I think that's probably the most difficult
week of all the weeks from a technical perspective

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:32.939
in the Coursera Course.

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:34.529
Another question on Ad Reinhardt.

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:37.459
Mister Fancy Pants writes, "Respect to the
artist."

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:38.470
Couldn't agree more.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.339
"But was I the only one to chuckle when he
said there is no black in this painting and

00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:43.890
then proceeds to add black to the painting?"

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.269
Oh, he's talking about me.

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:46.980
Yeah, maybe I overspoke a little bit.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.480
The key there...he's adding black pigment,
sure, but in the finished work, you're actually

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.879
not looking at any blacks.

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:58.009
You're looking at really deep shades of other
colors like red and green and blue.

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:01.610
Of course, to get those deep shades, you're
adding a lot of, in this case, mars black

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.199
paint there.

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:06.540
So I guess you were right to chuckle.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.470
I probably should've been a little bit more
clear about that.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:16.129
Coursera student, Constantina Yiokari asks,
"What would you use to prime, for example,

00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:18.509
wood or metal, materials other than canvas?"

00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:19.949
A really good question.

00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:26.470
Well, wood, this is a pretty time-tested answer
since of course in the northern and southern

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:32.009
Renaissance, we have many painters working
on panels, oak and hardwood to the north,

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:34.110
poplar and Southwood in the south.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.310
Gesso is the great material to prime wood.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.389
Traditional gesso is rabbit skin glue with
gypsum or chalk, calcium sulfate, something

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:43.589
like that mixed in.

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:44.730
That works great.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.049
Always has, always will.

00:15:46.049 --> 00:15:48.359
You can also work with an acrylic gesso on
wood.

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:49.819
No problem at all.

00:15:49.819 --> 00:15:53.779
If you're working on metal, this is a little
bit trickier since a lot of paints and painting

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:57.459
materials don't adhere particularly well to
metal.

00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:00.809
So the first step is you probably wanna etch
that metal with acid.

00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:01.809
Okay.

00:16:01.809 --> 00:16:04.040
I'm not sure if you're going to be working
with that in your studio.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.600
Or you can really abrade the surface with
a metal scour and pad or something like that.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.199
The point here is that if metal's really slick,
it doesn't have any tooth for a paint to really

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:17.369
bind onto, so by physically roughing up the
surface, that's definitely a good idea working

00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:20.009
in your advantage.

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:23.730
And then what kind of primers would you work
on that?

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.730
I might steer you towards a commercial primer
for metal now.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.480
There's a specific acrylic resin called B67.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480
Don't worry about it.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.540
Or it should be 48N.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:41.160
Regardless, acrylic...certain acrylic resins
are formulated to adhere to metal better.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.420
Don't go out and buy that resin necessarily
but you can find commercial products often

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:50.939
spray things or brush things like Rust-Oleum
products which are made for adhering to metal

00:16:50.939 --> 00:16:56.859
and then that primer is well built for receiving
other paints like traditional acrylic emulsion

00:16:56.859 --> 00:17:04.140
paints enamel paints or even oil paints.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.689
Live question on the Q&amp;A from Rachel Grodsky.

00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:12.700
Rachel says, "It seems like the painters either
landed in action painting or not.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.419
Why didn't they mix action with other styles
or are there such examples?"

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:24.130
There are in fact other examples but the landed
in action painting part, I like that.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.350
it does seem like it happened all rather quickly
and part of the reason if we can, you know,

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.889
open up the historic lens here for a moment,
is that many of these painters working in

00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:35.960
New York City and elsewhere by the way but
many of them in New York City were really

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.090
trying to find a new style.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:44.120
They were working very much in the shadow
of European surrealism and cubism and constructivism,

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.299
all of these styles from the old world.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.470
And they were really trying to break out and
find something new.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.830
And it's not that one artist did that but
Pollock and de Kooning are most often credited

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:59.540
with making the breakthrough which was really
a synthetic one.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:04.450
Drawing upon European precedent for sure,
drawing on Mexican muralists, David Alfaro

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:09.190
Siqueiros who had an experimental art workshop
here in Lower Manhattan.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:14.081
But then really using the body and the body
in a big, gestural, athletic, dancer like

00:18:14.081 --> 00:18:18.020
kind of way was a new idea, a non-European
idea.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.389
And once that idea became in the air, so to
speak, a lot of artists were really quick

00:18:22.389 --> 00:18:26.360
to pick it up because this became a real New
York style, a real American style, something

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.779
really new and exciting.

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:32.409
Part two of that question, "Are there mixes
with other styles?"

00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:33.409
Yeah, sure.

00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:39.470
Arshile Gorky, interesting artist who unfortunately
ended his own life in 1948 way too early was

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:44.140
working with a, you know, modest kind of gestural
kind of paint but also thinking very much

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.190
about surrealism and biomorphic abstraction.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.420
Biomorphic, this word means, you know, shapes
found in nature.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.649
So looking at plants really closely, painting
things that are abstract but look kind of

00:18:54.649 --> 00:18:59.770
like leaves or look kind of like a paramecium
or an amoeba or something like that but doing

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:08.470
so in the gestural physical kind of painterly
manner.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.679
Question on Mark Rothko from Mike Dusch, "I
was hoping for some tips and insights on how

00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:16.440
to adopt Rothko's oil techniques into acrylic
paint.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.990
Any advice from you, more veteran painters,
would be appreciated.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.250
I'm absolutely loving the courses.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.250
Thanks."

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.250
Thanks, Mike.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.320
Well, actually, Rothko himself was looking
for those same insights.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.990
Rothko, towards the end of his life...he passed
away in 1970.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.440
The last...and I'm not exactly sure.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.760
Four or five years, something like that, of
his career, he worked extensively with acrylics.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.669
A more minimal approach than the more painterly
things early in his career.

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:49.630
But certainly, I've had students working in
Rothko's style in acrylic emulsions to have

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.210
really, really good results.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.120
The difference is to get those stains, you're
no longer cutting oils with turpentine or

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.580
mineral spirits but you're cutting your acrylic
emulsion paints, your liquitex or what have

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.700
you, golden paints with water.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.840
And that water is then going to allow you
to have kind of a liquid, Kool-Aid consistency

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.539
of your paint which you can stain and really
scrub into the canvas.

00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:16.779
Now, the big difference here between using
water to cut your paint versus the organic

00:20:16.779 --> 00:20:19.059
spirits is surface tension.

00:20:19.059 --> 00:20:24.409
So turpentine is going to really flow nicely
and evenly into your support whereas water,

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:26.610
as you know, if you drip some water on a table,
it beads up.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.159
It has surface tension to it.

00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:31.220
So you might need to be a little bit more
aggressive brushing that, forcing it down

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.120
into the canvas or into the underlying paint
layer because otherwise, it may bead up and

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.250
have a little bit of a resist effect.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.519
But certainly, by spending a little bit more
time and energy on some vigorous brushwork,

00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:45.980
you can absolutely get some extremely Rothko
like effects with those thinned down acrylic

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.880
emulsions.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.430
Question from Mary Cooper.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.809
Question's about protecting acrylic and oil
paintings once they're finished.

00:20:55.809 --> 00:20:59.450
“I’ve seen various sprays advertised in
art supplies catalogues for protecting finished

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.309
pieces against ultraviolet light, etc.

00:21:02.309 --> 00:21:05.850
What would be the recommended way to protect
paintings to make them last longer and are

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:10.130
there any products to be aware of that alter
color over time etc?”

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.649
This is actually a huge question and we're
just going to scratch the surface, if you'll

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:16.659
forgive the pun here.

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:21.419
For many, many years, there has been this
kind of misconception that varnishes protect

00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:25.350
a painting and some of you are probably saying,
"Oh, my professor in such and such art school

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.649
said exactly that."

00:21:27.649 --> 00:21:30.440
Very rarely does a varnish actually protect
anything.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.679
As a matter of fact, varnishes have damaged
more paintings or the restorer trying to get

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:39.409
that varnish off has damaged many more paintings
than varnishes actually protected.

00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:41.130
I promise.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:47.160
So varnishes are really an aesthetic choice
here 99%.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.580
A frame, a sheet of plexi or glass over your...now
we're talking about protecting your painting

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.290
really but a varnish...every varnish is going
to change color over time.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.929
If you're working with a natural resin like
damar or varnish...sorry, damar or mastic

00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:07.340
varnish, these turn yellow gradually and,
you know, 25 years down the road, you're probably

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.809
going to want to take that off and put a new
one on.

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:14.150
That's a tricky job for certain paintings,
definitely a job for a conservator.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.909
If you're working with one of these newer
synthetic resin varnishes, acrylics and whatnot,

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:23.019
many of these don't turn yellow but they kind
of gray out or become foggy or milky looking

00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:24.019
over time.

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:29.960
And again, 20, 25, 30 years down the road,
you probably wanna take that off and put another

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960
one on.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.580
This whole taking off and putting it on part,
this is tricky and for certain kind of paintings,

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.720
it's impossible to do safely.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.470
So my own advice here.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:43.660
if you're using a varnish for aesthetic purposes,
by all means, run with it.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.799
If you're really thinking that it's just some
necessary coat that you have to do to make

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:51.990
a finished painting, it's really a fallacy
that unfortunately continues to be spread

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.309
today.

00:22:53.309 --> 00:23:03.429
So I'd really skip it if the look of a varnish
is not something you're interested in.

00:23:03.429 --> 00:23:07.169
Next one comes from Eva Brenda Rodriguez Paredes
on Coursera.

00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:12.049
“How can a contemporary painter part from
postwar abstractionism into something that

00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:15.680
reflects his own identity rather than just
a derivative approach from the artists we

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.630
are currently analyzing?"

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.390
The $25,000 question.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.690
That's up to you really but I really don't
think...especially developing artists should

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:32.009
worry about working in the styles of other
artists because in doing that, invariably,

00:23:32.009 --> 00:23:33.309
you're not going to make a copy.

00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:36.610
You're not going to make a Rothko that looks
just like Rothko or even a Pollock or what

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.610
have you.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.380
Instead, what you're going to do is you're
going to find out how your own hand does things

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.120
differently and before you start saying, "Oh,
it's not as good as a Rothko."

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.549
Just realize it's different than a Rothko.

00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:53.690
And some things you may have inadvertently
done are more you than Rothko and actually

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:58.200
these are going to find some...they're going
to provide some creative pathways forward.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.230
So I would suggest absolutely painting through
the masters, right.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:06.639
So learning about the painters that you really
like, learning about their materials, their

00:24:06.639 --> 00:24:11.159
approaches, their techniques, etc. trying
your hand at it and then finding out actually

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:13.800
it wasn't all of Rothko's approach that I
liked.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.190
It was just this one facet which is going
to provide an avenue into your own work.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:23.059
And by the way, don't worry about working
in someone else's style.

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:24.820
Pablo Picasso had a great quote.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.050
He said, "Good artists borrow.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.179
Great artists steal."

00:24:29.179 --> 00:24:30.179
Nice.

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:31.320
So go ahead.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.629
Be a great artist.

00:24:32.629 --> 00:24:35.909
Steal something, make it your own and in fact,
the history of painting is full of this kind

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:37.360
of thing.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.590
So as long as you're not, you know, lifting
an image or something like that, you know,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.139
the style of Richard Prince or Andy Warhol
and copyright infringement and all that, I

00:24:46.139 --> 00:24:47.950
really wouldn't worry about this at all.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.440
You will find your way for sure.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.110
And by the way, Arshile Gorky, who we just
mentioned a few minutes ago, did exactly that.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:25:00.250
As a young artist here in New York City, in
New Jersey, he basically was with Picasso

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.649
for a time in the same way that you might
be with a boyfriend or a girlfriend or something

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:08.840
like that and he was with Miró for a while
and with Kandinsky for a while and he wore

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.820
his influences on his sleeve.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.470
And by the time he was done with all these
withs, if you will, he realized that a little

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.581
of this and a little of that and a pinch of
salt and a twist of lemon and suddenly, Gorky

00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:22.150
has a very original language which is all
him.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.769
The idea of finding a signature style out
of nothing is kind of a ridiculous idea here

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:27.799
in the 21st century.

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:31.970
So there's no reason not to borrow heavily
from all these great historical sources that

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.970
we have.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.519
It's part of the reason we study art history,
by the way.

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:40.940
“ZiggytotheMoon” asks, "Are there any
rare color pigments that are very rare or

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.149
not used by artists anymore?"

00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:45.909
In fact, there are many of these.

00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:53.730
There's one really rare color called Indian
yellow which I believe is distilled from the

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.769
urine of cows who eat a lot of mango leaves
in India.

00:25:56.769 --> 00:25:59.149
I couldn't make that up, I promise.

00:25:59.149 --> 00:26:00.759
So anyway, that's kind of rare.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:03.070
There are a lot of extinct paints out there.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:07.320
very few artists still work with lead white
because lead is somewhat toxic.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.640
It's a little bit overblown as long as you're
not eating the paint or something like that.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.640
it's a problem.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.620
Now, if your walls are, you know, powdering
lead white and it's getting in your food and

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.090
you're breathing it, that is a problem.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.530
But there's another color, emerald green.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.320
A beautiful green, Paris green, it's also
called.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.730
A French color from the 19th century.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.990
Believe it or not, that is rat poison and
as that pigment was patented, it was patented

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.440
as a beautiful green pigment and as rat poison
at the same time.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440
So yeah.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.539
You probably don't wanna be working with that
and getting that all over your hands.

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:39.279
So that one, I don't know anyone who supplies
that now.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:41.240
You'd have to dig a little bit.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.070
But there are some out there.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:47.540
But certainly, with some research, actually,
you'll find many more than just those two

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.379
that I mentioned.

00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:56.889
Jenny Gunnerson asks...in fact, she asked
two questions, "What is the difference between

00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:59.350
binder and solvent and what is the difference..."

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.539
Well, let's tackle that first question first,
binder and solvent.

00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:05.440
So binder is the glue or the vehicle of a
paint.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.120
It's the stuff that's already in your tube.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.809
In other words, in an oil paint, that's linseed
oil.

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:13.120
The solvent is the thinner for it.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.990
So in the world of oil paint, the typical
historical solvent is turpentine.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:19.529
That's a tree distilled resin.

00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:23.409
It's the thing that takes your oil and really
dissolves it, okay.

00:27:23.409 --> 00:27:28.100
So if you're working with a liquitex or golden
acrylic emulsion, your binder is in fact that

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:35.840
acrylic resin, a synthetic resin and your
solvent, the thinner is now just water, okay.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.659
And secondly, "What is the difference between
color value, chroma, and saturation?

00:27:40.659 --> 00:27:42.669
Hope someone out there can help me out.

00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:43.700
Thanks."

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.110
Couple suggestions here.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.759
There is a little video on the Coursera Course
so you might take a look at that one.

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:56.090
You might also take a look...go onto Wikipedia
and check out Muncell, that's M-U-N-C-E-L-L,

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.059
Muncell color space.

00:27:58.059 --> 00:28:04.780
You'll find a really, really nicely written
site that explores Muncell color theory.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.159
Some people really dorked out there.

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:08.249
Thanks to those guys and gals.

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:10.809
Essentially, value is the darkness of a color.

00:28:10.809 --> 00:28:14.749
So you're looking at a color, you're looking
at this painting back here but imagine you're

00:28:14.749 --> 00:28:15.999
seeing it just in grayscale.

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:19.259
You're in Photoshop and you've turned down,
you know, all the colors.

00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:22.809
So it's how dark a shade of that gray is it.

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:24.789
Chroma is the purity of a color.

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:27.080
In other words, you're talking about a yellow.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.791
How much other stuff besides yellow is in
there?

00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:31.720
Is it a screaming, brilliant yellow, high
chroma?

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:37.289
Or is it kind of a muddy, oakerish you know,
muted kind of a yellow, low chroma?

00:28:37.289 --> 00:28:38.870
And saturation.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:43.789
Saturation, the term that a lot of people
use but not that many people actually know

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:44.789
what it means.

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:47.360
Saturation is the wet appearance of a color.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.750
So you know, Asphalt street, right?

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:56.190
In fact, it's kind of like dark gray or something
like that but when it rains, suddenly it looks

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.190
black.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:01.000
That's the saturated color of that unsaturated
dark gray of the asphalt.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.590
In fact, paintings work the same way.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:07.879
In fact, the aesthetic reason that most artists
use a varnish is because they wanna re-saturate

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:12.409
those colors, make them look wet again after
they dried.

00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:18.129
So the whole saturated business is very critical
to traditional painting, perspectival painting

00:29:18.129 --> 00:29:22.570
because it...when you evenly saturate all
those colors, suddenly you have the ability

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.789
to project some illusionistic space behind
the picture plane.

00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:27.730
That picture frame turns into a window frame.

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:32.509
You can imagine looking out into the distance
into a, say, a Tissen painting or Vermeer

00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:34.009
or something like that.

00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:39.830
In the 20th and 21st centuries, this becomes
more of an issue about the surface of a painting.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:45.009
Picasso making some glossy marks and some
mat marks so your eye knows that, "Oh, these

00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:48.230
are things that are marks made on a flat surface."

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.519
So a lot of different ways to handle that
but essentially, yes.

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:57.940
Saturated means the wet version of whatever
color that you're talking about.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:03.009
And I think maybe our last question here which
comes from Instagram from Felixblanzy says,

00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:05.410
"Hi, thanks for your videos, very instructive.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:09.130
Could you talk about thin, straight lines
technique in acrylic or oil?"

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.629
Thin, straight lines.

00:30:10.629 --> 00:30:13.179
Okay, a couple of different ways to do this.

00:30:13.179 --> 00:30:15.861
Barnett Newman made a lot of thin, straight
lines.

00:30:15.861 --> 00:30:21.679
Some thick, straight lines also that he called
zips working with masking tape.

00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:27.269
So to do that, you could take two pieces of
masking tape, leave just a thin space between

00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:28.269
them.

00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:32.040
Before you paint that space, really make sure
that that masking tape is well adhered to

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.040
the canvas.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.080
Otherwise, paint is going to bleed under that
masking tape.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.549
But then you can use a brush or a knife and
make that mark over those two pieces of tape,

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:42.549
critically over that gap between them.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:46.460
Take off the two pieces of paint...of tape
rather while the paint is wet still.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.700
That's fine.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.500
And you should be left with a very crisp line
in between.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.809
Many artists use this.

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:55.139
Piet Mondrian famously did a whole lot of
this.

00:30:55.139 --> 00:30:58.529
There's a kind of characteristic look to a
masked line however.

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:02.690
You could get a little lip of paint...I'm
actually working on a Gerhard Richter painting

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:06.379
where the whole thing is full of these lips
where there's a little thickness of paint

00:31:06.379 --> 00:31:09.300
right where that masking tape was.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.850
So if you don't wanna do that, if you don't
wanna get that characteristic effect, well,

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.029
now you've gotta practice a lot.

00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:16.799
There are brushes out there called lining
brushes.

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:22.210
In fact, de Kooning worked with these as a
kid when he went to trade school, art school

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.869
and he in fact, introduced that kind of brush
to Arshile Gorky.

00:31:25.869 --> 00:31:30.490
And if you look at Gorky's paintings, you'll
find very beautiful black sinuous thin lines.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:34.220
Not straight lines in his case but gorgeously
executed thin ones.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.809
A lining brush comes to a really nice, fine
point but they have really long bristles before

00:31:38.809 --> 00:31:41.999
the ferrule brush so that you can hold a lot
of paint.

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:46.590
The reason that's important...if you can make
a long continuous line without having to reload

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.600
your brush and then, you know, replace the
point which is going to give you kind of a

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.120
chattering line.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.549
So yeah.

00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:55.850
Making a straight line freehand.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:32:00.320
Well, now you're talking about, you know,
really great draftsmen and painters.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.539
So the easy way out is masking tape but there's
a caveat that has a kind of masked look to

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:05.539
it for sure.

00:32:05.539 --> 00:32:08.600
We do have a couple of more live questions,
it looks like here.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:16.740
This one's from YouTube from Katie Frank,
"Please tell us more about your personal artwork."

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.490
These days, you know, I haven't spent a whole
lot of time at the aisle because I've spent

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.960
a lot of work as a conservator and teaching.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.539
When I was making a ton of work in the studio,
I made mostly abstract paintings where I didn't

00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:35.700
really work with paint per se but chose to
use other everyday materials and find ways

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.799
for them to behave like paint.

00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:44.590
For example, taking iron shavings, finding
a way to fuse them onto canvas and then working

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:49.559
with different kinds of acid to dissolve that
and repatinate the surface.

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:50.559
Or working with makeup.

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:55.100
Makeup is something that looks a whole lot
like paint actually but it never dries.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.259
As a matter of fact, speaking of saturation
or thinking about our chroma, it's possible

00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:05.389
to get more chromatic or more saturated colors
with silicon binder of a lot of makeups than

00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:07.409
it is with oil because it stays wet.

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:10.279
Of course, those little fingerprints get all
over the place too.

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:15.370
Anyway, maybe more on that some other time.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:19.250
Question from Foster Atkinson, "We're just
going to ignore the fact that this guy looks

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.350
like Drake?"

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.690
I learned this from the YouTube videos.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.289
Actually, I did hear that once before.

00:33:25.289 --> 00:33:27.779
I could do worse, I guess, right?

00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:31.379
I'm more of a Kendrick Lamar guy but, you
know, I'll take that as a compliment.

00:33:31.379 --> 00:33:35.760
Thanks, Foster Atkinson.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.130
Anvita Mathu: “So Drake's a painter now?”

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:40.130
Thanks.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.130
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.230
If it is another Drake one.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.860
What do we got?

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.129
Renaldo Rodriguez says, "Are you Drake's lost
brother?"

00:33:48.129 --> 00:33:51.899
I don't know about that but it's starting
to look likely, I guess.

00:33:51.899 --> 00:33:52.899
Yes.

00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:54.309
I can guess.

00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:55.309
No.

00:33:55.309 --> 00:33:56.309
No more on Drake.

00:33:56.309 --> 00:33:57.309
Okay.

00:33:57.309 --> 00:33:59.429
So let's wrap up here.

00:33:59.429 --> 00:34:03.690
We've had some requests for additional contents,
more videos etc. are coming up.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.649
IN THE STUDIO videos, we've actually had a
couple...more than a couple of people request

00:34:07.649 --> 00:34:10.370
a part two of a William de Kooning video.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.980
You see where I left off in part one behind
me.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:18.250
And I mentioned in that video on YouTube and
on Coursera that a de Kooning painting is

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.620
never made in one afternoon, no way.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.810
In fact, he sometimes spent months or even
years on his canvases so this work necessarily

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:29.830
looks really thin and fresh whereas a real
de Kooning painting is very labor intensive

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:30.830
and very heavy.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.300
In fact, we're going to do that.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:38.740
I'm going to talk about a couple ways that
de Kooning would move on from week to week

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.590
or day to day by scraping, physically dry
paint.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.250
Scraping it off the canvas.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.740
And also by working temporarily or permanently
with collage elements in the canvas making

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:52.640
a drawing, putting that drawing on the canvas,
painting over it, you know, extending some

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.500
of those lines, maybe taking the drawing back
off or maybe leaving it there.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.360
So absolutely stay tuned for that one.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.480
“TheeArtChick,” nice name.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.190
“Would you do a painting a la fauve style?

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.290
Love this channel.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.290
Have learned so much.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:06.290
Thanks.”

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:07.290
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.980
Fauve, the movement, it means wild beast in
French.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.620
That's Henri Matisse, his followers, Maurice
de Vlaminck, Derain, artists like that.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.960
Fauve technique is actually quite straightforward.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.620
So this is one that I think we really should
do and this is a great kind of beginning modern

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.490
painting style.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.210
Most fauves wild beasts, they painted wet
in wet.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.070
Very direct painting technique.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.830
Straight out of the tubes at times.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:34.030
They really admired the paintings of children,
finger painting.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:38.100
Very simple looking paintings but there's
really nothing simple about a Matisse as we'll

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.100
find out.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.530
“Rossinaround” says, "Hello.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:47.150
As an aspiring painter living in Tokyo, I
love the how to paint like Yayoi Kusama video.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:51.430
Any chance you can do a how to paint like
Picasso in his abstract works or Jean-Michel

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:52.430
Basquiat Thanks?"

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.840
In fact, Picasso never made an abstract painting,
believe it or not.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.270
Although he came pretty damn close.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.940
In fact, we are going to do this.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.280
We are going to make a cubism video.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.700
Anyway, not specifically Picasso but also
Georges Braque who also gets left out but

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.550
was absolutely 50% of the invention of cubism.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:15.540
I think this is going to be really strong
video because in making a cubist drawing and

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.120
then a painting, you're really going to understand
what cubism is all about.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.040
It's going to help you look at a cubist painting
and really appreciate cubism.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.650
One of the really most important movements
of the entire 20th century.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.770
Basquiat, interesting one also.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.770
Next one.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.770
Please do one on Basquiat.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:33.930
Michael Augusto, Jean-Michel Basquiat please.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.100
Okay, I get it.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:44.130
Basquiat who is doing extremely well in museums
and auction houses these days...really interesting

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:49.440
artist who, like Rauschenberg, like many other
artists felt extremely free to do anything

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.950
and everything with any kind of material,
any kind of paint etc.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:59.660
So in a way, this is a hard one because there
isn't one Basquiat style at all to choose

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:04.250
from but certainly, we can look at some of
the materials he painted on, some very unorthodox

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.290
choices of supports.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.800
I worked on a painting recently that's stretched
over a pallet, like a wooden pallet.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:14.170
Not on a painter's pallet but a wooden pallet
for like moving furniture and things like

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.170
that.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.170
looked great on the back.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.060
Almost as great as it did on the front.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:22.320
And we can talk about some of the enamels
that he worked with and oil stick and some

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.360
of the other effects that he went back to
again and again.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.360
So absolutely.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.680
Let's do it.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.250
Make a Guston.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.100
We also received a lot a lot of Guston requests.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.320
I think that's a great idea.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.490
Phil Guston, an artist who started out as
a figurative painter, was a kind of relative

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:42.500
late comer to abstraction circa 1952, '53
here in New York City and then actually was

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.870
one of the first New York school painters
to really lose faith in abstraction and return

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:52.730
to figuration before making some really interesting
paintings in 1970s where he's thinking about

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.400
cartoons and sarcasm and satire etc.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.850
Guston is one of my favorite painters.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:03.541
I'd love to talk about some of the continuity
between his abstract works and then some of

00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:07.640
his later figurative works which for all their
crassness, their lowbrow humor, were actually

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.120
really gorgeously painted more often than
not.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.700
Bridget Reilly, Robert Motherwell, Clifford
Still, Gustaf Klimt, Helen Frankenthaler,

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.010
lots of really interesting artists that people
are requesting here.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:24.261
By all means, keep requests coming and as
we start to find, you know, more interest

00:38:24.261 --> 00:38:29.750
in certain areas than others, I will absolutely
take that into consideration.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.770
So yeah.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:36.040
Looks like we have a cubism video, a de Kooning
video on the way.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.310
You'll be sure not to miss those videos when
they pop up.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.270
If we didn't get to your questions in the
video, we'll try answering some of them in

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:51.130
text in the various discussion forums here
on YouTube or on Coursera.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.650
And by all means, keep those questions coming
as well.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.890
also, let us know if you like this session.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:00.290
I'd be happy to do more of them if this kind
of thing is useful or fun, if this is better

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:04.740
than, you know, clicking away on the keyboard
and getting responses in text, you know, a

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.270
couple days or a week later.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.970
If there's interest, let us know.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:09.970
So thanks for tuning in.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.490
Keep sending questions and thanks again for
watching IN THE STUDIO.
