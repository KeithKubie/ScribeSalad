00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.020
WOJTEK KALICINSKI: Android
Studio 3.0 is a major release,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.330
and with it we're also releasing
version 3 of the Android Gradle

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.370
plugin.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.780
It is based on new
Gradle APIs, supports

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.260
variant-aware
dependency resolution,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.200
and can greatly speed
up multi-module builds.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.300
Unfortunately, you might
have to make some updates

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.490
to your Gradle
configuration when switching

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.570
to the new plugin version.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.320
It's just a few steps, and
it's well worth the effort.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.750
You'll end up with a more
maintainable build file

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.700
and a faster build.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.920
When you first open your
existing project in Android

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.340
Studio 3, you will be prompted
to update the Android plugin

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.270
version.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.510
We also require, at
minimum, Gradle 4.1,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.690
and this will be automatically
fixed for you too.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.760
If you want to make
these changes manually,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.660
you need to check two places.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.920
First, in the main build
Gradle file, change AGP version

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.420
to 3.0.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.460
Next, open the Gradle Wrapper
properties file and edit

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.520
the URL to point to 4.1.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.310
By the way, as an
optional step, you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.070
can add the new Google Maven
Repository to your main

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.360
build file.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.580
We use it to distribute
our build artifacts,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.120
such as the support library.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.590
And with the latest
Gradle version,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.730
you can simply refer to
it with a Google keyword.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.670
If you try to compile your
app now with the new plugin,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.920
and you are using
flavors in your modules,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.180
you will most probably
get this error.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.990
Previously, flavored
dimensions were optional.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.090
In order to make resolving
flavors and library

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.610
modules more robust,
you are now required

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.610
to specify a dimension
for each flavor.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.770
The Android Gradle
plugin will automatically

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.140
use a matching flavor
from consumed libraries

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.760
if it can find one.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.250
If the library defines flavor
dimensions which are not

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.080
present in your
main build file, you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.060
have to make an
explicit selection using

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.160
the new missing
dimension strategy

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.610
statement in the module
consuming the library listing

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.010
the flavors you like
to match in order.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.350
And conversely, if a
library module does not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.140
have a flavor that matches
one defined in your app,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.690
you will have to
specify a fallback.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.350
Use the matching fallbacks
keyword in the app's flavor

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.660
definition followed
by the possible flavor

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.260
names that will be selected
from library modules.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.730
You can do the same
for build types

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.310
whenever the app includes
a build type that a library

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.230
dependency does not.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.940
A nice side effect
of these changes

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.980
is that you no longer
have to specify

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.020
which variant you
want to consume when

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.300
depending on a library module.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.770
You should remove
these extra lines

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.170
from the dependency section and
just include the library once.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.940
You can also remove
publishNonDefault

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.040
true from library modules.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.930
For external
dependencies, it's still

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.780
fine to use a variant
specifier if you only wanted

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.000
to be added to certain builds.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.740
By the way, there's one more
detail here that changed.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.910
Android plugin 3 is adopting
new dependency configurations

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.530
introduced in Gradle.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.210
As you can see in
the table here,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.390
this is just a name change
for most dependency types.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
Compile becomes API, and
provided becomes compile only.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.270
However, there is
one new configuration

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.570
called implementation, which
when applied correctly,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.780
can result in significant
build time improvements.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.390
You should prefer using the
implementation configuration

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.840
whenever a module only uses
the dependency internally

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.350
and doesn't intend to leak
its API to other modules.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.870
That way whenever the
dependency changes,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.120
you limit the number of
modules that would otherwise

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.100
have to be recompiled.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.140
These are the basic
changes that every Android

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.690
project should make when
migrating to Android Gradle

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.800
plugin 3.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.860
More migration scenarios are
covered in our documentation,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.110
such as when handling
annotation processors

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.960
or using the variant API
to access build outputs.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.510
So please take a look at
the link in the description.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.950
And thanks for watching.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.300
