00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.300
Let's review how China can
maintain a trade imbalance

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.720
with the United
States by artificially

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.840
keeping its currency weak.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.260
So we had a simplified
scenario where

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.340
we had an exchange
rate of 6 yuan per $1.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.920
We had a Chinese manufacturer
selling $50 million

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.260
worth of microwaves
in the United States.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.150
We had a US software
producer selling $20 million

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.050
worth of software in China.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.160
If we had a floating exchange
rate, the supply of dollars

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.100
is much greater than
the demand for dollars.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.920
So the dollar would
become weaker.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.050
It would become weaker, and
the yuan would become stronger.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.300
And that would resolve
the trade imbalance

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.100
We saw that the
People's Bank of China

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.120
does not want that to happen.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.720
So what they do is they
artificially create

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.130
demand for dollars
to keep it strong.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.550
They do that by essentially just
printing yuan and converting it

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.110
to dollars.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.700
And that obviously also
increases the supply of yuan,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.880
so it makes that less expensive.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.494
It weakens the yuan,
strengthens the dollar.

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:10.910
Now, they're not
just going to sit

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.040
on literally cash with
those dollar bills.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.090
They'll actually want
to lend to them out.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.350
So what this does is it
increases the supply of money

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.670
for loans, supply of loans.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.980
Well, if you increase the amount
of dollars that can be lent,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.580
that's going to lower the
cost of borrowing dollars.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.861
So the effect is you are
lowering borrowing costs.

00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.110
And if you're lowering
borrowing costs that just means

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.160
interest is less, and it's
easier to use your credit card,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.850
either if you're
the US government

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.090
or if you're the US consumer.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.590
Now, if debt becomes cheaper or
we have lower interest rates--

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.050
If you have a lower interest
rate on your credit card

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.375
that means that you're
just going to consume more.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.361
So the end result,
the big picture

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:08.610
of what's happening here,
in order to maintain a trade

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.419
imbalance, in order
to keep its currency

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:16.080
peg, you have the Chinese
Central Bank essentially

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.260
printing money,
converting it to dollars,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.557
and then lending that to the
US government and consumer,

00:02:21.557 --> 00:02:23.140
and what are they
going to do with it?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.640
Essentially, they're
going to end up

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.460
buying more Chinese goods.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.230
In our simplified
example, they'll

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.840
buy even more microwaves.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.568
