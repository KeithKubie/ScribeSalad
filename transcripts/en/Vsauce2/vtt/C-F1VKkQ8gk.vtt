00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.910
To prove their batteries are reliable in freezing
temperatures Canadian Tire built a truck out

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.220
of 11,000 pounds of ice.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.410
And burrito box is the world's first burrito
kiosk that serves five different types of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.150
burritos at the touch of a button.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.150
Vsauce!

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.260
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.570
The SkyCycle is an urban concept that would
allow people to ride their bikes in the sky.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.369
Developed by architect Sir Norman Foster it
would consist of 220 kilometers of safe car

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.800
free bike routes above London.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.900
And include 200 different entry and exit points,
accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour, and

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.640
improve bike travel time by almost 30 minutes.&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.440
Budgee is a robot designed to help with everyday
tasks and to carry your stuff around.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.530
Created by Five Elements Robotics, it can
hold up to 50 lbs and collapses easily for

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
transportation with a 6-8 hour battery life.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.689
It's intended for a wide range of uses from
helping the elderly and disabled to carrying

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.830
all of your stuff at an amusement park or
mall.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.280
Sea Stars are able to see images with tiny
eyes located at the ends of their legs that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.700
can be cut off and regenerate.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.700
So Yeah.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.270
Pavegen is making energy out of footsteps.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.840
By transferring the kinetic energy from a
human's step into renewable electricity that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.119
can be stored for future use.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.229
The tiles are waterproof, durable, and made
from recycled materials so they can easily

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.090
cover existing high foot traffic areas.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.079
Currently, their largest permanent installation
is at Kent grammar school where 24 kinetic

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.790
tiles cover over 5 meters of corridor.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.920
A new adhesive activated by UV light is being
developed to repair holes in blood vessels

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.840
and the walls of the heart.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.290
Until now medical adhesive glues were not
able to withstand the pressure that a beating

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.930
heart exerts and didn't adhere well to wet
tissue.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.579
But by studying the viscous secretions of
slugs and sandcastle worms researchers were

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.700
able to figure out how to form stable bonds
underwater.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.890
Corning Gorilla glass created the worlds first
antimicrobial cover glass for mobile devices.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.620
It's formulated to protect touch surfaces
from the growth of algae, mold, mildew, fungi

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.040
and bacteria and works continually over the
entire life of the device.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.760
Aurora is a headband that claims to let you
control your dreams.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.030
It plays special lights and sounds while you're
in the REM cycle of sleep that are supposed

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.230
to induce lucid dreaming.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.950
The software in the headband senses when you're
dreaming by measuring brainwave and eye movement

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.950
activity.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.849
The user is able to pick out their own specific
dream signs, which are used to induce the

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.160
lucid dreaming by making you aware of your
surroundings.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.560
It also sets a smart alarm clock that will
wake you during your most refreshed cycle

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560
of sleep.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.360
Mother monitors small connected sensors to
make your everyday routines easier.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.430
Motion cookies can be attached to almost anything
including water bottles to check if you're

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.830
drinking enough water, toothbrushes to make
sure everyone is brushing or pill bottles

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.930
so you don't forget your medication.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.239
Then Mother puts all of the information into
the sense board where you can then check out

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.489
the news of your daily life.&nbsp;

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.990
Onewheel is a self-balancing skateboard that
makes you feel like you're on a hoverboard.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.150
It uses gyro and accelerometer sensors to
feed a processor that determines the exact

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.280
speed to drive the motor based on how you
lean your body and because of the self balancing

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.870
abilities they say almost anyone can learn
to use it within minutes.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.629
The power lasts for 4-6 miles and can reach
up to 12 miles per hour.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.659
MiP is a self-balancing robot that can be
controlled by hand gestures and/or your smart

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:51.659
device.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.400
MiPs can dance, race, and battle each other.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.980
They're taking Preorders now and plan to roll
out in the Spring of 2014.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.830
Finally, The Waters of Greenstone by Nathan
Kaso shows the changing landscapes of New

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:19.440
Zealand over a three week period.&nbsp;

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.030
I'm gonna leave you with geometric bubbles.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:57.370
And as always - thanks for watching.
