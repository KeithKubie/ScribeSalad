THE BUZZ SPREAD QUICKER
THAN THE SMILE ACROSS MY FACE

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.243
WHEN I ARRIVED TO WORK
EACH MORNING.

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:10.477
HOW MANY CAPPUCCINOS
CAN I GET FOR YOU?

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.479
- JUST THE ONE, PLEASE.
- [laughs] OKAY.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.181
$3.50.
THANK YOU.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.417
THERE WERE NO TWO WAYS
ABOUT IT--I LOVED MY JOB,

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.152
TO THE POINT
WHERE I BEGAN TO FORGET

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.054
THAT IT WASN'T MY REAL JOB.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.191
[knocks on counter]
- EXCUSE ME.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.160
- OH, WE'RE NOT OPEN YET, SIR--
OH, GRANT.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.195
HI.
- HEY.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.496
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND TO TALK?

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.697
- UH...
- JUST FOR A SEC?

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.999
- YES.
- YEAH.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.767
- HOW'S THE SHOW GOING?
- WELL...

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.536
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.437
'CAUSE WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU
TO QUIT THIS JOB.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.439
- OH, YEAH.

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:41.175
QUIT THIS JOB?

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.843
- THAT'S WHY YOU TOOK THIS JOB
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.811
- I WAS THINKING OF--
MAYBE I WOULD CUT DOWN MY HOURS

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.180
ONCE I GET THINGS UP TO SPEED,

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.548
'CAUSE I HAVE
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT--

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.949
- WELL,
YOU'RE REVIEWING QUITTING.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.517
VIEWERS NEED THIS.
- YEAH.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.387
- AMERICA NEEDS THIS,
AND THE WORLD NEEDS THIS.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.322
- SIX MINUTES UNTIL THE PASTRIES
ARRIVE, MR. FORREST.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.990
- DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
OR WHAT?

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.992
- [sighs]

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:02.829
- FORREST, GET OUT HERE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:09.570
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
"LOBBY JAVA BY FORREST."

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.072
- UH, WILLY...

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.078
I'M REALLY SORRY. UH...
[clears throat]

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.747
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I FIRST STARTED HERE,

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.651
I BELIEVED IN WHAT
WE WERE DOING.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:27.221
NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.822
- WHAT?

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:33.093
- BUT THERE IS, UH,
ONE THING I KNOW.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.230
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST JAG-OFF
I'VE EVER WORKED FOR.

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.831
- FORREST...
- AND I HOPE THIS PLACE--

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.100
UGH--

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.203
BURNS TO THE GROUND
WITH YOU IN IT,

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:48.108
BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DESERVE,

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:53.447

CHICKEN[bleep] MOTHER[bleep].

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.617
OH, BOY.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.053
YOU CALL YOURSELF A MANAGER?

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:04.057
YOU COULDN'T MANAGE
A HAM SANDWICH!

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.628
[clears throat]
OKAY, I AM LEAVING HERE,

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:11.198
AND I AM NEVER COMING BACK,

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:14.468
NOT IF YOU BEG ME!

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.737
WHO'S WITH ME?

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:22.309
- I AM!
- OH.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.611
- IF MR. FORREST GOES, I GO!

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.313
- OH, GOD.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.418
- YOU COULDN'T MANAGE
A HAM SANDWICH!
