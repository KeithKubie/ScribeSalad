00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 align:start position:0%
and when you look at what happened I
 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.259 align:start position:0%
and when you look at what happened I
think<00:00:46.300><c> with</c><00:00:46.540><c> financial</c><00:00:47.440><c> institutions</c><00:00:48.269><c> you</c>

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 align:start position:0%
think with financial institutions you
 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.030 align:start position:0%
think with financial institutions you
know<00:00:49.420><c> the</c><00:00:49.659><c> dollars</c><00:00:50.110><c> that</c><00:00:50.140><c> people</c><00:00:50.559><c> talk</c><00:00:50.769><c> about</c>

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
know the dollars that people talk about
 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
know the dollars that people talk about
is<00:00:51.250><c> sort</c><00:00:51.550><c> of</c><00:00:51.610><c> trillions</c><00:00:52.479><c> of</c><00:00:52.629><c> dollars</c><00:00:53.159><c> so</c><00:00:54.159><c> I</c><00:00:54.760><c> and</c>

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 align:start position:0%
is sort of trillions of dollars so I and
 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:56.790 align:start position:0%
is sort of trillions of dollars so I and
the<00:00:55.780><c> reason</c><00:00:56.080><c> for</c><00:00:56.110><c> that</c><00:00:56.260><c> is</c><00:00:56.409><c> because</c><00:00:56.440><c> of</c><00:00:56.680><c> the</c>

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because of the
 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because of the
leverage<00:00:57.070><c> it's</c><00:00:57.489><c> not</c><00:00:57.610><c> because</c><00:00:57.850><c> of</c><00:00:57.879><c> the</c><00:00:58.059><c> equity</c>

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 align:start position:0%
leverage it's not because of the equity
 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
leverage it's not because of the equity
that<00:00:58.570><c> was</c><00:00:58.690><c> involved</c><00:00:59.080><c> so</c><00:00:59.229><c> I</c><00:00:59.260><c> think</c><00:00:59.530><c> on</c><00:00:59.699><c> I</c><00:01:00.699><c> think</c>

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 align:start position:0%
that was involved so I think on I think
 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.969 align:start position:0%
that was involved so I think on I think
there<00:01:01.540><c> was</c><00:01:01.570><c> just</c><00:01:01.780><c> a</c><00:01:01.900><c> real</c><00:01:02.379><c> lack</c><00:01:02.710><c> of</c>

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 align:start position:0%
there was just a real lack of
 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
there was just a real lack of
understanding<00:01:03.100><c> and</c><00:01:03.960><c> it</c><00:01:04.960><c> was</c><00:01:05.049><c> easier</c><00:01:05.440><c> to</c><00:01:05.500><c> sort</c>

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 align:start position:0%
understanding and it was easier to sort
 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.590 align:start position:0%
understanding and it was easier to sort
of<00:01:06.010><c> pick</c><00:01:06.310><c> on</c><00:01:06.430><c> hedge</c><00:01:06.610><c> funds</c><00:01:06.880><c> because</c><00:01:07.240><c> people</c>

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
of pick on hedge funds because people
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
of pick on hedge funds because people
believe<00:01:07.630><c> that</c><00:01:07.900><c> banks</c><00:01:08.320><c> were</c><00:01:08.440><c> safe</c><00:01:08.680><c> and</c><00:01:09.299><c> I</c><00:01:10.299><c> think</c>

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 align:start position:0%
believe that banks were safe and I think
 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
believe that banks were safe and I think
what<00:01:10.840><c> was</c><00:01:11.110><c> clear</c><00:01:11.590><c> and</c><00:01:11.770><c> what's</c><00:01:12.310><c> been</c><00:01:12.460><c> shown</c><00:01:12.670><c> is</c>

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 align:start position:0%
what was clear and what's been shown is
 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
what was clear and what's been shown is
you<00:01:13.780><c> know</c><00:01:13.899><c> that</c><00:01:13.930><c> is</c><00:01:14.590><c> really</c><00:01:15.009><c> the</c><00:01:15.130><c> banks</c><00:01:15.430><c> that</c>

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 align:start position:0%
you know that is really the banks that
 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know that is really the banks that

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
yeah<00:01:20.470><c> I</c><00:01:20.500><c> mean</c><00:01:20.680><c> I</c><00:01:20.740><c> think</c><00:01:20.770><c> there</c><00:01:21.100><c> is</c><00:01:21.130><c> I</c><00:01:21.610><c> think</c>

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think there is I think
 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.610 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think there is I think
part<00:01:22.630><c> of</c><00:01:22.660><c> the</c><00:01:22.750><c> reason</c><00:01:22.780><c> is</c><00:01:23.170><c> there's</c><00:01:23.350><c> a</c><00:01:23.440><c> big</c>

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 align:start position:0%
part of the reason is there's a big
 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.010 align:start position:0%
part of the reason is there's a big
focus<00:01:23.950><c> on</c><00:01:27.000><c> that</c><00:01:28.000><c> people</c><00:01:28.480><c> want</c><00:01:28.690><c> to</c><00:01:28.780><c> sort</c><00:01:28.960><c> of</c>

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 align:start position:0%
focus on that people want to sort of
 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
focus on that people want to sort of
monetize<00:01:29.700><c> the</c><00:01:30.700><c> value</c><00:01:31.300><c> that</c><00:01:31.330><c> they</c><00:01:31.630><c> have</c><00:01:31.810><c> in</c><00:01:31.930><c> a</c>

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 align:start position:0%
monetize the value that they have in a
 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.830 align:start position:0%
monetize the value that they have in a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
company and by doing that you go public
 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
company and by doing that you go public
I<00:01:35.260><c> think</c><00:01:36.010><c> being</c><00:01:36.160><c> private</c><00:01:36.910><c> there's</c><00:01:37.510><c> a</c><00:01:37.630><c> huge</c>

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 align:start position:0%
I think being private there's a huge
 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.290 align:start position:0%
I think being private there's a huge
amount<00:01:38.170><c> of</c><00:01:38.410><c> benefits</c><00:01:38.800><c> and</c><00:01:38.950><c> being</c><00:01:39.160><c> private</c><00:01:39.610><c> but</c>

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 align:start position:0%
amount of benefits and being private but
 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.150 align:start position:0%
amount of benefits and being private but
ultimately<00:01:40.750><c> the</c><00:01:40.960><c> reason</c><00:01:41.140><c> people</c><00:01:41.590><c> go</c><00:01:41.920><c> public</c>

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately the reason people go public
 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately the reason people go public
is<00:01:42.520><c> to</c><00:01:43.330><c> monetize</c><00:01:43.840><c> and</c><00:01:44.230><c> to</c><00:01:44.320><c> capture</c><00:01:44.710><c> that</c><00:01:44.740><c> value</c>
