00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.910
You might have noticed that moving
the decimal place to the right

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.430
decreases the power that 10 is raised
to, and that moving the decimal place

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.730
to the left increases
the power the 10 is raised to.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.270
So, every time we move the decimal
to the right one place,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.740
as we do with .27 to 2.7,
we have to take

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.881
one away from the number that 10 is
raised to, so we go from 10 to 9.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.650
These numbers are not written
in scientific notation.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.191
For each number, correct it, so
that it is written in scientific

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:37.816
notation by first entering what
the decimal should look like, and

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:41.546
then, entering what power
10 should be raised to.

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:42.824
I'll help with the first one.

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:49.741
33 times 10 to the 3rd should
be 3.3 times ten to the 4th.

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:54.370
If you're having trouble, it might
help to write out the full number, and

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.270
then, turn it into scientific notation.
