00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.680
In this lesson we covered some pretty advanced topics,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.200
and I hope you enjoyed them or were able

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.470
to follow along. But let's actually see if we

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.260
can summarize these ideas into four main points. Point one,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.600
pharmacogenetics is the study of how our genes influence

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.970
our reactions to particular drugs. Point two, pharmadynamics concerns

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.490
itself with, what a drug does to your body,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.700
specifically how it binds to a particular protein and creates

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.690
a particular effect. Point three, pharmacokinetics is about what your

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.830
body does to a drug, in other words, how your body metabolizes or clears

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.240
the drug from its system. And point four, genetic variability in the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.990
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic pathways influences the

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.430
toxicity and efficacy of a drug.
