00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.180
 Did you ever know that in 1998, "Psycho" was released from "Vince Von" in a role 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.160
 Norman Bates? - I think we each have a special trap tied to it 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.900
 The film failed at the public and monetary level 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.070
 It is almost just re-making a snapshot of the original, making it a good case study 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.060
 In knowing why the original was very good, we can compare the two to reflect 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.660
 The nuances between them and find out why those differences are important, and how they are made 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.400
 From the original "Psycho" much better. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.060
 Let's talk specifically about the end. How did the original film end? 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.930
 What did Hitchcock leave with him? Most people remember Norman Bates' look to the camera however 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.530
 But it actually ends up with the car pulling out of the mud. The snapshot keeps on 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.380
 Bad taste in our mouths because we know what is in the trunk of the car 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.070
 Not to mention that she was photographed from the center as she headed towards us 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.430
 Movie Replay The end begins the same way but ends with a panoramic motion 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.330
 To reveal the landscape while the Tatar rises. Which completely destroyed the end 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.180
 We are supposed to end up feeling disgusted and uncomfortable but in a panoramic motion 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.470
 Brings us back to the world with its familiar sights and cars moving through it 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.830
 The end of the original "Psycho" is much better because it is disgusting. 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.740
 If the camera moved away from this teasing picture and finished 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.370
 In the familiar situation, we emerge from the story and the case of murder and return again 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.420
 To society 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.900
 This is not the correct way to end the movie. The end of "Psycho" replays are closer to 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.680
 End of the film where driving in the sunset. This kind of footage is where 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.700
 We emerge from the original story and return to our world. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.000
 It is also a snapshot where our main characters - who have gone through a misfortune of some sort - 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.909
 They are actually moving away from the camera to complete their journey 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.390
 This type of finish is a lot of Western films but it is still widespread in 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.310
 Modern films only with a few modifications 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.850
 At present it can be a car instead of a horse or street corner instead of 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.270
 Beautiful sunset. It is a very comfortable end. See something familiar 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.960
 It also makes you cinematic that the story is over and we're back to 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.680
 The real world 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.159
 "Twelve Angry Men" ends with the men - who gathered to speak by virtue 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.610
 Innocence of the child - return to the real world. A world where the American justice system 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.210
 His role and people are convicted only if they have already committed a crime 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.900
 It's a comfortable end and integrates with a theme that inspires a good feeling that is 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.409
 Even the most stubborn people can listen to logic and change their views 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.310
 Not very easy or very nice. But do not say that all the ends are driving in 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.080
 In the sunset leave a good feeling. 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.530
 What about a serial killer 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.610
 Back to society? Now this is a scary end. - I wish we could chat more but .. 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.150
 - I will meet an old friend at dinner. Similarly, a door closes at the end represents 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.620
 Beautiful code to finish the movie 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.800
 This is a material chapter now. Where the door literally closes on 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.459
 Adventure 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.880
 Also very common. You can even use it to separate two main characters inside 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.420
 The story, which Francis Coppola has done and perhaps is the film's last ending 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.420
 in history! 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.290
 "The Searchers" also has a start shot at the door entrance 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.680
 John Wayne enters the desert. Then we have the end shot showing him as he goes 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.310
 Across the same entrance. This end symbolizes that our hero returns to 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.310
 The wild that came from them. 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.040
 Another common end: is when there is a link between the end shot and the start shot. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 A great video, with a montage of start and end shots side by side, 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 You can find it on the Vimeo site, many of which are related to each other. 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.250
 The goal of this type of end is to show a snapshot similar to the start cat 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.700
 But now that you've seen the movie, it should be a different feeling 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.030
 The start shot is the first impression the film tells of his story. And the film 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.269
 It ends with something similar to what it started. The last shot is always what 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.450
 Will give a different feeling because after the film tells his story, the shot became 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.959
 With a completely different meaning. In the second part of "Godfather", the shot is the same but Michael Corleone 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.190
 No longer. In the film "Gone Girl" he uses a violent perception 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.269
 Referring to his wife. 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:40.620
 - I imagine I smashed her beautiful head empty her brain to try to 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.930
 Get answers! In the last shot we know why. It's fun to think about movies 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.409
 Because the end can carry some of the main ideas of the film. the difference between 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.769
 Between the start and end shots is that the start shot gives a hint of these ideas 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.190
 While the end shot confirms it, it looks like the director is lighting 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.840
 The most important part of the film 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.470
 So go and watch the end of your favorite movie again. Maybe looking for a code 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.680
 What do you think the badminton symbolizes in "Forrest Gump"? There is no right or wrong answer 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.310
 But we know what the director wants you to notice. What the movement 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.720
 Which leaves you with it? 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.930
 This is the most important feeling in the film. Because what you come out of 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.790
 The showroom is what really matters. 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.669
 So try it out. This leaves you with the sarcastic ending of "Simpsons" 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.310
 For the end of the film "Godfather". Because I love "The Simpsons" 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.310
 thanks for watching
