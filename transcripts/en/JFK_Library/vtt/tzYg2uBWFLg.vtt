- I actually kind of found it by chance.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.080
I love history, politics and writing

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.853
so it was a perfect fit.

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.580
- It was such a great
opportunity to get to learn

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.040
about Howard Baker, his ability,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.000
his willingness to compromise

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.630
and his genuine attempt to
bring everyone together.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.943
These are traits that can
apply to my life as well.
