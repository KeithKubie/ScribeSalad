00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.529
The Queen of Baseball

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.350
On August 14, 1922, a collection of baseball
stars gathered at Fenway Park in Boston.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.750
An exhibition all-star game had been set-up
to honor and raise money for the family of

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.939
Tommy “Little Mac” McCarthy- Boston Red
Sox great in the 1880s and 1890s.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.670
The game featured the Boston Red Sox, World
Series champs only three seasons ago, versus

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.650
a group of professional baseball players,
some who actually played in the majors and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.990
others who made their living barnstorming.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.000
About half-way through the game, Lizzie Murphy,
the proclaimed “Queen of Baseball,” subbed

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.620
in to play first base.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.200
Met with jeers – and even louder cheers
– her entrance into the game made history;

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.399
Lizzie Murphy had become the first female
to play in a baseball game against major league

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.399
players.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.579
But that wasn’t and wouldn’t be the only
time Lizzie “Spike” Murphy would make

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.900
baseball history.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.620
She made something of a habit of it, in fact.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.680
While baseball was her true love, Lizzie was
born an athlete.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.949
She participated in everything from ice hockey
to soccer to swimming to long-distance running

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.820
in her hometown of Warren, Rhode Island during
the early 1900s.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.230
She told a reporter once, in 1941, that she
“always loved boys’ sports.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.480
They’re so active, they wake you up.”

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.540
She was such a good ice skater that her brother
Henry claimed that no boy or girl could even

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.820
come close to keeping up with her on the ice.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.250
But baseball was what she wanted to play.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.510
Lizzie’s father was an avid amateur baseball
player himself when he had time off from his

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.930
job at the mill.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.460
He encouraged Lizzie, thinking her tomboy
phase was eventually going to pass anyway.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.920
As for her mother, she didn’t love the idea
of her only daughter being so into sports.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.700
Despite this, everyone could see Lizzie was
destined for the baseball life.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.960
Henry would play catch with her, wincing as
her fastballs smacked his glove.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.280
As was customary back then for children of
working-class families, when she turned twelve,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.170
Lizzie left school and took a job, in her
case working in the Parker woolen mill as

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.650
a ring spinner.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.020
That still didn’t stop her from playing
baseball.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.790
She played after work, on the weekends- whenever
she could.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.800
In an interview with Sports Illustrated in
the early 1960s, she said,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.080
“Even then, when I was too small to play,
I used to beg the boys to let me carry the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080
bats.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.880
Finally, I was allowed to join the team for
only one reason: I used to ‘steal’ my

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.170
father’s gloves and bats and bring them
along, so I was a valuable asset to them when

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.540
I could furnish some of the equipment.”

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.610
She immediately left her mark with the boys
and soon was the first player chosen in nearly

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.610
every game.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.840
In fact, she was so good that by the age of
15, she was playing with men on local business

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.890
teams like the Warren Shoe Company.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.930
At 17, she became a professional and signed
on to play for a Warren semi-pro club.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.080
Though her skills were immense, it wasn’t
lost upon the team’s owner that Lizzie was

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.520
an attraction and could bring in a crowd.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.360
In those days, fans in these leagues didn’t
typically pay admission to the games, but

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.570
rather a hat was passed around after the nine
innings and coins were thrown in.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.900
The owners would divvy up payment when this
concluded.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.460
After her first game on the semi-pro club,
Lizzie received no payment.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.650
The next week, the team had a game scheduled
in Newport, Rhode Island.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.480
A wealthy port town with a fine amount of
sailors looking forward to seeing Lizzie’s

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.530
strawberry hair under her cap; the owner thought
he was going to make a healthy profit that

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.910
day in Newport.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.060
As the story goes, Lizzie showed up all week
long to practice and workouts, never once

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.250
mentioning her “forgotten” payment.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.319
On Saturday morning, mere hours before the
game, as everyone got ready, Lizzie approached

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.810
the owner and told him “No money, no Newport.”

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.630
Without much choice or leverage at this stage
with so many coming to see Lizzie play, the

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.180
owner agreed to pay her a five dollar flat
rate (about $121 today) every game from then

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.500
on, plus a share of the collection.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.459
Because of this, Lizzie Murphy made history,
becoming the first known female holdout in

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.750
professional sports.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.530
A few years later, she was signed by the Providence
Independents and, then, by Ed Carr’s All-Stars

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.780
of Boston.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.020
Said Carr at the time of the signing to a
group of reporters,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.590
“No ball is too hard for her to scoop out
of the dirt and when it comes to batting,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.590
she packs a mean wagon tongue.”

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.940
The team traveled across southern New England
and, then, into Canada, pulling in crowds

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.200
wherever they went.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.120
It was estimated that they played well over
a hundred games during the season, which lasted

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.620
from April to August.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.390
Boasted Carr to reporters,
“She swells attendance and she’s worth

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.390
every cent I pay her.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.630
But more important, she produces the goods.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.310
She’s a real player and a good fellow.”

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.180
Besides being a good baseball player, Lizzie
also had a good head for making money and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.380
marketing herself.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.820
To supplement income, she would go into the
crowd herself after games, selling picture

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.770
postcards of herself in uniform for a dime.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.020
She liked to say whatever town bought the
most postcards was her favorite town.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.740
She also wore the same uniform as all the
men – save for one pretty notable exception.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.770
The front of her shirt didn’t have the team’s
name, but rather “Lizzie Murphy” stitched

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.919
across it, as evident in a picture of her
at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.900
She wanted to make sure everyone knew that
the woman the fans had paid to see was, in

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.140
fact, playing first base, and what her name
was.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.070
Despite Murphy getting most of the attention,
she never had any issues getting along with

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.070
her teammates.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.220
She once told the Providence Journal that,
she “didn’t have any trouble with the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.220
boys.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.740
Of course, they cursed and swore, but I knew
all the words.”

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.490
Well, there was one incident in that 1922
all-star game.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.290
After Lizzie entered the game, in that same
inning, there was a sharp grounder to third.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.380
Legend has it (and according to Murphy’s
recollection), the third basemen held on to

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.990
the ball and waited for the runner to get
closer to first.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.330
He then zipped the throw hard and wide.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.530
Murphy, like she’d done throughout her life,
handled what was thrown at her with ease.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.970
She caught the ball for the out.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.120
Reportedly, the third baseman turned to the
shortstop and said, “She’ll do.”

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.010
As Murphy said later to Sports Illustrated,
“What he didn’t know was that I liked

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.520
fast ones better than slow.”

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.389
Lizzie would go on to have two more firsts.

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.699
In 1928, she played on a National League all-star
team (in a game against the Boston Braves),

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.020
becoming the first person of any gender to
play for all-star teams in both the American

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.470
and National leagues.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.290
She also became the first woman to play in
the Negro Leagues, when she played first base

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.050
for the Cleveland Colored Giants when they
came through Rhode Island.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.760
According to the Exploratorium, a museum in
San Francisco, Lizzy actually got a hit off

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.510
of legendary Negro League pitcher (and Baseball
Hall of Famer) Satchel Paige.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.870
Catcher Josh Gibson, one of the greatest power
hitters of all time and also eventual Cooperstown-inductee,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.200
was asked if Paige really had given Murphy
all he had.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.889
Gibson responded with an angry “Of course,
he did!” because Paige would have never

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.669
wanted to have the embarrassment of giving
up a hit to a woman.

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.580
Lizzie Murphy hung up her spikes and jersey
for good in 1935 at the age of forty.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.890
She spent the rest of her life in her hometown
of Warren, passing away at the age of 70 in

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.690
1964.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.800
Bonus Facts:
• Because her mother was French-Canadian,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.580
Lizzie was fluent in French (well, Quebecian-French).

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.600
While playing in Quebec with Ed Carr’s team,
she overheard the first base coach telling

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.740
the runner to steal second, completely unaware
that Lizzie also spoke French.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.860
She called time and worked out a hand signal
with her catcher.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.009
The catcher threw out five runners attempting
to steal second that day.

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.870
• Lizzie Murphy may have been the first,
but she wasn’t the only woman to play against

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.210
major league men.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.740
In 1931, a pitched named Jacki Mitchell was
signed by the Class-AA Chattanooga Lookouts

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.669
and their owner Joe Engel.

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.509
A few days later, she pitched against the
New York Yankees – and their legends Babe

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:14.890
Ruth and Lou Gehrig.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.740
She promptly struck both of these gentlemen
out on six pitches combined.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.759
For her efforts, her contract was voided and
she was banned from the majors by Commissioner

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:29.610
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, stating that baseball
was “too strenuous” for women to play.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.830
• Babe Didrikson, another woman to play
against major leaguers, pitched in two exhibition

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.080
games for the Philadelphia Athletics, but
she was more known for her other athletic

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.960
achievements – most notably winning two
gold medals and one silver in track and field

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:56.879
in 
the 1932 Olympics.
