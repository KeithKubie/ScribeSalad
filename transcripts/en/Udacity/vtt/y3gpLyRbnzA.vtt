00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.910
Milk, it's one of my favorite drinks.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.772
&gt;&gt; Especially when you have fresh baked cookies

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.145
right out of the oven. I love it.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:11.000
&gt;&gt; Hm, but, not everyone can enjoy

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.260
such a delicious combination. After drinking milk

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.910
or other dairy products, like all food, it travels to the stomach, where the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.530
body continues to break down the food

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.900
into smaller components for energy. Now the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
cells within the stomach control what gets

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.940
into the body. Lactose, a main ingredient of

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.490
all dairy products, is composed of two smaller

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.280
sugars that together are too big to get past

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.700
the stomach cell lining. So these cells produce an

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.150
enzyme called lactase, that is secreted to digest the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.400
two ring lactose into the separate sugars, glucose and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.458
galactose, which can readily pass through the stomach's cell

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:48.360
lining, into the body for further metabolism. Without lactase,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.240
lactose would travel right through the body undigested until

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.400
it reaches the colon where bacteria end up breaking the lactose down using

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.870
a fermentation process that produces a lot of gas. This also throws off

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.080
the water balance in the body, leading to an increased flow of water

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.260
to the bowels which results in, you guessed it, symptoms of lactose intolerance.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.530
&gt;&gt; That sounds like no fun. I don't think I'd like to be lactose intolerant.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.860
&gt;&gt; It's really not that bad guys.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.890
&gt;&gt; Hey Hsiao-Lu, I didn't know you were lactose intolerant.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.470
&gt;&gt; That's right,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.460
I am. As a baby, I was able to drink

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.140
milk. But as I got older, I stopped being able to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.850
process it. So, what that means is that I'm unable to

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.040
eat anything that contains dairy products, like cheese and ice cream.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.346
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:29.058
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but.

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:30.058
&gt;&gt;

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:29.964
[LAUGH]

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:32.830
&gt;&gt; You know, the consequences are such that you want to avoid them.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.768
&gt;&gt; Genetically speaking, why do you think

00:01:34.768 --> 00:01:37.680
Hsao-Lu's lactose intolerant? Choose one of these

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.630
answers, and then tell me why by typing a response in this text box.
