00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.959
The creation of the Village People is directly
attributed to French composer and producer

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.670
Jacques Morali, a gay man who wanted to create
disco music gay men would appreciate.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.240
Moreli, a legendary disco beat-smith who was
responsible for producing a string of disco

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.020
hits in the early 1970s, was approached by
a struggling singer called Victor Willis with

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.439
a demo tape in 1977.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.800
Morali liked the demo and came up with the
idea of packaging Willis as a member of a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.120
group called, you guessed it, Village People.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.030
As to why he chose the name, Village People,
this was a nod to the thriving gay community

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.190
in Greenwich Village, New York.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.280
Morali, using his clout in the disco world,
saw to it that his new creation was signed

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.700
to Casablanca records and soon after the Village
People released their first self-titled album

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.690
in 1977, with Willis the only member of the
“group”.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.850
To maintain the illusion that Village People
was an actual group and not a carefully crafted

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.390
gimmick, Morali employed extensive use of
vocal layering and backup singers while recording

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.890
and mixing the aforementioned album.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.560
Initially there was little problem with there
only being one Village Person, but soon enough

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.259
the album started gaining traction and the
“group” began receiving offers to perform

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.509
live in clubs around New York.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.959
As he couldn’t just send Willis out to sing
on his own, Morali hired a team of dancers

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.710
and backup singers to support Willis on stage.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.289
So where do the crazy outfits the group wear
come into this?

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.840
Again, Morali was looking to craft a band
that would appeal to and somewhat represent

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.889
certain facets of gay culture at the time.

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:46.650
It was during the process of researching how
best to implement that when inspiration struck.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.789
According to Morali’s business partner,
Henri Belolo, the look of the Village People

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.369
was inspired by an experience he and Morali
had in a Greenwich gay bar, Les Mouches, which

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.569
was having something of a costume ball.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.329
Specifically Belolo would recall in an interview
with disco-disco.com that,

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.719
I was talking to the gay community about what
they liked, what they wanted to listen to

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.289
musically, and what was their dream, their
fantasy.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.040
One day [producer Jacques Morali and I] were
walking in the streets of New York.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.380
I remember clearly it was down in the Village,
and we saw an Indian walking down the street

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.230
and heard the bells on his feet.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.790
We followed him into a bar.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.620
He was a bartender — he was serving and
also dancing on the bar.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.849
And while we were watching him dancing and
sipping our beer, we saw a cowboy watching

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:28.930
him dance.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.900
The Frenchman Morali, who was already a bit
enamoured by American culture and stereotypes,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.840
had a lightbulb go off in his head.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.430
He stated in an interview with Rolling Stones,
“I say to myself, ‘You know, this is fantastic’—to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.349
see the cowboy, the Indian, the construction
worker with other men around.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.090
And also, I think in myself that the gay people
have no group, nobody to personalize the gay

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.200
people, you know?…”

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.349
Thus, he ultimately approached the man dressed
as a stereotypical depiction of a Native American,

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.450
Felipe Rose.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.590
Rose explained that he chose that outfit as
his father was Lakota Sioux.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.319
As they got to know each other, Morali laid
out to Rose his plan for a new disco group.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.459
Rose stated of this,

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.620
Jacques showed me a sketch drawing of what
looked to me like the group, with me drawn

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.960
in, and a cowboy and construction worker and
a biker.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.379
He said, “We’ve built a group around you
darling, and I’m gonna make you famous.”

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.900
I thought, “Oh God.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.469
Jesus Christ, what is this man doing?

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.890
This is an awful idea.”

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.049
Eventually Morali nailed down all of the roles
that he believed were simultaneously universally

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.760
recognisable (at least to the American man)
and embodied the macho, masculine ideals he

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.170
felt typified that particular element of the
gay scene.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.900
These were soldier, police officer, construction
worker, cowboy, biker, Native American and

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.870
sailor, some combination of which has served
as the basis of the group ever since.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.569
To fill out these roles, Morali placed an
ad in the paper that simply read:

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.150
Macho Types Wanted: Must Dance And Have A
Moustache.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.360
As the group already had its Native American,
the casting was to find the construction worker,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.680
cowboy and biker (also sometimes referred
to as the leather man).

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.900
Oddly, Willis himself initially didn’t wear
a costume on stage (something you can see

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.061
in early music videos released by the group)
and it wasn’t until the group’s fame grew

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:18.470
that he decided to dress as either a policeman
or a sailor when performing.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.590
Another early member of the group, Alex Briley,
similarly performed sans a costume, but quickly

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.410
adopted the persona of an all-American GI
when the “look” of the group became one

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.990
of its trademark selling points.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.231
It should be noted here that, contrary to
popular belief, being gay was not a prerequisite

00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:38.820
of being in the band and several band members
over the years were/are not.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.520
As original band member (cowboy) Randy Jones,
who is gay, noted:

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.300
We didn’t start as a gay group, and not
everyone in the group was gay — that’s

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.820
an incorrect notion…

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.420
The Village People was a mixture of ethnicity,
races, lifestyles, sexualities, sexual orientations,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.420
it was a true village.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.590
It was a mixture of everything…

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.470
Despite this, given their band was specifically
formed by Morali to represent gay subculture,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.150
it’s no surprise that not only was their
iconic look crafted to reference said culture,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.820
but many of their songs are dripping with
double-entendres and references that mainstream

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.530
audiences at the time generally missed, which
was a very good thing for the popularity of

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.540
the band given attitudes of the era in which
the band was topping the charts.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.450
Nowhere is this more apparent than the Village
People’s biggest hit, “Y.M.C.A.”

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.390
Morali was inspired to write the song after
seeing the letters on the side of a building

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.170
and asking what they meant.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.190
Band member David Hodo (construction worker)
later recalled,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.010
It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography
session on 23rd Street.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.120
Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd
and asked, “What is this YMCA, anyway?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.730
“And after laughing at his accent, we told
him the Y was a place where you could go when

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.720
you first came to New York when you didn’t
have any money — you can stay there for

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.780
very little.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.780
And of course, someone joked, “Yeah, but
don’t bend over in the showers.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.910
“And Jacques, bless his heart, said, “I
will write a song about this!”

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.380
In a retrospective of the song’s genesis
and eventual success, the aforementioned Randy

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.410
Jones expanded upon this story, stating:

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.510
I took Jacques there three or four times in
1977, and he loved it.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.230
He was fascinated by a place where a person
could work out with weights, play basketball,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.590
swim, take classes, and get a room.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.030
Plus, with Jacques being gay, I had a lot
of friends I worked out with who were in the

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.460
adult-film industry, and he was impressed
by meeting people he had seen in the videos

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.690
and magazines.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.300
Those visits with me planted a seed in him,
and that’s how he got the idea for “Y.M.C.A.”…

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.660
Hodo would further ring in on of the song,
“Y.M.C.A. certainly has a gay origin.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.460
That’s what Jacques was thinking when he
wrote it, because our first album [1977’s

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.190
Village People] was possibly the gayest album
ever.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.340
I mean, look at us.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.520
We were a gay group.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.770
So was the song written to celebrate gay men
at the YMCA?

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.770
Yes.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.770
Absolutely.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.770
And gay people love it.”

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.840
Despite this, Michael Musto of the Village
Voice notes that Morali seemingly went out

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.790
of his way to write “every song with a plausible-deniability
factor that the Village People still use to

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.690
rebuff allegations of targeting a gay audience”.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.740
Or as professor at Johns Hopkins University
called Dr. Drew Daniel once so succinctly

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.740
put it:

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.070
The good, clean fun at the surface level of
the lyrics means that ‘Y.M.C.A.’ has this

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.030
incredible capacity to circulate in different
contexts.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.880
If people really thought they were singing
about gay hook-ups in the steam room, they

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.400
would not necessarily participate.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.910
As to how the now iconic moves that go with
the chorus of the song came about, the band

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.520
members themselves have mildly differing stories
as to the origin, though in all cases it would

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.000
seem it was an audience inspired set of moves,
rather than originally planned.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.120
For example, Randy Jones states,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.770
We were flying up from South America for the
show, and we worked on the choreography on

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.420
the airplane — handclaps, turning, marching
in place…stuff like that.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.360
Well, the audience at this particular taping
was a bunch of kids bused in from a cheerleader

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.360
camp.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.800
The first time we got to the chorus, we were
clapping our hands above our heads.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.900
And the kids thought it looked like we were
making a Y.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.850
So they automatically did the letters.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.340
We saw this and started doing letters with
them.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.800
It was purely audience-generated, which is
probably why it’s still so popular.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.630
And that’s great for me, because it keeps
the checks coming in every six months.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.110
So just to recap, a gay Frenchman created
the Village People, named them after a region

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.640
of New York known for its thriving gay community,
had them sing gay themed music aimed at gay

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.320
men in a gay way, including dressing in outfits
inspired directly by those worn by gay men

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.440
going clubbing.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440
Morali and co.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.880
ultimately pulled the whole thing off making
the band one of the most iconic of the disco

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.590
era all the while with few outside of the
gay community getting the references here,

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.620
which given attitudes of the era, if we were
Morali would have provided us with no end

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.450
of private chuckles.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.960
On a similarly humourous note, the music video
for the band’s hit In the Navy was notably

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:54.530
filmed on an actual frigate, the USS Reasoner
(whose motto was officially “Fidelity”),

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.680
thanks to the group’s manager securing a
deal with the U.S Navy.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.820
The deal was that the Navy would get to use
the song for free in Navy recruitment advertisements

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.850
and in return the band would be given access
to the military hardware for their shoot.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.290
What makes this particularly hilarious is
that around the same time the Navy was allowing

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.040
a group representing certain facets of gay
culture to sing aboard a Navy frigate about

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.920
the navy being a place “Where you can find
pleasure…”- with original intent to use

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.520
this music video in Navy recruitment ad campaigns-
they were spending millions of dollars attempting

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.810
to route out any gay people from their ranks…

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.380
These efforts included a hilariously inept
search for a woman named Dorothy, who they

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:38.490
were convinced knew every gay person in the
military.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:44.830
In further later efforts to get rid of any
lesbians as well, Vice Admiral Joseph S. Donnell

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.030
issued a memo noting how these women could
be identified.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.680
To quote him, “Experience has shown that
the stereotypical female homosexual in the

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.480
Navy is hard-working, career-oriented, willing
to put in long hours on the job and among

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.000
the command’s top professionals…”

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.420
(We can’t make this stuff up.)

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.680
In any event, unfortunately for the irony
of it all, the Navy ultimately scrapped plans

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.510
to use the Village People’s In the Navy
in their ad campaigns.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.250
In response to people getting offended by
the “cartoonish” depiction of a Native

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:22.260
American in the group, long time band member,
Felipe Rose, who as noted portrays said Native

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.710
American and whose father was Lakota, stated,
“Snap out of it!

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.710
Grow up!

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.510
I’ve had some tribal members speak up against
me, the headdress is certainly controversial,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:37.300
but I really only wear it for YMCA when we
perform it live to remind people of the image.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.660
No one’s ever told me I have a shitty job,
though.”

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.720
Fellow band member Eric Anzalone chimed in,
“Personal opinion: I do believe that the

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.660
world is moving towards a dangerous gray area
of political correctness.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.740
We take everything so literally that it sucks
the joy out of everything.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.580
If you remove it out of the decade we originated,
you’re not being true to when we hit our

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.580
mark.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:17.070
We’re a little campy and a little fun, so
let’s leave everything at 

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:25.460
the door!”
