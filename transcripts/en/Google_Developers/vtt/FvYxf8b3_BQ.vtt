PETE LEPAGE: Well, welcome
everybody.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.990
My name's Pete LePage.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.310
I'm a developer advocate
here at Google.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.020
And with me today, we've got a
very special group of people

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.010
to talk about Movi.Kanti.Revo,
the new Chrome experiment in

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.900
conjunction with the team
at Cirque du Soleil.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.510
With me, I've got a Nicole
McDonald, who was the creative

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.400
director on the project and
Gillian Ferrabee, who is a

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.800
creative director at
Cirque du Soleil.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.610
Nicole, why don't you introduce
yourself first,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.660
because you're up on screen.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.290
And then we'll have Gillian
introduce herself.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.790
NICOLE MCDONALD: Hi, I'm
Nicole McDonald.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.770
It's a pleasure to
be with you.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.126
I'm a creative director and
director specializing in

00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:54.420
interactive directing.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.670
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.130
Cool.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.690
And Gillian, do you want
to introduce yourself?

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.310
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Yeah hi,
I'm Gillian Ferrabee.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.540
I'm the creative director
at Cirque du Soleil.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.190
My title is creative director
of images and special

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.064
projects, which is mostly
anything to do with TV, film,

00:02:10.064 --> 00:02:11.100
and new media.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.560
And this project would fall
under special projects.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.470
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.180
All right, well, cool.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.190
So today, while we've got some
of these things going on, if

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.580
you guys have questions, things
that you want to ask of

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.160
folks, we've got a place where
you can ask questions at

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.170
goo.gl/5iDjh.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.960
The URL is there on screen.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.090
So if you have questions, things
that you want to know a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.640
little bit more about, feel
free to go and post your

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.670
questions there.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.810
And we'll take your questions
as we get towards the end of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.930
the session.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.970
So with that, I want to take it
over to Nicole to start and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.870
say, Nicole, when you started
thinking about this project,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.650
where did your initial
inspiration

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.540
come from for this?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.230
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, we
actually really researched

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.410
Cirque du Soleil, and the
brand, and also the live

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.840
shows, and we tried to figure
out where to bring the live

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.530
show into an interactive
space.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.450
And one of the inspirations
was magic.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.930
Magic is something that draws us
in, [INAUDIBLE] to the eye.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.210
It's visceral.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.880
There's emotion behind it, and
that's where we, kind of-- we

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.130
thought about magic.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.470
Magic [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.100
PETE LEPAGE: So what about the
magic of Cirque du Soleil sort

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.340
of brought you to
that experience?

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.780
What were some of the things
that you thought about that

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.776
would translate well
to the web?

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.513
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, one of
the things that I think Cirque

00:03:57.513 --> 00:04:02.140
du Soleil does extremely,
extremely well is, it kind of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.750
is a feast of sense.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.630
It's so beautiful, there's so
many colors, there's so many

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.770
things going on.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.900
It's just hyper,
hyper gorgeous.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.720
points, well, one of the points
that we wanted to be

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.340
careful of was that in a live
experience, we feel connected

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.630
in ways that we don't when
we sit behind a computer.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.895
And so one of our wants was to
really figure out how we could

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:38.820
get closer to the action and
experience it, maybe, in that

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.670
same way we would with
a live event.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.910
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.030
And Gillian, for you, as you
started to look at this

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.470
project and start thinking about
this project, where did

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.880
the inspiration come
from for you?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.210
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think for
us, the first meetings we had,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.840
the two things that came up as
themes in terms of bringing

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.230
Cirque du Soleil to the world
of the web was curiosity is

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.110
something that Cirque
creates for their

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.890
audience as a way to engage.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.540
So as Nicole said, it's magical,
and you want to

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.723
understand what's behind that
magic or where that magic is

00:05:12.723 --> 00:05:14.530
going to take you.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.080
So that idea of still being
able stretch people's

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.195
imagination and initiate
curiosity, which would give

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:25.970
someone the desire, then, to
move forward and into the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.180
experience, in the sense
of interactivity.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.285
And the other thing that came
up for us is adventure.

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:34.650
Because the web gives this sense
that you can access the

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.180
whole world.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.520
What's the edge of the map?

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.740
How far can you go?

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.850
And how wide can you reach?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.210
So [INAUDIBLE] came up with
curiosity, in the sense of

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.670
magic, and adventure.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.580
PETE LEPAGE: Cool I think, for
me, one of the really amazing

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.010
things about the web
is that we are

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.180
always pushing it forward.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.670
Or we're always trying
to push it forward.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.310
And that's certainly one of the
main components of Chrome

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.390
experiments is, like, we can
take the web here, and what we

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.770
do to push it to that
really neat thing?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.710
And how do we make it do
something it's never seen

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.760
somebody do before?

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.700
Nicole, when you started working
on this, how did the

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.120
technology affect your
inspiration?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.485
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, it's
actually going back to the

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:28.660
live shows.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.730
Even though you're not
necessarily interacting, it is

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.740
still a 3D experience.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.440
And one of the things that I
really wanted was to have it

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.530
be engaging in a
3D experience.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.970
And so that's where we came up
with the idea that we were

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.440
using a 2D world
in a 3D space.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.890
And so I think the technology
allowed us to really create a

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.360
layered environment.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.890
And that, I think, started to
snowball into, how do you

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.520
create a layered environment?

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.040
What does it do?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.210
How does it react?

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.680
Why does react?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.400
And I think that's a good
question is, why?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.386
Why use technology?

00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:16.560
And it's really to tell
more of a story.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.900
PETE LEPAGE: So you see
technology being a good way to

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.950
tell a better story and engage
with people in storytelling

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.185
and more dynamic experiences?

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:30.330
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, from
an artistic level, I think

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.870
technology is a paintbrush,
right?

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.330
So it's in size.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.662
You can either use a fat
one, or you use a

00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:38.270
smaller one for details.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.880
I think that technology is
also just a way-- it's an

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.920
outlet to communicate ideas.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.260
And the exciting thing about
it is, like you said, it's

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.410
never been done before.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.066
But also, we can pull in people
to dream in ways that

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.960
they haven't before.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.920
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.010
This is a question for
both of you guys.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.770
Before you came to the web, or
before you started playing

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:11.680
with technology, what is your
creative experiences based on?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.590
Did it come from painting,
drawing, or did it always

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.730
really exist around the web?

00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:20.850
NICOLE MCDONALD: Gillian?

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.330
[LAUGHS].

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.906
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow.

00:08:23.906 --> 00:08:26.110
Well, my personal history
goes way back.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.740
I've been performing and making
art since as long as I

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:30.810
can remember.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:36.380
My mother's a designer and an
artist and an educator.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.650
But for me, it's been
mostly live and some

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.655
drawing, music, singing.

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:47.480
But the primary has been live
audience, traditional and

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.990
nontraditional stage.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.700
PETE LEPAGE: OK

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.640
NICOLE MCDONALD: And for me,
my background has been

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.430
everything.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.685
You know, wit Christmas every
year, I got a new art kit.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.800
I was constantly a
little artist.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.020
I started, actually, in college
as a performance and

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.770
filmmaking and painting.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.020
[LAUGHS].

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.890
And then I immediately, after
college, went into games.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.830
And I painted sets for games.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.190
And that started my interest
in interactive.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.490
And so I took this fine
art world and

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.900
started making it digital.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.300
I was really quite lucky.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.730
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.100
Gillian, when Nicole and the
crew first sat down with you

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.870
guys and said, hey, here's this
really cool experience

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.850
that we're thinking about doing,
and showed some of

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.310
their inspiration and mood
boards, what did you think of

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.050
what they were showing and where
they were going with

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.460
some of these things?

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.780
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Well, the
first thing that was, I think,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.550
exceptional and almost magical,
really, to use the

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.720
word, was that we had prepared
a mood board, and there was

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.370
actually one image that we both
had chosen for our mood

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.330
board, of all that's possible
to find on the net.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.900
So that was kind of
mind blowing.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.230
When they presented their mood
board, we looked at each

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.150
other, like, we didn't give
that to them, did we?

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.730
No, we haven't talked
to each other.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.970
So there was an immediate
complicity and common vision

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.190
that was obvious from that and
from a few other things.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.580
And the other thing, from the
Cirque's point of view, that

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.910
was a strong indicator was--

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.200
I can't remember, I think was
Nicole, but somebody brought

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.460
up the idea of the screen, what
you might call the fourth

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.325
wall, and how to playfully
interact with your audience.

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:48.400
Like now, even, this is live,
we're talking-- how do you

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.730
interact through this new
form of communicator?

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.880
And that was something we were
definitely curious about.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.660
So those were the two things
that pretty much nailed it.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.443
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:10:59.443 --> 00:11:02.570
Nicole, what were your feelings
on those first couple

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.130
of meetings, when you sat down
and said, this is what we're

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:10.060
thinking, going from a really
web and creative background to

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.985
a company who's all
about doing live,

00:11:13.985 --> 00:11:16.950
in-person kind of stuff?

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.720
NICOLE MCDONALD: It was super,
super exciting, obviously, I

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.610
mean, I kind of a dream
come true, really.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:28.570
To work with such a creative,
imaginative, really

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.830
responsible company, that's
kind of rare.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:41.200
But I think the challenge of
it all was thrilling, to

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.930
really kind of crack open the
nut a little bit and be able

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.185
to do take a step into a
direction of interactive

00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:52.990
performing is super exciting.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.710
PETE LEPAGE: So as you started
working on some of this stuff

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.470
and sort of took the technology
with your vision,

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.750
how did the technology change
the way that you saw the

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:10.500
vision being done as you were
working through the project?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.828
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, I think
I'm a developer's worst

00:12:13.828 --> 00:12:19.165
nightmare in that [INAUDIBLE],
because I think I know enough

00:12:19.165 --> 00:12:24.790
of what technology can do, I
know where we can push it.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.550
I think that one of the
challenges for us, from a

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.850
development standpoint was,
could we get things in time?

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:38.110
Could different technologies be
available at that moment?

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.990
I think that was our
biggest challenge.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.680
PETE LEPAGE: So whether and
when technology came on,

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.384
whether you had access to it?

00:12:49.384 --> 00:12:52.090
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and I
think that usually the process

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.630
of how I work in an interactive
space is, we

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.840
dream, and then we kind
of dial it back.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.570
And then we become detectives
and solve problems, which is,

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.380
I think, the best-case
scenario.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.283
Solving problems means we move
forward, which is [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:14.460
PETE LEPAGE: Were there any
problems that you were really

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.640
proud of having solved with this
project, technology-wise,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.880
creativity-wise?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.670
NICOLE MCDONALD: That's a
really good question.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.643
I think you'll notice that
there's an incredible amount

00:13:24.643 --> 00:13:35.420
of layered sprites and divs,
figuring out what a system

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.280
could handle.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.760
And you dream big and so you
have, like, seven videos

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.520
playing, and all these
animations, and then there are

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.610
all these huge files.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.850
And then really figuring
out, OK, now we have--

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.858
it's not moving on a computer.

00:13:50.858 --> 00:13:52.550
So nobody can watch it.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.620
It looks great, but
nobody can see it.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.360
Really figuring out what
that wait was.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.765
So how do we turn this down, but
still, how do we maintain

00:14:01.765 --> 00:14:03.950
our vision?

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.405
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:14:05.405 --> 00:14:06.390
NICOLE MCDONALD: That was
definitely a big challenge.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.640
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.980
What was it like going through
the process of saying, OK, so

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.200
we've got our idea here.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.720
What did the workflow look like,
to say, all right, so

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.310
here's our idea, after those
first meetings with Cirque, to

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.132
then go and get to that
final project?

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:30.000
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, we took
some time and wrote the story.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.240
That was super fun, just
to tell the narrative.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.570
And then once we had the
narrative, we actually made it

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:42.025
a functioning animatic And then
from the animatic, it

00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:48.100
kind of gave us the answer of
flow and also an asset list,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.390
which was super important.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.410
PETE LEPAGE: For each of the
different scenes, yeah.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.670
NICOLE MCDONALD: And
then we shot it.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:01.280
And then at the shoot, we were
able to kind of pull in video

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.527
live and be able to see how it
moved and whether or not our

00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:08.740
horizon line was correct, or
overshooting it, or even just

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.020
if it was a worthwhile
experience.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.050
And then from there on,
it was just, go.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.560
PETE LEPAGE: And Gillian, how
did you see, and how did your

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.140
team work with Nicole to really
take that vision from

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.390
beginning to end?

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.154
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think the
main thing was keeping in

00:15:31.154 --> 00:15:36.000
touch all along the way so that
everybody had a sense of

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.150
what was happening, what
it looked like.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.120
Did it match what we wanted
and imagined?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.620
I can't think of any specific
obstacle, but I know that we

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.380
hit a bunch.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.950
And Nicole probably
remembers this.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.810
We would always say, well,
that's because something else

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.970
even better's going to
show up, which it

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.350
actually did, often.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.850
The part that was most
interesting, for us, I would

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.430
say, was the actual shoot and
watching how the artists,

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:11.990
themselves, how Nicole was able
to translate to them what

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.400
their work was going to look
like in the final product.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.200
Because a live performer knows,
they're onstage when

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.370
it's happening.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.330
So what they give comes
from that knowledge.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.870
And so Nicole was able to inform
them the context that

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.980
they were performing in, what
it would look like, and then

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.610
they were able to play and adapt
with that, which was

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.900
exciting for us to see that.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.760
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and
I think that's where the

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.270
animatic played an incredible
role, and also being able to

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.760
input stuff immediately live.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.060
In a green screen environment,
it's cold.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.980
There's no connection.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.720
And I think that was super
exciting that we were able to

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.085
show the artists where they were
in the space and really

00:16:57.085 --> 00:17:01.272
let them have that world and
take over that world.

00:17:01.272 --> 00:17:06.480
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, actually, I
just got some of the green

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.670
screen video set up so that we
can see have a quick peek at

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.599
that, I think.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.700
Let me see if I can get
that running here.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.450
There we go.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.210
So we've got some picture in
picture going so that folks

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.900
can see what's going on there.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.089
So this was the scene where
our guide jumps

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.569
backwards off the log.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:32.350
And you can see her there
on that blue screen.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.840
Nicole, as we run through that,
what was your process of

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.460
thinking through how to do these
things, because you see

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.890
just this blue screen.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.470
And the artist has really no
idea, we have really no idea,

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:49.755
until we see what's going
on, what to expect.

00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:51.340
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, what we
tried to do is to have some

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.270
key frames to show the artist
where they were in the space,

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.630
and also for us to be able
to plan appropriately.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.790
This is an A-camera.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.320
We don't have a B-camera to cut
to, so the entire scene is

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.100
first person POV.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.710
So we really needed to make sure
that there was a thread

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.655
throughout-- like a breadcrumb
trail continuous, throughout

00:18:17.655 --> 00:18:19.260
the experience.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:25.220
And with these frames, we were
also able to build out the 3D

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.720
experience, and then immediately
key the video and

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.370
put them into an environment
to help the artist see what

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.220
space they were working
in, and to--

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.220
what was the first film of Star
Wars that came out, where

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.240
they used blue screen
everywhere?

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.020
PETE LEPAGE: The remakes,
or the--

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:52.586
NICOLE MCDONALD: The new ones.

00:18:52.586 --> 00:18:53.400
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, yes.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.150
NICOLE MCDONALD: I just remember
how cold that was.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.770
There was no connection.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.980
And there was just
these two people

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.230
speaking to one another.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.480
We were joking and saying, we
do not want to create that.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.250
PETE LEPAGE: Gillian, for you
guys, was this the first big

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.810
web project that you guys had
worked on at Cirque du Soleil?

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.685
Or how had you guys worked
with the web before?

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.280
GILLIAN FERRABEE: It was
the first creative

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.630
project, I would say.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.880
Obviously Cirque has done lots
of marketing, and the company

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.385
website, and other, more
traditional, transitions to

00:19:32.385 --> 00:19:34.860
the web, doing things that
people were doing anyway,

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.130
before the web, but in
a different way.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.360
But this was the actual--

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.175
the content was created
for this project, and

00:19:41.175 --> 00:19:42.690
it was fully creative.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.160
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.950
PETE LEPAGE: Were you somewhat
skeptical at the beginning, or

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.700
did you think that we would
be able to create such an

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:58.040
immersive, Cirque-like
experience right off the bat?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.942
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I'm a highly
optimistic person, so I wasn't

00:20:00.942 --> 00:20:03.407
skeptical, because I
almost never am.

00:20:03.407 --> 00:20:05.790
But I would say there
were definitely lots

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.970
of people who were.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.180
And the minute we met Nicole and
their team, that went out

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.860
the window.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.860
Their enthusiasm--

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:19.750
and maybe they were as highly
optimistic, but they were the

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.180
experts, and they seemed really

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.080
excited that it was possible.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.320
So that schooled us
pretty quickly.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.570
PETE LEPAGE: That's
awesome, yeah.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.540
How would you describe the
difference between working

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.980
with a web experience and
working with a live show,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.304
starting something like that?

00:20:40.304 --> 00:20:42.400
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow, that's
a good question.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.650
It's completely different,
because, from the beginning,

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.120
your framework is
not a theater.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.070
It's not an audience.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.810
It's a platform, in a way.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:54.480
It's a tool.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.410
But there's much more unknown,
which can be exciting, except

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.540
that, when you're doing a show,
the parameters are very

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.080
concrete and practical.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.760
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.940
GILLIAN FERRABEE:
Go ahead Nicole?

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.090
NICOLE MCDONALD: I was just
going to say, I think it's

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.336
practical because it's known.

00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:16.951
Because we haven't defined the
process of interactive--

00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:20.460
there is no cookie cutter
process, necessarily.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:27.900
I think that that's the exciting
and the scary part.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.580
GILLIAN FERRABEE:
It's definitely

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.415
exciting for Cirque.

00:21:29.415 --> 00:21:32.120
And the first question we asked
ourselves is, what are

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.530
all the things that we can't do
in a live show because of

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:40.660
the parameters of time, or the
weight of something, or the

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.340
feasibility, visually?

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.890
The suspension of disbelief is
completely different live.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.865
So it's a very exciting
terrain.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.090
I mean, Cirque has always been
interested in the unknown, as

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.340
Nicole said.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.530
PETE LEPAGE: So what were some
of the things that, right off

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.160
the bat, when you said, what are
the things we can't do a

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.220
live show, what were some of the
things that you said, we

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.510
can't do, could we do
these on the web?

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.730
GILLIAN FERRABEE: The first
thing that comes up is, in the

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.170
web, you have, to some
degree more say how

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.030
the story is told.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.700
Because live, you don't
know where the

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.980
person's going to look.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.040
Which Cirque is a real master
of giving people lots of

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.490
things to look at and, in a way,
guiding their attention.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.170
So that's different.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.750
On the web, it gives more
of a traditional

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.240
storytelling process.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.690
And the other thing
is practical--

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.580
like, to get something onto
stage takes time.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.650
And to get it off takes time.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.690
And when you're shooting, you
can do that before you turn

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.560
the camera on for however
long it takes.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:03.540
So that's a very practical and
very creative examples.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.950
PETE LEPAGE: Were there any
things in the Movi.Kanti.Revo

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.760
experience that you pushed
to have them try

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.010
some of those things?

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.682
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Nothing
comes to mind because my

00:23:19.682 --> 00:23:22.530
experience is that Nicole
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.710
surprised us over and over.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.270
We didn't have time
to catch up.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.970
NICOLE MCDONALD: From our
perspective, I think it was

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.650
about, really, how to challenge
this experience of

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.940
intimate, a one-on-one
experience, whereas in the

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.260
theater, there's many, many
people around you.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.740
So how do I engage somebody in
the one-on-one experience?

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.890
And then also perspective--

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.990
we can gauge perspective
behind a computer.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.580
In a theater, you're
in a seat.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.220
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.140
that Cirque does an amazing
job doing many shows, like

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.040
you're moving around the space
as much as they're moving

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.430
around you.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.200
But I think that's a really
super interesting thing for

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.570
how to translate live experience
in the future is,

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.750
it's a virtual theater seat.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.200
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah actually,
that's a perfect segue into

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.263
the next question I have, which
is, what do you think

00:24:22.263 --> 00:24:26.240
that the web brings to
experiences that you can't do

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.960
in a live show?

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.030
And where do you see that going
and changing the way

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:40.840
some, not just Cirque shows, but
in all live entertainment

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.668
changes in the future?

00:24:43.668 --> 00:24:46.530
NICOLE MCDONALD: That's
a very good--

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:51.370
I mean, I don't really think we
know quite yet until we do.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:55.900
Because I think the wonderful
part of about doing stories

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.480
interactively is that every
single time, we find out

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.650
something new about a way to
engage somebody differently.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:08.650
And that's, I think, the part
of the process that is the

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.280
most challenging, because
it's almost like--

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.980
and I think this is why my
developers kind of hate me

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.480
sometimes-- not hate me,
but obviously, raise

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.560
their fist to me--

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.870
is because I think I'm
constantly using technology in

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.080
ways that it's not supposed
to be used.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.190
And that's how we
move forward.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.790
That's how we push the lines.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.970
PETE LEPAGE: I think one of the
things that really excites

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.510
me with the web is, it's
not always about--

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.690
the technology is not supposed
to used this way.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:45.450
It's that as browser vendors, or
as the people who make the

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:50.070
specifications develop stuff,
they say, hey, we think it's

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.310
going to get used this way.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.180
But then creative, brilliant
people like you guys come in

00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.030
and say, oh, hey, if I
do this and this, I

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.840
can get this to happen.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.530
And suddenly you get something
that's never really been seen

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.630
or done before.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.690
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, it's
like using a hammer for

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.495
something else other
than nailing.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.520
If there's a tool available,
then it can kind of push us

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.150
into ways that we don't
reveal yet.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.100
GILLIAN FERRABEE: One other
thing that comes to mind from

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:25.840
a live [? performance ?]

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.230
point of view is there is a
different kind of intimacy.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.990
As Nicole was saying, you can
move the camera into places

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.250
that you can't always
see from your seat.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.730
And then the other thing that's
way out there is the

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.040
web provides a different kind
of live, which is--

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.580
for instance, in the way that
if you're using an app,

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.250
sometimes you can see who else
is using it at that moment.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.250
There's a collective
participation over time and

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:59.130
space that you never have with
the limitations of 1,200

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.920
people from 8:00 to 10:30 or any
form of live experience.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.600
There's that potential for
a different kind of live.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.950
NICOLE MCDONALD: And a very
new and exciting unity.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.100
There's people that are coming
together that would never have

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.930
the opportunity to
come together.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.560
It's incredibly exciting.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.380
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.370
Well, let's talk about the
workflow, a little bit, of

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:31.330
taking some of the actual
practical things and putting

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:35.150
them onto the web into some
of those experiences.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.820
So Nicole, as you started going
through and saying, OK,

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.690
this is what I want some of
these scenes to look like, how

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.040
did you say--

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.830
for example, the tree
of life scene--

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.040
how did you translate that from
being something in your

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.310
head to being something very,
like, touch, like, I can go

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.575
and see that, I can
move around?

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.580
NICOLE MCDONALD: I think it's
that this is about sketching.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.155
We sketched the tree out.

00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:09.280
I kind of [? drew ?] the layout,
originally, handed it

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.500
to some very talented artists,
who painted it.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.490
PETE LEPAGE: Now, when you say
painted it, because we've got

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.670
a lot of different types of
folks who are watching this--

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.070
some may be a little bit more
like me, who are more

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.980
developer oriented.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:26.440
And for me, I know how to
write some angle bracket

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.460
markup-y like stuff, but
anything more than that, I

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.330
need your help.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.570
So what's painting it mean, and
how do you go about that?

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:39.910
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, I really
wanted the experience

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:45.180
to be very set designed, but
also touched by humans.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.660
So we actually literally
created paintbrushes in

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.460
Photoshop, and if you zoom into
some of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.050
the pieces, you'll actually see
the actual paint brushes

00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:01.660
of the artist that digitally
painted, in Photoshop, each of

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:07.750
the elements that we created.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.950
Because we wanted it to feel,
actually, a bit of Renaissance

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:15.560
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.570
I think you broke up there at
the last little second, but I

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.340
think you were saying
Renaissance paintings, and

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.370
each one was hand drawn.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.570
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah,
I'm breaking up.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.520
PETE LEPAGE: All right, well,
hopefully this will clear up

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.770
here in a second.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.620
So from the point where you
started taking each thing, and

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.480
turned each painting--

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.710
designed each scene in
Photoshop, where did it go

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:44.240
from there?

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.150
So you've got this great PSD
file that's potentially pretty

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:52.000
huge, and you can't just hand
that over to a developer.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.250
So what happened next?

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:03.760
NICOLE MCDONALD: Then we
had this huge PSD, and

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.220
we pulled it apart.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.230
Can you hear me, OK?

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.480
PETE LEPAGE: I can now.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.470
All right, looks like we've
lost you here for a sec.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.030
Let's see, Gillian, why don't
we pop over to you for a sec

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.140
and give it a sec for
Nicole's network

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.970
connection to come back.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:35.460
What was your favorite scene
in this project?

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.150
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.260
I sincerely love them all
for different reasons.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.960
They have different energies
and different flavor.

00:30:45.585 --> 00:30:46.690
I mean, the tree of life
was the one that

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.760
surprised me the most--

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.110
how moving it was, how effective
and how moving, when

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:57.690
he floats up at the end,
I was completely

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:58.690
surprised the first time.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.298
And then I really loved when the
user arrives at the fork

00:31:02.298 --> 00:31:04.850
in the road in the forest,
because it was just

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:05.370
delightful.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.970
The delight of this little
tricycle coming and then the

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:13.020
clown, and how that all works
so beautifully, the same way

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.135
it would've onstage, those are
the ones that I remember at

00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:17.480
this moment the most.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.970
PETE LEPAGE: Cool Nicole,
do we have you back?

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.720
No, looks like no Nicole yet.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.940
All right, well, I've got to
say, I think my favorite scene

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.440
was tree of life, as well.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.770
There was just something
absolutely beautiful about it

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:43.000
that really said--

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.420
between the growth of
everything, between the way

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.920
that you can go in and see all
of the different things

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.340
interacting and moving together,
it's just such a

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.100
beautiful thing.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.810
And in some ways, I think
that scene is kind of

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.140
a little bit sad.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.040
But it's also just so--

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.560
I feel like, it's a great big
circle, which is kind of fun,

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.840
something that you don't
typically see around

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.350
in stuff like that.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.326
All right, it looks like
we've got Nicole back.

00:32:13.326 --> 00:32:14.020
NICOLE MCDONALD: Sorry guys.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:14.810
PETE LEPAGE: That's OK.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.840
And it looks beautifully nice
and sunny there now.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.344
I'm jealous.

00:32:20.344 --> 00:32:21.190
Cool.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.910
Well, Nicole, we were talking
about taking that gigantic PSD

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:31.630
and turning it into something
that, as a developer, I could

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.010
go do something with.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.040
Do you want to talk about
that a little bit more?

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.480
NICOLE MCDONALD: Sure.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.800
So the PSD, one of things,
[INAUDIBLE] that we had to

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:45.430
kind of creative a layered PSD
that was appropriate for the

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.260
space in which we were
putting it in.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.450
So in other words, if we had
some trees, if there's trees

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.990
behind them, those trees behind
had to be painted.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:59.680
So in Photoshop, this huge,
layered file then got cut into

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.930
transparent [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.790
and optimized.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.880
And then we brought them into
the 3D space in HTML5.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.710
And that was kind of it.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:19.466
It was pretty long term in the
effort it took it to create,

00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:22.570
but once it was created,
it was executed fast.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:23.530
PETE LEPAGE: Very cool.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.500
And just as a reminder for those
folks who are watching

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.630
live right now, we do have a
place where you can go ask

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.920
questions if you have questions

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.610
for Gillian or Nicole.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.470
You can post your questions
there, and we'll take some of

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.700
those as we get towards the
end of the session.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:41.020
But the URL is up on
screen right now.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.190
Nicole, I had asked Gillian what
her favorite scene was.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.090
What's your favorite scene
in the experience?

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.340
NICOLE MCDONALD: That's
a good question.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:55.000
I think probably, the
tree of life.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.880
I think the barge performance,
I think, is really lovely.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.580
PETE LEPAGE: Which one was the
barge performance again?

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.600
NICOLE MCDONALD: The one with
the clown pulling the house,

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.620
and then the girls coming out
and dancing and performing.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:16.567
I loved the fork in the road.

00:34:16.567 --> 00:34:19.139
I like a lot of them.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:22.254
PETE LEPAGE: Which one do you
think you're most proud of?

00:34:22.254 --> 00:34:23.989
NICOLE MCDONALD: I think
the tree of life.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:27.210
I feel like that was the
closest to what I had

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.460
envisioned.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.210
The clown is just--

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.765
the fool in love is
so beautiful.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.139
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah it's pretty
pretty is slightly awkward to

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:41.710
say, but very true.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.260
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think what
people love about that is that

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.239
the poetry translates.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.820
It's a very poetic
representation of something.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.193
And everyone I've spoken
to got it.

00:34:53.193 --> 00:34:59.180
They got the metaphor, and they
understood and were very

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.060
moved at the end,
when he floats.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.750
So that's what struck me, is
how, again, this concept of

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.460
the web, and a screen, and how
such a depth of human poetry

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.070
can translate.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:11.990
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.390
That was for my grandfather,
actually.

00:35:16.484 --> 00:35:19.003
He's very connected
with family.

00:35:19.003 --> 00:35:21.050
He's just madly in
love with family.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.252
So I thought that was a nice
homage to my grandfather.

00:35:24.252 --> 00:35:25.240
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.490
PETE LEPAGE: Wow, that's
kind of neat.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.590
Gillian, how do think Cirque's
going to approach the web

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.470
differently because of this
experiment and the way that

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.760
people have been responding
to it?

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.590
GILLIAN FERRABEE: How are we
going to respond differently?

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.300
We're just really excited.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.100
It was a delight from
beginning to

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.780
end, the whole process.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:56.200
And people have responded
beyond our expectations,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:01.050
in-house and everybody
outside.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:05.330
So that only creates the
appetite to continue.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.370
That's basically what--in the
big picture, there's lots of

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:13.690
excitement around it and lots of
interest and ideas and just

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.220
general excitement.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.040
PETE LEPAGE: That's
really cool.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.330
And it's so neat to see this
kind of stuff really whetting

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.080
the appetite.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.310
One of the things that I hope
comes out of this and other

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.730
Chrome experiments is really to
get other developers, other

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:33.560
creatives excited, that they
can go do things on the web

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.390
that they've never seen
done before, right?

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:40.120
We've never seen a 3D world like
this built where you can

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.500
change the angles and interact
with it in such different and

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.640
neat ways until now.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.030
And this really has said,
hey, look, we can

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.770
do something neat.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.070
Why don't you go
try something?

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:04.940
In terms of the workflow, as you
started building this, to

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.950
jump back to that kind of stuff,
Gillian, how did you

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:13.240
see the workflow happening in
terms of working with a

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.640
company who wasn't necessarily
Cirque developers, and Cirque

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.280
designers, and Cirque people?

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.380
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Well again,
it was all new,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.050
I think, for us.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.870
I don't know for
Nicole's team.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:33.200
I would say Nicole's experience
with a diverse

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.420
background, having done film,
having done live performance,

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.220
meant that she knew how
to speak to us.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.980
I think that facilitated
a lot.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.710
And it was really the ongoing
sharing of just where

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:50.706
everybody was at, and a lot
of visual referencing.

00:37:50.706 --> 00:37:53.850
And then the big chunk
was the actual

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.180
shoot itself, obviously.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:00.020
That was, I would say, the peak
of the collaborative part

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.270
on a day-to-day basis.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.580
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.020
Well, we're getting a little
bit close to the end.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.420
I want to take a look at some
of the questions that we've

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.260
got from some folks who are
posting their questions.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.090
So one of the questions that
we've got is, where do you

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:25.560
think the web is going to be
with Cirque in 10 years?

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.020
And this is, I guess, for both
of you, because I think this

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.550
kind of interesting for both
of you guys to take.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.460
And I'm going to tack on a
little bit of an extra

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.810
sentence on there--

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.590
not just Cirque, but

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.250
performances and art in general.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:53.550
NICOLE MCDONALD: My hope is that
it's an experience that

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.360
we're participants in.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.380
I think that we've come close
to being able to be

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.470
engaged on the web.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.710
I would love to see performance,
especially on the

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:11.937
web, become about me feeling
connected in ways that I

00:39:11.937 --> 00:39:12.840
haven't before.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.870
And whether that's with touch
and call and response, meaning

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:22.840
if I touch somebody, do they
have goosebumps, suddenly?

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.710
If I touch them hard,
do they get bruised?

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:30.100
I think that's where
we're going.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.910
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:38.190
So new interactions and better
ways to touch the audience.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:43.990
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and
the audience is suddenly

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.730
participants.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:50.580
And it's kind of dictated by
their own personal experience

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.080
and desire.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.240
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.550
Gillian, what are
your thoughts?

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.310
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I mean, 10
years is a long way, in terms

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:02.640
of technology, to ever imagine
what's going to have happened.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.970
I think the two most exciting
things-- the first is, kind of

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:09.610
what Nicole was saying, but
I would say around the

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.816
refinement and sophistication of
kinesthetic interactivity.

00:40:13.816 --> 00:40:16.690
So that's something that Cirque
thinks about a lot,

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:22.700
which would allow for the user,
which is what we call

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.220
the name for the person now,
whereas we had a conversation

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.640
about it recently where, it
could go so fast, or there

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.080
could be so many dimensions that
it's not longer the user

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.230
and the web, but there's going
to be a whole sense of

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.960
possibilities of the user being
part of the art, and

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.330
influencing the art, and then
the art responding to that,

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.220
and there being so many
possibilities in

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.870
that that it really--

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.130
the line becomes more
and more blurred.

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.180
And then the other one is, I
think Nicole mentioned it

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.760
earlier, what the web provides
in terms of the opportunity

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.360
for people to find each other
that have more and more

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.380
specific things in common, and
how that's going to affect

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.630
art, per se.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.590
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that's
an interesting idea.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:15.060
So one of the questions that I
had, that I wanted to sort of

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.860
continue on with some of the
things we were talking about

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:22.360
earlier, is, how do you guys
want to see technology change

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.540
in the near term, so like in the
next couple of months, to

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.630
make these experiences better
or more interactive?

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.250
NICOLE MCDONALD: Technology
physically?

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.440
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.050
NICOLE MCDONALD: Alpha channel
video in WebM.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.290
PETE LEPAGE: Why don't you talk
a little bit about why

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.120
you want that?

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.370
Because I know that was
something we were trying to

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.170
get in, and unfortunately
we didn't get it in

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.150
in time into Chrome.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.750
It's coming soon
but not quite.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.900
NICOLE MCDONALD: It's actually
something I've wanted, about,

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.830
for two years now.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:01.650
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:08.670
NICOLE MCDONALD: Because you
have more control of changing

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.700
the way a video or
an experience is.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.620
Let me think for a second.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:20.140
So if I have an alpha channel
video, and my videos are on

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.560
rails, meaning I have a
narrative that is moving from

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.920
A to B, I have no ability to
switch those rails and have

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.940
the content or narrative
change quickly.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:40.070
With alpha channel video, we can
have a much more reactive

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.220
environment for the user in
the narrative meaning.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:51.940
And I have hope that that's
something that we have a

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.320
little bit more control over in
the future, is that we can

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.290
kind of change the narrative on
the fly, depending on what

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:02.200
user is reactive to.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.610
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah and in
Movi.Kanti.Revo we kind of did

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:08.770
that at one point, where there's
the fork in the road

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.180
scene where the user can choose
which direction to go.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:17.850
But it's a very limited amount
of changing on the fly.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:23.210
NICOLE MCDONALD: Right, and if
you had a WebM alpha, the

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:28.420
possibilities of A or B, becomes
A to Z, which, I think

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.640
would be exciting.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.020
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.270
And Gillian, what about you?

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.105
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I don't
have the same tech

00:43:38.105 --> 00:43:40.970
knowledge of lingo.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:44.510
But two things that come to mind
for me, it's simply that

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.670
people think about interactivity
as a full-bodied

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.240
experience.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.830
Obviously, being a dancer from
Cirque, that's the first thing

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:53.430
that comes to mind.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:57.730
Anything to facilitate, and
encourage, and play with

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:02.400
people using their whole body,
not just hands and eyes.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.350
And the other thing is the
context and the environment.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.680
I love the idea of anything
where the screen

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.565
is somewhere different.

00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:17.360
It's on the street, it's on the
floor, the screen comes to

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.450
me more in my world than
just at my computer.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.600
I think that as a 3D dancer
person, that's what I'm

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600
looking for.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.330
PETE LEPAGE: I think that's a
really powerful piece, that we

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:34.150
are interacting with more and
more screens every day,

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.840
whether you're talking about
your smartphone, whether

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.150
you're talking about your
laptop, your desktop, maybe

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.990
it's a tablet that you're
walking around with.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.010
There are just so many different
screens that

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.485
we have access to.

00:44:46.485 --> 00:44:50.180
And seeing these experiences
on more and more of these

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.410
scenes, I think, is phenomenally
powerful and a

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:57.410
really cool, fun thing to
see the web change.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:00.100
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think It
opens up the possibility for

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.590
surprise, which is one of the
best things in life and also

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:09.430
neat in that we all all live
in worlds, often, that are

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:13.110
very busy, and very repetitive,
and where we have

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.620
physical routines in
our life every day.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:22.130
So the idea that a screen can
play the part of a magical

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:27.400
moment, the way flash mobs work,
dance mobs, where at the

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.060
beginning, you're going to work,
and you're going through

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.870
central station as you do every
morning, and then, ahh,

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.170
people start dancing.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.940
So how can screens or the
capacity for screens to be in

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.510
new places begin to
provide that?

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.800
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and how
do we show something new, and

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.820
exciting, and different to
people who wouldn't have

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:53.260
access to new and
exciting things?

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.566
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:45:54.566 --> 00:45:59.880
Well, so I want to wrap up with
one question for both of

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.060
you guys to answer.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.870
And it's really about, if you
could say to other designers

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.870
and creative folks, after having
worked through this

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.190
project, what would
you say to them?

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.320
How would you encourage them
to go and play with this?

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.860
Or what would you say?

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.500
NICOLE MCDONALD: To--
playing with Movi?

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.080
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.450
NICOLE MCDONALD: I would love
for people to go and see it,

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:34.250
and experience it, and be
excited by it, but also to

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.700
help us move forward
with technology.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.890
And how would they do
it differently?

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:45.880
What would they do to make the
story have more depth or add

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.260
more creativity to it?

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:51.070
And then go do it so that we
kind of keep leapfrogging and

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:55.330
progressing, and inspiring
each other.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:57.240
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.010
And Gillian, what are your
thoughts on that?

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.580
GILLIAN FERRABEE: My thoughts
are to encourage other

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.810
physically creative people--
so that would mean anyone

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:08.590
whose art form is
their own body--

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:13.080
to being playing with people
whose art form is technology.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:21.840
Because I was so surprised,
with this project, how

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.580
visceral my response to the
artists was, how much I could

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.610
really feel them, and their
personalities, and their

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.200
charisma, and what they
were emanating.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.490
So I think that's really
encouraging for people who are

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:38.360
physical performers, to know
that when you partner with the

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.890
right artist of technology,
they're as excited as you to

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.140
have that happen.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.480
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.660
So we just actually had one
question pop in on the

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.330
question list that I
think is actually

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:54.140
a really neat question.

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:59.330
And the answer I'll give
immediately is, not right now,

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.210
but I'm curious what
you guys think.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.000
Is there any possibility of
Movi.Kanti.Revo being

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.040
implemented on Google Glass and
this virtual space being

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.800
overlaid in the real world?

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.230
How do you guys see that
actually happening?

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:15.890
Because--

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.140
NICOLE MCDONALD: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:21.062 --> 00:48:22.750
We have actually talked
about it.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:28.700
And we have some ideas on how to
make this almost, kind of,

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:33.230
be an interactive flash mob.

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.540
PETE LEPAGE: Oh neat.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.910
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, we
potentially could be putting

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:43.370
it in places that surprise
us and draw us in.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:45.855
PETE LEPAGE: Gillian, are you
familiar with Google Glass?

00:48:45.855 --> 00:48:47.070
GILLIAN FERRABEE: No.

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:50.830
PETE LEPAGE: Google Glass is
a project that Google has

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.480
started working on.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.320
It's a research project for the
most part right now, but

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.090
effectively what it is is it's
a pair of glasses that you

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.410
wear that have a little
display right here.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.680
And you can interact with
it in all kinds

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.800
of different ways.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.690
So the video that they showed
was showing being able to get

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.970
maps, but being able to send
messages, call people, talk to

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:18.240
people, because you have that
display right there in your

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.950
field of view, or maybe it's a
little bit above, or something

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:22.700
to that effect.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.660
But you've always got that
technology right

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.910
there around you.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:29.962
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I
had heard of it.

00:49:29.962 --> 00:49:30.790
I didn't know what
it was called.

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:34.440
PETE LEPAGE: OK, so
for something like

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.680
Movi.Kanti.Revo, how do you see
that, maybe, playing into

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.920
something like this?

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.700
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Well, what
comes to mind first is the

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.420
obvious one, of the characters
being a part of your daily

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:49.920
life, and making even more
practical uses playful.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:55.190
So if it's a map, as happened in
the forest, that they could

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:59.190
playfully feed you
the information.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.790
And the other thing that
comes to mind is just--

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.816
my memory is that, in our brain,
80% of our receptors

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:09.140
are visual, and it affects our
whole body and our brains in

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.050
ways that we're just
learning about now.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.860
So I think there's possibilities
beyond that that

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.805
the biological science
is going to

00:50:15.805 --> 00:50:18.310
meet us on that front.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.490
Who knows what it would do to
your body to think you were in

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:25.310
a forest when you
are in a city.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:30.890
And if the forest is peopled
with fun, magical people,

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:34.010
would your whole body relax?

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.820
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.430
It would be interesting to take
that same technology and

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:41.850
concept and go the other way.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:45.580
So put those on people at a
Cirque show, where you can

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:52.750
take the just amazing magic of
a Cirque show and augment it

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:58.240
even more by providing things
that change for each person.

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.150
That's really cool.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:05.760
Well, I think that that's pretty
much about all the time

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.420
we have left for today.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:11.870
I want to thank both of you guys
for joining us, Nicole,

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:15.530
for joining us from bright and
sunny LA and Gillian for

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:19.040
joining us from Montreal.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.750
This has been really great, and
I think this experiment

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:22.800
has been fantastic.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.800
You guys both did an absolutely
wonderful job.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.260
It's been amazing to see people
respond to this and

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:33.648
really just sort of react
and love it as well.

00:51:33.648 --> 00:51:34.860
NICOLE MCDONALD: Thank you.

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.110
PETE LEPAGE: With that, I want
to say thank you for joining

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.920
us, and thank you for helping
make this project

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.692
a phenomenal success.

00:51:41.692 --> 00:51:42.870
NICOLE MCDONALD: Thank you!

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:43.810
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Thanks
for having us.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:45.040
PETE LEPAGE: Thanks, guys.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.290
All right.
