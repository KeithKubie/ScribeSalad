00:00:01.274 --> 00:00:02.690
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Welcome everybody.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.470
Welcome to "Kitchen Sink."

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.700
This is our kitchen to play
in and to let Googlers really

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.260
learn how to fish.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.590
We don't just give you fish.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.710
We want you to
learn how to fish.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.330
But my guest today, Ann
Cooper is the person

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.190
who really has changed the
way a very important part

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.950
of our population eats and
cooks, and that's children.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.630
So I'd like to welcome you.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.300
Thank you.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.700
Thank you for doing
the class earlier.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.820
ANN COOPER: My pleasure.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: And it was
delicious and simple and good,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.850
and it's recipes
from what she cooks

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.664
for the kids in the
Boulder School District

00:00:48.664 --> 00:00:50.080
from the Berkeley
School District.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.510
So when I knew Ann
many years ago,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.040
she had the moniker of being
the renegade lunch lady

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.160
because she was the only
one doing this, doing really

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.879
good, healthy,
nutritious food to kids.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.490
And I'll have her
tell that story later.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.060
And now, she was kind
of lamenting to me

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180
that we can't call
her that anymore

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.810
because so many other school
districts are doing this.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.020
She's really at the
head of this movement

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.650
to change school food around
and how our children eat.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.850
So she's not renegade,
but what she's done

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.560
is a lot of other things,
like started a foundation.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.750
The Food Farmer Foundation?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.190
ANN COOPER: Food Family Farming.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: Food
Family Farming Foundation.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.650
She's got her own nonprofit.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.150
Her daytime job, as she says,
is running the Boulder School

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.880
District and turning that
freight train around,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.860
all the conventional
old practices

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.990
of a school district in the US.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.540
So I'm delighted
to have you here.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.070
Thank you.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.070
ANN COOPER: My pleasure.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.153
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:01.750
So what is the work now, Ann?

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.480
It's not being the renegade.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.770
So many people are being you and
trying to turn things around.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.280
What's the next step in turning
around our children's diets?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.830
ANN COOPER: Well,
you know, I'm not

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.040
even sure we're past
the crawling point yet.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.671
There's 113,000 schools in
this country, 14,000 school

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:21.170
districts.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.920
So there's so many schools
and so many school districts.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.050
And they have no
money, and they're

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.850
under the USDA guidelines.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.720
So it's really baby
steps to make changes.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.250
And there are
school districts all

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.600
across the country
that are making them,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.890
but it's really slow
and really hard.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.580
And I just heard that there's
four daycares at Google,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.540
and of course Google
has amazing food,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.700
but most school districts
run on $1.20 for food cost,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.650
which is a quarter
of a venti coffee.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.090
So the idea that we would try
and feed our kids healthy food

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.932
on $1.20 or $1.25 is
of course ridiculous.

00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:05.890
So if we're going to
really make these changes,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.400
we need more money
in the system.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.830
We need better
food in the system.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.630
We need facilities
for people to cook in.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.470
And we need training
for the cooks,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.310
and we need marketing
for the kids.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.210
I've already heard,
my kid won't eat.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.460
That's what every parent
says, is my kid won't eat,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.000
fill in the blank.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.010
So in all of these ways,
we need to make changes.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.160
But to just build on what Olivia
said, I have three day jobs.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.954
I'm the director of nutrition
services in Boulder Valley

00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:34.620
School District.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.990
We do about 11,000 meals a day.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.720
And everything's
cooked from scratch

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.140
or to our specifications.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.460
We have salad bars in
every school, pre-K to 12.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.770
We have organic milk, hormone
and antiobotic free beef

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.670
and chicken, only whole
grains, I mean on and on.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.910
But five years later, it's
super hard to do that.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.030
And before I was in
Boulder, I was in Berkeley.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.330
So that kind of
work is really hard.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.640
My foundation does three things.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.270
One, we work in conjunction
with the first lady's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.250
Let's Move campaign.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.630
We have Let's Move
salad bars to schools.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.642
And we raised about
$8 and 1/2 million

00:04:13.642 --> 00:04:15.850
putting salad bars in schools
all across the country.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.209
I think we have
about 3,400 right

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.709
now, which is really great.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.130
And we have
thelunchbox.org, which

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.360
is our web portal that has all
free information for school

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.200
districts all across the country
to make that change from how

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.030
we process to scratch cooked.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.490
And then we have a
breakfast project as well.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.310
So we have all that, and I
also have a consulting company

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.900
that actually does technical
assistance for school districts

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.650
that are really trying
to make the change.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.929
Most recently, we
were in Baltimore

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:44.720
for a year working on
that school district,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.490
and now we're going to be doing
some more work in California.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.300
So a lot of stuff is going on.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.350
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Basically, though, if it

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.440
has to do with what
most of these people

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.810
are here to hear about,
which is how do I

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.960
get my kid to eat more
vegetables, fill in the blank?

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.440
And why is it you can do it,
and they can't do it at home?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.254
Or they're fighting
more at home?

00:05:09.254 --> 00:05:10.920
ANN COOPER: Well,
first of all, if there

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.010
is better food in schools,
it becomes easier at home.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.390
I mean, that's
absolutely critical.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.890
I mean, if every day
your kid goes to school

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.940
and has choices off of a salad
bar that has 20 items on it,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.230
and because there's choice,
they will make their own palette

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.940
of flavors that
they like or palette

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.750
of colors that they like.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.480
I mean, that's really,
really helpful.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.740
But one of the big issues
really is that one of-- what's

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.970
the first word a child learns?

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.850
Well maybe mama, maybe
dada, and then no.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.520
Right?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.010
And they're saying
no to whatever

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.590
is on that spoon
going in their mouth.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.600
And so we teach our kids
from the very earliest age

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.471
that their place of
power is no over what

00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:58.720
you're putting in their mouth.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.178
And then, of course, there's
no for all these other things.

00:06:01.178 --> 00:06:05.410
But because we are doing it to
them, we're handing it to them,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.680
we're having them eat it.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.190
So they've learned that.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.414
So when parents tell me, my
kids don't eat x, y, or z,

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.830
and I bring them
into the kitchens

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.120
and say stand behind
the window and watch

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.520
your kid eat all of this stuff.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.145
And they go, no, my
kid won't eat that.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:23.390
I'm going, is that your child?

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.810
And it's because we
give them choices.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.680
It's because they are not
fighting with their parents

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.900
and having a win or lose
kind of game going on.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.420
We take the power away, and
we just give them the choices.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.290
And there's this funny thing
that's happened in America,

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.660
and it's happened in
just 40 or 50 years.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.440
40 or 50 years ago,
there wasn't kids' food.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.410
40 or 50 years ago, 55 years
ago, there wasn't McDonald's.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.830
There wasn't Burger King.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.150
65 years ago was when
the National School Lunch

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.090
program started.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.980
Chicken nuggets aren't that old.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.120
So it's this idea that
there's kids' food.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.510
And I happened to be able
to go to China with Olivia

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.770
a number of years ago,
and her great-aunt--

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.710
whether it's an aunt or
not-- we had this banquet

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.050
that she was overseeing.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.620
You look at the
food, and there's

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.100
chicken heads and
whatever was on the table.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.650
And so I asked through
Olivia, what about kids' food?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.020
And she said, what?

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.870
There's not even a
concept of kids' food.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.620
She thought, what do
you mean, kids' food?

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.970
And so this idea that kids
get to have their own food,

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:37.680
and that it should be colors
or flavor, taco something

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.780
cereals, or Fruit Loops
cereals, or chicken nuggets that

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.640
are in the shape of hearts,
diamonds, and Flipper.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.460
I mean, all of
this is marketing.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.120
And so big companies are
spending $17 to $20 billion

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.690
a year marketing these
non-nutrient foods to kids.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.850
And then all of us are
sitting there going, well,

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.430
how do we get the
kids to eat broccoli

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.240
if what's being marketed to them
is this unhealthy junk that's

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.260
supposed to be fun food,
that is kids' food?

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.830
It's something that the
kids think is their own.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.430
And that becomes
their choice then,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.490
and that becomes the
things that they're

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.710
drawing a line in the sand.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.450
And I only eat chicken nuggets.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.610
I only eat tater tots.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.480
I only eat white bread or rice
or pasta or fill in the blank.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.140
Because that's the
thing they get to have.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.850
So the way we work against
that in our school district

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.760
is we have 200 to
300 events a year.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.760
So we do tastings and
Iron Chef competitions,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.100
and we do rainbow days where
the kids go to the salad bar

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.190
and have to get four
colors off the rainbow,

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.659
and they get a sticker.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:43.000
So they get stickers if they
eat all the different colors

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.870
of the rainbow and all the
flavors that go with that.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.830
So we really try and
make it educational,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.810
and we really try and
make it all about choice.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.620
And that helps.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.420
But there is no kid food
in our district at all.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.960
So we don't have chicken nuggets
or french fries or tater tots.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.170
We make our own french fries.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.410
We serve them once
or twice a month.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.770
But nothing processed.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.110
And kids eat the food.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.120
FEMALE SPEAKER:
And then is there

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.920
a way to translate it for home?

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.350
I mean, if I go home and I have
half an hour to make dinner,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.690
I'm not going to give
my kid five choices.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.990
ANN COOPER: You would be
surprised how many families

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.870
end up being short order cooks.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.780
And I think that that's
part of the problem.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:31.380
I mean, I think if we
as adults, if we just

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.090
say-- when we go
home to make dinner,

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.590
if we're not cooking a
different thing for every person

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.540
in the family, if we say
this is what's dinner,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.230
no child is going to
starve themselves to death.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.480
Because I've never
heard of a child

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.910
starving to death
because of lack

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.200
of a chicken nugget
or a tater tot.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.240
But as soon as we
continually decide

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.530
that we are going to be short
order cooks, then again,

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.790
that's what happens.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.830
Then we are becoming
short order cooks,

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.329
and then we give everybody
their own little thing,

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:05.370
whatever it is they want.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.880
And all of a sudden,
then you guys

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.420
go home from work every
day pulling our hair out

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.790
because this kid only eats this
and this kid only eats this,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.350
and this kid only eats this.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.540
And it becomes this
nightmare to live with.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.690
I mean, I know parents
tell me this all the time

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.060
how hard it is.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.870
But I think there are ways
around it around the kitchen

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.750
table as well.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.400
I mean, I think that
the idea that we really

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.960
involve kids in the process.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.600
So go shopping with your kids.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.514
And I understand how
much of a nightmare

00:10:32.514 --> 00:10:33.680
it is to take kids shopping.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.430
I get it.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.930
So you don't do it
every day or anything.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.270
You go to the farmer's market.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.070
We're here in California
right this minute.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.330
There's farmers markets
every single day of the week

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.974
somewhere.

00:10:43.974 --> 00:10:45.390
When you go to the
farmer's market

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.880
with the kids,
when you have time,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.130
and you let them pick out
something they've never had.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.539
And say, OK, every week,
one new thing, and we're

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:54.830
going to cook it together,
and you just have to try it.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.690
Or let them grow something.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.520
Gardens are incredible.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.580
Every kid that would
never eat arugula,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.890
when they pick that
arugula, they'll eat it.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.560
When they see the carrot in
the dirt, and they'll eat it.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.180
And they see all of a
sudden it tastes so sweet,

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.070
and it's so amazing.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.230
So you take kids shopping.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.880
Cook with kids.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.840
Grow with kids.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.905
Have them involved
in the process.

00:11:19.905 --> 00:11:21.280
I was with some
people last night

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.090
that say one of things
they do is they--

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.684
and this is a little older than
maybe the preschool kids here--

00:11:26.684 --> 00:11:28.850
but in middle school, with
their middle school kids,

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.510
they may have them make
the menu once a week.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.570
So they get to choose.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.514
It has to be healthy.

00:11:33.514 --> 00:11:34.180
Here's the deal.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.700
You have to have a fruit or
a vegetable, whatever it is.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.970
But you make the menu,
and I'll help you cook it.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.430
And then we'll all
eat it together.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:45.170
And everybody has their turn of
when they get to make the menu.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.380
Maybe it's not once a week.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.630
Maybe it's once a
month, whatever.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.400
The other thing that's
really important

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.050
is sitting down at the
dinner table with your kids.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.180
Turning off the TV, the
iPhone, the iPad, the computer,

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.000
everything.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.050
Take a moratorium on all
things digital for 45 minutes

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:11.240
and sit down with your
child or children and family

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.784
as many times of
the week as you can.

00:12:12.784 --> 00:12:15.200
It's not going to be every
night, but as many times as you

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.800
can, as a full family, and
take that time to eat together.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.200
It solves so many problems.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.900
And when all of a sudden, meal
time becomes something special,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.950
then it's something that then
becomes part of a core value.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.690
We now live in a country where
one out of every four meals

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.870
is actually eaten in a car.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.930
We've made cars our
dining rooms in America.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.750
One out of every
four meals is fast

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.220
food, and one out of
every four meals in front

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.430
of a blue screen-- iPhone, iPad,
or in Google world, Android.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.380
But that's what we do.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.490
And so we've taken away
this core value of food,

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.040
and it changes things.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.872
It really changes the dynamic.

00:12:56.872 --> 00:12:58.080
And we need to get that back.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.538
We need to find
our kitchens again.

00:12:59.538 --> 00:13:01.290
We need to cook
again, turn off the TV

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.200
and get rid of all the blue
screens for one hour a day.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.780
Or even 45 minutes.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: But there were
stories, I heard some of them,

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.470
from early days when
you were at Berkeley.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.050
So the background is
Alice Waters in Berkeley

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.140
heard about what Ann was doing
at a private school called

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.320
Ross, and said you're
coming to Berkeley choose

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.970
to turn this freight
train around.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.640
And she did.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.186
But what happened
in the early days?

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.060
Tell us some stories.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.018
ANN COOPER: Well, yeah.

00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:35.720
There's some crazy
stories, including

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.420
when I went to Boulder as well.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.290
But one of the first things that
happened even before I got out

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.730
here to California,
at the Ross School.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.290
The Ross School was a very
well-funded private school

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.200
in New York, in East Hampton.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.870
And I think the first or
second year we were there,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.640
I had a bunch of fourth
graders march in.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.510
It was all girls at that point.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.200
It wasn't co-ed.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.920
March into the cafeteria,
sit down on the floor,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.520
and say, Miss Cooper,
we're on strike.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.090
We hate your food.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.250
And they all sat down.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.280
I felt like cheering.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.481
But I know I wasn't-- that
wasn't what was supposed

00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:11.980
to happen.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.130
So I didn't cheer.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.280
I sat down on the floor
with them, and I said,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.690
what's going on?

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.462
We hate your grilled
cheese sandwiches.

00:14:20.462 --> 00:14:22.670
Well, how can you hate the
grilled cheese sandwiches?

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.560
The bread is yucky.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.450
It's brown.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.220
The cheese isn't orange.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.260
So of course it was
in New York, and it

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.200
was beautiful white cheddar,
and we made the bread ourselves.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.830
So we started a cooking
class for the girls.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.830
We had a cheese tasting.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.060
We let them make
their own bread.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.440
They came up with a ratio on the
bread that met our guidelines.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.200
And all of a sudden, they
had a grilled cheese sandwich

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.100
that was as good
as the other one.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:04.480
Different, 50 something percent
whole grain instead of 100%.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.750
I was fine with that.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.950
We switched from white
cheddar to orange cheddar.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.810
I was OK with that.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.100
A little annatto
never hurt anybody.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.820
But that was their sandwich.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.300
So the next year,
these young girls

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.460
are bringing the new girls into
the cafeteria, and they said,

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.240
oh my god.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.250
You guys have it
so much luckier.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.610
We fixed everything.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.300
The food is so much
better here now.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.610
So they liked to have taken
total ownership over it.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.530
When I got to
Berkeley at King, this

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.690
is before the new kitchen was
built over there at King Middle

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.490
School, the kids
actually went on strike

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.030
and were throwing their food
against the side of the school.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.489
So they would just
take their food,

00:15:44.489 --> 00:15:46.779
and they would walk outside,
and there were bouncing it

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:47.940
off the side of the school.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.490
So after lunch, there's
this whole pile of food.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:58.290
So we did have that whole
discussion about, again,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.540
what was wrong.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.950
What do you want to change?

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:01.890
How can you fix it?

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.370
How can we work on it together?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:09.560
And eventually, all these years
later, the Berkeley School food

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.720
is still unbelievable
and amazing.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.010
And we had some of the same
things happened in Boulder.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.919
But I've been there
five years now,

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:19.710
and participation over
the last three years

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.775
has gone up 6%, 6%, and 7%.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.260
So it works.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.280
It just takes time.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.500
That's the other thing.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.300
We didn't become a nation
of obese people overnight.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.100
We're not going to
change overnight.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.620
We didn't change children's
palates to be really invested

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.110
in high salt, high fat,
high sugar overnight.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.547
So we're not going to turn that
train around overnight either.

00:16:42.547 --> 00:16:44.880
So you just have to keep
walking down the road of going,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.600
OK, this is what it is.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.070
And it's going to be this way
tomorrow and the next day.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.302
So what's it going to
take to get used to it?

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it's
about ownership for the kids.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.426
ANN COOPER: It's about
ownership for the kids.

00:16:55.426 --> 00:16:57.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: But
what about the parents?

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.820
I hear you had some threats.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.940
ANN COOPER: I had death threats.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.589
I had actual, written
death threats from parents.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.380
In Berkeley and in Boulder, as
a matter of fact-- in Berkeley,

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.880
the death threats
included, I hope

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.700
somebody runs you
off the Bay Bridge.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.599
This was, of course,
the old Bay Bridge.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.520
And then when I
got to Boulder, it

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.980
was I hope somebody
just runs you

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.400
all the way back to California,
where you weird people belong.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.440
Of course, here I
am the weird person.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.260
But parents don't want
to be told what to do.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.910
Kids don't want to
be told what to do.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.010
I had parents going,
whoa re you to take away

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.440
our kids' chicken nuggets?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.780
And who are you are tell us that
we can't have chocolate milk?

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.130
And who are you to
decide what's healthy?

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.910
And my answer to
all of those things

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.460
is that schools take a higher
bar and a higher ground.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.520
Schools are drug-free zones.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.510
And parents may allow their
kids to smoke pot at home,

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.580
but schools are drug-free
zones, and schools

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.686
are alcohol-free zones.

00:18:00.686 --> 00:18:02.060
Parents of high
school kids might

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.320
let their kids have a little
bit of wine at home or beer

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.861
or something.

00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:05.990
But at schools, we say no.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.240
And in the same way, we
as adults and caregivers

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.640
and educators have to take
that higher bar and say,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.340
this is an educational place.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.630
And whether tacitly or
implicitly, if we allow things

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.760
that we don't believe are in
the best interest of the child,

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.650
they become part of the culture.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.920
So we have to make
those changes.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.510
One of the things we work on a
lot now is educating parents.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.790
So we do cooking classes.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.040
We do quarterly newsletters.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.210
I go to PTA and PTO meetings.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.650
We do tastings for parents.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.080
So we do all that stuff as well.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.890
Because parents
have to be invested

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.160
in the change, as
well as the kids.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: What are
some data points you have?

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.350
You're saying you have
growth, 6%, 6%, 7%.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.550
Anything about
children's health?

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.554
Anything about
their performance?

00:18:59.554 --> 00:19:01.470
ANN COOPER: Here's the
thing about evaluation.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.380
It's really, really expensive.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.740
So we did an
evaluation in Berkeley.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.930
And for half a million
dollars, here's

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.810
what I was able to find out.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.430
Our kids that ate school lunch
ate three times more vegetables

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.920
than kids that brought
their lunch from home.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.165
And not fruit, vegetables.

00:19:17.165 --> 00:19:19.290
And that's really important,
because you can easily

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.415
get kids to eat fruit
because it's basically sugar.

00:19:21.415 --> 00:19:23.990
But vegetables.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.350
So most parents in
Berkeley would think, oh,

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.780
my kid's going to eat
healthier if I pack them lunch.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.590
But what the evaluation
showed is actually no.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.059
The kid's going to eat healthier
if they eat school lunch

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:37.600
because our school
lunch was healthy,

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.930
and because we had salad bars.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.420
And that our kids ate
less sugar at home

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.320
because there was basically
no sugar in school.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.150
So that's what we found out
for half a million dollars,

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:50.520
and that was great.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.040
But it was not
able to do anything

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.740
about baseline wellness
or academic performance.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:07.430
I think that there is-- Arkansas
is doing BMI, body mass index,

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.820
with every child in the state
that's in their K-12 program.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.040
That should, in a few years,
have some kind of results.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.890
But what I can tell
you anecdotally

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.630
is that it really
makes a difference.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.820
What we see when we
change food in schools

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.460
is less absenteeism,
less tardiness, less

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.350
behavioral problems.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.730
Those things we know.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.364
And we also know that
hungry kids can't think

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:33.780
and malnourished
kids can't learn.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.740
So we need to have kids fed.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.860
But I think even more
important for Googlers

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:43.290
than that, or just as important,
is many people around Google

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.490
can probably afford to
feed their kids well.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.315
But they're going to school with
people who may not be able to.

00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:52.070
And every teacher
will tell you, they

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.440
have to teach to the
bottom third of the class.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.070
It's just that's
what they have to do.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.440
So if there's behavioral
problems in a class,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.330
it doesn't matter how well
you're feeding your child.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.990
If the next person is
not, and especially

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.580
if those are kids from
underprivileged homes,

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.750
then your child is not
getting the education

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.760
that you would like them
to get because there's

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.380
kids that are hungry or
malnourished in that classroom

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.410
who can't behave
and who can't think.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.120
And your child may be
being taught down to.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.340
So it's really important
to understand it's not just

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.950
your child, because your child
is part of a whole class.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.120
And every child in
that class ends up

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.040
being part of the
educational model.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: What about
some success anecdotes?

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.720
ANN COOPER: We see
tremendous success.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:46.400
I will tell you that I'm
going to speak to Congress

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.130
in just a few weeks at
a congressional hearing

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.487
because these kind of
issues have made it

00:21:53.487 --> 00:21:54.570
all the way up to the top.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.780
I've done events
with Michelle Obama,

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.670
and she's been an amazing
cheerleader in this.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.140
There is foundations all
over the country that

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.350
are putting money into
school food and to salad bars

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.020
and to gardens.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.600
We're really seeing
the USDA make

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.120
tremendous positive change.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.430
I mean, the National
School Lunch program,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.240
even though it's
really imperfect,

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.810
is still feeding kids better
now than it maybe ever

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.690
has in its existence.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.970
And if school districts
would actually

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.290
start living up to
the letter of the law,

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.020
and if our Congress
people would stop

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.202
messing with the
guidelines, then we

00:22:31.202 --> 00:22:32.910
would see the food
get better and better.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.920
I mean, the USDA said that
pizza shouldn't be a vegetable.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.670
Now, I don't know if
any of you know this,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.700
but pizza's still considered
a vegetable in schools.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.060
And I'm pretty sure that pizza
doesn't grow out of the earth.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.090
And why is this
considered a vegetable?

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.360
It's because one
tablespoon of tomato paste

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.800
is considered a
vegetable equivalent.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.090
And so the lobbyists
got to Congress people--

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.260
and this is the frozen
food and tomato lobbyists

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.970
and the pizza lobbyists--
got to Congress

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.490
and convinced Congress
that the world was

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.540
going to go bankrupt if
we didn't consider pizza

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.910
a vegetable.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.090
And the USDA in
the guidelines said

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.940
that you could only serve
starchy vegetables like corn

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.870
and potatoes twice a
week, a half a cup each.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.420
And the potato lobby got to
Congress, and the frozen food

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.250
lobby, and got them
to turn that around.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.460
So potatoes or
french fries can be

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.720
served as a vegetable
five days a week.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.080
So you could actually serve
whole grain chicken nuggets,

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.820
chocolate milk with high
fructose corn syrup,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.650
and french fries
as a complete meal

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.610
today under the guidelines.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.850
Now, it's certainly not
the intent of the law.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.980
But because Congress
wouldn't back up the USDA,

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.730
we ended up in that place.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.970
So one of things we
all can do is really

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.740
think when we vote, in
congressional elections,

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.210
that the people who run
school food is the USDA.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.440
But Congress
allocates the money.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.580
So they get to actually pull
punches and make changes

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.670
in the program because
they hold all the cards.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you can do
whole wheat chicken nuggets,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.290
chocolate milk, and french
fries for $1.20 per kid?

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.900
ANN COOPER: Well, yes, you can.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.800
But you're going to get
pretty crappy chicken

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.472
nuggets for that.

00:24:24.472 --> 00:24:25.930
But we don't serve
chicken nuggets,

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.750
so I don't know too
much about them.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.030
I've never eaten one.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: So how much
are you spending per kid?

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.420
ANN COOPER: I'm spending in
Boulder about $1.20 on average

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.550
for the food.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.070
The reimbursement rate from the
federal government is $2.96.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.910
So that's what all
lunch ladies like

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.530
myself get to feed
a child is $2.96.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.070
But that includes payroll and
overhead and trucks to deliver

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.610
and knives and cutting
boards and every piece

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.130
of the whole department.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.910
So most school districts spend
about a third of that on food,

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.470
or around $1, $1.20 for
good school districts.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.580
But LA spends $0.76, and
they've been very proud

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.270
of that for years.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.790
FEMALE SPEAKER:
But you are getting

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:11.810
them organic, local
vegetables on most days.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.810
ANN COOPER: Well, not
always organic vegetables.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.580
FEMALE SPEAKER:
No chocolate milk.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.371
ANN COOPER: But there
is no chocolate milk.

00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:18.990
And we do have hormone and
antibiotic free hamburgers

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.080
and ground beef and chicken,
and I have organic milk.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.470
But we work super
hard at procurement.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.920
We working really hard at trying
to control inventory costs,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.230
and to control waste, and
to cook as much from scratch

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.750
as possible so that we really
can keep our costs down.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.590
But it's hard.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.140
It's really hard.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.670
A typical lunch here at Google
costs four or five times

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:48.580
what we're spending for an
entire week of our kids' meals.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.540
And we in America think
nothing of spending

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.600
$3, $4, $5 on coffee,
$5, $6, $7 on beer,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.700
$8, $9, $10, $15 in San
Francisco or probably

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.140
here as well, $18
on a glass of wine.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.280
So we think, as adults, nothing
of spending 3, 5, 10, 15 times

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.890
on a sometimes daily
adult beverage,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.060
as we do to feed a kid.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.950
And I think that that
really needs to change.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:18.200
We need to understand that our
choices as far as how we fund

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.830
education and school food
really makes a difference.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.490
And makes a difference
for your kids

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.280
at home and at school and
their ability to learn.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.889
And so it's super important.

00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:29.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: Talk
about your foundation.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.062
Why did you do it,
and what does it do?

00:26:33.062 --> 00:26:34.520
ANN COOPER: I don't
know how I ever

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.940
came to have a foundation
around school food.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.850
I was like, I'm such
an unlikely advocate

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.980
to be doing anything
with school food.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.670
I was a white tablecloth
kind of crazy celebrity chef,

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.920
and never knew what kids ate.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.414
My worst nightmare
is when somebody

00:26:50.414 --> 00:26:53.080
from the front of the house came
running into the kitchen going,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.199
chef, chef, there's a
screaming child on table 19.

00:26:55.199 --> 00:26:55.740
What do I do?

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.490
And I'd say, ask them to leave.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.640
Why are they in my restaurant?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:07.880
But here I am, and I did start
a foundation four years ago now.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.630
And the foundation was trying
to put together a toolbox.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.341
Everyone would ask
me, are you going

00:27:13.341 --> 00:27:14.840
to come to our
school district next?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.700
Somebody earlier today said,
oh, San Jose really needs you.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.535
And every place I go, they
say, oh, we really need you.

00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:21.910
I get an email
today, oh, can you

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.590
come to Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh?

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.530
And of course I
can't clone myself.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.060
So I decided what
we needed to do

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.900
is develop all the tools a
school district would need

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.620
to be able to go from highly
processed to scratch cooked.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.360
Well, I originally
actually envisioned it

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.660
as a physical
toolbox 10 years ago

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.580
when I started
thinking about it.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.860
Then shortly after that, I
said oh, no, it of course

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.350
needs to be digital.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.360
Even 10, 12 years
ago, the reality

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.170
of the digital world we live
in today was very different.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.520
But anyhow, it became digital.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.850
I started a foundation.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.480
And we did the three
things I told you about,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.650
the lunch box and Let's
Move salad bars to schools.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:04.080
And we have a breakfast program
and a few other programs

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.680
as well.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.400
But now what we're doing is
the USDA guidelines change.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.330
So we got a big grant to
overhaul the entire website, so

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:13.990
everything.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.830
And they really only change
once every 10 or 20 years.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.010
So we overhaul
everything so we would

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.240
be able to meet the new
guidelines going forward

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.960
for many, many, many,
many years to come.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.020
We're also relaunching
the website,

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.830
relaunching the foundation, and
working with a lot of partners

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.220
to do that.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.960
And I'm really excited
about all of that.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.950
Because as we move
forward, I really

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.680
hope that we can change how
we feed every kid in America,

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.260
that it shouldn't be just
private schools or rich schools

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.512
that can feed kids well.

00:28:46.512 --> 00:28:47.970
I mean, it ought
to be a birthright

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.940
that every child in America gets
good healthy food in school,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.580
and that no child is hungry.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.800
I mean, that's what
everybody wants.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.690
And we're sitting
here at Google.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.830
And just the amount and
variety and quality of food

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.970
we have here.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:04.340
And then you think that
you go a few miles away

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.870
to a typical school, and go look
and see what they're eating.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.780
We need to change that.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.777
So that's what we hope to do.

00:29:11.777 --> 00:29:12.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.000
Very inspiring.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.130
So any questions from the floor?

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.320
AUDIENCE: So I wonder if you
know who particular in Congress

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.310
introduced legislation
or introduced

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.650
the line item, whatever it was,
to say pizza was a vegetable,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.670
and maybe they'd like
some more attention.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.520
ANN COOPER: Pizza was-- it's
been a vegetable for decades.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:44.630
But the USDA had taken
it out of the new ruling

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.060
so it wouldn't be
allowed anymore.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.540
And I don't know who
in Congress was really

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.000
forcing that the other way.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.250
I will tell you that a
congressperson from Maine

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.030
and a congressperson
from Colorado

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.370
were the two people that made
sure that french fries could

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:02.050
stay in every single day and
be served as a vegetable.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.190
So it's hard.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.670
It's all about money.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.530
We serve about 8
billion meals a year

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.430
in the National
School Lunch program,

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.996
and it costs about $12 billion.

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:17.340
Oh, that's just
lunch is $12 billion.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.180
So it probably costs
about $15 billion.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.250
That's a lot of money.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.920
There's a lot of profit.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.770
And so a lot of
people could get hurt

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.470
if we said we're going to do
things a little different.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.002
And so there's tremendous
pushback from the industry.

00:30:30.002 --> 00:30:31.460
AUDIENCE: If your
school district's

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.899
not focused on this, what
do you think the best

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:37.850
way is to get them
focused on it?

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.270
ANN COOPER: Every school
district in America since 2006

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.200
had to have a wellness
policy put in place.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.490
Most of them have languished
on some administrative shelf.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.660
But now, as of two years
ago, every school district

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.430
has to update them and have
them re-approved by the USDA

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.550
every three years during
their recertification.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.060
So the first thing you do
is find the wellness policy,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.370
which is probably-- well, you
guys all work at Google, so you

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:06.160
could probably figure this out,
but Google wellness policies

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.140
for your school district.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.040
And then you'll find some
place on the website,

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.191
and you might have to dig, where
this wellness policy resides.

00:31:14.191 --> 00:31:16.440
And they may not actually
even have it on the website,

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.570
but it's probably in the minutes
of the board meeting somewhere.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:20.680
So find it.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.340
Then go to your child's
school and actually eat lunch.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.450
Then find a whole
bunch of moms and dads

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.800
that think like you do
and go to the school board

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.024
and say, OK, here's
the wellness policy.

00:31:30.024 --> 00:31:31.940
And either it says nothing
about healthy food,

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.450
and you go, OK, so
this needs to change.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.530
Or it talks all about
the healthy food,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.370
and you can have a big,
poster-sized picture

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.225
of whatever it is you saw
on your kid's plate that day

00:31:40.225 --> 00:31:41.100
and go, OK.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.750
Or better yet, bring
the food with you.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:48.310
And then go, we really
wanted this to change.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.600
We live in a democracy.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.440
And school boards are actually
not in every single place,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.280
but in most places in
America, they're voted in.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.990
They're voted in
by the electorate.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.080
There are some places
where they're appointed,

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.030
but mostly they're voted in.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:06.050
And superintendents
are basically

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.520
hired by the school board.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.920
So the superintendent
and the school board

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.859
hold all the cards
around school food.

00:32:11.859 --> 00:32:13.400
So if you want it
to change, you need

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.080
to get the school board to tell
the superintendent that better

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.496
food is really important.

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:20.120
And that's what you
want for your kids.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.950
And eventually they'll listen.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.270
Or vote them out and find
someone who will listen.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:28.120
I know cities that
have actually made it

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.650
such a big, important thing
that school board members would

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.350
actually have to run
on healthy school food

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.922
as part of their
platform to get elected.

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:39.505
AUDIENCE: So how
much of an emphasis--

00:32:39.505 --> 00:32:43.565
you talked about organic foods,
and I'm wondering-- because I

00:32:43.565 --> 00:32:45.440
remember one time I was
at a farmer's market,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.398
and there were two stands,
and one was organic.

00:32:47.398 --> 00:32:50.710
The other was not organic,
and the price was obviously

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.381
a lot less for the non-organic.

00:32:52.381 --> 00:32:53.880
And I said, why
isn't yours organic?

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.120
Do you use pesticides?

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.105
They were like, no.

00:32:56.105 --> 00:32:57.445
What is it?

00:32:57.445 --> 00:33:01.374
They go, we use some fertilizer,
so we can't say it's organic.

00:33:01.374 --> 00:33:02.790
But for the privilege
of that, you

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.860
get to pay whatever
additional premium.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.140
So it seems like
in a lot of cases,

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.670
going for the organic really
isn't actually that beneficial.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.980
So how discriminating
are you in terms

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.730
of what you're trying
to do as organic

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.812
and what you recognize really
because plants are making

00:33:20.812 --> 00:33:22.520
their own toxins
internally all the time.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.140
That's how they
defend themselves.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.670
ANN COOPER: So I
absolutely agree.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.060
What we say is local first.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.870
And the closer I am to the
source, if I know the farmer,

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.510
then that's what's
the most important.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.180
If I know the
farmer, and they say

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.080
we're practicing IPM,
Integrated Pest Management,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.970
or we're practicing
organic practices,

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:48.490
but we have a potato beetle
problem, and we are once a year

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:53.240
spraying something, I
don't know what, on it.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.500
But it's well before harvest,
and we've had it tested.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.370
So what's important
to me is that I

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:04.340
have an honest and open and
transparent relationship

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.400
with the person who is producing
the food for our children.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.870
And it's not always organic.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:12.440
I can't afford all organic.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:18.310
But to your point, it's not
always the best alternative,

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.030
although we need to
have less chemicals

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.530
on our food and our
children's food.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:23.870
So it's always a balance.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.840
But for me, local
always comes first.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.960
And the further away from
me it is-- like bananas,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.620
for instance, which
I don't actually

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.150
think we're even
going to-- I think

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.230
we're going to stop serving
them altogether finally.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.949
I've been trying, but finally
I think I've made the decision.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:41.010
But organic bananas
were important

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.850
because they came from
far away, and bananas

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.909
are one of the most
chemically laden pieces

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.815
of produce in the world.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.330
So distance and
transparency and knowledge

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.340
make a huge difference.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.320
AUDIENCE: I think
it's interesting

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.455
that you spoke about
choice, and that choice

00:34:58.455 --> 00:35:01.470
is an important
part of the meal.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.840
Because I think I always
made the assumption

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.540
that choice complicates
the decision,

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.924
and so just eat what's
been put in front of you.

00:35:10.924 --> 00:35:12.340
And so I'd like
to hear more about

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:16.069
how choice has helped children.

00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:17.360
ANN COOPER: So here's the deal.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.290
When I say choice, I don't think
there should be 10 entrees.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.950
You go into high
schools, and they say,

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.730
oh, the kids need
mini-marts, or the kids

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.960
need seven kinds of fast food.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.090
That's ridiculous.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.530
But when I say choice, when
you look at a salad bar,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.300
and there may be seven
kinds of vegetables,

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.870
and we usually have eight kinds
of vegetables, both animal

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.750
and vegetable protein,
some kind of dairy,

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.850
and something like hummus
or something like that.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.780
So those are the kind of
choices, teaching children

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.470
that you can have-- there's
four vegetables on the table.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:58.180
You can have any
two of them today.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.810
I think that that's
the kind of choice.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.790
Or going to the grocery
store and saying,

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.820
pick out something you want
from the vegetable aisle,

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.750
something you've never
had from the vegetable

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.300
aisle or the farmer's market,
and we'll make it together,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.910
or something like that.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.850
So I don't mean 10
kinds of entree choices,

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.210
like you often see
here at Google,

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.030
because I don't think
that's realistic.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:22.610
And I don't support schools
having those kind of choices.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:25.670
But it's more around small
choice, like salad bars,

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.550
or a couple kinds of vegetable.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.437
So we do things like that.

00:36:29.437 --> 00:36:31.270
AUDIENCE: And with the
vegetable consumption

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.520
that you're seeing in children
increase in their school

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.950
lunch-- is that typically
tied to the salad bar,

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.962
or are cooked vegetables
also being consumed?

00:36:41.962 --> 00:36:42.670
ANN COOPER: Both.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:47.970
But in a school food setting,
the largest percentage

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.090
of our produce is
on the salad bars.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.930
Because it's very hard,
in a school setting,

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:59.010
to actually serve
cooked vegetables well.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.370
So I'll take broccoli
as a perfect example.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:05.260
I can have the most beautiful
steamed, shocked, chilled,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.090
bright green broccoli that comes
out of our production kitchens.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.190
Goes out to be reheated,
because it's a cook chill

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:16.620
operation, at the site, and I
guarantee you nine times out

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.980
of 10, they will turn
it into brown mush.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:28.520
And most sites don't have the
capacity to cook that from raw.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.027
There are some vegetables
that transport really well.

00:37:31.027 --> 00:37:32.610
Roasted broccoli,
roasted cauliflower,

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.230
roasted carrots, things like
that transport really well.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.450
But because raw vegetables
transport really well,

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.730
and because for most kids, if
you can get them to eat raw,

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.160
cooked is actually easier.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.970
So it's sort of a little
harder to go backwards

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.825
because the cooked is sweeter
than the raw is oftentimes.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.420
That's what we see.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.420
But we saw in Boulder, we went
from $70,000 worth of produce

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:09.880
to $500,000 worth of produce in
three years without much waste.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.422
It's pretty amazing.

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:15.278
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] my child
won't eat question as much

00:38:15.278 --> 00:38:21.480
as when other children
are eating things,

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.900
and it becomes harder.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:30.370
Five friends have Lay's
potato chips, and they don't.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:34.294
I'm sure you see that
[INAUDIBLE] schools.

00:38:34.294 --> 00:38:36.035
So are the children
making health--

00:38:36.035 --> 00:38:38.118
do you see the children
making healthier decisions

00:38:38.118 --> 00:38:40.200
on their own, given
that ultimately they

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.212
have the chicken nuggets
in front of them too?

00:38:42.212 --> 00:38:43.420
ANN COOPER: Well, they don't.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.253
So that's the thing.

00:38:44.253 --> 00:38:46.450
AUDIENCE: Oh right, but
like a friend from home.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.060
I'm sure they must.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.110
ANN COOPER: Actually,
I have not seen

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.930
kids bring chicken
nuggets from home.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:58.310
But they do bring things like
Lunchables or stuff like that.

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:03.100
I don't see much trading between
kids who bring their lunch

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.010
and buy their lunch.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.950
What I see is kids
that bring their lunch

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.600
trading back and forth.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.630
The kids who get
hot lunch actually

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.350
have a hot meal and salad.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.480
And so there's not that kind
of trading you see with the kid

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.470
next to you that has the
Cheetos or whatever it is.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.690
So I don't know.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.770
But I think that
the more kids that

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:27.740
are eating, if the
majority of the kids

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.890
are getting hot lunch, then
that problem kind of goes away.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:35.485
But it's got to start with that
the food is good for parents

00:39:35.485 --> 00:39:38.470
to want their kids to eat,
actually eat hot lunch.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.130
So that's the problem.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.140
But to your point,
I mean, I think

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.380
that in the schools
where we have

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.400
a high proportion of parents
who pack their kids' lunch,

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.340
we go to the PTAs and talk
about what's in the lunches.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.640
We have schools that have
banned candy, banned sugar

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.070
drinks and stuff like that.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.480
And so that kind of
stuff really helps.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.430
And that can all be in
the wellness policy.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.140
You can actually write
a wellness policy

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.390
that says candy or
sugar-added beverages aren't

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.430
allowed in school.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:11.700
Just say, that's it.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.520
Not allowed.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.030
And parents can do that.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.340
AUDIENCE: My
take-away is parents

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.507
need to take
responsibility, hopefully

00:40:20.507 --> 00:40:24.872
the other parents can make
this district continue

00:40:24.872 --> 00:40:26.570
to raise awareness.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.510
But is anything
top-down happening

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:33.545
because $2 [INAUDIBLE]
low budget.

00:40:33.545 --> 00:40:35.920
Can the school give
them more budget?

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.920
How can we push on that?

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.836
ANN COOPER: The school
doesn't have the money.

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:41.025
But the government has
the money, both the state

00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:42.150
and the federal government.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.780
In California, the state
actually gives school

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.350
districts, I think it's
$0.19 or $0.20 per lunch.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.900
So the state of California
actually does supplement.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.360
Many states do not.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.110
We need to push on the
federal government.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.390
That's where the push
really needs to be.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.670
And that's a policy issue.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.890
And I think we really
need to take that on.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.640
And I'm going to be doing
some work with Google

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.410
over the coming year, maybe two.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.410
And I think that one of
the things that we could

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:11.250
try and work on is, how
do we make that push?

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:16.420
How do we use Googlers
and Google's influence

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.720
to make-- if this
is something that's

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.320
important to many
people, how do we start

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.960
to make the change
in the upper levels?

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.690
So there is some of
that top-down change.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.960
Because, at the end
of the day, it's

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.390
a government-funded program
that our tax dollars pay for.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:33.750
So we should really get
to make those changes.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:38.480
But a lot of people don't
want to see their taxes go up.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.880
But it's not even so much
about taxes going up.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.250
Like right now, the National
School Lunch program,

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.470
just lunch, costs about
$12 billion a year.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.380
And I think it should double.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.860
And people go,
well, where are we

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.193
going to get that kind of money?

00:41:52.193 --> 00:41:54.900
But just two diseases,
diabetes and obesity,

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.962
cost us $260 billion a year,
which is $5 billion a week.

00:41:58.962 --> 00:42:01.420
The wars that we're not in cost
us about $3 billion a week.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.310
So it wouldn't take
much to actually put

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:08.240
a whole lot more
money into the system.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.340
But it really takes all of us.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.880
If we all just did one
thing and got everyone else,

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.210
and we knew to do one thing
and really said, OK, we're

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:18.710
going to do one thing
to make this change,

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.200
then over time,
slowly but surely,

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.640
we could make this our nation's
priority, instead of-- we

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.360
have a multi-trillion
dollar budget.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.110
Who even knows what a
trillion dollars is?

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.290
And our budget is
multi-trillion.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:37.030
How could we not want
to spend an extra $0.50

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.390
on our kids' lunch?

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.040
$0.50.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.580
And that's what I
think we need to do.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.760
It's so little.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.555
So little money.

00:42:45.555 --> 00:42:47.221
AUDIENCE: It's slightly
more complicated

00:42:47.221 --> 00:42:48.985
though because of
the lobbies, right?

00:42:48.985 --> 00:42:52.790
I mean, because you
have-- you're doing OK,

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.650
and I'm not suggesting
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.270
But you're managing to
find better options.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.390
ANN COOPER: Well, I
spend half of my time

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.440
being a grant fundraiser.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.180
But yes, it is
really hard though.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
lobbyists that

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.430
are pushing their processed
foods as well, right?

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.740
ANN COOPER: But this
is the only country

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.000
on the planet where this
is really happening.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.030
And it's because that we
really haven't valued food

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.960
as a nation.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.380
And so you go to
Italy or France,

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.950
and you see they're spending
$5, $6 on their school lunch.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.640
And when I talked to
the people in Rome

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:34.660
that were overseeing
816,000 meals a day in Rome.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:38.160
I said, how can you afford--
it was four euros at the time--

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.080
how could you afford
the four euros?

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.060
And she looked at me
and said, four euros

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.430
for lunch, 400 euros
for a hospital room.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.560
That's the connection
that we in our country

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.900
aren't making, is
that if we don't

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.980
feed our kids
healthy food today,

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.540
they're going to be in
the hospital in 10 years.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.740
We already see that
the leading cause

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.810
of death of children
under 15 is cancer,

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:05.860
which is related to diet and
environment and exercise.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.840
We know that one out
of every three kids

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.360
that was born in
the year 2000 is

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.140
going to be overweight
or diabetic.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.920
It's crazy.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.080
It's staggering.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.440
Obesity in children has
tripled in 25 years.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.320
I mean, it's a quarter
of a generation.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.520
So things are going
bad so quickly

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:31.520
that we have to be able
to make the connection

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.330
between healthy food
and healthy kids.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:41.430
And we have to be able to
push back on the bottom line

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:46.560
corporate mentality that is
pushing us in this direction.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.690
It's not only going to ruin the
health of generations to come,

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.419
but it's going to bankrupt
the entire system.

00:44:53.419 --> 00:44:55.460
We're not going to be able
to pay for it anymore.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.370
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you for coming.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:57.980
Please talk to her some more.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.190
Thank you.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:03.140
[APPLAUSE]
