because<00:13:06.000><c> then</c><00:13:06.209><c> you</c><00:13:06.300><c> have</c><00:13:06.329><c> to</c><00:13:06.450><c> come</c><00:13:06.720><c> up</c><00:13:06.750><c> with</c>

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
because then you have to come up with
 

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.810 align:start position:0%
because then you have to come up with

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
get scares so so I get it stuff but
 

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.220 align:start position:0%
get scares so so I get it stuff but
