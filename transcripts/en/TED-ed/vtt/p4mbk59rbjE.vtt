00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:12.291
In 19 B.C., the Roman poet Virgil
was traveling from Greece to Rome

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:14.884
with the emperor Augustus.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:20.493
On the way, he stopped to go sightseeing
in Megara, a town in Greece.

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:23.164
Out in the sun for too long,
he suffered heatstroke

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:27.053
and died on his journey back to Italy.

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:28.323
On his deathbed,

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:32.634
Virgil thought about the manuscript 
he had been working on for over ten years,

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:36.997
an epic poem that he called the "Aeneid."

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:40.973
Unsatisfied with the final edit,
he asked his friends to burn it,

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.104
but they refused,

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:48.774
and soon after Virgil's death,
Augustus ordered it to be published.

00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:54.506
Why was Augustus so interested
in saving Virgil's poem?

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:57.765
The Romans had little tradition
of writing serious literature

00:00:57.765 --> 00:00:59.745
and Virgil wanted to create a poem

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:04.234
to rival the "Iliad"
and "Odyssey" of Ancient Greece.

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:12.254
The "Aeneid," a 9,896 line poem,
spans twelve separate sections, or books,

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:15.416
the first six of which mirror
the structure of the "Odyssey"

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:19.140
and the last six echo the "Iliad."

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.254
Also like the Greek epics,

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:25.796
The "Aeneid" is written entirely
in dactylic hexameter.

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:30.150
In this meter, each line 
has six syllable groups called feet

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.279
made up of dactyls which go
long, short, short,

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:39.513
and spondees which go long, long.

00:01:39.513 --> 00:01:43.030
So the famous opening line
in the original Latin starts,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.130
"Arma Virvmqve Cano,"

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.722
which can be translated as
"I sing of arms and the man,"

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:55.482
arms, meaning battles and warfare,
another "Iliad" reference,

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.581
and the man being the hero Aeneas.

00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.080
To understand the "Aeneid,"

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.161
it's necessary to examine the unsettled
nature of Roman politics

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:09.228
in the second half of the 1st century B.C.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:13.717
In 49 B.C., Julius Caesar, 
Augustus's great uncle,

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:16.401
triggered nearly 20 years of civil war

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:20.214
when he led his army 
against the Roman Republic.

00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:24.013
After introducing a dictatorship,
he was assassinated.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:30.662
Only after Augustus's victory
over Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 31 B.C.

00:02:30.662 --> 00:02:33.065
did peace return to Rome

00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:36.213
and Augustus became the emperor.

00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:39.460
Virgil aimed to capture this sense
of a new era

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.416
and of the great sacrifices
that the Romans had endured.

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:46.543
He wanted to give the Romans
a fresh sense of their origins,

00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:47.473
their past,

00:02:47.473 --> 00:02:49.743
and their potential.

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:51.634
By connecting the founding of Rome

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:55.352
to the mythological stories
that his audience knew so well,

00:02:55.352 --> 00:03:02.154
Virgil was able to link his hero Aeneas
to the character of Augustus.

00:03:02.154 --> 00:03:07.984
In the epic poem, Aeneas is on a quest
to establish a new home for his people.

00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:11.354
This duty, or pietas 
as the Romans called it,

00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:14.895
faces all kinds of obstacles.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:18.374
Aeneas risks destruction 
in the ruins of Troy,

00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:24.555
agonizes over love when he meets
the beautiful Queen of Carthage, Dido,

00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:28.095
and in one of the most vivid passages
in all of ancient literature,

00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:31.465
has to pass through the underworld.

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:36.085
On top of all that, he must then
fight to win a homeland for his people

00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:39.125
around the future sight of Rome.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:42.936
Virgil presents Aeneas as a sort of model
for Augustus,

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:46.005
and that's probably one of the reasons
the emperor was so eager

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:48.876
to save the poem from destruction.

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:51.587
But Virgil didn't stop there.

00:03:51.587 --> 00:03:58.217
In some sections, Aeneas even has visions
of Rome's future and of Augustus himself.

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:02.277
Virgil presents Augustus as a victor,
entering Rome in triumph

00:04:02.277 --> 00:04:05.796
and shows him expanding 
the Roman Empire.

00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:11.536
Perhaps most importantly, he's hailed as
only the third Roman leader in 700 years

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:19.056
to shut the doors of the Temple of Janus
signifying the arrival of permanent peace.

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:20.799
But there's a twist.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.527
Virgil only read Augustus three
selected extracts of the story

00:04:25.527 --> 00:04:29.380
and that was Augustus's 
entire exposure to it.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.898
Some of the other sections
could be seen as critical,

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:37.447
if not subtly subversive
about the emperor's achievements.

00:04:37.447 --> 00:04:41.988
Aeneas, again a model for Augustus,
struggles with his duty

00:04:41.988 --> 00:04:45.319
and often seems a reluctant hero.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:49.329
He doesn't always live up to the
behavior expected of a good Roman leader.

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:52.635
He struggles to balance mercy and justice.

00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:57.138
By the end, the reader is left wondering
about the future of Rome

00:04:57.138 --> 00:05:00.040
and the new government of Augustus.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.159
Perhaps in wanting the story published,

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.098
Augustus had been fooled
by his own desire for self-promotion.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:11.059
As a result, Virgil's story has survived
to ask questions

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:15.030
about the nature of power
and authority ever since.
