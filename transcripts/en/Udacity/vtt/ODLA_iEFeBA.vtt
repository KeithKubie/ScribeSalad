00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is actually no.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We haven't done enough yet to provide authentication.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And as I've described it, it's not the full EKE protocol.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The reason that it's not is the way to authenticate

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
depends on proving that you have the same key.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
To authenticate, what Alice needs to prove to the server

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is that it knows the password, p, and the server needs to prove to Alice

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that it knows that password, p.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Our assumption is that the password is shared between the client and the server--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in this case, Alice and the server--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the way to authenticate is to prove knowledge of that password.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In this case, that's not done--that we've just established a key.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That doesn't prove anything.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This message could have been anything.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The fact that Alice can decrypt it using the password

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
doesn't prove that Bob knew the password.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
To do that, we need to add an extra challenge to this.
