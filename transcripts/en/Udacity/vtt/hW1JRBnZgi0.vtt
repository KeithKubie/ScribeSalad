00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.190
So, we're nearing the end of the course,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.820
and we've had a great time building this

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.210
content for you, and we hope that you've gotten a lot of value out of this.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.770
&gt;&gt; So, we've run tons of meetups and workshops about Dorm Room Debbie

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.480
and building pizza applications. And, one thing that's always true is that the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.620
developers at these events come up with the most amazing ideas for features

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.990
and applications that are context aware. Stuff that I can never even think of.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we're trying to put all of this together

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.810
into a Repository of Awesomeness. I mean, you know,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.735
we get a couple hundred, folks come through the workshops.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:30.800
&gt;&gt; Yep. .

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.970
&gt;&gt; But, through this class, we have the potential to reach thousands of people.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.590
So, imagine all of you posting your

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.740
amazing ideas that, we haven't thought about, that

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.330
others have not thought about, in this one Repository of Awesome that can serve

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.160
as a source of inspiration for you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.380
months from now after you've taken this class.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.080
&gt;&gt; So, let's get creative. Take the most amazing ideas you

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.040
can think of, whether or not they can be implemented or

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.700
not, and go to the forum and post them under the Repository of Awesomeness.
