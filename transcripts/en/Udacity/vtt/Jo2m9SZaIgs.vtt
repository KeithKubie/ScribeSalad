00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.070
The biggest difference
between TV games and

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.780
mobile games is how players
interact with them.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.420
Instead of using a touch screen,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.490
players control Android TVs using
remote controls or game controllers.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.020
There are two basic types.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.380
The first is a D-pad or directional pad.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.740
This is the basic style of remote
control that most Android TVs ship with.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.750
For that reason,
it's very important to design for.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.760
Just like the controllers
you may have used as a kid,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.870
it's important to realize that none of
these buttons are pressure sensitive.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.020
So pressing harder won't make
your car accelerate any faster.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.310
This is a game controller.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.740
Of course, the biggest difference
with remote control is the joysticks.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.690
Whereas you can think of the buttons
on the D-pad as basically being on and

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.600
off, the joysticks, of course,
have a range of motion.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.410
In addition,
Android TV games can also be controlled

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.720
using devices connected via
the nearby connections API.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.520
This let's players use their phone or
tablet as a second screen input device.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.980
This opens up very cool options for
multi screen gaming.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.800
You can imagine that if you have friends
over to your house to play a game,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.420
you don't necessarily have to purchase
additional game controllers for

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.720
them, they can simply use the phones
they already have in their pockets.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.966
Check out the video in
the instructor notes to learn more.

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:09.790
Let's talk a bit about
designing your control scheme.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.940
First, always plan for a D-pad,
this control set is the default for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.360
Android TV.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.700
At a minimum, you should at least be
able to navigate your menus this way.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.010
Even if your game is best
played with a game controller,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.960
make sure players can gracefully exit
it through your menus using a D-pad.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.210
That said,
it's best to support both D-pads and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.330
game controllers in your game,
whenever possible.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.720
Be explicit about what kinds of
controllers your game works best with.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.850
Do this both in your
Google Play description and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.450
when your game starts up.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.880
A good strategy is to detect at runtime
what types of controllers are connected

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.320
and then prompt players if
they're not an ideal type.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.060
This sets expectations properly and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.580
maximizes your chances of getting
a good rating on Google Play.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.690
It's good practice to show
visual controller instructions.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.510
If you do so, be sure the images
you use are free from branding.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.100
Down the road,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.140
it may be possible to detect what brands
of controllers are detected at runtime,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.990
and show matching graphics for them but
for right now, please use this template.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.200
You can find this image, and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.390
more like it, by following
the link in the instructor notes.

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:11.100
Here are three tips for
designing your control scheme.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.980
Start with default controls that
are in line with what users expect

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.770
in different regions.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.160
For example,
if you plan to release both in Japan and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.450
the United States, make sure you set the
defaults appropriately for each region.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.910
When possible, the back button
should always work as expected.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.520
Usually, it should navigate backward,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.750
bread crumb style through the previous
screens the player has been on.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.610
For example,
if the user is playing your game and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.560
presses back,
you might take them to the pause screen.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.670
If they press back again,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.460
you might take them to your game's
home screen and if they press it yet

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.780
again, take them all the way back
to the Android TV home screen.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.290
Because TV remote controls though have
a limited number of buttons, it's also

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.930
appropriate to use the back button to
bring up a context menu in your game.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.450
If you choose to do so though, make
it clear how to move back from there.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.990
Last, don't rely on special buttons.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.550
Not all controllers have start,
search or menu buttons, for example.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.330
