00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:16.993
Deep in the jungles of Vietnam,

00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:18.555
soldiers from both sides

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.229
battled heat exhaustion and each other

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:22.098
for nearly 20 long years.

00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:23.533
But the key to Communist victory

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.051
wasn't weapons or stamina,

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:26.881
it was a dirt road.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:28.312
The Ho Chi Minh Trail,

00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:30.831
winding through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia,

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:33.336
started as a simple network of dirt roads

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:35.029
and blossomed into the centerpiece

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:37.051
of the winning North Vietnamese strategy

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:38.452
during the Vietnam War,

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:39.480
supplying weapons,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.348
troops,

00:00:40.348 --> 00:00:42.464
and psychological support to the South.

00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:43.753
The trail was a network of tracks,

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:44.430
dirt roads,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.578
and river crossings

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.668
that threaded west out of North Vietnam

00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:50.504
and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:51.959
between Vietnam and Laos.

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:54.421
The journey to the South originally took six months.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.207
But, with engineering and ingenuity,

00:00:56.207 --> 00:00:59.039
the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.294
Towards the end of war,

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.295
as the main roads detoured through Laos,

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.923
it only took one week.

00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:05.091
Here is how it happened.

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:08.258
In 1959, as relations deteriorated

00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:10.242
between the North and the South,

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:13.272
a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:17.164
soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam.

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.186
The first troops moved in single-file

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:21.838
along routes used by local ethnic groups,

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:24.233
and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.856
were often all that indicated the direction.

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:29.323
Initially, most of the Communist cadres

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:30.283
who came down the trail

00:01:30.283 --> 00:01:33.307
were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam.

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:34.752
They dressed like civilian peasants

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:37.230
in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.090
They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.501
cut from truck tires,

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.378
and carried their ration of cooked rice

00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:44.123
in elephants' intestines,

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:46.173
a linen tube hung around the body.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:47.313
The conditions were harsh

00:01:47.313 --> 00:01:49.298
and many deaths were caused by exposure,

00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:50.345
malaria,

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:51.907
and amoebic dysentery.

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:52.605
Getting lost,

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:53.816
starving to death,

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:56.852
and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:58.227
were constant threats.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.395
Meals were invariably just rice and salt,

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:01.939
and it was easy to run out.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.152
Fear, boredom, and homesickness

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:05.318
were the dominant emotions.

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:07.278
And soldiers occupied their spare time

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:08.295
by writing letters,

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.399
drawing sketches,

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.962
and drinking and smoking with local villagers.

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:13.291
The first troops down the trail

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:14.959
did not engage in much fighting.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.061
And after an exhausting six month trip,

00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.314
arriving in the South was a real highlight,

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:21.790
often celebrated by bursting into song.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.088
By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck.

00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:27.666
Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:31.478
took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:34.430
and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.360
As traffic down the trail increased,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.774
so did the U.S. bombing.

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:39.733
They drove at night or in the early morning

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:41.223
to avoid air strikes,

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:42.311
and watchmen were ready

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.318
to warn drivers of enemy aircraft.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:46.692
Villages along the trail organized teams

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:48.026
to guarantee traffic flow

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:51.111
and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks.

00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.324
Their catch cries were,

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:54.145
"Everything for our Southern brothers!"

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:56.543
and, "We will not worry about our houses

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.749
if the vehicles have not yet gotten through."

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.291
Some families donated their doors

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:02.642
and wooden beds to repair roads.

00:03:02.642 --> 00:03:05.003
Vietnamese forces even used deception

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:07.525
to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:09.103
in order to make gravel for use

00:03:09.103 --> 00:03:11.173
in building and maintaining roads.

00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:14.674
The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny.

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:16.660
The Ho Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.766
on the Vietnam War

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:19.975
and it was the key to Hanoi's success.

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:22.731
North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields,

00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:24.145
but by the trail,

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:25.072
which was the political,

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:25.609
strategic,

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.067
and economic lynchpin.

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:28.862
Americans recognized its achievement,

00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:29.737
calling the trail,

00:03:29.737 --> 00:03:31.073
"One of the great achievements

00:03:31.073 --> 00:03:33.329
in military engineering of the 20th century."

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.159
The trail is a testimony to the strength of will

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.285
of the Vietnamese people,

00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:37.795
and the men and women who used the trail

00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:39.496
have become folk heros.
