00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.750
Firebase provides a full set of
authentication options which can be

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.370
easily configured.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.380
Options include email password,
Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Twitter.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.190
Documentation is provided for
each option.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.490
When a user authenticates in Firebase,
a token is generated which is valid for

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.310
the length of time specified
in the Firebase log in and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.080
auth page under session length.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.320
For e-mail password authentication
Firebase compares the e-mail password

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.540
against a stored hash and
then generates a Firebase token.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.530
For social providers such as Google,
Firebase gets an OAuth token from

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.100
the provider in
the authentication process and

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.880
then generates a Firebase token.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.300
Let's briefly look at the user log in
authentication screen in Firebase.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.710
Here you see the user log in and

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.130
authentication screen inside
the Firebase application.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.280
You can enable email and password or
other social providers here.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.990
For email and password and for
Google, Lila will show you

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.400
how to configure these as authentication
methods, but before that,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.360
let's take a brief look at some of the
methods you can use for authentication.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.010
Remember, these methods
are provided by Firebase.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.745
As a developer, all you have to do is
call them and Firebase does the rest.

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:18.550
createUser() creates a new account
with a specified email and password.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.640
Auth with password attempts to
authenticate the fire base with giving

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.790
credentials.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.330
Auth with OAuth token attempts to
authenticate the Firebase within

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.980
an OAuth token and
the on off method listens for

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.860
changes in the user's
authentication state.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.650
This is useful when you want to
determine the authentication state of

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.480
a user, and subsequently force
a user to log in if necessary.
