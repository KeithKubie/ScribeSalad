00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.215
One last problem in
this section.

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's see, problem number 16.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.400
After the first term, each
term in a sequence is 3

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.130
greater than 1/3 the
preceding term.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.190
So if I were to write that--
so if I were to say n of i

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.940
plus 1 is equal to the
preceding term

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.190
times 1/3 plus 3.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.900
And all I'm saying is, if
I have a term, right?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.720
Say the ith term is n, n sub i--
I take 1/3 of it and add 3

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.670
to get the next term.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.030
That's all.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.710
This is just fancy notation
for that.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.490
If t is the first term of the
sequence and t does not equal

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.920
0-- so this is t.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.390
I probably didn't even
have to write this.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.550
Ignore this if this
confuses you.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.890
So t is the first term.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.110
What's the next term
going to be?

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.840
It's going to be 1/3
times t plus 3.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.000
So it's going to
be t/3 plus 3.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.320
And they're going to say-- and
then we could keep going-- but

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.100
they just want to know, what
is the ratio of the second

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.095
term to the first term?

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.269
So what is the ratio
of this to this?

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.520
Well the ratio is t/3
plus 3, to t.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.260
Right?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:24.320
And that's the same thing
as t/3 plus 3 times 1/t.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.560
That's the same thing as t/3
times 1/t plus 3 times 1/t.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.760
I just distributed the 1/t.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.450
These cancel out.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.480
So that equals 1/3
plus 3 over t.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.050
And that doesn't look like any
of the choices I see, so we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.540
probably have to find a
common denominator.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.710
So let's say the common
denominator is 3t.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.290
Just multiply the two.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.820
1/3 is the same thing as t over
3t, and 3/t is the same

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.930
thing as 9/3 t, right?

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.070
I just multiplied the top
and the bottom by 3.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.495
So t plus 9/3 t.

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:10.350
t plus 9/3 t is choice C.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.170
And you could even
ignore this.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.550
Really, the hard part
isn't even this.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.100
The hard part is actually just,
you might end up with

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.050
something like this.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.775
And then you're like, well I
don't see that choice, and

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:23.170
then you have to realize, oh
I have to find a common

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.690
denominator to get to this.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.110
The common denominator is 3t.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.680
Well that's it.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.780
That's a very short video.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.320
I'll see you in the next SAT
test, or on the next SAT test.
