00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.250
We're on problem 148.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.310
What is the tens digit of
positive integer x.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.560
We want to know the
tens digit.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.680
Statement one tells us x
divided by 100 has a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.280
remainder of 30.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.140
Well, then we know the tens
digit is 3, right?

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.890
Because, let's say 30 divided by
100 has remainder of 30 and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.340
its tens digit is 3.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.300
130 divided by 100 has a
remainder of 30 and its

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.950
remainder is 3.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.730
And I can make an argument
that any number, when you

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.280
divide it by 100 that has a
remainder of 30, its tens

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.650
digit is going to be 3.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.550
In fact, that number is
going to be 3, 0.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.140
And its going to have a
bunch of other digits

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.680
here, there, there.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.730
And if you just divide this by
100, you're going to be left

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.120
over with 30.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.560
So statement one is sufficient
to figure out what the tens

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.020
digit of the number is.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.545
Statement two.

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:06.880
So we could write x divided
by 110 has a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.470
remainder equal to 30.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.140
Well, this is a little
different case.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.045
So, definitely, when 30 is
divided by 110 the remainder

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:17.700
is 30, because it goes
into it 0 times.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.500
So the remainder is 30.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.850
And then the tens digit is 3.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.490
So let's see, I'm going to try
to find other numbers when

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.160
they're divided by 110 its
remainder is 30 but its tens

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.740
digit is something else.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.770
So let's see.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.400
140.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.320
If I divide that by 110, I'm
left with a remainder of 30.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.200
But its tens digit is what?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.940
Its tens digit is 4, right?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.990
I shouldn't draw
an arrow here.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.830
If I did-- let's see, I
go up one more-- 250.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.270
250, you divide it by 110,
its remainder is 30.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.600
But its tens digit is 5.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.940
So this statement gives
me no information.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.760
Saying that the remainder
is 30 still gives me no

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.450
information.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.650
The tens digit can be any of
these numbers, or a bunch more

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.100
if I just kept going.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.520
So statement one is sufficient
to answer this question.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.070
Question 149.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.740
If x, y, and z are positive
integers, is x minus y odd?

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.070
In order for this to happen,
one of these have to be odd

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.080
and one have to be even.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.560
And you can just think
about that.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.480
If you take the difference,
or really the sum, of two

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.310
numbers, the only way that
that difference or sum is

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.060
going to be odd is if one
is odd and one is even.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.150
So let's think about that.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.640
Let's look at the statements.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.660
Just going to see if they
give us any information.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.775
They say that x is equal
to z squared.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.950
Well, that gives me no
information about y.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.795
And it gives me, actually, very
little information about

00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:50.780
x just yet.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.100
I mean, it tells me that x is
a perfect square, but a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.190
perfect square could be
odd or even, right?

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.070
It could be 16, it could be 9.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.830
16's an even perfect square,
9 is an odd one.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.780
So this doesn't give me much
information by itself.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.700
Let's see what statement
two tells us.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:14.280
Statement two says that y is
equal to z minus 1 squared.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.620
So this statement, by itself, is
kind of like statement one.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.780
It just tells me that y is
a perfect square of some

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.440
integer, right?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.310
Because z is an integer, so
z minus 1 is an integer.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.840
So it just tells you y
is a perfect square.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.410
And a perfect square could
be even or odd.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.370
But if we take both of these
together, then something

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.690
interesting happens.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.130
For example, if we assume that z
is odd, then its square will

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.170
also be odd, right?

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.510
3 squared is 9, 7
squared is 49.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.300
So if z is odd, then x is odd.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.930
And then z minus 1 would be even
and then y would be even.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.110
So one would be odd,
one would be even.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.870
And you could do
the other way.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.540
You could say if z is
even, x is even.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.190
And if z is even, then
z minus one is odd.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.250
And y is odd.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.110
And I can prove it to
you mathematically.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.570
Let's write this and
substitute for z.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.660
So x minus y becomes z squared
minus z minus 1 squared.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.900
And so this becomes z squared
minus z squared

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.770
minus 2z plus 1.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.959
And that equals z
squared minus z

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.620
squared plus 2z, right?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.940
Distribute the negative sign.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.000
Plus 2z minus 1.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.550
The z squares cancel out and
we're left with 2z minus 1.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.870
If we use both statements,
x minus y

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.160
simplifies to 2z minus 1.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.970
They told us that z is
a positive integer.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.420
So this-- this part of
the statement right

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.490
here-- has to be even.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.870
It's a multiple of 2.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.600
So this is even.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.090
And if you subtract 1 from an
even number, this whole

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.800
expression has to be odd.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.400
So both statements together are
sufficient to say that x

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.050
minus y is odd.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.620
Next problem.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.950
This one looks hairy.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.070
150.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.930
Henry purchased three
items during a sale.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.450
He received a 20% discount off
the regular price off the most

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.860
expensive item and a 10%
discount off the regular price

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.840
of the other two.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.940
Was the total amount of the
three discounts greater than

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.410
15% of the sum of the
regular price?

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.170
OK.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.610
So what was the total amount
of the three discounts?

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:34.450
It was 20% times-- let's just
call it item one-- 20% times

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.570
item one plus 10% times
item too, plus

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.200
10% times item three.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.970
And I'm assuming this is
the most expensive.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.780
Let's just say this is the
second most, I guess.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.950
This is third most expensive.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.570
Maybe they're the same
price, I don't know.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.700
This is the total discount.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.730
This isn't what he paid.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.240
This is the discount
on item one.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.170
The discount on item two.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.490
I'm not saying what they
actually paid for item two.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.800
So what the question is, was
a total amount of the three

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.090
discounts, that's this number,
greater than 15% of the sum of

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.030
the regular prices.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.050
So they're saying, was that
greater than 15% of I1, plus

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.895
I2, plus I3.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:21.240
And I think we can
simplify this.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.200
Because if we distribute this
right-hand side, you get 0.15

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:35.110
times I1 plus 0.15 times
I2 plus 0.15 times I3.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.990
And let's see, if we subtract
out 0.15 I1 from both sides,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:48.600
you get point-- let's see, 0.2
minus 0.15 is 0.05 I1.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.840
And I want to keep everything
positive, so let me subtract

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.410
these from the right-hand
side.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.180
So I'm going to subtract 0.1
I2 from-- I'm going to

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.610
subtract these from both
sides of the equation.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:06.040
So that's going to be greater
than 0.15 I2 minus 0.1 I2.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.570
So that's 0.05 I2.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.690
Plus, and now to do the
same thing for I3.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.550
0.15, 0.1.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.140
So I'm going to subtract
0.1 from 0.15.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.170
So 0.05 I3.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.420
All I did, going from this to
this, is I just distributed

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.390
the 0.15 and I subtracted
and added to

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.590
simplify it a little bit.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.400
And, actually, this is
interesting, too, because I

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.970
just have these 0.05's
everywhere.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.150
That's a positive number.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.640
And I was able to do that
because I just added and

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.060
subtracted from both sides.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.820
But if I multiply or divide by
a positive number, then I

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.750
don't have to change the
inequality, and you could say,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.620
let's just divide both sides
of this equation by 0.05.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.460
Or the equivalent is to multiply
both sides by 20.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:53.720
But then we're left with I1 is
greater than I2 plus I3.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.550
And I think this simplification,
without having

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.080
read the statements,
was worth it.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.320
Because we went from something
very convoluted in a very

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.630
convoluted problem statement
to something very simple.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.470
So, essentially, they're asking
us was the price of I1,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.830
was the price of item one,
greater than the price of item

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.000
2 plus item 3.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.850
If we can answer this question,
we can answer the

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.090
harder question.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.260
So statement number one.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.710
The regular price of the most
expensive item was $50.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.230
I1 was equal to $50.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.560
And the regular price
for the next most

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.910
expensive item was $20.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.120
So I2 was equal to $20.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.409
So now the question boils down
to, was $50 greater than $20

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.880
plus the third most
expensive item.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.390
Well, I don't know, depends.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.710
Well, actually, this answers
our question, right?

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.830
Because I was about to say, well
the third most expensive

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.330
item, maybe it's $30.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.010
But by definition, we know
that it's not $30.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.840
Why?

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.970
Because it was the third
most expensive item.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.560
The second most expensive
item is $20.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.780
So this thing has to be less
than $20 if we are to consider

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.430
it the third most
expensive item.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.220
So if this thing is less than
$20, then the right-hand side

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.615
of the equation is definitely--
it's going to

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:08.820
actually be less than $40.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.940
So this is definitely going to
be less than $50, so this is

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.010
going to be true.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.790
So it turns out that statement
one by itself is sufficient.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.050
Because you just have to realize
that I3 has to be less

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.390
than $20 I2 is equal to $20.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.270
Statement two.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.770
The regular price of the least
expensive item was $15.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:27.180
So let's see.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:33.570
That statement by itself, we get
I1 is greater than I2 plus

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.840
$15, where this is the
least expensive item.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.342
So just looking at this, we know
this is going to be $15,

00:09:40.342 --> 00:09:43.630
this is going to be more than
$15-- yeah, this is hard.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:51.140
You can't say anything about
this, because maybe I1 is $17.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.400
Maybe I2 is $16 plus $15.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.590
And in this case, it would
not be the case.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:01.230
Or maybe I1 is $170 and I2 is
$16 plus $15, in which case it

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.170
would be the case.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.600
So statement two, by itself,
isn't sufficient.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.010
So the answer to this is a.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.010
Statement one alone
is sufficient

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.760
to answer this question.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.720
