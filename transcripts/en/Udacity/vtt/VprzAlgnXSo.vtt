00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We can imagine drawing a right triangle here and d' still has to cover this vertical distance,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but it also has to cover some horizontal distance.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That means this hypotenuse here--that's longer than the upward leg of this trajectory,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and likewise this hypotenuse is longer than the downward leg.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So d' must be larger, so d is less than d' and as long as we're getting specific with our primes and unprimes,

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
let me mention that this clock is measuring the time t whereas this clock is measuring time t'.
