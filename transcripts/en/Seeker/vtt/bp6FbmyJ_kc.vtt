00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.740
The holidays in the States are a reason to
come together with family and pie and be thankful

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.290
for what you have, like pie, and take a break
and have some pie.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.110
If you choose work over that something must
be wrong with your brain.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.730
Hi knowledge junkies, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.390
Americans are a people who take pride in their
work ethic.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.720
We’re a nation of builders, doers, dreamers,
makers, entrepreneurs, cliches!

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.720
But to quote the philosopher Strong Bad, too
much of a good thing is an awesome thing.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.480
But too much of an awesome thing is really
really dumb and bad.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.170
Workaholism is a loosely defined term right
now but the general consensus is it boils

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.329
down to being literally addicted to your work.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.500
Although as a grammarholic I feel the need
to point out it should be an addiction to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.500
workahol.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.210
A recent meta analysis of the trait in the
Journal of Management shows that while some

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.129
may wear being a workaholic as a badge of
honor, it’s actually doing you more harm

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.380
than good.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.629
Workaholics are more likely to skip meals,
are more stressed, have worse physical health,

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.289
and end up burned out on their job much sooner.

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.610
And you’re not even being more productive
to boot.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.479
Dr. Brian E Robinson, author of Chained to
the Desk, says workaholics tend to get less

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.619
done because they take on too much work, don’t
delegate, and are often more disorganized

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.729
than their coworkers.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.750
Melissa Clark, the lead author of the meta
analysis, does make a distinction between

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.960
workaholism and working more because you enjoy
your job.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.720
People who work hard because they love what
they do don’t have any of the negative outcomes

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.090
their counterparts do.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.510
And they can still step away from their work
without feeling guilt or shame.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.870
Of course the benefit of working more hours
is more pay, so is that why people end up

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.670
skipping vacations and staying late?

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670
Is it really an addiction to money?

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.080
According to the meta analysis, that’s not
it.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.530
People who are workaholics tend to be perfectionists
or type A personalities; they do it because

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.200
they have an internal need they need to satisfy.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.620
Just like how an addict has cravings.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.060
So don’t overwork yourself; take a break,
step outside, have a cigarette.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.810
I want to be completely clear, that was a
joke.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.940
Do not smoke.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.530
Does that really need to be said?

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.429
Anyway, this all comes back to the holiday
season.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.480
Right now a lot of people have the choice
of working through the holidays or seeing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480
loved ones.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.489
Remember, according to science, taking time
off will not only make you mentally and physically

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.230
healthier, but you’ll be a better worker
when you get back.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.230
So relax.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.439
See your family.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.439
Have some pie.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.230
If you’re like me and oh my god just love
pie, Tara and Anthony explain why it’s awesome

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.280
in all it’s forms here.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.489
Can addictions be healthy?

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.780
I want to know your thoughts.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.240
Tell us in the comments, and I’ll see you
next time on DNews.
