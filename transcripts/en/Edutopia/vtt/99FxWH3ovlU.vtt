00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:07.006
&gt;&gt;Allyson: The level of student
engagement here is incredible,

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:10.196
and it's just the feeling you get
when you walk in the building.

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:20.736
&gt;&gt;We're a career and
technical high school.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:24.206
The students come here because
they have an interest in something

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:28.166
and they're able to make
connections with their technical path,

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.746
and then they learn how to apply
it through the math, the sciences

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:35.416
and the English, so that you have
this really well rounded, interested,

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:38.796
high level student who's doing
something that they love.

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:42.586
&gt;&gt;Gregory: I teach my architecture
classes in a way where students get

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:44.486
to apply the relationships to academics.

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:48.096
They also get to understand a bit
about art, a bit about design,

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:49.976
a little bit about everything really.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.596
&gt;&gt;One thing I'd like to do
first is to sort of recap

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:56.356
so that we can knock these
site-specific aspects of the project.

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.886
&gt;&gt;For the past six years,
we've been going

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.966
to the Pocono Environmental
Education Center.

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.066
I team up with a history
teacher and a science teacher

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.696
for that large scale project.

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:10.396
&gt;&gt;Jamie: It is a national
park in Poconos, Pennsylvania.

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:13.286
&gt;&gt;Gregory: I decided to have students
demonstrate their understanding

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:17.736
of architecture by designing a
pavilion that would be site-specific

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.256
to the Pocono Environment
Education Center.

00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:23.656
&gt;&gt;Cathy: My class is involved
in the project, just by looking

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:30.176
at national parks and conservation of
different habitats, different species.

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:33.706
&gt;&gt;Jamie: I'm touching on the
history of national parks

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:36.466
and how they were founded, and
how without Teddy Roosevelt,

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:38.246
there would be no national parks.

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:42.306
&gt;&gt;What I want you to do, start
researching different national parks

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.136
and see if there are
historical monuments within them.

00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:48.776
And I want you to talk about the
different features and how does

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:53.186
that change the features of the park?

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:56.106
&gt;&gt;Gregory: Prior to going on the trip,
we'll hold a seminar with students

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:58.536
to give them some connections to
that trip, so that we can bring

00:01:58.536 --> 00:01:59.986
that experience back to the classroom.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:04.126
&gt;&gt;Cathy: Having input from the different
subjects areas provides something

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.566
that maybe wasn't thought of originally.

00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:09.876
&gt;&gt;Gregory: Today, Miss Velasquez
and Miss Yuhas are also here

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:11.246
to give their perspective on things.

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:15.436
&gt;&gt;Jamie: This and this remind me
of Epcot Center, that big dome.

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:17.376
This design and that shape.

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:20.726
&gt;&gt;Some students want to focus
on structures and monuments

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:21.956
that they've seen in the past.

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.266
Some students just want feedback,

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:26.346
so they have three different
teachers that they can speak to.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.716
&gt;&gt;Cathy: Some of the students
were working on a lot of designs

00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:31.746
and incorporated a lot
of biology concepts.

00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:34.026
&gt;&gt;Enzo: So first I was
working with a dandelion,

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:36.946
so then I was like, can
you kind of see it?

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:41.416
It's like a sphere, but then I was like,
oh, this looks better flipped over.

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:45.526
So I wanted to make the water
filter down with these pipes.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.646
&gt;&gt;Gregory: Collaborative projects are
really used to bring everything together

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:54.246
to show relevancy and
to break down the silos

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:55.896
between the different courses of study.

00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:59.686
&gt;&gt;Allyson: If I have a cohort
of teachers working together,

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.226
I give them common planning time,

00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:06.546
so that they can specifically
plan based around the vocation.

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:10.906
So the technical instructor will
say, "This is what I'm doing.

00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:13.216
How can you contribute to this project?"

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:16.376
We don't force it, we
find ways to support it.

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:18.896
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Someone will say what
they're doing in their class

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:21.936
and it will spark a conversation
and then someone will say, "Oh,

00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:22.976
I'm doing this in my class."

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:26.616
And if something can
tie in, let's do it.

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:29.646
&gt;&gt;Cathy: It's good for them
to get a different perspective

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.146
on topics from the different areas.

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:35.206
&gt;&gt;Jamie: Students come to the
class with more knowledge.

00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:36.576
They're getting different mindsets,

00:03:36.606 --> 00:03:38.706
different viewpoints
and different material.

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:41.346
&gt;&gt;Allyson: We're trying to show
them how they need to be able

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:43.636
to think critically, think creatively

00:03:43.636 --> 00:03:45.836
and independently, while
working in the team.
