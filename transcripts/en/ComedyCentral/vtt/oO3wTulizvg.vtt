00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.504
Okay, remember now.
We're not here to judge anybody.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.739
We want to handle this
with love, right?

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:09.675
You want to tell him
how his drug abuse has hurt you,

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.144 line:92%
maybe hurt himself.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.446
Okay Harold, what time did you
tell him to be here?

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.248
Five o'clock
but he's always late.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:20.353
No, he'll be here in three,
two, one ...

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.124
Is this a five o'clock
free crack giveaway?

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:31.965
Y'all tell anybody,
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:37.404
Peanut butter
and crack sandwich.

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.515
This week, Tyrone gets invited
to an intervention.

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:51.251 line:92%
Lock the door. Good idea.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.522
Okay Tyrone, do you know
why you're here?

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.158
I'm here for the same reason
you is, man.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.928
I want some crack.
Crack.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.431
Okay, Tyrone, we are not
giving crack away today.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:06.399 line:92%
What? What time is it?

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.633 line:92%
It's five o'clock.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.036
Did I miss the five o'clock
free crack giveaway?

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.370
Tyrone, these are
your friends here

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.106
and they have something
they'd like to say to you.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.474 line:92%
I've been tricked!

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.110
Okay, Tyrone, I'm what is known
as an intervention counselor.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.378 line:92%
Oh.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.913
And these people would like to
talk to you about your drug use.

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:23.049
What you talking about, man?
I don't do drugs.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.584 line:92%
What'd you all them?

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.719
Come on, Benedict Arnolds,
what'd you all tell them?

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:29.155
Okay Rhonda, would you like
to go first?

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:31.424
This is ridiculous.
What is going on in here?

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.159 line:92%
Do we get crack at the end?

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.531 line:92%
Tyrone, you know I love you

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.001
but I feel like drugs is
hurting you and that hurts me.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.038
Tyrone, I was very hurt that you
car jacked me that time.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.340 line:92%
What's you talking about Rhonda?

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.442
I would never car jack
that ugly ass car.

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:51.444 line:92%
Get out of the car!

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.212 line:92%
Tyrone, what are you doing?

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.848
Who's Tyrone?
I don't know Tyrone.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.416
No it's you,
you cracker ass lisp.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.652
I'm not Tyrone.
Get out of the car.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.289
Get out.
I don't know any Tyrone.

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:05.558
Look, the police found you
three hours later

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.094
in my car asleep,
high on crack.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.629 line:92%
That's impossible, Rhonda.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.531
How can I sleep
if I'm high on crack?

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.100 line:92%
Chinese riddle for you.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.736
Okay, let's have Janet and Rob,
okay?

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.471 line:92%
I aint do that, Rhonda.

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:22.642
Tyrone, we opened
our home to you.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:26.212
You let your addiction
lead you to abuse our trust.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.316 line:92%
Janet, Rob ... look y'all.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.186
It's me you talking to.
I would never hurt you.

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:37.557
Don't play dumb with us Tyrone.
I remember the whole speech.

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.759 line:92%
I just need $200 dollars.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.496
I take these real estate classes
and I'm back on my feet, baby.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.164
I'm serious, Rob.
It's me, baby.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:48.267
It's Tyrone.
I'm cleaning up my act.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.602
Okay.
Tyrone.

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:52.605
Oh Rob, Janet, you all aren't
going to be sorry about this!

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.710
Oh. I studied my ass off
for that real estate test.

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:03.449 line:92%
We're off to my mothers.

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:04.850 line:92%
We'll be back Sunday evening.

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:07.220
The number's on the fridge
if you need anything.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.488 line:92%
Okay. Bye Janet. Bye Rob.

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.393
I passed my test and was
a certified real estate agent.

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.995 line:92%
Good for you, Tyrone.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.431 line:92%
Damn right, good for him.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.534
He sold our house
and kept the money.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.804 line:92%
$450,000 dollars.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.607 line:92%
Where's the money, Tyrone?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.342 line:92%
He spent it on a party.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.512
Took out an ad
for it in the paper.

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:36.082
You didn't get your invitation
for that party?

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:37.516 line:92%
Oh Rob, you should have seen it.

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.553
We had piles of crack this high.
I had a heart attack.

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.922
Heart attack.
I'll give you a heart attack.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:44.190 line:92%
Rob!

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:45.791 line:92%
Come on, come on, come on.

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:48.160
I'm getting a restraining order
against you, Rob.

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:50.329 line:92%
Harold, why don't you go next?

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:54.601
All right. Tyrone, I'm here
because I love you.

00:03:55.534 --> 00:03:57.470
Well if you love me so much
Harold,

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.872
why'd you get me fire
from the post office, huh?

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.240
Do you know how many people
on your route

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:02.976 line:92%
complain of receiving open mail?

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.344 line:92%
Seven?

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:07.447 line:92%
136 Tyrone.

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:10.750
And then there was the incident
with the powder.

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:17.924 line:92%
Oh!

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:31.771 line:92%
Attention everybody.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.907
Be on the lookout
for any enveloped marked

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.510
Senator Tom Dashell
or Tom Brokaw.

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.378 line:92%
It might contain Anthrax.

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:41.614
For your information,
that's a white powder.

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:45.285 line:92%
Is Anthrax bad?

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:47.953 line:92%
Yes, Tyrone.

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:51.324
And if it fell into the wrong
hands, it could be big trouble.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:54.060
I got than Anthrax
and it's the bomb, baby.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.294 line:92%
$60 bucks.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.696
If that man hadn't
turned you in,

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.230 line:92%
it would have been a disaster.

00:04:58.263 --> 00:05:02.835
Y'all act like crack is so bad!
Well like the good book says,

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:07.073
let he who is without
sin throweth the first rock.

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:10.143 line:92%
And I shalt smoketh it.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:14.580
Basically Tyrone,
we would like you to check

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:16.316
into rehabilitation
immediately.

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:23.356
All right. Okay. Fine. Fine.
You know what?

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.658
I need to get better.
Y'all right.

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:29.395
But first step is first
I need to go to the bathroom.

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:32.699
And then I'm on my way
to recovery, Rhonda.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:34.700 line:92%
I've got the key.

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.035 line:92%
And that wasn't me, Rhonda.

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:37.536 line:92%
Go to the bathroom.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.207
Okay. I've got it from here.
Thank you. I'll be right out.

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:45.911 line:92%
Oh. Oh.

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:48.748
Why didn't they say there
weren't any windows in here?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:54.187 line:92%
Oh. Here goes nothing.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.940
We have a very special
surprise today.

00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:17.877
Let's hear it
for Tyrone Biggums.

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:27.286
Hi kids. Thank you
very much, teacher.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:33.959
It is truly an honor
and a privilege for me

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:37.063 line:92%
to be here at Pinehurt School

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:40.299
or whatever your school
is called today.

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:44.970
I say it's a privilege because
it's a violation of my parole

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:47.874
to be around children.
But enough about that.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:51.444
Hello little boys
and little girls.

00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:58.718
Kids, y'all are looking
at a dead man.

00:06:59.818 --> 00:07:02.188
I should not be
in front of you today.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:08.928
Drugs and alcohol
have ruined my life.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.766
I started doing drugs when I was
little, just like you fellow.

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.001 line:92%
Me and my friends would go home

00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:18.471
and smoke marijuana
after school.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.306 line:92%
Can you say marijuana?

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:22.408 line:92%
Marijuana.

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:24.043 line:92%
That's what I was smoking.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.245
Sometimes dipping
in embalming fluid.

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:28.914
And me and my friends
would laugh and giggle

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:33.285
and eat all the cookies.
It was terrible. Terrible.

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:36.755
I can definitely say
he was the absolute worst

00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:39.992
anti drug speaker
in the history of drugs.

00:07:40.592 --> 00:07:43.629
Then I upgraded
to a little drug called acid.

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:46.232
Very inexpensive
and affordable.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.801
Even young children
could afford it, it's so bad.

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:53.772
I did two hits of that
and Bugs Bunny and Scooby-Doo

00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:57.042
and all my favorite cartoons
came to my room

00:07:57.075 --> 00:08:01.981
and ate cookies with me
and sang songs for 16 hours.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:10.523
God damn. Talking about
clean up your room.

00:08:11.356 --> 00:08:13.893
And Mickey Mouse was doing
the bass line like this.

00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:23.002
And then he basically told them
where and how to buy the stuff.

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:26.605
We all know we can sneak
into our mommas room

00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:28.741
when she's sleeping
and take five,

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:30.776
ten, maybe
$20 dollars out her purse,

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:33.913
run on down to Third Street
and catch the D bus downtown

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.115
and meet a Latin America
fellow named Martinez.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:37.950 line:92%
We know that.

00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:40.953
And we know that Martinez's
stuff is the bomb.

00:08:41.653 --> 00:08:44.824 line:92%
Kids, drugs is all around you.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.426
How would I know
when drugs is around?

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.228 line:92%
You might be asking.

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:52.097
Well, I'll tell you.
You with the magic markers.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.099
What do you think that is,
some kind of crayon?

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:56.202
No.
Take that cap off and sniff it.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.771 line:92%
And you'll be high.

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:02.542
These little ones are 10
and 11 years old.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:06.478
You. You know what dog food
tastes like?

00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:09.882
Do you?
It tastes just like it smells.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.586
Delicious.
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:27.633
I thought the worst was over.
I was mistaken.

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:33.072
That, children, was the first
time I sucked a dick for crack.

00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:37.510
But it wouldn't be the last.
Why one time I seen Martinez ...

00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:39.845 line:92%
I'm trying to say something-

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:43.182
Thank you for the lovely
and moving and graphic story.

00:09:43.682 --> 00:09:45.384 line:92%
You're welcome teacher bitch.

00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.054
I'm not finished
but that's all right.

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.690
Can I get cash for this?
I've got some errands to run

00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:53.025
and I don't think
I'm gonna make the bank.

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:54.226 line:92%
I-

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:55.594
It's my money, bitch.
I've earned it.

00:09:55.627 --> 00:10:02.268
Give me my speakers back.
Thank you kids. Goodbye.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.007 line:92%
Hello. My name's Tyrone Biggums.

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:11.243
Sometimes the endless pursuit
of crack

00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:13.412 line:92%
leaves me tired and depleted.

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:16.515
But now cocaine comes
in a delicious shake.

00:10:17.215 --> 00:10:19.752
Red Balls.
It gives me wings.

00:10:23.488 --> 00:10:25.358 line:92%
My baby!

00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:38.204 line:92%
It's my baby in the car!

00:10:43.842 --> 00:10:45.544 line:92%
Oh my God!

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:05.097
FYI, people do still
steal radios, you know.

00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:08.234
How do you think
I got this suit?

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:15.841 line:92%
Red Balls got me!

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:27.686 line:92%
Mayday! Mayday!

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:29.455
We've got a crack head
lifting up the bus.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:31.190 line:92%
Must be Red Ball.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.535
I love this drink.
Thank you, Red Balls.

00:11:43.902 --> 00:11:46.071 line:92%
Excuse me, jailer.

00:11:46.104 --> 00:11:50.009
Pardon me but may I have
a Red Balls please?

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.483 line:92%
Shazam!

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:13.466
Red Balls.
Cocaine in a can, baby.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:17.470 line:92%
I can get some money for this.

00:12:20.872 --> 00:12:22.141 line:92%
My name's Jeff.

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:24.877
I'm a computer programmer
from Redondo beach

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.012 line:92%
and I refuse to lose.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.550
My name is Rita.
I'm from Idaho, but trust me.

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:33.485 line:92%
I aint no couch potato.

00:12:33.518 --> 00:12:35.754 line:92%
I'm Anne. I'm from Boston.

00:12:35.787 --> 00:12:38.958
I promised my mom I wasn't going
to embarrass her here tonight.

00:12:39.624 --> 00:12:44.830 line:92%
Huh? Oh. I'm Tyrone Biggums.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:47.366
I heard that I can
win a lot of money

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.969
and I get a pig testicle meal
with all the fixings.

00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:52.838 line:92%
Got to play to win.

00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:55.875 line:92%
Here is your first stunt.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.613
We've got to eat that?
I can't eat all of it.

00:13:01.146 --> 00:13:03.048
You each have to lie
in this coffin

00:13:03.081 --> 00:13:04.850 line:92%
covered with worms and bugs.

00:13:04.883 --> 00:13:06.819
The three of you
that can last the longest

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:08.620
will move on
to the next round.

00:13:08.653 --> 00:13:11.557
Rita, you're up first.
Climb on in.

00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:15.394
All right, we're going to have
to add a few more to the mix.

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.628 line:92%
Oh God.

00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:18.364 line:92%
Oh Joe Rogan, you crazy.

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.305
One of them tried
to crawl in my mouth.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:27.573 line:92%
Oh god.

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:30.009 line:92%
One minute and 42 seconds.

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:33.512 line:92%
Let me just help you out.

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:35.347
Get some all in ...
there you go.

00:13:38.383 --> 00:13:40.486
Look at them spreading.
They're spreading.

00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:44.456 line:92%
Five minutes and 42 seconds.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.992
Anne, it's all up to you.
Lie down.

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:54.833 line:92%
Oh God, that was gross.

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:56.668 line:92%
Wow. All right, Ty.

00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:58.337
I'm going to tell you something
about me, Joe Rogan,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.973
that you might not know.
I smoke rocks.

00:14:14.252 --> 00:14:16.455
You did it, Tyrone.
You shattered Jeff's time.

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:17.956 line:92%
You can come on out now.

00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:19.992
Oh Joe Rogan, if it's
all the same to you,

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.494
I'd like to finish
reading my newspaper.

00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:25.364
I haven't had a chance to sit
still and read for so long.

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:31.036
Technically you can stay
in there as long as you want.

00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:33.873
You know what? I think
I'm going to take a nap.

00:14:37.342 --> 00:14:39.244
Go ahead without me.
I'll catch up.

00:14:39.277 --> 00:14:41.614
Could you dim the lights
please, Joe Rogan?

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.662 line:92%
Crack.

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:02.000
All right, it's time
for your next challenge.

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:03.836 line:92%
Walking on hot coals.

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:07.406
Some of these coals burn
at over a thousand degrees.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.674 line:92%
God damn.

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:10.542
The two people that can spend
the most time

00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:12.278 line:92%
on those coals will advance.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.213
All right, Rita,
you're up first.

00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:16.415 line:92%
Ready to do this?

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:17.649 line:92%
Yeah.

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:25.891
Go! Time. Eight seconds.
Go! Come on Jeff.

00:15:26.524 --> 00:15:28.593 line:92%
This is a test.

00:15:28.626 --> 00:15:31.530
Time!. Seven seconds.
Rita, he didn't beat your time.

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:34.199
Congratulations,
you advance automatically.

00:15:34.232 --> 00:15:36.268 line:92%
Tyrone, it's up to you now.

00:15:36.301 --> 00:15:39.004
All you have to do is beat
Jeff's time of seven seconds

00:15:39.037 --> 00:15:40.439
and you will move on
to the next round

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:43.208
and be that much closer
to $50,000 dollars.

00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:44.543 line:92%
Oh.

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:46.311
Take your shoes off.
Let's do it.

00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:48.814
Whoa. Tyrone, I think
there's something wrong

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:53.251 line:92%
with one of your feet.

00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:54.486 line:92%
Oh.

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:56.621 line:92%
Go!

00:15:56.654 --> 00:15:59.558
Hey Joe Rogan,
is it almost lunch time?

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:01.293
Because I smell
somebody cooking.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.066
Maybe some hazy steaks
or catfish and fried peppers.

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:12.270 line:92%
Tyrone, are you okay? You won.

00:16:12.303 --> 00:16:14.907
You beat Jeff's time.
You advance to the next round.

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:17.109 line:92%
My feet are strong.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.291
All right, Rita and Tyrone,
here is your final stunt.

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:36.461
Eat one of these platters
contains over three pounds

00:16:36.494 --> 00:16:39.565
of elk penis
in a light cream testicle sauce.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.701
It's topped off
with diced pig bladder.

00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:44.970
For dessert,
we have horse hooves.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.807
Whoever can eat the most
is going to walk away

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.443
with $50,000 dollars.
Go!

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:53.945
Hurry up, girl,
I want to do my turn.

00:16:53.978 --> 00:16:56.581
Grab that penis,
suck them juices off.

00:16:56.614 --> 00:17:02.054
Suck it.
That's it. Oh!

00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:05.457 line:92%
I can't do this.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.758 line:92%
Are you sure?

00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:07.959
Mm-hmm
(affirmative)

00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:10.095
All right, I'm sorry.
You're eliminated.

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:12.230
All right, Ty. It's up to you.
All you have to do is eat

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:13.532
a little bit
and you're the champion.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.267 line:92%
And yada yada yada.

00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:20.238
You know, Joe Rogan,
this is not the first time

00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:22.207 line:92%
I've tasted penis.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.109
I've had several
in my line of work.

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:29.381
You taste penis' all the time.
All kinds to get drugs.

00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:32.751
Tyrone, you are our champion.
Congratulations.

00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:36.755
And evidently fear
is not a factor for you.

00:17:36.788 --> 00:17:38.524
Fear is never a factor,
Joe Rogan.

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.393
I'm trying to get
some crack rocks.

00:17:41.426 --> 00:17:43.595
For real, I did it.
I won.

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.231
Come down on
these penis' with me.

00:17:46.798 --> 00:17:51.270
Hot sauce! There you go.
Pretend like it's mine's.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.880
Tyrique, this money's going to
change our lives forever.

00:18:05.383 --> 00:18:08.887
Tyrique, I can finally make
an honest woman out of you.

00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:12.758
Give you that rock
you always had your eye on.

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:17.996 line:92%
Here Tyrique, see?

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:20.632
Oh Tyrone.
This will get us high for-

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:22.367 line:92%
Hours. I know.

00:18:23.501 --> 00:18:35.347
But first,
may I have this dance?
