00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.660
Now that we've got a scatter plot. I want you to take a guess as to what

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.440
you think the correlation coefficient is, between these two

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.730
variables. Write that answer in this box. After you've

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.410
made your guess, I want you to calculate

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.740
the actual correlation between the two variables and put

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.070
that number here. Be sure you round your answer

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.920
to the thousandths place or to three decimal places.
