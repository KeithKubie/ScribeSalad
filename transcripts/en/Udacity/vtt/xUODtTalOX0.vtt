00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.140
To access the classroom videos,
you'll click Classroom.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.050
Within a given course,
you'll see a few things.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.800
Up here, you'll see a drop down
box with a list of lessons.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.830
&gt;&gt; Typically, your class will give you
a separate calendar telling you when you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.540
should watch each lesson.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.150
&gt;&gt; Click on any lesson to
jump straight to that lesson.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.430
These bars across the top will indicate
your progress through the lesson.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.170
The orange indicates
what video you're on now,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.950
the blue are those that
you have already watched.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.040
The grey are those you have yet to watch
and the dots here indicate exercises.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.000
So we'll talk about those next.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.580
&gt;&gt; Real quick though,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.860
note also that below videos you
may find some instructor notes

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.110
as well as additional links to
the downloadables for that video.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.860
There are also a couple options you
can turn on when viewing the videos

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.190
on Udacity.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.710
You can click the CC button to turn
the closed captions on and off, and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.670
if you click the gear,
you can adjust the speed of the video.
