1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,840
This listening to radio
lab radio from W. N y.

2
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:10,030
S? Yup. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,170
Okay. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,440
We are super, super excited to
talk with you. Oh, same in me.

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,660
I'm sorry about the delay and so,
oh, that's fine. No, it's a busy day.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,120
Life is crazy. Life is crazy. I know.
But uh, you were so enthusiastic,

7
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:32,320
so I just, I need to talk to
these guys. They really mean it.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,630
This is Alex Alexandre Gumbo, Gumbo,
Ma. Are you Norwegian all the way back?

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,120
Yeah. Typical Norwegian, you know,

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,390
if typical includes things like biking
Sahara and climbing Everest and things

11
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,020
like that.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,580
He's kind of a professional adventurer
and we got him into the studio because he

13
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:55,270
made a video last year on one of
his trips. Get tell you this video.

14
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,430
It's maybe the most amazing
Internet video I've ever seen.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,430
I think so too. So let me just
set the scene for you. Okay.

16
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,060
What you see in the video is this
Guy Alex kind of moving along this,

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,920
he's on skis, this snowy snow scape
[inaudible] he's filming himself.

18
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,340
He's got the camera in his right hand.
Where is he exactly? Antarctica. Oh,

19
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:22,240
he's on a three month track to the
South Pole and back by himself.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,570
And what he'd been doing is every
couple of days on his trip, you know,

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,140
everybody 200 kilometers. And so he
would bury stuff in the snow, some,

22
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:33,280
some fuel and uh, and sometimes a
little bit of gear that I didn't use.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,950
Was that just to lighten
your load? Yeah. You know,

24
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:39,820
cause every ounce of unneeded
weight has to go. So in this video,

25
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,390
it's date 86, almost
three months since I left.

26
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,770
That's three months of walking 10
hours a day and I lost almost 25 kilos.

27
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,840
55 pounds. He's exhausted.

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:50,983
Oh,

29
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,970
he's come upon his last cash.

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,360
So on the last cash where
this video is captured,

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,780
what you see is Alex Neil
and the snow start to dig.

32
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,800
[inaudible] I'm telling
you that I'm quite hungry.

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,880
Whatever's in this last cash in the snow,

34
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,410
it's been three months since he buried it.

35
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:19,780
So I didn't really recall what was there.

36
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,400
[inaudible] he helps it sound good. Cool.

37
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,140
So he digs up this bag of stuff, starts
rifling through it. There's ticket and

38
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,930
[inaudible] gasoline, some zinc
ointment. It's just a mess.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,160
Nothing. It's pretty much all press down.

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,700
Excuse me. That awesome bro.

41
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,770
But then Yup.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,393
Yeah,

43
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,740
yeah.

44
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,203
[inaudible]

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,550
he holds up good.

46
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,390
[inaudible] devil back
of cheese doodles. Yeah.

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,400
[inaudible]

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,350
then he throws it up in the air. Yeah.

49
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,670
[inaudible]

50
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,680
and then this is, this
is my favorite part.

51
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:24,450
He just freezes and he's staring
off into the distance. Almost like,

52
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,380
did that happen? [inaudible] killer.

53
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,823
Is it real?

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,370
Okay,

55
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,660
so he starts to dig some more and then

56
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,843
bye.

57
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,190
[inaudible].

58
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,860
What's it? This huge chocolate bar.

59
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:51,120
It's milk chocolate and then it's
just like he finds the Mentos

60
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,190
I find more and more and

61
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,830
Lauren Woo.

62
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,000
Have you ever been that happy in your
life? Well, I've been thinking about that.

63
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,090
How? When did you shout
last time you were so happy.

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,000
I think that's why we've been watching
this video over and over again because

65
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,050
none of us can remember.

66
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,650
It's like what stands between you and
that feeling is a really interesting

67
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:20,710
question. Yeah. It's a
free mounts with hunger.

68
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,151
Actually,

69
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:25,790
I think the reason I liked this video
so much is not just because he's happy.

70
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,100
He said he somehow stumbled
into this moment of perfection.

71
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,310
It's just like a perfect situation by
being so tired and so hungry and finding

72
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:41,270
such a stash of candy that
he had forgotten to, he left.

73
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,860
He created a moment of just
absolute complete bliss.

74
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,023
[inaudible]

75
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,840
[inaudible] in this hour on radio lab,

76
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,940
we're going to be searching for
moments like Alex had up in Antarctica.

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,700
We're going to be searching for
bliss, bliss of all different sorts,

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,480
perfect moments,

79
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,440
perfect worlds kind of blistered slips
right through your fingers and the kind

80
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:14,700
of bliss that just might last. And last,

81
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,000
right? We're going to begin with a story
that, uh, kind of inspired this show.

82
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,550
We would have never done a show
about the word bliss, where it,

83
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:33,410
not for the following story,
which is about a bliss. A,

84
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
what do you mean a better? That'll
make sense in just a second.

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,040
A story comes from our producer Tim
Howard, and it begins with a box of tapes.

86
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,620
Uh, alright. So check it
out. This is in my office.

87
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:44,840
And you've got a rectangular
package here. What is,

88
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,660
what is a very old looking box?

89
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,160
It doesn't look like much. It's
just about like 15 cassettes.

90
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,060
Tape number six, singing and
playing to friends in America.

91
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:00,860
[inaudible]

92
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,200
okay, so this is Charles, Charles Casey.

93
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,100
You'll bliss in both an amazing
character. And that's Richard.

94
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,470
Richard [inaudible]. He's a
fellow who gave me the cassettes.

95
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,210
He was a friend of Charles. Yeah.

96
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,710
So these were just like sitting
in his attic or something, garage.

97
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,850
He looked like, I suppose a little
known him, a little Leprechaun, almost

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,970
[inaudible] he was short, bald
and laughter the whole time.

99
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,650
[inaudible] it's a lovable character.
Simple as that. This is my favorite one.

100
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,320
Gay Nicholas. Yet we just like, just
explain why we're talking about this guy.

101
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,070
Sure.

102
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,460
Because these tapes tell an amazing
story about a guy who really embodied

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,330
his name and he tried to save the world,

104
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,840
but ultimately just tried too hard.

105
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,890
Fall into that void in
my life. K in grade eight

106
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,460
we can start the story here. This is from
a lecture that he gave decades later.

107
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,810
So the story goes,

108
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:04,790
it's 1908 and he's a little kid living
in what's now the Ukraine. Okay.

109
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,680
And His name is Carl Blitz, not
Charles list, not Charles Bliss,

110
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,780
Carl Blitz, B. L. I. T. Z.

111
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,870
That's his original name and a little
Carl was fascinated by tales of

112
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,890
discovering adventure.
My name is Erika Okrent.

113
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,280
Erica wrote about Charles Bliss and
there's a great book called in the land of

114
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:28,190
invented languages. Getting back
to the story one day, she says,

115
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:31,910
when Carl was 11 a lecture
came through town about some

116
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,600
Austin polar expedition,

117
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,940
polar expedition,

118
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,830
two explorers talking about their trek
across the North Pole and he was so

119
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:43,610
inspired by what he saw and heard at
that lecture did. Even decades later,

120
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:44,730
he couldn't talk about it

121
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,980
and my father took me
through this. I shoot me

122
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,930
without getting choked up.

123
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,080
[inaudible] my father took
me to this lecture and fed.

124
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,480
I show Nay who left? One Rose,

125
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,400
just Jessica CUNY sisters.

126
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,860
And when all people got into the ice
and snow in on almost chipping this bull

127
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:15,230
walk for a walk. We're in
search of knowledge for a idea

128
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,530
as he tells it on those tapes.

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,340
That was the beginning of his big idea
that was going to change the world.

130
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,770
Fast forward a few years,

131
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,840
they came to Ghana after the first girl
who did end up going to the Technical

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:30,740
University of Vienna.

133
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,370
I was suddenly discovered to be the
best mandolin player in Australia.

134
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,500
And one time I played with a full opera
orchestra under the action as a composer

135
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,710
Francesca. Uh, so those were the days

136
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,430
and then everything changed. In 1938

137
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,710
[inaudible] across the Austrian border,

138
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,610
the Nazis came to town,
Nazis came to town,

139
00:08:56,611 --> 00:09:00,210
he was sent to Depauw and
then Buchenwald you know,

140
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,620
the concentration camps,

141
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
feelings won't be shown
desire to end my life

142
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,200
all around him. People were being worked
to death or outright exterminated,

143
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,760
but his wife Claire was a
German Catholic with connections

144
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,660
and clear am I good vibes, sluggish,

145
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,260
my mandoline and my guitar
into the concentration game.

146
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,340
[inaudible]

147
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,220
I became so famous amongst
notches. For instance,

148
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:29,000
I blocked fear would come into
[inaudible]. I can say bitch

149
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,160
[inaudible]

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,300
and you could say that it was here in
book and wall that Carl started to develop

151
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:41,040
his ideas about language, about the
ways that you can manipulate words.

152
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,640
For instance, there was this one song
that all the prisoners saying, Yep,

153
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,970
well who fleet one of the
[inaudible] songs? I can ever mean

154
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,970
the saddest lyrics in the
world. At a certain point,

155
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,190
Carl started to play around
with this song. You know,

156
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,710
he'd swap out some of the
sad lyrics for some jokes,

157
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,660
sing it for his fellow prisoners,

158
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,790
and then laughed and laughed and laughed
and for God for a few minutes that the

159
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,490
orange of darkest and the
most terrible [inaudible].

160
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,740
And on the flip side,

161
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,490
every evening the guards would
march all the prisoners outside,

162
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,490
force them to stand there in the
cold, in front of these loudspeakers,

163
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,870
make them listen to these speeches.

164
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,653
Wow.

165
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,400
Speeches of Hitler and
Gerbils screaming Nazi slogan.

166
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:25,980
Yes.

167
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,780
Which means Germany above all

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,590
did I say I got to start with
the rice bags [inaudible] words,

169
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,530
which [inaudible] which does you mean? But

170
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,230
after about a year,

171
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,290
his wife somehow wrangled a a
British visa for him and he gets out,

172
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,030
thank heavens those dreadful times are
gone and now I can play here for you and

173
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,070
improvisation as it
comes into my mind. Yeah.

174
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,460
[inaudible]

175
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,070
in 1939 he went to Britain,

176
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,100
then got a job as a
manager of [inaudible],

177
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,240
but he arrived in England just as

178
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,390
[inaudible].

179
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,350
The blitz begins, the German start
to bomb every major city in England.

180
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,490
The noise did you hear at the moment
is the sound of air raid siren

181
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,080
and every time he'd introduce
himself to somebody new they shutter,

182
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,770
that can't be your name. Yeah.

183
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,530
Because of like blitzkrieg good
to have that associate. Yes.

184
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,290
God going off,

185
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,380
he had a good business was named like
blitz and so I changed from the war,

186
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:30,710
like rich to the peace for base.

187
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,660
That was how he became Charles Bliss.
Bliss has all the right associations.

188
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:41,100
So he went forward with the feeling of
that he was now bliss and would bring

189
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:45,920
happiness to the world. And a year later,

190
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:50,240
he and his wife ended up in China and
Shanghai where there was a big population

191
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,990
of Xcel, Jews. Shanghai was the only
place that would take them at that

192
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,520
time. And they're in
China. And then in China,

193
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,580
I got Joe Opportunity of my lifetime
and now we come to his big idea.

194
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,760
I realize what I did not know that
the Chinese have a different way of,

195
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,320
right. He became enraptured by
the Chinese writing that he saw

196
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,710
the Chinese use symbols
and each symbol is a word.

197
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,880
And he writes about having this epiphany
when he started the Chinese symbol for

198
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:22,330
man,

199
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,330
he saw that the Chinese written form
of man sort of looks like a man.

200
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,390
It looks like a stick figure
man. And it means man,

201
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,910
he doesn't even know what
the Chinese word for man is.

202
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:35,160
He doesn't know how to say
man, but that doesn't matter.

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,180
He is skipping the word and
going directly into the meaning.

204
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,030
So here was a way of
getting beyond language.

205
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,720
You could think of the word in any
language if you see it in the symbol

206
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,200
was a revelation. Why? Well,

207
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,210
Gotcha.

208
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,480
I mean,

209
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,500
think back to the concentration camps
when they were outside in front of those

210
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,220
loudspeakers listening to
Hitler's saying stuff like,

211
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,440
no. [inaudible]

212
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,690
Paralis you know, Germany above
all that phrase [inaudible]

213
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,130
Charles knew that it
actually predated the Nazi.

214
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,370
That was cool a hundred
years earlier in 1848

215
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,030
and originally it was meant as a rallying
cry to bring together all of these

216
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,590
separate principalities.

217
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,490
You see the robot where you
can't go book structure, you can

218
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,150
that spoke German, but
these were not one country.

219
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,210
So when they said Deutschland
Alice, it meant university

220
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,240
unified Germany,

221
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,620
the nation above the states. Oh, suit
wasn't necessarily an aggressive thing.

222
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:34,940
Yeah,

223
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,670
no, but Hitler turn this around.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,720
Hitler changes the meaning instead
of the nation above all states.

225
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,340
He changed it to the nation.

226
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,170
Never seen. You've got all the
conditional, the word bubble,

227
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,660
all other nations. So
you'd see what happened.

228
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:53,220
This phrase that started meaning
one thing, unification. Yeah,

229
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,500
became the opposite. Yeah.
This is what the Nazis did.

230
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,040
Yours works nice.

231
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,870
It would bend words to obscure
the truth of what they were doing.

232
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,030
Extermination did call it solution.
By doing that. As he saw it,

233
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,270
they were able to convince
good, sane people,

234
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:15,850
his neighbors to go along
with the genocide. [inaudible]

235
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,240
and I realized that [inaudible] must
be done to make language more to it.

236
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,560
The nature words were the problem.

237
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:28,390
Words made people do cruel things to
each other. They bear our society apart.

238
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,010
Words were dangerous instruments.
They caused violence. They cause wars.

239
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,870
So when he saw the Chinese symbol for
man, he thought this might be the answer.

240
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,960
And that idea came up to me that I would
should invent shimmers like the Chinese

241
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,560
symbols, but even clearer,

242
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,550
he just show simple and pictorial
that even children can read them.

243
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,650
If he could sit down and work it out.

244
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,830
You look at the symbol and
know what it meant instantly,

245
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,510
regardless of what language you spoke,

246
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,810
you wouldn't even need words which
he felt could be manipulated.

247
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:04,340
You could just have the symbol and get
straight to the truth of the manner and

248
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,520
the way he saw it. Right off the bat,
you'd have all of these benefits.

249
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,020
Freshmen didn't finish English when an
Estonian language barriers would be out

250
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:12,620
the window.

251
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,540
Everything from traffic accidents
to health problems could be avoided.

252
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,120
He thought if his symbol
system would just be adopted.

253
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,950
He had this vision that
high level political and
commercial negotiations would

254
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:26,210
be done in symbols.

255
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Did he say anything as grand as like or
wouldn't happen constantly and even of

256
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,234
course

257
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,890
he reckon Hitler wouldn't have happened
basically that if the German people had

258
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:40,550
understood the symbols, they wouldn't
have copped gerbils propaganda.

259
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,480
That's a pretty tall order, but
it did seem to be what he thought.

260
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,520
Everything could be cured by the system.

261
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,610
He's the biggest dreamer ever. Yeah.
How did he go about doing this?

262
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,620
He started working out with the
basic lines and shapes would be,

263
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,280
he also wanted to make sure you
could produce it with a typewriter,

264
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:02,330
so it had to be a limited set of
shapes out of which everything could be

265
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,223
created.

266
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,120
Okay, so he works on it for
seven years, seven years,

267
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,530
and he comes up with that.
Wow. That is a big way.

268
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,260
This massive book called list symbolics,

269
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,540
Symantec ology illogical
writing for an illogical world.

270
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,650
It says it all where he explains the
logic of his system. For example here,

271
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:25,520
here's a symbol for sword, which
looks exactly like a sword.

272
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,500
And then the sword plus a forward
Arrow means attack. I buy it.

273
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,500
And then if you see a symbol for sword
and another symbol for sword and they're

274
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:35,790
cross, that means war.

275
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,490
So that's the idea that you take these
basic elemental symbols and combine them.

276
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,250
Exactly. All right. Here's another one.

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,770
This symbol here is like the top half
of a circle, like a little rainbow,

278
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:51,180
but just one line that means mind, mind,
it looks like the top of his skull. Ah.

279
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Now if I were to take that symbol for
mind and I were to go like this or to put

280
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,900
inside it, the question
mark, that means, um,

281
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,240
I don't know or I have no doubt.
And, and there are also, you know,

282
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:10,710
ways to indicate verbs and adjectives
and first person, second person,

283
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,360
the past, the future.

284
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,510
But kind of the one thing that it did
that no other language or symbol system or

285
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:20,300
anything is attempted to do,
at least as far as I know,

286
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,100
is that it would make clear
when something was, um, well,

287
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,860
he called the human evaluation,
you know, basically an opinion.

288
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,440
And what you would do is
you'd put this a little,

289
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,600
this little v symbol and you put it
above this symbol and y, y v. Well,

290
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:37,321
because you know,

291
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:41,400
a v is balanced on a point and
it's unstable at wobbles to him.

292
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,100
That represents opinion's
human evaluations.

293
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:47,580
Anything that comes out in
the mind or take metaphors

294
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,300
[inaudible] the top four is he says,

295
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,280
you must put up the [inaudible] sign
to alert the reader. Do not take this.

296
00:17:56,281 --> 00:18:00,990
Literally stop [inaudible] not
exactly bulletproof, but I can,

297
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,000
I can see the, the thinking there.

298
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,080
I actually think it's pretty impressive
and okay, so what happens next?

299
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,830
Well after he finishes this and he and
his wife are living in Australia at the

300
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:15,750
time, they spent all their savings on
producing this book and sent it out to

301
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,790
professors, government officials, heads
of state, something like 6,000 people.

302
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,530
And they waited for the orders
to start rolling in and um,

303
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,590
no response from anybody.
And then they had nothing.

304
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:37,970
[inaudible]

305
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,100
I can't say. I didn't
see that coming. Yeah.

306
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,010
And with great disappointment,

307
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,750
Charles went to work as a welder and yeah,

308
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,730
factory at General Motors.

309
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:52,930
Holden's he was working on the
production line almost as a robot.

310
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,610
And a year later his wife died. You
know, he had fought in world war one.

311
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:01,730
He had been in a concentration
camp. He had lived in exile,

312
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,670
but he says this was the
lowest point of his life

313
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,440
until one day, 1971 this, as he said,

314
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,990
this letter floated onto his desk

315
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,680
with this picture of this
beautiful dimpled child.

316
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,580
Proudly using his symbols.

317
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,613
Yeah,

318
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,990
it was a poster, a poster,
a poster. This is Shirley,

319
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,330
Shirley McNaughton and at the time she
was a nurse at a place called D o c c c

320
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,850
the Ontario crippled children's

321
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,080
center and named that we were very happy
to leave behind us and they've since

322
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,111
changed in the name.

323
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:49,111
I started there in 1968 and Shirley
was part of this group of teachers and

324
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:54,040
nurses who worked with these kids
who suffered from cerebral palsy.

325
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,360
If you have cerebral palsy,

326
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,080
it's the motor control from
the brain that's been affected,

327
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,580
which meant that they had trouble moving
their arms or legs and even in some

328
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:07,390
cases they couldn't speak.
They couldn't form words

329
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,720
and then a film that
was made of this class.

330
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,470
You see these young kids,

331
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,400
children from five to seven I'll sitting
in wheelchairs and they're watching the

332
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,624
teacher.

333
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,070
She talks to them and you
hear them try to talk to her,

334
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,840
but they can. These kids
had no way to communicate.

335
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
Couldn't they learn how
to [inaudible]? I read.

336
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,050
They could if you knew what they were
understanding and they have no way to

337
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,670
communicate that to you.

338
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,540
The only thing all these kids had were
pictures that they could point at.

339
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,860
They had a picture of a toilet,
picture of food, picture of a drink,

340
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,430
a of a bed. They were limited
to that kind of communication.

341
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,080
But I knew they were bright. But if they
couldn't move and they couldn't speak,

342
00:20:56,081 --> 00:21:01,000
how would you know? My uh, insight on
that was the twinkle in their eyes.

343
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,890
But she says a lot of doctors and nurses
at the time thought I was crazy that

344
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,650
there really wasn't much going on
inside these kids' heads. You know,

345
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:12,160
they thought I was projecting
into the children what she needed.

346
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:14,050
She said was a way to get through to them.

347
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,490
And so one day she was at the library
with a colleague and they come across this

348
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,400
dusty old volume that had never been
checked out, called, you guessed it,

349
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,060
lists symbol, likes and what did you
first think when you saw it? Oh boy,

350
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,440
can I get back to the group?

351
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:33,430
How fast can I get back to the group
with this exactly what we need.

352
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,440
So do you remember what the first
symbols were? I think it was I you,

353
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,490
I looked kind of like a
standing person. Upright line,

354
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,030
small horizontal line at the base.
Yep. Next to it, the number one,

355
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,410
which means first person you as the
same symbol but with a number two for a

356
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:55,411
second person and then they had to have
a verb and it was long heart with an air

357
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,560
threat. So now they've got
a sentence. I love you.

358
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,850
One of our mothers,

359
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,740
since the happiest moment she's ever had
with her child was when her child came

360
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:09,260
home and said, I love you. You know, so

361
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,330
[inaudible]

362
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,220
surely and her staff
started to add more symbol.

363
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,990
They caught on and pretty soon they'd
created this giant laminated chart.

364
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,400
It had I and you and he, she, we and they,

365
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,870
then it had mother, father,
grandma, grandpa, doctor,
nurse, teacher, therapist,

366
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,760
postman, environment, library, dentist.
Eventually they added adjectives, happy,

367
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:37,580
sad and frustrated. All the verbs
who had loved and liked and hey,

368
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,960
want ni understand.

369
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,110
Pretty soon the kids started to do
amazing things with symbol combinations.

370
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,430
They started to improvise. Shirley
remembers asking one kid, Terry Martin,

371
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:53,220
what did you want to be? Refer Halloween.

372
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,660
Terry pointed first at the symbol for
creature, a creature, not a person.

373
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,150
Then he pointed at a symbol for drinks.

374
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,190
Then blood night creature who
drinks blood at night. Right.

375
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:08,940
You want it to be of par.
Ah, he spelled a new word.

376
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,700
It sounds like an explosion
with these kids. It was.

377
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,010
It was for the first time.

378
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:21,011
She says she could actually talk
to them like know who they were.

379
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,800
Yeah. You've got to know who the
leaders were in the classroom.

380
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,640
Those who wanted to help
others, those who copied others.

381
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,140
And it was around then that she and the
other teachers decided to send Charles

382
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,980
Bliss. That letter.

383
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,690
We were sharing our excitement for
this gift deed given to the children.

384
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,360
You know, he was in Australia,
he was an elderly man.

385
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:45,020
We had no thought that he would
come and visit us, you know,

386
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,100
didn't enter our mind. But
Charles Bliss, he was delighted.

387
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,183
[inaudible]

388
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,290
he had battled for so long, had
recognition and now he headed,

389
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:57,850
yeah,

390
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,260
mortgages, his house and it
flies over. Heavy, bad debt.

391
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:06,370
Paid my mandolin and told him jokes
and only he dances around and kisses

392
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:10,480
everybody a Fusilli than
laughter. I love that. Hello?

393
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,350
We had long conversations
with the kids in symbols,

394
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,770
right? He was very happy
about the children. Joy,

395
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,570
joy,

396
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,400
okay. But somewhere along the
way, he noticed this something

397
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,150
surely, surely and the
teachers had begun to

398
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,790
[inaudible]

399
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,350
augment the system.

400
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,400
They'd be going to add their own symbols
such as the opposite meaning symbol.

401
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,880
This allowed the kids to take one implicit
standard symbols and just invert the

402
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:49,410
meaning, opposite of happy, sad,
opposite of uptown, opposite of Ian,

403
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,250
out in to her.

404
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,940
This would effectively double the number
of adjectives which would be great for

405
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:58,530
the kids and we developed rules for how
to combine symbols for how to be more

406
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:02,280
precise with the symbols. She thrown
some new pronouns that we're missing.

407
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:06,300
The difference between he
and him and his. In short,

408
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,860
I would make the adaptations I needed
to make from the very beginning.

409
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:14,190
We were using it to meet
the children's needs,

410
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,630
their specific needs, and of course
that is not what he had in his mind.

411
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,030
He wanted a system that was universal.

412
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,230
Every change that she made created
like a, a separate dialect.

413
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,740
He would get very emotional about
it. So when he got back to Australia,

414
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,770
he started writing all these
letters basically taking
issue with her changes and

415
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,550
her failure to understand how
his system works. Meanwhile,

416
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,240
thanks to Shirley,

417
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,660
worried about blesses symbols
had spread way beyond Canada too.

418
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:50,220
France, Sweden, Israel,

419
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,190
Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe. Yeah.
And then Argentina, Brazil,

420
00:25:56,191 --> 00:26:00,060
Finland, Iceland, Italy, Bermuda, Guam,
Japan, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands,

421
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:02,910
Hungary, Switzerland, Venezuela,
Madagascar, Yugoslavia.

422
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,860
It's spread to all these places. Yeah.

423
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,980
And in each place,

424
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,120
the symbols bin Inevitably get tweaked
to suit that country. For example,

425
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:14,270
in Israel because the writing
goes from right to left. Yeah.

426
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,330
The bliss symbols went
from right to left. Uh,

427
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,260
but what really pained him the most,

428
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:23,261
what really got him was that these
teachers were using his symbols as a step

429
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:27,140
toward English or French or
German or Hebrew or whatever.

430
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,580
It was just a way to get the
kids to their native languages.

431
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,920
The teachers always saw
it the way they saw it.

432
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:37,240
You start the kids on bliss and then
you introduce reading and letters and

433
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:38,830
eventually they're fully literate.

434
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,590
At which point you don't
need the bliss symbols.

435
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,460
This was the ultimate insult to him.

436
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,990
They were using his system to bring
these kids back to the very thing that he

437
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:55,280
was trying to get everyone
away from evil words. Yeah,

438
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,860
why not? Why not?

439
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,410
If I tried to explain it to them, they
don't want donation to me, then look,

440
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:05,020
show me what should I do? I do that.

441
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,510
I don't know [inaudible] and it's right
about this point in the story that you

442
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:13,510
start to hear a different Charles Place.

443
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,210
Shannon,

444
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,210
if Norton has better that it never
has been better than [inaudible].

445
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,500
Is he saying perverted? Yeah,

446
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,300
she smiles. She be guys. She she lies.

447
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,540
He kept sending Shirley and the other
teachers letters and the letters got

448
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:33,130
angrier. An angrier. This was
not what the language was for.

449
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:37,090
This was a universal language that had
nothing to do with spoken language.

450
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,740
You are ruining my system.

451
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:43,090
You are abusing it and eventually he
decided to take matters into his own hands

452
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,950
and he traveled back to Canada and he
started going to the various centers where

453
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:52,430
the kids were using his symbols and
seeing horrible things about me. Uh,

454
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,420
and getting them very upset.
That's when I got upset.

455
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:57,430
I got upset when he got them upset.

456
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,980
Not long after Shirley receives a
summit I have taken to court. She,

457
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,340
oh she, she in Dubuque.
He sued them. Yeah.

458
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,730
I added two more dependents.
Ms Jalen ignored on the tapes,

459
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,280
even suggest that he's going
to have surely put away,

460
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,850
put a whole knife for life. Wow.

461
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,310
Why was he so upset with
her in particular? Well,

462
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:22,300
because by this time she'd started
the international organization,

463
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,960
BCI Bliss Symbol,
communications international,

464
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:31,170
and she felt like this was a total
unique and powerful tool which could,

465
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,220
could and should transform lives around
the world and more teachers needed to

466
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:39,130
adopt it. Definitely.
What was he asking for?

467
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:42,490
Did he wanted us to use
the symbols in his way?

468
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,700
So in 1975 the BCI won a license agreement
to use the symbols in the workbooks

469
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:52,680
for the kids. But Charles
Bliss, they should all be part,

470
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,830
didn't give up, should all the part,

471
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,940
he published endless tirades and sent
them out to anybody who is listening.

472
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,050
Please should note and hopefully to
educate or oppose you, the patient.

473
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,340
What was the question was just all in all
this went on for over a decade and the

474
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,800
administration of the program or surely
was working was desperate to make him go

475
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:17,530
away. He had basically
destroyed the program.

476
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,740
And so in 1982 he and the BCI
finally come to an agreement.

477
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,550
Yeah.

478
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,630
It was a financial settlement
that satisfied him.

479
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,740
What was the financial
settlement? $160,000.

480
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,963
Wow.

481
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,131
You know,

482
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:40,180
we were a little program in the basement
of the Ontario cripple children's

483
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:43,810
center. We were, you
know, just a classroom.

484
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,330
Wow. That,

485
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
so a guy who wanted to save the world
ends up robbing a bunch of disabled kids.

486
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,770
I mean, that's kind of putting it crudely,
but that's how this, how it feels.

487
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,180
Yeah. Basically that's the, yeah.

488
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:02,500
[inaudible]

489
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,900
did the symbols ever go anywhere? Well,

490
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,390
there was a lot of excitement
about it in the beginning,

491
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,460
but it never spread very far.

492
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,140
It's used now at a few
schools in Canada and Sweden,

493
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:15,990
a couple other places. Uh,

494
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,560
but it never went very far because he
was constantly taking it down at every

495
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:21,394
turn.

496
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,910
[inaudible]

497
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,630
but here's what I find
most surprising. When I,

498
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,490
when I talked to Shirley, she didn't
have any bitterness toward him.

499
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,290
Not even in the worst moments when
we were having the final legal,

500
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,010
um, action.

501
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,360
We'd go through that in the morning and
as the players were packing up their

502
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:47,930
papers, Charles Bliss would reach
across the table and he'd say,

503
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,790
surely will you help me? And so she'd
go to lunch with him, sit with him,

504
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,480
and then he asked me if I would come
to his hotel that night and put the

505
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,810
eardrops in his ears. And
I did that every night.

506
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,500
He was involved with this thing.
That's just the way it was.

507
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,400
And it wasn't just that she takes care
of people for a living, you know, she,

508
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:12,550
she felt and still feels that Charles
Bliss had created something really new in

509
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:18,470
the world. She even told me that
when she uses blessed symbols,

510
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,360
she actually thinks differently.
Yes, definitely. Really, definitely.

511
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:27,680
What's different? Oh, I just think
so much more about what a word means

512
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,580
and it, it's, it's like
poetry in its purest form.

513
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,570
[inaudible]

514
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,840
um, well I've been playing with stained
glass down here in my retirement and you

515
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:41,381
can, you know,

516
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:46,381
you can just take the symbols and put
them into one composite and they say

517
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:53,230
things that only art
can say. It's beautiful.

518
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,180
They transmit a meaning
that is beyond any words.

519
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,713
[inaudible] [inaudible]

520
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,833

thanks to producer Tim
Howard and Erica Oakridge,

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,430
author of in the land of invented
languages. We'll be right back.

523
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,070
Bliss is having friends
and family you can rely on.

524
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,700
My name is Libby Graham and I am calling
from the side of the road in Dallas,

525
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:35,690
Texas awaiting rescue.

526
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,430
This is ginger, a socially awkward
introvert from Cabot, Arkansas.

527
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,800
Bliss is one day in which I do not have
to interact with another human being.

528
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,070
Bliss is political ignorance.

529
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,600
This is my moose from Malia places here,

530
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,850
baby sleeping in your arms.
