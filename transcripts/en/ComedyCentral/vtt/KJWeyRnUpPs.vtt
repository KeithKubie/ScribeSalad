00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.802
Welcome to "The Next Level."

00:00:01.802 --> 00:00:05.038
Right now, I'm here with my
guy, all the way from Detroit

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.773
and the heart of the city.

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.842
I'm talking about Jeff
Horste, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.776
Give him some love.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.646
Jeff Horste.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:13.947
Let's talk about Detroit, man.

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:17.217
You know, you play shows
with black audiences.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:21.455
What adjustments do you feel
like you have to make, if any?

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.056
Really, I think it
was just because--

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.858
it wasn't the black
audiences as much

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.793
as just some of the
rooms in Detroit

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.630
were just harder
rooms to perform in.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.731
I love that answer.

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.933
So I just put a
funnier joke up top.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.001
There you go.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.569
And then I did
my set as normal.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.571
It wasn't really--
it wasn't a change.

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:38.939
Those are the jokes
that I enjoy telling.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.741
I love that answer.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.643
And finally, I had an audience
that understood them more.

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:43.944
Because it shouldn't matter.

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:44.811
It shouldn't matter.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.946
Funny is funny.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.681
Well, you know what,
right now I want

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:49.583
to learn some stuff about
you by looking at a photo.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:50.784
OK.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.619
Here's Jeff's senior
high school picture.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.621
Jeff, do me a favor, man.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.891
Explain what was
going on here, please.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.728
You see, I grew facial
hair at a very young age.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.497
He looks older than you now.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:04.898
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.433
You look like a detective.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.902
Doesn't he look like
an undercover cop?

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:12.940
You just look like
you're wearing a wire.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.909
What was one of the strangest
experiences that you had?

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.778
I've had a few.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.580
I've performed at
nudist colonies.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.447
I'm sorry.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:20.981
What?

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:22.583
I'm sorry.
What?

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.984
I got booked to perform
at a nudist colony.

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:24.851
Back up.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.653
Stop for a second.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.856
First of all, who's
booking this gig?

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.960
Not that I want to go,
but if there's a promoter,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.229
who do I get in touch
with about the nudist gig?

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.065
I don't know if they want
to be mentioned on camera.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:39.866
There's naked
people in the crowd?

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.034
Yeah, Yeah.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.804
So literally,
literally, you're doing

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:47.174
stand-up and there's naked
people, just naked people.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:48.608
There's no way.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.843
And they're a little
uptight about it.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.512
You'd think they would--

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.514
they weren't as relaxed
of a comedy room

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:55.582
as you would imagine.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.950
That is the up there.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.819
That's up there with
one of the strangest

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.554
that I've ever heard, man.

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:02.656
I'm actually sorry that
you had to go through that.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:06.760
I am 100% apologizing
on their behalf.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.195
That shouldn't have
happened to you.

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:09.830
You're a good kid, man.
66
00:02:09,830 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
Now, this guy, this guy, it
should have happened to him.
