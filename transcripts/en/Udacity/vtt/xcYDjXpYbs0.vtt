00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:05.320
Something that Nick Felton talked about at the last Eyeo Festival,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.870
with his new annual report that just came out.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.780
He collected so much data, for this project.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.973
In, in the past he's collected the data in manual form on paper and

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.010
then he developed an app so that he could record stuff himself.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.730
For this year he collected data from like all kinds of news sources.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.550
So it was like all his emails,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.770
all of his text messages all of his phone records, plus a bunch of stuff that he

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.935
was collecting manually, plus all of his geographic locations.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:35.890
So for the phones we're doing a lot of this tracking for him, and

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.800
what I think was really interesting about that project is that the number of

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.800
data sources were or number of values were so

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.020
big that he could no longer manage it in the manual form.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.700
Like, he used to do this project with Excel sheets, and to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.700
me that's when that project became like a big data project,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.610
because he had to relinquish some control to the algorithm or to the software.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.040
We said, okay, well make me a map of all the places that I've been and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.400
he could make this, like he could let the software make this map.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.040
And, then as a human being who had, who lived through this he could look

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.710
at the map and say, well I know that's not right because I never went there.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.290
So this was a glitch in the GPS or

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.160
this was, you know, this was a glitch in my email system or something.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.310
But I think it's really interesting that he's made the decision to leave those

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.120
glitches in there.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.690
Like, the things that I am calling glitches are really just kind of

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.855
side effects of the data tracking process.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:39.280
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. &gt;&gt; And side effects of the algorithm, and how it's being applied.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.600
So I think, connecting that to the question.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.940
What's interesting about that to me is,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.990
when you're talking about what's subjective and what's objective.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.500
It gets really fuzzy when you get the algorithm involved, right?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.270
because you have. You have sort of my point of view.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.920
You have maybe like a more balanced objective point of view.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.480
But then you also have the point of view that's being represented by

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.314
your code or by the tools that you're using.

00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:01.912
[CROSSTALK]. &gt;&gt; Yeah the data itself right?

00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:02.649
And how it's collected.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.557
&gt;&gt; Yeah the data itself.

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:06.030
The process that we use, use to collect it.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.074
The technology that was maybe reliable or not that was used and collected.

00:02:12.074 --> 00:02:13.120
So, yeah I don't know.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.440
So I don't know what, what is like an objective truth in that, you know,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.410
in that kind of project.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.690
Yeah but it's, it's really interesting.
