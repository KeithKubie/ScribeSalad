00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Today, I want to talk about something a bit unusual that was discovered.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.500
It's called Hanny's Voorwerp.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.100
I may be pronouncing that wrong?
[MV: it's pronounced quite well]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.700
This object was discovered by accident,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.100
as are many of the most exciting astronomical discoveries.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.100
It was discovered by a member of the public,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.500
a schoolteacher in Holland, named Hanny van Arkel.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.300
The name is Hanny's Voorwerp, and voorwerp is Dutch for object.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.600
So this is Hanny's object, and that's what it looks like. A funny-looking thing.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.700
One of the basic things we do as astronomers is take pictures.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.600
Even now we have digital pictures from big telescopes

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.700
we still get a lot of information by looking at them with our eyes.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
The typical thing for an astronomer like myself to do,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.400
would be to cycle through thousands of images of objects.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.800
This is for my own survey, these are images from the Hubble space telescope,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.200
it's a galaxy, a disc like the Milky-way, but we see it edge-on.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.900
And we see a huge variety of objects.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.200
Round ones, some with spiral arms, a 'train wreck',

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.500
a collision of two different galaxies.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.000
Even though we have automated routines to gather information,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
we can teach a computer to do this,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.700
those automated routines are not perfect.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.300
There's still a lot to gain from using our eye-brain system,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.500
which is really good at picking out patterns or features.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.000
In my own research I may have gone through 5,000 of these images.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.200
Recording whether they have spiral arms, are round,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.600
whether they have bars, whether they're all messed up.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.200
Together with about eight other people, 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.600
we could cover six or seven thousand galaxies,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.400
with each one being done a couple of times.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.600
When you have a survey like the Sloan digital sky survey,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.700
we have millions of galaxies.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.600
That's far too many for one individual to look though one by one.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.800
So in this case the Galaxy Zoo project has enlisted members of the public to help.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.400
The Galaxy Zoo is a project I'm not involved with,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500
but it's close to our hearts here at Nottingham,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.700
because colleague Steven Bamford plays a key role.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.900
They've enlisted hundreds of thousands of people.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.300
Members of the public, schoolchildren, amateur astronomers, etc.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.500
- And me!
- and Brady of course to help with this project.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.900
How many galaxies have you looked at?
- I did about twenty

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.900
- I don't think you're up there in the top...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.800
This is the galaxy zoo webpage at galaxyzoo.org

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.300
After a galaxy zoo member logs in, they do the same thing,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.700
they are presented with pictures of galaxies and they look at them

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.800
they're asked very specific questions about the galaxy.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.800
All those classifications are combined in a statistical way

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:57.200
and the project has shown that this is as robust as when done by professional astronomers.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.200
In the first leg of the project they had about 150,000 people

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.300
classifying a million galaxies submitting 15 million classifications.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.400
You get a real hands-on connection with the science.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.000
The images themselves are beautiful,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.100
you're looking as spectacular pictures of galaxies,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.400
collections of hundreds of billions of stars, billions lightyears away.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.400
And there's always the possibility that you uncover that nobody else has.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.800
That's exactly what happened with Hanny's Voorwerp.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.200
Hanny van Arkel, schoolteacher from Holland,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.700
a participant in Galaxy Zoo,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.500
and she uncovered this strange object.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.200
She asked on the forum if anyone else knew what it was.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.100
No one could explain it, and it became an object of interest.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.200
It was out of the ordinary and unexpected.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
And that's always what we like follow-up.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.700
What you're seeing here is lots of galaxies,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.600
there's this big galaxy here with spiral arms,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.100
there's a companion galaxy next to it,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.700
but what we're interested in this green object here, Hanny's Voorwerp.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.800
It is irregularly shaped, so something is strange,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.300
and in this colour scheme it's bright green.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.300
It is very different in colour from the galaxies around it.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.500
That means it emits light at a particular narrow frequency.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.100
This was a puzzle, it wasn't immediately obvious what it was.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.900
Members of galaxy zoo and astronomers have followed it up,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.100
with many telescopes at different wavelengths,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.800
trying to find out as much as they could.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.800
They've determined it doesn't have any stars of it's own,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.100
it's mostly gas and dust,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.800
it's the remnants of a tiny galaxy that has been pulled apart,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.800
by the gravity of this much larger galaxy.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.400
We might not normally see that,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.300
because without stars it wouldn't be very bright.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.400
What they think has happened, is that something

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.500
has dumped a lot of energy in this gas.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.000
It's ionized it, which makes it glow at this wavelength.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.400
That object could be something like a quasar,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.500
a massive black hole accreting mass and spewing out energy,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.400
but there's no smoking gun in this picture.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.100
At any wavelengths, they can't see the candidate quasar.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.800
It may be hidden in the center of this galaxy here.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.900
But another intriguing possibility is that

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.600
it was spewing out energy but stopped.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.700
We've had enough time for the energy to reach Hanny's Voorwerp,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.300
ionize that gas and make it glow.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.200
That gap could be as long as 100,000 years.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:30.500
What could be seen here is a light echo of a dormant quasar.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.300
And we can still see what kind of effect it had.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.400
