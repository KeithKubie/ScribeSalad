00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C..

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.850
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Well,
thank you all for coming.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.150
I'm John Haskell.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.450
I'm the Director of
the Kluge Center here

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.750
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.060
And we together with
the Center for the book,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.920
represented by Guy Lamal-- I
can never pronounce your name.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.220
[Laughter] Help me with this.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.190
[Laughter] Guy, anyway,
is his name.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.370
Is, he, he and us
worked on this project,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.980
and we're glad you came
to see the program.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.260
The Kluge Center is, our mission
as established in the charter

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.890
in 2000 is to, quote,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.610
"Reinvigorate the
interconnection

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.150
between thought and action.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.080
Bridging the gap between
scholarship and policy-making."

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.830
To that end we, we have
programs like this one.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.140
Where we bring, in this case,
one of our former chairs,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.490
former Kissinger
Chair, Bruce Jentleson.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.440
To talk about a book
that he was working

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.740
on while he was at Kluge.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.610
We'll get into that
more shortly.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.500
Let me tell you a
little bit about Bruce.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
He's Professor of Political
Science and Public Policy

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.360
at the Sanford School of Public
Policy at Duke University.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450
Bruce's degrees,
at the bachelor's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.760
and doctoral level are
from Cornell University.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.150
And he has a master's degree

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.660
from the London School
of Economics.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.510
The current book
is The Peacemakers.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.490
Which is what we're going
to talk about today.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.140
Lessons in Leadership from
Twentieth Century Statesmen.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.000
That is coming out right
now, essentially, right?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.300
Like today.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.600
You can get one afterward.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.330
And Bruce will sign it for you.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.920
He has a textbook called
American Foreign Policy that's

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.350
in its fifth edition.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.660
Probably some of you have
had that assigned to you.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.210
And I'm sure you
read it carefully.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.050
He also wrote The
End of Arrogance:

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.220
America in the Global
Competition of Ideas.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.940
And With Friends Like
These: Reagan, Bush,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.370
and Saddam: 1982 to 1990.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.350
Bruce is one of those
academics who, in his career,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.880
has done a lot in
the policy side.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.530
Which informs and, and,
and most of us think,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.000
here at the Kluge Center,
all of us think here

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.700
at the Kluge Center makes
one's scholarship better.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.070
He was Senior Advisor

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.490
to the State Department
from 2009 to 2011.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.440
For the Obama Administration.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.550
And he served on
the 2012 campaign,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.860
National Security Advisory,
Advisory Steering Committee.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.730
He was a senior foreign
policy advisor

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.840
to Vice President Gore
during the 2000 campaign.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.200
And he served in the Clinton
Administration State Department.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.700
And he also worked in
the United States Senate,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.570
both for Senator Al Gore,
when he was in the Senate.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.340
And also for Senator David
Durenberger who was a Republican

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.960
from Minnesota many years ago.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.870
Bruce is co-founder with a
gentleman, Jim Goldgeier,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.920
who will be Kissinger
Chair come this fall.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.850
Of Bridging the Gap, which is a
policy promoting greater policy

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.320
relevance among academics.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.620
We'll talk a little bit
more about that later.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.670
But let's dive into the
first question, Bruce.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.610
And I just want to know
why you wrote this book.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.910
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Well first of all,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.310
let me say thank you for the
invitation to be here today.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.740
To the sponsors.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.040
Special thank you
to the Kluge Center.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.700
I spent the 2015-'16
academic year here

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.630
as the Kissinger Chair.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.880
There would be no book if it
was not for the opportunity

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.470
to do research while I was here.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.290
Thanks especially to Jay
McCullough who was head

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.590
of Kluge at that point.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.870
When, when I applied
and was gracious enough

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.170
to accept my application.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.760
So I, I really appreciate that.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.610
So you know a lot of the
work I've done, as John said,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.910
you know, in the policy world.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.940
As well as my academic
world work has been

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.430
on you know deeply
intractable foreign policy

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.070
international problems.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.090
I spent a number of years
working in the Middle East

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.960
on various peace talks and
a variety of other issues.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.320
I worked on so-called
responsibility to protect

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.690
and genocide pre, prevention.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.040
And this book deals with you
know many intractable problems.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.560
But I tried to focus on ones

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.220
in which major breakthroughs
were made during the 20th

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.050
century by a variety of types,
by a variety of leaders.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.860
So at one point I was
beginning to think

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.830
that I was writing this book
as mental health exercise.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.900
To keep me thinking
about the positives.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.220
It's not about any
perfect pieces.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.370
None of these were, you
know, absolute piece

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.670
that was fully enduring.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.420
That book would be very,
very short and thin.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.660
But I did decide
to finish it and,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.210
and then enjoy the mental
health benefits of talking

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.510
about it to, to people.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.810
But it's very important,
I thought,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.590
to talk about when we see
these very difficult problems

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.890
in the world.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.280
A variety of types for
both practical strategy

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.050
and inspiration.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.850
To see where leaders
really were able

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.590
to make major breakthroughs.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.620
And learn from that what we can
for the 21st century agenda.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.880
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So
you have experience

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.960
in both academics and in policy.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.130
How did that influence
the writing of this book?

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.550
I mean, in, in the sense

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.200
of how did you bring those
two together in this book?

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
So it's interesting.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.610
Those, you know, you know
John and others who have been

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.250
through [inaudible]
and political science.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.180
You know, there's
very little emphasis

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.920
on what they call the individual
level of analysis on leaders.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.540
It's about institutions.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.840
It's about processes.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.860
When you study international
relations,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.840
it's about you know
enduring concepts.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.740
Like balance of power,
national interest.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.230
As much of it should be.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.530
Indeed, put a number on it.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.490
Seventy to eighty
percent of what happens

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.050
in international affairs, who
the leader is matters a little.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.050
But, but not fundamentally.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.290
In Washington, having spent a
lot of time inside the Beltway,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.880
not just Kluge Center but
the other positions I've had.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.120
Sometimes there can be like
too much emphasis on leaders.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.420
Who did what?

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.720
What's the chemistry?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.020
You know, who winked at whom?

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.320
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.410
And so I was looking for sort of
a balance point between those.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.430
And, and one of the ways
I, I thought about it.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.930
I use an epigram from Isaiah
Berlin to start the book.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.110
Which is always a good
idea to quote Isaiah Berlin

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.410
when you start a book.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.710
You can't go wrong.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.930
And, and he said, "At crucial
moments, at turning points,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.380
individuals in their decisions

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.640
and acts can determine
the course of history."

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.940
And that's really
what I look at.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.910
Crucial, crucial moments,
at turning points.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.210
Not day to day.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.990
Why I call the book
transformational moments,

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.830
not just the transactional part.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.710
And I actually got a little bit
of inspiration from an article

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.320
that some colleagues wrote about
so-called "bad guy leaders."

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.830
And in that article, they, they,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.130
they looked at for
example Germany and Hitler.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.870
And said there's no question
that Germany was going

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.490
to be unstable after
World War I.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.790
But the particular form

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.470
that instability took
had an awful lot to do

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.750
with Hitler as the leader.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.940
Similarly with Napoleon
after the French Revolution.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.240
France was going to be unstable.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.420
And so I tried to flip that
around and, and look at it

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.890
from a positive point of view.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.700
And so I was really trying
to find a middle ground there

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.650
about where leaders matter.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.780
And then to flesh out, you know,
a little bit of a framework

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.870
of how they really matter and
what we could learn from that.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.430
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So that when,
when I just saw the title,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.800
before the book was even
available, I thought.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.850
"I wonder what the criteria
are to be a peacemaker."

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.250
I mean, like is there like
an entrance requirement?

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.550
You know, what's
the, what's the,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.900
what are the qualifications?

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.810
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: So one
of the fun things in the book.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.260
It's written very
much as, in the,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.070
in the publishing [inaudible]
they call it "trade book."

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.370
It's not just written for
academics and policy wonks.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.480
But it's really for broad
audiences who have interest

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.150
in what's going on in the world.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.490
And so if I was really savvy,
I'd have a social media game

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.240
out there now with
the book, right?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.320
For people to choose their
own 20th century peacemaker,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.620
peacemaker.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.870
So we do say, so I, I, when
I thought about what I mean

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.020
by peacemakers and
global peace and security.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.020
I break it into five
different categories.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.080
One is the major
powers, geopolitics.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.900
Because conflicts by major
powers historically have been a

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.200
principle cause of war.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.980
And rapprochement between
major powers has been crucial

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.280
to peace.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.450
Secondly, building
international institutions.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.820
Third, reconciling the
politics of identity in terms

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.900
of conflicts that are core.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.400
Based on issues of identity.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.610
Fourth is advancing
freedom and human rights.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.370
And fifth is fostering
global sustainability.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.310
And so at each of those areas,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.550
I try to have representative
cases.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.380
And the criteria
that I use are one,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.440
that it's about transformational
statesmanship.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.970
Not just transactional.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.050
It's efforts to really make
a breakthrough in the trans,

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.080
in the intractable problems.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.860
Secondly, and here I
confess as I was coming in,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.110
I saw that there's a
Baseball Americana exhibit

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.660
in the Jefferson
Building in June

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.960
which I've got to come back for.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.780
Because I'm, I'm a
total baseball fan.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.030
And anybody that you know
follows the Moneyball,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.720
there's this statistic
called wins

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.570
against replacement
player or WARP.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.160
Which is how many wins does this
particular shortstop contribute

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.460
to his team.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.150
You know, calculated
against every other shortstop

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.400
in baseball, and
there's a fancy formula.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.510
And so I call mine
"statesmanship Moneyball."

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.640
Alright? And I don't really
have a statistical formula.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.490
I just base it on the basis of
the argument and the evidence.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.570
And, and try to say that
this leader made choices

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.830
that another leader in that
situation wouldn't have made.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.750
For example, Gorba-- there's
a chapter on Gorbachev.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.140
And I strongly argue
against those

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.070
that say any Soviet
leader would have had

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.660
to make the choices he did.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.590
And so that's the
second criteria.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.980
Is it really something that,
that the particular had a set

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.180
of choices and political skills?

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.620
And the third one is what I call
impact had, not position held.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.690
And there I broaden the
concept of statesmanship.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.820
So it's not only, we'll
see as we go along,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.370
about presidents
or prime ministers.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.700
Secretaries of state,
foreign ministers.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.690
There's some chapters in there
that are about leaders of NGOs.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.870
There's some chapters in there
that are about social movements.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.170
In which they did things

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.960
that governments were either
unable or unwilling to do.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.190
And again, as we think
about the 21st century,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.670
we're going to see
even more of that.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.220
So those were kind of
the criteria I used.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.340
And you know we have a
discussion, I'd love to hear,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.620
"why don't you have
so-and-so and so-and-so?"

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.250
And that, that's what kind of
makes, but, but I was very clear

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.630
that these were representative
cases.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.300
Not necessarily comprehensive
in closing the book so.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.600
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: It's
funny, there's, you know,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.900
sometimes statesman
are considered

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.200
to be Commissioner of Baseball.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.500
Like George Mitchell.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.460
Might not have peace in
Ireland if he had gone

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.760
that route, I don't know.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.950
But so the one of the ones that,
that, that you, that you count

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.790
as a peacemaker who would
certainly be controversial

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.390
in some corridors would
be Henry Kissinger.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.540
So you know as the
former Kissinger Chair,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.040
perhaps you could speak to that.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
There are no strings tied

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.170
to the Kissinger Chair that
are to be included in the book.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.150
[Laughter] I had a
distinguished fellowship

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.580
at the Woodrow Wilson
Center, too.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.650
In fact, my chapter on Wilson
is highly, highly critical

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.390
of Wilson in ways that I didn't
even realize before I started

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.690
doing the research.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.620
So another criteria is it's
not about the overall record.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.180
It's about particular
areas of statesmanship.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.120
Kissinger is in the book
along with Zhou Enlai

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.250
for the U.S.-China opening.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.290
Not for Vietnam or for other
things that I acknowledge

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.590
that these are areas that.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.490
You know, that I
personally disagreed with.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.630
But I feel like we need to learn
things from leaders, you know,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.230
in, in, rather than everybody's

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.700
in this basket called
"a great leader."

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.930
And this basket called
"a flawed leader."

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.660
We need to try to
learn from a variety.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.300
And so that, that really
looks at the breakthrough

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.420
that was made in
U.S.-China relations.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.130
Sometimes when we look
back at history, we say,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.410
"Well of course they, they
made a breakthrough back then.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.270
You know, they were all, they
had a mutual sort of enemy

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.900
or adversary in the
Soviet Union."

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.430
But if you go back, and if
you had gone to Las Vegas

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.730
or [inaudible] if
you're in London.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.930
In early 1971 and said,
"I'd like to place a bet

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.010
that the United States and,
and Red China," as we used

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.390
to call it in those days.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.230
"Are going to you
know have some sort

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.560
of rapprochement sort
of relationship."

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.600
We all could have been
wealthier than we are.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.480
And so, I, I look into that.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.780
I did have the opportunity

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.720
to interview Kissinger
for that research.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.230
And one really, when you
do this kind of research,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.510
a lot of the documents
are declassified.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.380
So I had the documentary record.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.200
I had work that was
done by other scholars,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.840
a whole variety of things.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.530
But you get the color when
you do the interviews.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.160
And I'll give you
one example of that.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.910
There'd been, when Kissinger
first meets Zhou Enlai

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.950
in July 1971.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.320
And what was called the
secret Operation Marco Polo.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.620
They had this great name for it.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.920
[Laughter]

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.670
Although you would have thought
if somebody heard the name,

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.970
they would have thought
it might have something

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.270
to do with China, right?

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.420
And the first thing it says
is he walks in and he puts

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.540
out his hand to shake
Zhou Enlai's hand.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.840
So I asked Kissinger about that.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.180
Because he couldn't quite tell
from the documentary record.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.480
And he tells this story.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.570
He says, "You know,
in back in 1955.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.060
At the Geneva Convention

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.450
after the French were
defeated in Vietnam.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.300
And Vietnam was being broken up
and the rest of Southeast Asia.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.640
John Foster Dulles, you know,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.710
very hawkish American
Secretary of State.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.350
Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov,
you know, he of the cocktail.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.190
And Zhou Enlai, the Chinese
Foreign Minister were there.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.130
And Dulles showed up and
he shook Molotov's hand,

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.050
but he wouldn't shake
Zhou Enlai's hand.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.350
Again, this was Red China.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.650
And you read some of
the things at the time.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.150
And we thought they
were much worse

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.680
than even the Soviet Union.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.370
And so Kissinger, and
he says, "It wasn't me."

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.370
It was some China experts
he had on his staff,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.390
said that this is a real
gesture of building trust.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.170
And it really meant a lot.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.600
As they got to know each other,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.120
Zhou Enlai at a later meeting
told Kissinger how much

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.420
that meant to him.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.000
You know? And that had really
stayed with him for what?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.540
Sixteen, seventeen years.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.140
And so this kind of thing that
is in the book that you pick

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.710
up the color from
the interviews.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.510
That gives you a sense of
this really being Kissinger

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:39.810
at his best.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.400
You know, great power
of statesmanship

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.370
which was very different
than some other eras.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.670
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So
you know, you can get,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.300
you can see why he was,
why this, you know,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.760
can be considered
transformational.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.440
What, what happened with China.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.400
Why was Kissinger, you know,
in your Wins Above Replacement?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.700
You know, comparison.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.790
Why was he important here?

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.300
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: So
I talk about it, you know,

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.600
why not Nix-- , Nix-- , I mean.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.170
And every story I tell's not
just about a single individual.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.470
Others come in.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.660
It's not hero worship, but
I focus on the individual

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.270
that I think was that
statesmanship Moneyball.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.760
So my little one-liner is
Nixon and Al got the opera.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.590
And Kissinger and Zhou
Enlai did the statesmanship.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.440
The statesmanship
was very intricate.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.170
And they spent seventeen hours
in those first set of meetings.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.360
Basically in one-on-ones
with translators.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.900
And maybe with one aid.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.870
And they had an enormous
amount to work through.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.270
And the essence of it was one

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.920
of the United States' main
motivations is we wanted more

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.650
help from China on Vietnam.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.560
Because the Soviets
weren't giving it.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.660
And China wanted a
lot from us on Taiwan.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.530
That was the transactional
point.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.740
We got less on Vietnam
than we wanted.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.040
But we got some.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.340
They got less on Taiwan
in the moment they wanted.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.640
They got some.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.560
And there's a statement
that, that Zhou Enlai makes

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.580
in which he basically says,
well, I'll interpret this.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.890
He says, "Conventional thinking

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.340
about statesmanship
is you've got to work

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.640
out the transactional.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.160
And sort of the aggregate sum of
this deal and that deal is going

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.870
to lead to change in
the relationship."

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.220
And he actually says you
know, you really need to start

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.520
with the transformational.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.820
There needs to be a sense

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.120
that the relationship
is transforming.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.580
The trust has been building up.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.240
Whatever concessions
were made that will lead

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.470
to other progress
in the relationship.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.310
And that the transformational
actually has to precede

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.090
or at accompany the
transactional.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.420
Which we can talk
about in relation

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.720
to any number of things.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.050
You know, U.S.-Korea
or Iran or whatever.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.740
But and so the way they
worked out the statesmanship

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.040
and I go into some detail.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.470
Not as much as if it was
a straight academic book.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.840
There are any number of points
where it could have broken down.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.980
Nixon and Mao were absolutely
necessary for the politics.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.560
But I felt like that, that there
was more of a story to tell

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.860
about the statesmanship.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.510
And so make them, and
that's the pair chapter.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:52.070
Where if you like, it's a
50/50, you know, giving credit.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.780
Because the both of
them were, were crucial.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.080
Not just Kissinger.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.620
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So how did
Aung San Suu Kyi qualify?

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.530
How did, how did
she make the grade?

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: That's
really an interesting story.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.430
That chapter's titled
"A Cautionary Tale."

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.860
And we, I'd started writing it.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.080
Actually, I working it
out when I was here.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.940
About the role she
played in Burma,

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.060
Myanmar, from 1988 to 2015.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.500
Which again was quite
extraordinary.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.270
An enormous amount of
personal and moral courage.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.770
A leadership that pretty
much only she could provide

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.330
with her heritage being
the daughter of one

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.630
of the founders of the country.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.020
And a whole variety
of other factors.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.920
And then as we were finishing
the book last summer.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.670
There were Rohingya
genocides taking place.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.450
And you're getting articles
like from Nicholas Kristof

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.800
about you know seeing a Nobel
Peace Prize winner you know not

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.770
necessarily doing
this military-wise.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.510
But at minimum, being complicit.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.810
So my editor [inaudible] and I.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.110
I called him.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.410
I said, "I wonder if we
should pull the chapter."

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.410
We actually had a couple other
chapter, couple of chapters

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.300
that we didn't include because
we were looking at length.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.700
And I give him credit.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.110
He said, "You know,
let's think about this.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.490
The whole theme of the
book is draw lessons

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.490
from where leaders had skills
and where they didn't."

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.270
And there actually was
a pattern emerging.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.610
There's a chapter on Lech Walesa

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.700
who was a terrible
President in Poland.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.380
But was an extraordinary leader
of the Polish Revolution.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.460
There's a chapter on Gandhi.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.840
And his role in,
in anti-colonialism

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.140
and Indian independence.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.440
He was assassinated.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.810
But nobody ever thought
he could be a leader

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.110
in government, right?

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.980
And so the pattern that was
emerging was certain skill sets

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.860
helped bring certain
kinds of change.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.090
And they don't necessarily
carry over to,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.500
to consolidating,
institutionalizing.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.850
So you know, did a little
bit of reframing it.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.270
And, and made very clear what we
were saying and what we weren't.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.230
We were concerned
some people might say,

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.530
"How could she possibly
be in the book?"

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.140
And I, I understand that
opinion and respect it.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.080
[Inaudible] Roger Collin,

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.860
New York Times columnist wrote
a column that also came out.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.090
And I've known him for a while
while I was thinking about this.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.250
And he said, "We in the West
have a tendency to either idol,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.430
idealize or demonize people.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.730
And we need to break
out of that."

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.290
And so that's the essence

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.660
of that chapter is
the cautionary tale.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.080
Of both dimensions.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.010
And we felt it was
important to keep it in.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.950
And the same way
of Woodrow Wilson

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.730
in for what his failures
were, not his successes.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.030
Even with what was happening.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.140
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So,
so you touched on this,

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.440
the next question
I have for you.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.740
You touched on this
a minute before.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.340
So I'm going to try
to pin you down.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.730
What's your position
on, you know,

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.580
people have the age-old
question.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.280
Is it that leaders make history
or history makes leaders?

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Yeah, and that's-- .

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.160
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: It's
hard to say, you know.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.230
But, but you brought
it up so I want to-- .

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: I did.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.830
And, and going back
to the academic train.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.430
I, I'd given a couple papers
you know related to this

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.560
where I fleshed this out more.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.220
And there's a lot of
footnotes in there,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.720
some of the literature on this.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.580
The basic formulation I use
is what I call the three C's.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.510
The constraints that any
leader faces in making change.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:55.630
The conducive conditions
that they may have.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.560
But then the domain of choice
that's with the leader.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.430
And so that's that
middle ground.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.660
It acknowledges that there
may be conducive conditions.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.790
Like in the Kissinger Zhou Enlai
case, the fact that you know,

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.100
Sino-Soviet relations
were deeply strained.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.950
And we were looking
for leverage as we went

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.810
into the detente negotiations.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.700
So this was a conducive
condition.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.150
The same time there were
enormous constraints.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.220
The China lobby was hugely
powerful in this country.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.460
And China had just come out
of the cultural revolution

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.820
and Mao wasn't convinced
he wanted this.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.220
But that domain of choice.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.500
And when that domain of
choice really is decisive is

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.880
where I feel the focus on
leaders is, is really helpful.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.600
And, and so everybody
in the book.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.350
And I, I kind of taken on about
the whole you know, you know,

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.050
was this really inevitable,
if we get academic with,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.020
the dependent variable,
you know?

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.230
But that's really, I think
there's a middle ground there.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.530
That goes on.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.470
And again, I think we inside
the Beltway maybe get too much

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.770
into the, you know.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.480
Everything about
you know the leader.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.760
And the academic world so,
so that was the effort.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.640
And you know bringing
some of the work back

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.940
into the academic world.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.560
I'm trying to get
people to start thinking

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.140
about how they can
pay more attention

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.440
to the role the leaders have

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.640
and not just the broad
things that you can model.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.940
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah, and,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.060
and you know presidential
historians the,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.390
maybe the greatest one, it's
about persuasion and choice.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.750
And you don't ex-- obviously,
I mean, persuasion's a part

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.540
of what you're looking at
with these people as well.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.840
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
I do, I do.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.140
The framework I develop is what,

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.560
what I call the who,
why, how, what?

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.900
Who are these people
as individuals?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.400
You know, not getting
super Freudian,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.680
but what were their
qualities as individuals?

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.200
That, that led them.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.000
Yitzhak Rabin is in the
book in a chapter called

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.660
"Soldier's Peacemaker."

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.170
You know, what were
his qualities that led

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.400
from his transformation of
the Minister of Defense?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.880
Who as he said was breaking
knuckles during the First

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.740
Intifada to somebody that
really had a vision for peace?

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.160
With the Palestinians and
took it pretty far before he

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.600
was assassinated.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.660
So who are these individuals?

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.100
And many of them, you don't
really see these leadership

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.400
qualities from the beginning.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.310
At the end I talk about you
know kind of runs against the,

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.610
you know, the resume,
the political consultant.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:03.910
Let me look at the
things on the resume.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.510
They, you know, it's sort
of person and moment.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.810
Why did they do what they did?

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.330
What was the vision
that brought them to try

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.630
to take the risks
of these changes?

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.310
And that they used to get
people to buy into it?

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.610
Change is a scary thing.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.000
And how did they
provide people a sense

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.810
of that the current context
needed to be changed.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.070
Whether it's Mandela or Rabin
or [inaudible] or others.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.580
And then how did
they go about it?

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.880
And that's where
there's this mix

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.890
of ideas and political skills.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.650
And some of the limits, Rabin,
for example [inaudible] both.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.200
I give him an awful
lot of credit.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.000
But I talk about where his
political skills failed him.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.340
Same with Gorbachev.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.640
You know, that he didn't, he,

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.300
his political skills
were really failing him

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.600
in those last couple of years.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.400
And consolidating and
taking care of his base.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.280
But it's, so it's
a mix, I think,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.570
of the two biggest
qualities of personal capital

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.850
that people bring to this.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.160
That gives people a sense
that they are authentic.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.380
In Aung San Suu Kyi's case

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.640
and Mandela's case
and [inaudible] case.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.940
And political skills.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.460
And the what is what did they
achieve and what didn't they?

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.590
And again, what can we,
what can we learn from both?

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.380
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So you
mention there, you have to,

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.080
a leader has to adjust
to change.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.380
Change is inevitable.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.720
But the communications
change is radical these days

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.020
with social media.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.590
Is, is what does that do
to a leader's capacity?

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: So let
me just really quickly pull

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.960
out something I start
the epilogue with,

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.500
if I can find it quickly.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.800
It speaks to that.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.830
So this is a quote that
I'm just going to read.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.970
"For our everyday life
is becoming so saturated

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.930
with the tremendous power
of mass communications.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.940
Our political life is becoming
so expensive, so mechanized,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.860
and so dominated by
professional politicians

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.620
and public relations men.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.920
That the idealist who dreams

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.890
of independent statesmanship
is really awakened

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.510
by the necessities of
election and accomplishment."

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.320
That's from John Kennedy and
Profiles of Courage in 1956.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.660
And, and the book is actually
a little bit [inaudible]

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.960
than Profiles in Courage.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.520
But it's, you know, not
just American Senators.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.050
It's international
leaders, it's not domestic.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.210
And you know so he's writing
that in 1956, you know.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.720
So it wasn't just today.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.580
There's no question
that social media--

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.180
I know from my time you know

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.930
in the foreign policy
world in Washington.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.340
You know, the, you know the, the
need to make decisions quickly.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.730
You know? God only knows

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.050
if the Cuban Missile Crisis
had occurred with social media.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.770
And their ability to keep
control of information

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.070
to a great extent then.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.370
That has complicated it.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.600
But I, I, I try to do a
push, not only in the book

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.900
but in some of my other work.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.410
Against too much presentism.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.130
You know, there are things
unique about our era.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.760
But in some ways,
they're, you know,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.750
other leaders have faced
the same kind of problems.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.020
And here's Kennedy
writing about them in 1956.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.010
Without social media, without
the internet in a different age.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.290
So it has changed
it, but to be honest

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.590
with you, I say in the book.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.340
You know, we've seen the
emergence, for better or worse.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.710
Of very powerful,
strong leaders, you know?

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.410
I mean, saying this as
a purely analytic point,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.710
but there's no question

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.470
that President Donald Trump
has demonstrated the impact an

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.900
individual can have in the
position of the Presidency.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.110
So the notion that
the Presidency can't

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.410
provide leadership.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.440
Putin and others and
maybe I'm giving examples

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.280
that maybe aren't on
the constructive side.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.350
But I think that you
know that it shows

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.420
that leadership is possible.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.490
Even in this environment
and you know there's a lot

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.790
of bottom-up that happens.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.230
The Arab Spring was bottom-up.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.960
There's a lot of
middle-out that happens

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.130
from science, technology.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.290
There's some work here where I
draw on the business literature.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.630
And the challenges
of transformation

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:39.930
in the business community

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.400
or the higher-ed community
are in some ways similar.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.310
But I, I don't think that,
that, I think you have

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.250
to you know take into account
certain characteristics

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.590
of today's political and
communications environment.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.100
But we still, it's not
totally unique compare,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.410
compared to others.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.840
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Of course people by

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.370
and large haven't
had an opportunity

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.670
to read the book yet.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.270
Here and lest anybody
get the impression it's,

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.430
that you're doing a
great-man theory of history.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.500
There, there are chapters in
there about social movements,

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.800
NGOs, that kind of thing.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.010
Do you have, do you want to
say a word, too, about those?

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: Sure,
so two, three of the chapters

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.160
that relate to that, I'll
make mention here briefly.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.610
One is on Northern Ireland,
and two Northern Irish women:

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.350
Betty Williams and
Mairead Corrigan.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.510
Who are everyday folks.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.990
And the story starts in
19-- so from 1969 on,

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.310
what's called The Troubles,
the level of violence

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.920
and killing was rapidly
going up.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:45.910
And in 1972, Mairead
Corrigan's sister was walking

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.200
down the street in
Belfast with three

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.160
of her, four of her children.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.190
And an IRA getaway car, driver
lost control, smashed into them.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.080
Injured her seriously, and
killed a couple of the children.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.930
And it was being chased
by a British police car.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.080
And so Mairead Corrigan
who was a secretary

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.920
in a Guinness brewery
goes to the hospital.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.900
And this actually relates to
your, to your previous question.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.570
And comes out, and the BBC
reporters are all out there.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.780
And she makes a statement
along the lines of--

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.080
I have the exact
quote in the book.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.100
Of you know, in only less than
five percent of the people

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.930
in Northern Ireland really
want these things to happen.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.420
The rest of us are tired of it.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.860
And as we would say
today, it went viral.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.850
It went all over BBC.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.640
It went all over the world.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.010
It was a person and moment.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.420
Betty Williams, you know,

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.910
it was another person
in, in Northern Ireland.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.210
They come together,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.980
they organize the Northern
Ireland Women for Peace.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.620
And they bring in some
political organizers.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.210
And the level of violence
never goes up to that level.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.830
It takes another 20-plus years
and our friend, George Mitchell.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:56.070
And the, the, the you know,
and the negotiator skills

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.430
to bring the Good
Friday Agreement around.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.650
And in fact Betty Williams and,

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.290
and Mairead Corrigan win the
Nobel Peace Prize I think

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.860
in '76 or '77.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.370
And they reached the limit
of their political skills.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.720
They kind of get pushed aside.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.710
There are a couple small
scandals that get pushed aside.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.010
And others take it over.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.530
But, but they were
transformational

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.830
for that moment.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.540
You know, there are
all these marches all

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.840
over Northern Ireland.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.140
It really changed the dynamics.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.560
I was in grad school in
London at the, at that time.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.240
There were bombings in Harrod's
and other sorts of things.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.520
So that's one of the stories
that shows how, you know,

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.900
civil society, if you will.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.520
Can, can, can transform
the moment.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.510
Again, can't make
the peace agreement.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.340
And whatever else is happening
in Northern Ireland today.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.070
It's hardly total peace,
but it has not gone back

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.870
to the violence that it was.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.490
Second story is about
the rise of the,

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.190
of the contemporary
human rights movement.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.850
And I start it with, and
it's again, contemporary.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.290
It goes back many centuries.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.730
In 1961, a British lawyer by
the name of Peter Benenson

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.570
who was sort of an odd duck.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:58.260
Had run for the House of
Commons three times and lost.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.520
But had been involved actually
through his mother and others

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.240
in protecting children
in the '30s and '40s.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.300
Not only from Hitler, but
from Franco and Salazar

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.600
in Spain and Portugal.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.390
And so he begins to think

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.000
about what he calls
prisoners of conscience.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.650
And he writes an op-ed in
The Observer of London.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.950
And again, it goes viral.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.190
I mean, you know, I've written
a lot of op-eds in my life.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.490
And you always hope
they go viral.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.830
You know, you know,
maybe a few Twitter,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.590
Twitterings, but not a lot.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.480
And, and it's picked up by
newspapers all over the world.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.780
And it's this new concept

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.810
for a grassroots human
rights organization.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.910
Within three years, you know,
donations are coming in.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.950
And you know, the
number of chapters

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.010
of Amnesty International
increases exponentially.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:45.200
By 1967, he's actually kicked
out of the organization.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.960
And political skills took
him to a certain point.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.440
And others take it
over, and it grows

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.420
as we know Amnesty
International today.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.360
But, but, but it really seeds
the human rights movement.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.000
Human Rights Watch, you know,
all these groups we know today.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.550
That in many ways you could
argue are more prominent.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.230
But they really kicked
it off, and,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.480
and they do in many respects,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.580
what governments are
unable or unwilling to do.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.300
And so that's one of the
other stories that, again,

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.600
you know, non-obvious.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.400
He wasn't somebody
that you saw coming.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.490
And the third one is about the
Gates Foundation and its work

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.220
in global public health.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.600
And what I call the rise

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.220
of philanthropy statesmanship,
you know?

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.120
The Gates Foundation is
the second-largest budget

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.730
in the world today for
global public health,

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.720
next to World Health
Organization.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.510
And what they have
done in that sector.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.340
And it's not, I mean,
there are criticisms

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.380
of the Gates Foundation
and I address those just

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.790
like with [inaudible] Kissinger.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.350
But I do believe I'm balanced

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.060
that they've made an
enormous difference there.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.530
And that they exemplify
this emergence

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.930
of philanthropy statesmanship.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.860
The role of philanthropies,
you know, Bill Gates

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.360
and Warren Budget, Buffett
now have this giving pledge

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.660
where they're getting.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.660
You know, very wealthy people
around the world to commit

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.550
to not just foundations that
spend at their five percent.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.480
But to give away 50% of their
wealth in their lifetime.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.270
So those are three examples
that complement, you know,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:11.480
the Kissingers, the Rabins,
the Mandelas that I think are,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.210
really are statesmanship
in their own way.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.430
And again, in the 21st
century I think are trendlines

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:17.730
that are going on.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.110
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Let's
talk about the 21st century

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.190
and sort of draw some lessons.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.890
Because you know
your peacemakers,

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.190
among many other things,

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.980
contributed to the
end of the Cold War.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.090
But things aren't great
right now, some would argue,

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.940
between the U.S. and Russia.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.270
And what kind of
lessons do you draw from,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.570
in the book about that?

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.870
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: Yeah,
I've been really pushing back

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.690
against people calling
this "new cold war" stuff.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.210
You know, it's an
easy little one-liner.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:46.110
But if you think about
it, it's not global.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.300
It's not ideological.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.110
And we're not on the
brink of nuclear war.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.130
As I look around the room,
those of us who lived

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.290
through the Cuban Missile Crisis
can remember that all too well.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:01.830
It's classic major power
you know competition.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.810
U.S.-China has an
element of that.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.690
The case I've actually been,
been in the process of trying

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.120
to write something to
make, make the linkage on.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.920
Is looking at the summitry
from those and how it relates

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.430
to the U.S. perspective.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.290
U.S.-North Korea summit.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.430
And the pattern that I trace

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.400
in both the Gorbachev
chapter and Reagan.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.770
I, I give more credit to Reagan

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.760
than probably some
other academics do.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.120
Maybe less than some people that
are on the conservative side.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.420
But he was a crucial partner.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.660
My argument is really
Gorbachev was the absolutely

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.960
indispensable one.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.960
And the Kissinger is, there
were three elements that make

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.260
for successful summitry.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.420
And this could apply to
U.S.-Russian, U.S.-China.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.910
But I think you know North
Korea's on our mind a lot.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.960
And I, you know, I guess I do
alliteration on my three C's.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.690
This is the three P's.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.310
It's the personal, the
policy, and the political.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.660
That, that in the
cases we looked at.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.460
As I talked about
with the handshake,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.800
personal trust was developed.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.630
Reagan and Gorbachev
developed an enormous amount

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.930
of political trust.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.230
Actually to the consternation
of some

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.160
of Reagan's hawkish advisors.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.310
That makes possible
concessions and the belief

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.800
that your partner is
being straight with you

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.060
and will lead to other things.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.170
Policy which is based
on a mutuality.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.600
Just like I said about
Taiwan and Vietnam.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.010
We each got some.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.310
You know, that there's
a mutuality

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.370
and not one side
thinking they're coming

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.670
out with everything.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.430
And then the politics which is
managing with constituencies.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.120
If we look at, and every day we
hear whether the summit's going

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.420
to happen or not.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.430
But let's just assume it does.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.850
You know, I actually think the
politics is my least worry.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.780
You know, the whole Nixon
goes to China, you know.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.190
Conceivably, Trump could
manage the politics of backlash

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.030
about a deal with North Korea.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:47.830
And, and presumably Kim
Jong Un can do it at home.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.570
The policy I worry
about a lot you know.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.110
I don't see a lot
of mutuality there.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.880
It would have to be
you know, policy change

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.180
and that regime change.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.930
North Koreans are interested
and part of their motivation

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.140
for nuclear weapons
is an insurance policy

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.670
against regime change.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.670
They look at what Libya
gave up in the early 2000s.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.540
They look at what Saddam
got taken away by the UN.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.660
And, and I think there really
has to be a lot of mutuality

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.960
and reciprocity in there.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.690
I'm not optimistic about the
way that pre [inaudible].

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:16.380
And then the personal.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.680
And again, I'll be honest.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.020
I'm not sure either of these
leaders has any experience

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.450
or the temperament that's
conducive to the kind

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:28.520
of relationships and
trust-building that we saw

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.820
in the other, other two cases.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.870
So I feel like there's a
little bit of a formula there.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.490
Personal policy and politics
for successful summitry.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:38.660
And I'm in the process of
trying to write something

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.430
for you know the blog world
or the op-ed world now.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.420
Laying these out and
kind of giving a sense

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.240
for what we need
to happen on them.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.190
One I'm confident about.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.970
The other two I'm not.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.050
Which, which I don't say
is a political statement.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.320
I try to say is an analytic
statement, again drawing lessons

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.170
from how you do successful
summitry among countries

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.660
that are, between countries
that have been adversaries.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.500
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: So, and, and
you, you mentioned Yitzhak Rabin

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.250
as one of the peacemakers.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:08.220
We draw lessons for
what's currently going

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.060
on between the Israelis
and the Palestinians.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.360
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Yeah, this is really,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.220
I get asked at a
talk I gave you know.

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:18.040
We've been having, you know,
little bit of a book tour.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.940
Not on the scale of Jim Comey.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.450
But a little bit of a book tour.

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:26.010
And I give talks in New York
and I'm going to Chicago,

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.270
and Atlanta, Denver, a
bunch of other cities.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.210
And, and in fact C-SPAN, if
you're really interested.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.390
And this is [inaudible] C-SPAN
2 is showing one of my talks

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.710
at 5:45 Saturday night
that they filmed.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.570
They do it now at bookstores
when you give talks rather

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.870
than just sitting you down.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.570
And somebody at that talk asked
me or someone in New York,

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:46.730
which chapter you know was
the most personally best.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.030
And it really was
the Rabin chapter.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.190
Because I worked on the
peace talks a bit when I was

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.900
in the Clinton Administration
'93, '94.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.880
Worked on Middle East issues
before that and ever since.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.180
And.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.580
You know, I really felt

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.910
like Rabin was the
right leader, you know.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.090
Can't go into any detail
on the conversation.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.040
I believe that there was a good
chance the [inaudible] would

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.480
have succeeded had he survived.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.220
It was a tragedy that he didn't.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.010
His own intelligence people told
him to wear a bullet-proof vest.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.340
And he could not imagine

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.600
that a countryman
would try to kill him.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.180
Was out of his mindset,
you know?

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.310
And, and I think today.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:30.250
You know, there's no, and no
peace would have been perfect.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.830
But I feel pretty confident
making the argument there would

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.280
be a lot better for Israel
and for the Palestinians,

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.130
the United States
and for the world.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.660
Had the Rabin process
gone forward compared

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.290
to what's happening today.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.380
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And let's
talk a little bit about the UN.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.960
Because you had Dag
Hammarskjold,

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.560
who you say was the most
effective Secretary-General.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.130
Why do you make that claim?

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:58.330
And what lessons of his
leadership do we take for today

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:02.430
for the Secretary-General
and for the UN more broadly?

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
So [inaudible] I titled

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.050
that chapter "Hammarskjold
the Secular Pope."

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:09.630
When he came in, he was seen as
a nameless, faceless bureaucrat.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.010
Who, but and his predecessor,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.470
the first Secretary-General
described the job

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.780
as the most impossible
in the world.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.540
Hammarskjold had a
huge impact on a number

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.980
of issues before he died
in a plane crash that's,

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.090
once again, being investigated.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.240
And let me just tell one of
the stories because it relates

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.540
to today particularly.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.090
In 1956 and the Suez Crisis.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.940
When Britain and France
and Israel invaded Egypt

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.270
because of Gamal Abdel
Nasser's nationalization

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.570
of the Suez Canal.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.250
So you had two permanent members

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:47.190
of the Security Council
invading another country.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.160
And you had the United States
and the Soviet Union looking

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.760
at it from a Cold
War perspective.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.920
And so you had the
coming together

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.030
in this crisis anti-colonialism.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:02.310
The Cold War, the Middle
East, all of these issues.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.710
And Hammarskjold was the
one with some assistance

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.510
from the Canadian Ambassador,
Lester Mike Pearson,

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.560
who managed the crisis.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.700
He went in and did
the diplomacy.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.600
Got the British and the French
and the Israelis to withdraw.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.240
He-- .

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.780
Went in and negotiated
with Nasser.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.640
He and Pearson formed the
first major United Nations

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.030
peace-keeping force.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.460
That went into Suez
that was successful.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.770
And he did everything that,
that, you know, both the,

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.590
the strategy and the
ideas to the practical.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.230
Oh my god, we've got to deploy
these countries' peace-keepers

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.530
right away.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.600
But we don't have helmets.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.900
So they took some
American surplus helmets

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.200
and they painted them blue.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.550
You know, that's
the blue helmets.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.310
So he, he really
resolved the crisis.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.740
And so in the latest
you know couple weeks,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.270
month or so ago,
a little more now.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.570
Crisis in Syria.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.990
It's always been a crisis, but
the U.S.-Russia confrontation.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.470
I was talking to some reporters.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.080
I said, you know, you know,

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.020
we need to empower the
Secretary-General the way

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.820
that Hammarskjold was empowered.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.830
And it may not be the
first-choice strategy

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.270
for either the United
States or Russia.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.370
But it's probably a pretty
good second-choice strategy.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.590
And there is a UN negotiator,
but he's not empowered.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.850
I was actually involved in
this very issue when I was

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.370
in the Obama Administration.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.540
And, and, and, and
said look, you know,

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.920
all the major powers
say oh my god,

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.460
we can't have a powerful
Secretary-General.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.800
You know, you have to
give up some prerogative.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.120
Right? All, China would, Russia
would, the United States.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.520
But no Secretary-General's
ever going

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.440
to tell the major
powers what to do

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.990
on an issue that's
absolutely crucial

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.590
to their vital interests.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.530
But what you gain for
the prerogative you give

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.490
up is you know a
better strategy.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:47.800
For, for, for crises that
affect your own interests.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.960
And so you're making
that gain there.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.260
And so there's an
argument in the book

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.680
about why we need
a Hammarskjold-ian

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.980
Secretary-General.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.080
It's not so much a direct
criticism [inaudible].

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.270
It's really more you know
how the job is defined.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.610
And until then, and the UN
has a lot of other problems.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:02.910
This wouldn't solve them all.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.520
But what organization do we
know, whether it's a government

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.260
or large organization that
can deal with its problems

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.710
if it doesn't have
a CEO, in effect?

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.900
Who people respect
and is powerful?

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.590
And so I really think
that that's crucial.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.700
If we want the UN
to be effective,

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.630
we really need a more
empowered Secretary-General.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.850
And I kind of take on
the political arguments

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.150
and push back against them.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.060
Why, why this is
actually in our interest.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.450
It's not a concession.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:28.200
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay,
well we're going to,

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.860
going to go to questions
in a second.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.200
I just wanted to ask Bruce
something apart from the book.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.500
He, I mentioned that,
that he is the cofounder

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.380
of Bridging the Gap which
is about something that,

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.210
that they call public
scholarship.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.010
And maybe you can say a word
or two about what that means?

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:50.360
And some, something that you
all have accomplished in this,

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.660
with this organization?

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.090
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: Sure,
I mean, as someone who's,

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.460
who's spent most of the
career as, as a professor.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.930
But has also ventured
in the policy world.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.550
I know how much I've
learned from being

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.530
in the policy world that's
made me a better scholar,

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.830
a better writer.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.130
And a better teacher.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.090
And what I think I
brought, you know,

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.580
as being somebody who's
largely been you know in,

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.880
in the academic world.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.580
Not, maybe smarter than people
whose careers are [inaudible]

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.780
but a different kind
of expertise.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.080
And when you learn
to work together.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.510
And it's been a little
frustrating

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.740
to see the academic
world increasingly,

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.040
not just in my discipline.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.520
Kind of going into
its ivory tower.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.800
Not just today, all
the problems we face,

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.470
but this is something we've
worked on for 15 years now.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:34.100
So with some support from
the Carnegie Corporation

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.470
of New York, one of
the major foundations.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.320
We created this program with my
colleague Jim Goldgeier who'll

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.660
be here at the Kluge Center in
September for one of the chairs.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.480
And a couple of other--
Steve Weber from Berkeley

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.010
and some other, you know, to try
to help bridge the two worlds.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:49.000
We run programs for Ph.D.
students in political science,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.830
international relations who
may want to be academics.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.200
So they may want to get
into the think-tank world.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.460
But to develop the skill
sets you know that come with,

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.990
you know, being able to
speak to both worlds.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:00.180
We run a, in a couple of weeks
we're running a training program

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.480
for faculty.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.680
You know, who really want to
be able to connect to, to,

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.980
to the policy world more.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.280
We started a book
series with Oxford Press

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.030
in which we've got our
first books coming out now

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.740
that are books by
academics that.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.910
You know, at, at the
end of turning 20 pages,

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.210
it's not just three paragraphs

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.370
on what the policy
implications are.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.490
And, and so there's really been,

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.540
in fact tomorrow we're
having a meeting in New York

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.170
of all the programs that
the Carnegie funds on this.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.790
But it's really been an
effort of, of mutuality.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.560
And for universities.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.550
Even if we have nothing smart
to contribute to policy.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:36.140
It, in universities as
institutions in society have,

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.440
you know, huge roles to play.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.300
We get a lot of benefits.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.840
I've stayed in universities.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.420
And not gone totally [inaudible]

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.690
because I really love what we
do working with the students.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.630
Having the freedom to write
and, and that sort of thing.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.390
But the worlds need
to be bridged.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.010
I was saying to Jay before
I just finished hearing a

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.860
committee at Duke this semester.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.680
Reviewing our tenure
standards for a variety

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.470
of factors including
public scholarship,

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:00.770
far beyond what we're
talking about.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.930
But for the sciences
and for the humanities.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.750
For the divinity school.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.230
For, for math and stuff.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:11.460
And I may have more wounds on
my back than I did from working

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.010
in the Middle East from that.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.070
[Laughter] But I think
you know we're still

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.370
in the process of doing that.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.060
But I, I think it's an
issue of you know call it,

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.560
you know, interconnection.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.100
Or cross fertilization
or whatever.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.960
So we've built up this
particular program in our area.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.070
And, and you know,
it's sort of one

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.370
of those bottom-up strategies.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:34.340
A lot of people have come
through our programs now who are

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.460
out there building
their careers.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.260
And hopefully universities
will change

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.810
to make the top-down
meet the bottom-up.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.110
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Yeah.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.410
So let's see what folks can--

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.710
signal to me if you
have a question.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.010
Gentleman right up here.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.300
&gt;&gt; Audience Question: Yeah, you
were talking about the, the,

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.600
the effectiveness of the UN.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.380
And I was wondering, do
you think the legitimacy

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.580
of the UN's moral like authority
has been hampered recently?

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.580
Especially like I'll give an
example off the top of my head.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.010
The Human Rights Council
having countries like Russia

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.250
and Venezuela on their board.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.170
Do you think that hampers
the effectiveness of the UN?

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Unquestionably it does.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.270
That's what I said,
there are many issues.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.280
There's just a commission
chaired by Kevin Rudd,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.720
former Australian Prime Minister

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.380
that has a long agenda
for UN reform.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.840
That's one.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.560
There have been scandals
with peace-keepers.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.610
You know, sexual scandals
with peace-keepers.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:31.820
You know, I guess there's
bringing cholera to Haiti.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.300
There are a whole
slew of issues.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.400
My sense of things though is,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.720
is you know we need an effective
UN in the world, right?

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.910
And, and we need it
frankly now more than ever.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:47.110
And so.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:50.030
You know, you know,
the only thing I deal

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.690
with in this book is, is the
role of Secretary-General.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:53.990
Because I think a lot
of things should flow,

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.290
could flow from that.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:57.070
Hammarskjold's notion
of the Secular Pope was

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.400
about the moral authority
that, you know,

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.100
that he exercised
and brought it there.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:05.230
There are things that UN can
do that governments can't do.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.500
I mean, Syria's, to me is a
really good example right now.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.170
And there are a whole
host of others.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.000
And many other reforms are
going to have to happen.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.720
But sometimes we look at the UN.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.220
And we say, "Here's
all its negatives."

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.640
And we look we look at American
foreign policy, and we say,

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.940
"Here's all its positives."

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.230
And so we've got to do a
two-column accounting of both.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.530
And then figure out
how to change it.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:26.200
Because we really do
need an effective UN.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.200
And you know the
notion of blowing it up

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.920
or cutting off our funding.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.650
Or telling countries that
don't vote the way we want them

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.530
to that we're not going to,
we're not going to give them,

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.030
you know, foreign aid.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.620
It's just counterproductive,
right?

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.430
So you know, it's been a
little bit of tough love among,

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.280
directed at kind of
liberal internationalists,

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.580
people that do believe
in the UN.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.950
It's not enough to say what's
wrong with the anti-UN.

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:50.440
You know, if you really
believe in the UN,

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.060
you've got to do a
little tough love on it.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.350
And part of what I'm doing in
this book is along those lines.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.480
&gt;&gt; Audience Question: Yes,
the three C's that you talked

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.510
about being the constraints

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.970
and the conduciveness
and the, the choices.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.720
Reminded me a lot of
Machiavelli's kind

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.020
of [inaudible] type thing.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.250
And I was wondering
what peacemaker

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:17.730
in your book you though faced
the most restrictive constraints

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.420
that they had to deal with?

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.720
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: Oh,
that's a really good question.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.020
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Great question.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
That's a great question.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.250
So I'm going to have
to think on my feet of.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.380
I probably would
say, and it I thought

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.040
about it later tonight,
I'd need your email.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.890
Might change my mind.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.230
I would probably say Gorbachev.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:38.370
You know, because the
system was so ossified.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.910
And, and he was trying
to do this balancing

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:46.030
of domestic change with
international change.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:49.160
And in the end of the day,
it caught up with him.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.490
Right? I don't think it
had to, so US Ambassador,

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.730
Jack Matlock wrote
the very long memoirs.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.030
He actually is a Duke grad.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.710
He's been spending these
latter years at Duke.

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:01.910
And I've talked with
Ambassador Matlock.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:07.500
And in spring and summer of
1991, President George H.W. Bush

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.980
and Ambassador Matlock
were warning Gorbachev

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.160
about what they were picking
up on what was being-- .

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.600
You know, they didn't
specifically say who's going

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.940
to be attempting on
such and such a day.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.670
And the skill set that
Gorbachev had started

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.250
with that made him
so successful.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.550
Kind of abandoned him.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:25.870
Whether it was the
arrogance of power.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.270
That, you know, the
longer you're in power.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.890
And he just kind of dismissed
their, I don't need to worry.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:33.190
It's really okay.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.740
I'm in, I'm here.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.430
So the combination
of the nationalism

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.720
that was unleashed among the
republics, the Baltics first.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.460
The real difficulties
of economic change.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.880
His commitment to Glasnost which
opened up the political process.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.050
And, and not, one of
the expressions I take

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.310
out of the business leadership
literature that relates

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:55.960
to Gorbachev and to Rabin.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.950
Is the need to control
the temperature

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.660
and keep the opposition close.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.800
This is in some of
the leadership books

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.740
that are written in
the business community.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.460
And neither one of
those did that.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.910
And I think Gorbachev's
challenge,

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.450
I think Rabin could've, his
was a little more manageable.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:11.850
But I, so that's one I'd
probably nominate is,

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.740
is the most difficult
to really consolidate.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.620
So that he's disappeared,
you know?

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.920
I guarantee you,
and first or all,

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.290
you know, when he passes away.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:25.480
There will be enormous
accolades all over the world,

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.100
except for inside
his own country.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.880
&gt;&gt; Audience Question: So, so
as a scholar of leadership.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.400
What are the leadership
challenges for the EU right now?

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Sorry, in the end of the book,

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.540
I don't necessarily,
sometimes people ask

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.480
so who do you think are the
21st century peacemakers.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.880
And I intentionally
don't point to people.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.550
Because a lot of these
people, you want to point

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.030
to Rabin earlier in his career.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.300
You want to point to the
Gorbachev who knew Lech Walesa.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.630
I talk about strategies that
you can derive from this

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.080
in each of those five areas.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.610
And there's similarities
and differences for it.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.660
I actually have a chapter I
was working on, on the founding

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.130
of the EU but we have to again,

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.900
make it you know,
marketing a book.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.780
You know, you have to, we
have to keep the length.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.560
And it was going to be
about Monnet, Schuman,

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.810
and Adenauer together in
the founding of the EU

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.180
because you know, whatever
else the EU's done wrong,

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.650
the fact that you know there
has not been a major power war

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.270
in Europe after two world
wars start there is not,

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:21.570
not small potatoes.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:25.000
So I think its challenges
are, are, are policy.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.260
My own analysis is
they, you know,

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:33.040
they didn't keep symmetrical
the political change

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.910
and the policy and
economic change.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.380
So they had this
enormous integration.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.440
They went to a single currency.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.870
There was a rule that you
couldn't run about more

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:45.250
than 2.7, two percent of your
GDP as your fiscal deficit.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.280
Nobody enforced it, you know.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.850
So Greece ran up its deficit.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.660
And Germany then came
in which really had all

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:52.960
of the economic power

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.160
and imposed its own,
you know, views.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.460
Which were coming
out of what it went

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.760
through in the [inaudible]
Republic.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.480
So they're going to have to
find a greater, you know,

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.360
kind of equilibrium
between how far they want

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.660
to take the political change.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.830
And how much they
coordinate policy.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.990
I think they've actually
seen the worst of their days.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.010
I just came back from Britain.

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:16.480
And in June 2016, I had been
invited to London, to the,

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.340
to Chatham House [inaudible]
International Affairs

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.680
to give a talk on how our
domestic policy was affecting

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.980
our foreign policy.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.750
Turned out to be three
days after Brexit.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:28.950
So I walked and said, "Why don't
you guys talk to me, you know?"

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.060
And so Brexit is a huge issue.

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.480
You know, Catalonia
may be an issue.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.890
The right wing is a huge issue.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.480
But I, I think that they're
going to have to manage those.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.070
You know, my own sense is, is
I think the EU can survive it.

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:46.770
But at the same time, in the
nuts and bolts of policy.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:50.710
It's going to have to figure
out, you know, how to, you know,

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.960
you know, if its wants
more political integration.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.250
It's going to have
to you know impose,

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.180
make the governments comply.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.800
Because it's still kind of
like the United Nations.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.100
It's really a bunch

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.240
of governments coming
together under an umbrella.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.540
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We
got, yeah, Andrew?

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.840
&gt;&gt; Audience Question:
Thank you very much

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.150
for a most interesting
discussion.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.940
I would appreciate your
inclusion of social movements

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.970
and non-governmental
organizations.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.680
And I also appreciate
the fact that you point

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.390
out that there are
limitations to what they can do.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:18.980
And eventually state
institutions

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.150
and governmental
authorities have to pick up.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.340
In order to push
the process along.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.390
You think about Martin
Luther King,

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.690
pushing up from the bottom.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.260
And Lyndon Johnson
pushing down from the top

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.990
to achieve Civil
Rights legislation.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:32.380
I'm wondering, based on
your historical research,

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.590
can you offer suggestions

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:36.800
for that process of
passing the baton?

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.450
From social movement to
government institutions?

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.020
How do we ease that along?

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Let me give you an example.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.020
In the, in the section on
your know advancing freedom

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.880
and human rights that
the Amnesty International

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.180
chapter's in.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.480
And some of the others.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.580
At the end I say that
you know, NGOs are going

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:56.290
to be extremely important
in the human rights area.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.890
Because the reality, whether
it's the Human Rights Council

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:00.250
or US foreign policy.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:04.050
There's a lot of inconsistency,
to say the least there.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:08.170
And so what we're seeing
as, as NGOs, you know,

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:09.750
get the kind of technologies.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.650
So for example with what
was happening with Rohingya,

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:13.980
the first reports came
from Human Rights Watch.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.440
Who now had satellite technology
they could photograph.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.060
The same way we were dependent
upon intelligence agencies

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.360
to do.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.660
And intelligence agencies
of governments may

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.450
or may not share
that information.

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:25.360
So I actually think
they will continue

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:30.220
to be extremely important on
flagging human rights issues.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.550
They've developed enormous
expertise over the years.

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:35.360
There's little market
competition among human right--

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.350
human rights NGOs because
they all need funding

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.290
from foundations and others.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:40.590
But you're right.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:43.290
At the end of the day, they
can't change the policy, right?

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:44.910
So I think that you know

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.600
that their role there
in calling attention.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.690
You know, they're not
going to be as important

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.490
in major power geopolitics.

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:54.780
They can, there can
be some things.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.740
Secondly is in this
philanthropy statesmanship.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.050
If you watch the role of the
Gates Foundation has played.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:01.840
You know, one of the
chapters in the book is

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.890
on Gro Harlem Brundtland who,
she was the Prime Minister

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:08.210
of Norway, but she's in there
for her international role.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.900
First in chairing the
World Commission on,

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.760
on Sustainable Development
in the '80s.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.640
That took the term
and the thinking

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.820
of sustainable development,
you know, into the mainstream.

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.840
And, and you could be
green in both ways, right?

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.050
Both for environment
and for money.

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:27.420
And then she took over the WHO
in '90s and really reformed it.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.010
Got it paying more attention
to a variety of issues.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.560
And then unfortunately,
other leaders let it go.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.730
I think that's where
foundations come in.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.040
I think in the case
of the [inaudible]

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.100
and others is the
WHO's spun its wheels,

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.930
the Gates Foundation and others.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.940
You know, Doctors without
Borders and others got

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.240
in there and did things.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.330
So those are two areas:
environment, three.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.270
Environment and the
sustainability of global health

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.060
and environment and
human rights.

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.960
Where I think we need
you know again the notion

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.890
of what governments are
unable and willing to do.

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:00.640
And to push to get
governments to act.

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.680
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: The guy right
here in the back, [inaudible].

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.650
&gt;&gt; Audience Question: Has
the wired world made changes

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:13.410
in the ability to
have transformational

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:14.710
relationships here?

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:18.360
The quote from Kennedy earlier I
think was related to the media.

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:25.850
But it seems to me if time and
personal attention are needed.

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:28.070
There's also more
heat and light coming

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.100
from putting those
leadership relationships

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:34.040
under a microscope
or into blogs.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.060
[Laughter] Almost immediately,
and has that changed the ability

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.950
to make them possible?

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.250
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: I think,

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:42.780
I think it's added
the complication.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.320
Particularly like
the time factor.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.420
It's very hard to
control message.

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.980
Or sometimes, you know, I know
you make a policy decision,

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.280
you've got to get out quickly.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.300
And sometimes, you know, any
of us know from any situation

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.030
that a quick decision
may not be, you know,

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:58.830
well thought through,
well researched.

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.590
I, I, I you know, but
again I go back to.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.350
And I try to build up to
the U.S.-China opening.

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.180
And the Red China, and I go
back to the Soviet Union,

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.200
and I go back on
Rabin and others.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.010
And who would have
thought Mandela, you know,

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:14.460
would get out of prison?

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.870
That the South African political
transformation would be peaceful

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:19.170
and democratic?

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:24.010
That he, after 27 years in
prison, plenty of reason to,

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:26.410
you know, be resentful.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.490
So I, I don't think our
current situation precludes it.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.010
I really don't at all.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:33.230
I think people in
some ways are anxious

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.440
for vision and leadership.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.300
I acknowledge that in some
respect social psychologists

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.500
will say that appealing
to people's fear

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.520
and anxiety psychologically
can always be easier.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.270
Than to their hope
and aspirations.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.180
And that's an inherent
psychological problem.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.210
But I feel like with everything
we're going through now,

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.500
I think, I actually think
that, that, that the,

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.590
that the table's being set.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:54:59.860
You know for that sort of thing.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.410
And, and so I, I hold out.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.400
And I don't think it's naive.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.840
I think it's based on, on that.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.450
You know, based on the
research I did and,

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:10.840
and the intractability of
many of these problems.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.480
You know, I'm not betting my
next non-subprime mortgage

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.520
payment that it's going
to happen you know soon.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.180
But I think there's, there's
an analytic and strategy path

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.520
to make those kinds
of things happen.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.290
In a variety of areas.

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:27.720
Environment's a good
example where, you know,

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.770
you read a magazine from the
real estate industry now.

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:32.690
They sound like my
old boss, Al Gore.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.080
Right? Because they have
all these, you know,

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:38.560
hotels on the shoreline of
Miami Beach and elsewhere.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.640
And you know, and so the
business community has begun

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.940
to see that.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.920
We have a political issue in
our country, you know, that,

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.230
that's been problematic there.

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:49.590
But you begin to see change.

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.290
And then you need leadership
that can tap that change.

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:54.460
That's that person and moment.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.120
You know, with all
due respect to Al Gore

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.350
who I think was extraordinarily
insightful.

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.950
You know, the moment
in 1992 or even 2000

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.640
on the environment
it just wasn't there.

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.190
Right? And so it's where
these two intersect.

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.140
How and when they intersect
isn't always predictable.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.880
But I think on some of these
issues, we're really at a moment

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.200
where people would
respond to leaders

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.790
that they believe have
this authenticity.

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:21.790
And a vision that you know
that is somewhat reassuring.

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:23.200
That, the, that you know,

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.420
that change can lead
to better futures.

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.720
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: We have time

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.580
for one more question,
if we have it?

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:31.970
This gentleman over
here, last question.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:35.550
&gt;&gt; Audience Question: I wanted

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:36.850
to ask a little bit
about Irving Babbitt.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:39.070
I want to see if you
think there's a connection

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:42.580
between a strong moral
character, both in the citizenry

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.850
and of the, these statesman.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:46.670
That correlates to
good statesmanship?

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:47.970
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: What
was the first thing you wanted

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:49.270
to ask about who?

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:50.570
&gt;&gt; Audience Question:
Oh, Irving Babbitt.

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:51.870
I'm just channeling him.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Okay, so I use the term

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.080
in the book personal capital in
which moral capital is a subset.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.380
So it's hard to talk

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.100
about Kissinger [inaudible]
having moral capital, right?

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.020
But they had personal capital.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.050
Mandela had moral capital,

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:07.700
[inaudible] in that
role had moral capital.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.450
Rabin had enormous
moral capital.

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:14.960
And so I sort of define it as
qualities that the person has

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.250
that are not just a function
of the position they occupy.

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:21.870
The two Northern
Irish women had it.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:24.090
You know, Walesa
had it as a worker.

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:25.660
And that's enormously important.

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.600
There's an authenticity
thing that people, you know,

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.520
the average person wants
to know that you know,

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.800
you really are what
you say you are.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.830
Having worked in quite a few
presidential campaigns and gone

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.470
through the consultant as
the perfect resume, you know.

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:42.010
I think that, that
these qualities--

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.540
and so when I talk
about leadership.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.000
You know, I use this broad
sense of personal capital.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.100
And it is really important
for transformational change.

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:50.730
And, and it's not necessarily.

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.820
You know, there are very
few leaders in the book

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.450
who were like, you
know, LeBron James,

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.180
you know coming out immediately.

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.480
Or Mozart as a young person.

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.090
They emerge through
their life experiences.

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.390
And they get to that point.

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:04.420
Mandela's probably the closest
because he you know came

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.360
out of this particular,
you know, upbringing.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.550
But the others are you know
who would have thunk it

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:12.670
at an earlier point in
their, in their lives, okay?

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:13.970
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Bruce,
thank you for coming back

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:17.690
to the Library to share your
thoughts in public scholarship

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:19.850
and the actual scholarship
you've done.

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:24.800
And we have a reception that
we would like to invite you to,

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.700
to enjoy as well as Bruce is
signing copies of his books.

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.000
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson:
Happy to sign books.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.380
Good, thanks very much.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:32.680
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Thank you.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Bruce Jentleson: Thanks!

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:38.040
[ Applause ]

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.890
