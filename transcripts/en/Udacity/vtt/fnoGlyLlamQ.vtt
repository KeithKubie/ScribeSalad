00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.080
One more little specific
tracking method and

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.400
this comes from the work of tracking
people, particularly their limbs and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
stuff by learning their appearance and
the idea is they build a person model.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.830
And the person model is made up
of a couple different things.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.120
It's made up of an appearance,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.950
we'll talk about what that is
in a minute, plus structure.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.740
plus dynamics, allright?

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.170
Now the structure and dynamics are
generic, that is, they are the lengths

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.780
of my body, the dynamics are how
they can move so, you know,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.030
what are the speeds people tend to move
and some of the process noise, but

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.270
the appearance is person specific,
okay, so the idea is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.030
I'm going to learn the appearance,
and then I'm going to do the tracking.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.900
And that's represented in
this picture here, allright?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.380
So the idea is given some input
examples, we build the model,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.660
and the model is, like I said,
it's generic structure, but

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.890
we might learn the colors and, you know,
the textures of these different parts.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.400
And then, using that appearance and

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.510
the structure, we can do the detection
running, on the, on the new frames.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.300
Here's the reference,
Ramanan, Forsyth and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.870
Zisserman, and this is showing you
them tracking those people parts.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.320
And the idea is they use a appearance.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.330
That's all I want to talk
about that specific method.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.390
A bit later actually, towards the end of
this course we're going to describe some

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.300
recognition methods that use a lower
dimensional space for doing recognition.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.340
We've mentioned piece,
principal component analysis, et cetera.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.850
Once we do that, we can talk about
a couple more one or two more tracking

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.100
examples that use a PCA-base description
as their appearance model but

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.960
until we have that it,
it would be premature to talk about it.
