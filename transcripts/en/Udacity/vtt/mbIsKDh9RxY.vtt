00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.300
Okay. Let's look at the solution for our

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.630
computer architecture quiz. The question was, what computer

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.370
architecture is about. Is it about building faster

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.560
transistors? It is not. Computer architecture is about, maybe

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.110
finding how to use these faster transistors to

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.050
build better computers in some way. Is it about

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.400
how to build faster computers? It is. One

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490
of the possibilities for how computers can be better

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.930
if they're faster, so if we need a

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.210
faster computer, computer architecture is definitely about how to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.840
do that. How to build larger larger buildings. This

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.924
is not correct. How to design energy efficient computers,

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:40.900
again energy-efficiency, that is what we're after is

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.566
a way of improving computers, so we definitely are

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.550
interested in that in computer architecture. How to build

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.620
buildings that fit more computers. This again is about

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.890
buildings, not about building computers, so this is not true. And how

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.350
to build computers that fit better into buildings, is about building computers

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.030
that are more suited for some purpose, in this case, fitting more

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.530
of them into buildings, so computer architects might be worried about this.
