Speaker 1:          00:01          The word hit us like you're hit with the, with them.

Speaker 2:          00:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:12          and we're like, that cannot be art. That cannot be our son.

Speaker 1:          00:18          I'm Janet and Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab in our story today begins with a boy and that boy a is going to vanish. Not In the thin air, but to a place that we know very, very little about. And if you're the parent of that boy, what do you do if your child is falling away from everything you know, how do you find him? How do you get him back? So part of this tale we got from Ron SAS kinds, new, wonderful book, life animated. And some of you may have heard it, some not. Let's start. Where, uh, were Ron started, uh, for him it began around 1993 and uh, and it was an exciting time.

Speaker 3:          00:52          Well, we're going into Owens around for, what is his last night in the crib? Nike's. I still can't, you still can't watch it. Can you tell us about your crib own? Do you like your crib? Yeah. Do you know where you're sleeping tomorrow? What kind of better you and Walter going to sleep. Then

Speaker 1:          01:16          in 1993, this last guy and family decided to make a big move run and his wife, Cornelia, Cornelia Suskind and their two sons, Walt and Owen. Walter is about five and Owen is about two and a half. They decide to relocate from Boston to Washington DC. You know, I had the senior National Affairs job at the Journal.

Speaker 3:          01:36          Can I say Navy night? Kind of a dream job. I love you. Lots of excitement. Have a nice last night near Cribby.

Speaker 1:          01:46          So they make the move and as soon as they arrive in Washington, we start sort of noticing something's amiss. Their youngest son, Owen, who to that point had been a totally normal chatty, almost three year olds hitting all of his markers. Suddenly

Speaker 4:          02:00          it goes sideways. Maybe the very first thing that happened was he stopped sleeping. He stopped sleeping, he stopped eating. He was very fussy initially. They figured, well, it's gotta be the move. Um, and then we start losing eye contact. Then he starts losing motor skills. He can hold his cup slipping out of his hand. His gait became very odd. Um, and he was sort of looked like a drunken sailor walking around the house and then he stopped speaking bit by bit by bit.

Speaker 1:          02:34          This is all compressed into a few months. A few months. Really. Yeah. What could have occurred, could he have banged his head than just did something toxic? You know, first you hit the regular pediatrician and he's gone. No, they sent us to a center. There was a woman there who sits them down and uh, she says the word autism. What did the word mean to you at that moment? It meant rain, man, Dustin. I'm a good driver. Until we saw and were like, that cannot be our, that cannot be our son.

Speaker 5:          03:07          You know, it was just terrifying. Now in reporting this story, we ended up going off in a variety of different directions, but we did visit one place where we got a glimpse, just the here and again, what parents like Ron and Cornelia must have felt back then. We visited a school here in Manhattan called the Rebecca School. It's a really unique school for children with autism, other developmental delays. There's little kids in their h four all the way up to I think even 21 every kid that you meet in the school is different. Autism is a many, many flavored things, but the overwhelming sense you get walking the halls there is that each of these kids is kind of

Speaker 1:          03:52          locked away a little bit. Just they don't know how to be with.

Speaker 2:          03:58          Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:58          Like Kelsey paget and I, we got there during lunch and one of the rooms, I don't know, maybe you should describe this. Yeah, there was this, we went to this one classroom where there was this, this one boy who really stood out. He was about six years old and he had this, this big mob of uh, black hair and he was just standing there at the table holding

Speaker 2:          04:18          an apple apple, you want to eat that and just sobbing when you eat your apple, you don't want to eat the apple woo woo.

Speaker 4:          04:34          And the director of the school, Tina McCort, she was there and she just stayed with the boy and really like tried to be there with him, but there was nothing she could do.

Speaker 2:          04:48          [inaudible] goes apple. We don't want to say with heron,

Speaker 4:          04:55          it was hard to walk.

Speaker 2:          04:59          Okay.

Speaker 4:          05:00          Because you don't know how to help.

Speaker 2:          05:03          Oh,

Speaker 4:          05:08          so that's the challenge, right? There's a kid who actually can't tell you what's upsetting to them, right? That's guilt hippy. The school's clinical director could be that he physically, he actually doesn't know where he is in space. Maybe if that's, if we were being

Speaker 6:          05:23          drone out of an airplane, right? You're just tumbling. You don't know where your body is a, it's a thunderstorm. So you only see things in flashes. Right? So now the world is totally frightening. It's totally overwhelming.

Speaker 1:          05:39          I mean, I do remember the drive home from that, from that terrible day. I don't, I blocked that out. Well, just, I mean I just remember, you know, you and I driving home in silence with Owen in the back and I just felt like, you know, there was no, there's no,

Speaker 7:          05:58          like they had no idea if the Owen they knew was in there or if he was just kind of lost to them, like gone. Now keep in mind this was 1994, uh, we knew even less about autism than we know now. We still have no idea what causes autism. But then the prevailing wisdom seemed to be that kids with autism, they couldn't feel emotion. They had no capacity to empathize with other people. This was way before the neurodiversity movement, like actually right around the moment when autism was becoming a spectrum for the first time.

Speaker 1:          06:29          That's just happening in 1994 just starting, barely starting. Yeah. At that point Owen was Belfour, was he active or was he always very, he was hyperactive. A lot of self stimulatory behavior, you know, hand flapping, running around and uh, Cornelia and Ron say that when they would call him, it was as if he didn't even hear them. We're hoping he's hearing, you know, but he's not really responding when you needed him to come to the table, we basically have to go and lead him by the hand and, or pick them up and bring them over. Huh. And he was down to one word, which was juice. So the only thing he was doing was drinking juice for about a year. And also, you know, there was the Disney movies, so he would sit for, he would sit for, and for television entertainment. He wouldn't sit for the whole movie for sure, but he would, that would be the one thing that he would sit for quietly for periods I'd been through because he didn't sleep.

Speaker 1:          07:27          So at night I was usually up with him all night, thrashing around and it's Owen Watch one Disney movie after another after another, not sleeping at all. That word juice. It seemed to expand just a little bit. He began to repeat the word juice. Servos, juice Servos, juicer vose wait, so is he saying juicer foes to service two through five but you don't know what first what that is? No, no, we think it's juice. Cornelia's like I said, does he seem to want more juice? And she's like, no, I gave him more juicy, didn't seem to want it. And Ron says he would say that word over and over for weeks and they had no idea what it meant until he was about a year or in a month after the symptoms have started. One night, all four of them are together in the living room and we're watching the little mermaid, I'm dot.

Speaker 1:          08:11          Not My bed does say. And at a certain point, oh, who's got the remote? He starts rewinding the movie back a little bit. The lady was with to rewatch the scene. That's typical. So I will knows that her work, the remote while kind of showed him how to do it and he took to that and he's rewinding the part where Ariel, hi, become human or protagonist, I'll never be with my father's sisters again. Wants to become human to get her man Eric. That's right. And the see which Ursula [inaudible] says it will, it will cost you tough choices and the prices are voice, your voice, my voice. You've got it. Sweet cakes. And then all of a sudden Ariel and first solar

Speaker 2:          08:59          and this park, the three land again, again, no day.

Speaker 8:          09:10          It's like, oh and stop. Rewinding. Just play the movie.

Speaker 2:          09:12          I won't leave after the third rewind.

Speaker 8:          09:19          Critical. He says, oh,

Speaker 2:          09:22          [inaudible],

Speaker 8:          09:23          well it's not juice does not choose. It's just, ah. I said, what? Just your voice? At which point I'm like, I grabbed the shoulders and I'm like, just your voice. Just your voice. And he can stay. It's called juicer, vose juicer, juicer. Rose and Walters are jumping in the bed crying and laughing and [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:44          jumping to the feeling you chose that phrase for a reason. Oh, that's what we, that's of course immediately what we thought. He's trying to tell us something that like, he has things to say but he just can't say it's his voice. In other words, he's in there, he's in there because he's trying to talk to us.

Speaker 8:          10:01          So we run to the doctor, very trusted guy and he's like, ah, you know, sit down, let's talk. And he says something called Echolalia. It's echoing sounds that their auditory processing, their ability to process sound speech by inquiry goes haywire. And so they just repeat the sound and we've seen so he doesn't know what it means. And he's like, probably not echolalia. It's what it sounds like. Echo what it sounds like. Echo. I said like a parrot. They're like, yeah, yeah, a parrot. So we go from Helen Keller to the pet store parrot.

Speaker 2:          10:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:37          Life goes on and years go by

Speaker 8:          10:41          where he's murmuring a lot of jibberish. We might be able to decipher from some movie, maybe by six he's got, you know, three words, sentences. I want juice, just, you know, one and a half year old speech corns there full time. 24 seven Ron's working around the clock in a kind of frenzy. It pay for all of the therapists and we're fighting it out.

Speaker 1:          11:04          Basically they see tiny, tiny bits of progress, but no more breakthroughs

Speaker 8:          11:11          until the ones about six and a half and Walt is nine and Walter gets a little emotional in his ninth birthday.

Speaker 9:          11:20          I'm not sure, maybe the anxiety of the moment of the attention of it.

Speaker 1:          11:24          This is Walt Suskind. And how old are you now? Well, I'm 25 your voice is so much deeper than I imagined it would be. People usually have,

Speaker 9:          11:31          they're like 10 minutes. If it's their first time meeting me asks if I'm faking my voice, I'd have to assure them this is not in effect. This is how I sound. Any case, Walt has his ninth birthday and his friends come over

Speaker 1:          11:45          and then after the party he's out in the hammock in the yard and he's kind of crying a little bit and as

Speaker 8:          11:53          it was, right, they were just kind of strange days for me, like sensory overload in a way and walks in after Walter is emotional and we're in the kitchen and he seems to kind of look back and forth between the two of us in like there's something he wants to say to this point, Owen had only said three word sentences, but in this moment, according to Ron, he looks at us and says,

Speaker 10:         12:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          12:19          Walter doesn't want to grow up like Mowgli or a Peter Pan said full sentences, full thing, whole thing.

Speaker 8:          12:29          Wow. I mean literally it was like a thunderbolt, a lightning bolt went through the kitchen and Owen goes, runs off in some, you know, reverie, whatever. And we look at each other and like the luck that was that, you know, this is his first complex sense or thought that's been expressed. And it's a subtle one actually. Cause he's taking three different characters to from a movie, one from real life. And he's putting them together. Saran is like, ah, I got to follow this. So he goes up to Owen's room and I see Owen on the bed looking at a Disney book and I see on the carpet are some of his puppets and he, and one of them is Jago from a, from Aladdin, the plush toy, you know, which is the $98 one that goes up to your elbow. And I grabbed it and I put it on, on my arm right up to the elbow and I crawl along in the rug and I throw the bedspread kind of over my head and just edge up to the edge of the bed.

Speaker 8:          13:28          And I pushed the puppet up through the crease in the bedspread. And so now they're face to face, Owen and Jago and I'm looking up through the crease, sort of up my arm. And I talked to him as Jago. Now this is an easy voice. It's Gilbert Gottfried's voice. I mean, anyone can do this. I say salt, I'll wait, I'll wait. I'll wait. How, how does it feel to be you? And he turns to the puppet, like he's a bumping into an old friend and he says, oh, not good. Uh, I'm lonely. And it was his voice. Wow. And so I say, so when did, when did you and I become such good friends? And he says, when I watched the Latin and you made me laugh, and we go back and forth like this for four or five more exchanges. And then I hear Owen clear his throat, like, are like that. And then all of a sudden I hear him say back, I love the way all foul little mind works. He said, what? I love the way all FAO little mind works. That's Jafar the villain. Ya'll goes the villainous sidekick to Jafar, the villain of the Latin. That's Jeff. That's the next line from Jafar youth lead into a square movie. You're asking for me to respond as Jago. Did you know the next time I didn't know the next line at that point I just jumped out from under the bedspreads. What's going on?

Speaker 2:          15:02          Whoa.

Speaker 11:         15:04          I was glad to know. They felt like, okay, he, he is, he is in there. I mean despite everything that they had been told about autism, Owen was in there and somehow these Disney characters are in there

Speaker 8:          15:17          with him. It doesn't take us long that, you know, we start what we called the basement sessions where we say to, let's see how far this can go. Couple of times a week we go down in the basement and start playing at scenes and we do it the first time we do it with the jungle book, which is a movie he was into at that point. And then I did 101 Dalmatians down on the piece, Peter Pan Towards the stone. So will you, we kind of ran the gamut. I mean pretty much we'd watch any and every

Speaker 12:         15:46          Disney movie there was what? Describe to these guys. What was the like when mom and I started doing voices and Walter felt amazed. Felt amazed. Who? Who was amazed? You were amazed or they was amazed. This is Owen SAS Guide. He's 23 now. Why were you amazed? I was so surprised by my family. I could hear them respond better.

Speaker 11:         16:16          You're saying that when, when everybody was acting out the Disney movies, suddenly you could hear them better, right? So when people wouldn't talk to you, not in the Disney movies, do you, what do you remember about how they sounded

Speaker 12:         16:34          a little weird? Yeah. Jibberish and rubbish. Huh? Do you remember how you felt? A little worried. You told mom once that you were scared. I was scared.

Speaker 2:          16:51          Okay.

Speaker 12:         16:52          Why did it feel good to watch them over and over again? That you kept wanting to watch them over and over again? How did that feel to you? It felt comforting. Comforting, felt comforting. Why? Because it would help me with reducing my autism.

Speaker 1:          17:14          How does a movie help a boy in Owen's condition? Stay tuned and we'll, we'll attempt some explanations.

Speaker 11:         18:24          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today a story about a kid named Owen and a condition that no one can quite pin down. Now we just heard that Owen, when he watches Disney movies, he feels comforted in that somehow the movie seems to dial down his autism. We're like, why would that be crazy next? How could a Disney movie or any movie really make that much difference?

Speaker 5:          18:51          Um, can you hear me okay? I can really pretty well. I'm just gonna we ended up taking the question to this guy, Simon Baron. Karin, he's a leading researcher in autism and yes, he is the cousin of

Speaker 15:         19:00          this guy is my wife

Speaker 5:          19:03          and I'm the director of the autism research center at Cambridge Uni. Bursty and Simon told us a couple of different things. First of all, he says that in the last few decades, our whole notion of what is happening in the mind of a child with autism has totally changed. We've sort of tossed out the rain man idea. The idea that um, people with autism lack some in our life. I think that's completely false.

Speaker 11:         19:30          It's not necessarily that they can't feel emotion or empathy. It says not at all. It's often a decoding problem. Like they have trouble decoding all of the information that's coming in. I mean some studies have found that a lot of kids with autism literally have too many synapses in their brain. So it might be the world is just coming in too loud.

Speaker 5:          19:48          I think often people with autism feel very lost and confused as to a little predictability in the social world. You know, people come and go, they that no two days are the same. People say things unexpectedly, they do things unexpectedly. Then people with autism who seem to need a lot of predictability.

Speaker 11:         20:14          We spoke to temple granted, uh, the well known author and autism advocate and here's how she put it.

Speaker 15:         20:19          That was a little kid. I wanted to feel the nice feeling of being held, but there was just too much overwhelming stimulation. Your loud sounds hurt. My years, like the volume control on touch and hearing was way, way, way turned on. And one of the reasons why I withdrew into things like dribbling sand to my hands is I could shut and shut out the hurtful sound

Speaker 11:         20:42          as a temple grant and explained it to us. A kid with autism gravitating to something like bus or knowing every single effect about every dinosaur that ever lived. That is just a way to slow things down and make the world predictable so that it happens the same way every time. And as Simon Baron Cohen puts it, in Owen's case, he had these Disney movies that you could play Oh,

Speaker 5:          21:03          over and over and over and over. And then the fact that it's, you know, it's sad, it's not just repetition, but it's repetition about human action. Jasmine, where are you out in the Menagerie? Hurry. Yeah. That creates a kind of structure to be able to look at human behavior. You know, in the real world, there's no opportunity to rewind the movie. Whereas in the world of movies, you can watch the same Disney cartoon a hundred times or a thousand times and you can almost go frame by frame like a literary critic or a film critic. You could really analyze the action to understand, okay, that's what happened. And that's, that's what caused him to do what he did.

Speaker 4:          21:49          And to that, the element of Music

Speaker 11:         21:54          [inaudible] we spoke with a professor, Geraldine Dawson, a neuroscience professor at Duke who guessed that maybe it's not just the repetition that made the difference, but the repetition with music.

Speaker 4:          22:04          One of the things that we've learned from neuroscience is that music activates emotional centers in our brain. And in fact, it's pretty reliable that certain kinds of music make us feel,

Speaker 11:         22:19          no frightened, make us feel happy, make us feel worried and so forth. Now she says, when scientists have done brain scans of kids with autism, they found

Speaker 4:          22:32          that during kind of normal interactions, people with autism don't necessarily activate those emotional centers of the brain areas like the Amygdala. But during the experience of music

Speaker 16:         22:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          22:47          um, the, those areas of the brain did become activated in a way that was very much like a typical person.

Speaker 11:         22:55          So it might be that while Owen was sort of forensically examining these moments of Disney movies, it was the Disney music that was binding those moments to feelings. So we could know like, oh, when a person looks like that, that's when they're happening and the person looks like that. That's when they're sad. However it works. Simon Baron Cohen thinks it's at least plausible.

Speaker 5:          23:16          Okay. Is He using the movie as a scaffold to make sense of the much greater complexity of natural life

Speaker 11:         23:25          and that's what got to run sky.

Speaker 17:         23:29          Wow. This is a whole new planet here and maybe this Disney ish therapy that they use with Owen might be a whole new approach to treating kids with autism instead of the one size fits all model of the sit in the class and here are the things you're supposed to know to be a working member of. Instead it's like go with their passion, follow them in there. It's, it's a pathway, the brain finding a way to get to what people need, which is interaction and emotional wholeness.

Speaker 12:         24:02          You're, I want you to sing the song for them. [inaudible] dessert. Visco Grina it's about the this lake. You're [inaudible] up there, but that is a big mistake. Just do a car too.

Speaker 18:         24:15          Over the years, sometimes down in the basement with the family or sometimes even in doctor's offices, Owen started to improvise. He'd go off script and use the characters. He knew so well to explain how he was feeling.

Speaker 12:         24:27          I'll do the C. Dot. But the Dow quid is with the take for me. Yeah,

Speaker 18:         24:35          and as you were thinking about all this and asking ourselves, you know newt, well, right, if this works with Disney movies, which are very emotional and clear, what do you, how do you do this with paper clips or bus schedules? And as the questions kept coming, we ran into inevitably a counter reaction to run story and this, we didn't expect the story. It's great. It's a wonderful story. But the fact is most, I mean onto the danger with a, with a book, with any book including life animated, is that it's going to give the impression to a lot of people that this is the answer. You know? It's kind of what that psychologist and journalist David Royko and he warned us that like with autism we still don't really know much and we don't have yet. And a body of established science and all the anecdotes you're hearing, they're just anecdotes. If you've known one person with autism, you've known one person with autism that he says it's really all you can say and to take one person's experience and generalize on it, it's a mistake. Okay. A case in point, his son Ben Ben is turning 21 years old today. Oh my God. Happy Birthday to him. Thanks. And uh, Yo, Ben is never going to be able to live independently. He's never going to have what anyone considered would consider a full and normal life.

Speaker 11:         25:53          Well, Ben has severe autism and is now living in an assisted living facility. He was diagnosed around the same age as Owen, same basic symptoms, lack of eye contact, sudden loss of speech

Speaker 18:         26:04          with spinning wheels, with ceiling fans, the whole, the whole package.

Speaker 11:         26:09          Dave says he and his wife tried every therapy they could afford and a whole lot they couldn't, but Ben never had any of those big breakthroughs. Instead, even as a teenager,

Speaker 18:         26:18          he would hit and he would scratch and he would bite and he would punch and he would kick. Honestly, I was always afraid when Karen and I would end up having to go to the emergency room for some reason that, you know, if they saw her arms that they would arrest me because I would think I was some horribly abusive person because their arms were nothing, but they were covered with scabs and scars and scars on scars. And on top of that, uh, you know, there'd be the crap, like, like, like know his pants. Yeah. I mean, he, he's, he was not, well, you know, I hate to say it, but here we are in his 21st birthday and he's still not 100% reliable when it comes to the toileting.

Speaker 1:          26:57          And honestly, the reason we ended up calling Dave is because he wrote a review of Ron's book where he said, basically, it's a great book, but it's just one more story of a triumphant happy ending. And that is not the norm

Speaker 18:         27:08          for many, many people who experience autism. You don't have happy endings. I mean, that's, that's a sad fact for many of these families and we're not expecting in our life a a happy ending for Ben.

Speaker 19:         27:22          Oh,

Speaker 1:          27:23          people seem to believe that, that it's dangerous for parents to have too much hope because what if they really think it's possible for their child to progress a huge amount or recover and then their child doesn't. We have the other concern. That's Ron Kaufman of the autism treatment center of America. We find that we're not afraid of so-called false hope. We're more concerned about false pessimism.

Speaker 3:          27:52          And here's why. He says that in 1981 Ron's dad, Barry and don over with, he sits down, yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:58          on a local TV show was a very young Oprah Winfrey and he describes his experience. Okay. We had a child who was diagnosed as incurably ill or hopelessly ill, something called autism. He tells how at a really young age or year and a half old, his son began to regress and began to flap hands, lose eye contact, rock back and forth. And then one day he, his wife decided, you know what, we're going to just sit down on the bathroom floor right next to him and we're going to rock back and forth just like him. And he explains that they did this over and over and over, hour after hour until one day his son turned his head and he actually looked at us. It took 900 hours before

Speaker 20:         28:39          he ever gave us eye contact on his own. When he looked at us, we cheered whose cried this? That was really big for us, so somebody else might look at us and say, you're crazy, but we're not. We just got this little boy, took us 900 friggin hours, but he just looked at us for three seconds. My God,

Speaker 3:          29:08          and he went from that to a little boy now who functions on a near genius level who talks is communicative, is loving, and is embracing awesome

Speaker 1:          29:16          and that little boy is run for me. It just felt like my mother was loving me and enjoying me and playing with me. Nowadays in interviews, run seems to say that maybe his parents cured him a lot too, so I actually have never used the word cure. I don't use that in my lectures. Youtube videos, no one's ever actually heard me say that. What I do say is full recovery, which is essentially the same thing, the reason, whatever you call it. Armed

Speaker 15:         29:42          with his heroic story, Ron and his dad, Barry now run an autism treatment program that they call sunrise, s o n, right?

Speaker 20:         29:49          People come here from all around the world. Let's say my child is severely autistic and I will sim smile and I'll put out my hand and I'll shake their hand and I'll say, I am so excited for you. Wow, you are so blessed and you know what they'll start to do? They'll cry and I'll say, why are you crying? No one ever said that to me.

Speaker 11:         30:11          You really say that to parents with a severely like severely autistic kids. Severely. I say it

Speaker 15:         30:17          all over the world.

Speaker 18:         30:20          You know, last year there was a woman named Kelly Stapleton who was a fairly prominent autism blogger and I got to know Kelly a bit.

Speaker 11:         30:32          She has a daughter with autism and one day when her daughter was 14

Speaker 18:         30:35          she locked herself in a van with a couple of charcoal burners and tried to commit suicide with her autistic daughter. You see that in the world of autism more than I, I can't think of any other place you see it.

Speaker 11:         30:48          Dave believes that one of the reasons you see so many suicides in this community, and by the way there a huge debate about this on the web, but he believes that one of the reasons you see it so much is that all of these success stories seem to say to parents like him did as hard as it can be in it can be really, really hard. You're not trying hard enough.

Speaker 18:         31:08          It's depressing. You know, a, a new bumper sticker, you know, that's shown up that uh, autism is awesome and awesome spell like a u s l m e like kind of like similar to autism. Um, no, you autism, it destroys lives is what it does in our definition of it.

Speaker 11:         31:27          And that's one of the things that makes it very, very confusing for people outside the community to describe what's going on. Because you now have this situation where obviously all autism is a spectrum and so you have all of these different kids described by the same word

Speaker 15:         31:44          making things even more confusing. Do you take a child one there, two or three, that's temple grand and again you're going to have two kids that look real severe and I looked real severe while I was when I was three real, real severe. And then you work on these kids, lots of one-on-one therapy and one kid you kind of pull them out of it and the other one you're not able to pull them out of it and they've all looked the same at h street.

Speaker 11:         32:08          So if a lot of these kids start out with the same set of symptoms but they end up in vastly different places, no one knows why. Then as a parent you really have no idea what is going to happen or how much you can dare to hope notions of what could be up the road or what should be. Now if they pop into my head, which is rare, I dismiss them. I have absolutely no idea because have been down

Speaker 1:          32:40          so many roads that were disappointing.

Speaker 2:          32:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 21:         32:48          and uh, that's next.

Speaker 2:          32:52          [inaudible]

Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation and by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org. Thanks guys.

Speaker 1:          33:21          I'm jet album Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. And to continue with the story after Owen's Disney basement sessions had really taken off in the Disney therapy as it were, seemed to be working and Owen was getting better and better and better things took a turn and, and not for the good. Remind me how old he is at this point. Uh, 14 1414. Yeah. Ninth. Ninth. Great. Um, but it was 10th grade. Oh, right. 10th grade. I was it. Yeah, that's right. That's right. And what happened? We didn't know what was happening. You know, we just saw over the months at Owen was really out of sorts. You got quiet, kind of withdrawn, basically stopped doing Disney over this period. He's losing a lot of weight. He's not sleeping. The three of us were scratching our heads saying what is going on with Owen? He is really moving into a bad place. I mean I was actually worried that he was becoming schizophrenia.

Speaker 9:          34:17          Boy. Yeah, I still think about that whole scenario all the time cause we knew something was wrong with Owen and we couldn't get it out of him. This is Owen's older brother Walt again. And he says when he picked up Owen from school, he was just a shell of himself. You'd talk to him. So I'd pick him up and you've talked himself in the car and it'd be no note or you know, it's not true or something under his breath.

Speaker 1:          34:36          And then at one point I overhear him in a kind of conversation with Phil, the sidekick of Hercules in that movie, Hercules. Danny Devito does the voice. And Phil is, you know, like saying kid, you can take them, you know, you're kind of stand up for yourself. That kind of thing that Owen was saying and I didn't, I didn't know where to fit it in. Ron says, it seemed like Owen was trying to psych himself up for something. So he sat down with him on the couch and he grilled them for an hour until eventually Owen told him about his music class at school. There are two kids in this class who are Ed kids, emotionally disturbed kids. So they're not, they're not on the autistic spectrum. And socially, they're very, um, on target and they, um, basically torment and terrorize him for six months of that school year, unbeknownst to us and unbeknownst to the school. Um, what did they do? They sat on either

Speaker 12:         35:38          side of him and basically said, you know, we're going to kill you. We're going to kill your parents. And those two bullies lied and bullied me badly. I mean, right then you were in a very bad spot and you couldn't tell me your mom or anyone, right? Because what happened? The bully said, what? Burn your house down if what if you tell. Right. And Owen was so literal, as are so many autistic kids, he believed that they literally meant they were going to come in, burn his house down.

Speaker 8:          36:11          Then there's an extraordinary moment in the middle of this where Walter picks him up and Owens starts to think of, go through a calculus. The bully said, if you tell your parents about what we said, we'll burn your house down. But they said nothing about your brother.

Speaker 12:         36:29          Ah,

Speaker 8:          36:30          and so he's, he sees like an opening.

Speaker 12:         36:32          Yeah. And so did you tell him no I didn't. No, I didn't. I why? Why not? Cause I'm afraid he would beat them up. I didn't want that,

Speaker 8:          36:42          Walter, at this point, you know, as a football player and you know, he looks like Hercules to Owen. And Owen later describes to us this thinking that if he tells Walter, um, that Walter will, uh, hurt the kid and maybe killed a kid. And in Disney, none of the heroes actually kill any of the villains.

Speaker 12:         37:08          No. Walter was the hero. You were afraid he was going to do what? Kill. Yeah, it's wrong. Did you ever talk to Walt about it? A little bit later after it happened, I just remember finding out. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          37:22          And it was like a combination of like rage and helplessness that I literally just thought of what I would've done to that kid if I'd, if Owen had told me I really wanted to kill that kid. I mean, um, you know, um, I'm his protector

Speaker 22:         37:54          in a way. Your, you were kind of pre Walter was worried about protecting you in that time. Yeah, in a way it was me that was doing what? Protecting myself and who else and my brother. Right. And Wild on the wall. You're protecting Walter. So here you had this moment where it looked like Owen was sliding backwards. But according to Ron, it might've actually been his greatest leap forward. His most profound moment of empathy these days. Oh, in his 23 just turned 23 a few months ago. And Are you in love right now? Yes, I am. What the girl made dreams and Molly, she and I graduated from review last month. This has been a three year program called getting ready for the outside world grow. Yeah. And so he'll be graduating from the, from the entire program. Yup. Yup. And often on sound. And now me, her and our other two friends, John and Julie also go to school are all gonna move and live up life and Hyannis I think what his wife living in a penalty forever. And what is it, what kind of day to spend adult independent living program

Speaker 1:          39:12          as we were talking, it was hard not to wonder how independent will Owen be because that's the question that's in front of the SAS guys now. Especially Walt.

Speaker 9:          39:22          I think what scares me sometimes is

Speaker 2:          39:26          okay,

Speaker 9:          39:26          kind of just having to go it alone in a lot of ways and at the same time just being there for,

Speaker 2:          39:42          sorry. Um,

Speaker 9:          39:48          there's some daunting things ahead and um, you know, I'll just have to be ready to take these things on. Kind of

Speaker 1:          39:57          no wonder you don't like birthdays. Makes Sense. That makes clear, well, it's a tough one. I mean, well if there's like an, I said to me at one point, he's like, is it always going to be Disney? I mean, forever. And I'm like, God, I know. Well, but we talked, we talked to him about, you know, about everything, about, you know, our will and who will be s you know, how he figures into everything.

Speaker 9:          40:27          All the efforts of what we're trying to do and have been doing for all this time is to, one of our favorite movies is the jungle book cause Mowgli's it's this quest

Speaker 6:          40:38          but there's animal sidekicks to get him to the man village. What we have been doing all this time and what we're still doing and we do every day, is to bring Owen closer and closer to that man village that we all inhabit. There's so much hope in that and as he progressed, as you feel so good about it, but at the same time, that's not to say he'll ever totally get there.

Speaker 2:          41:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          41:10          as hard as we might try, we, we may not get, but that doesn't mean you, you leave him on the path, you stay with him on the path, even if it's a never ending path.

Speaker 2:          41:33          [inaudible]
