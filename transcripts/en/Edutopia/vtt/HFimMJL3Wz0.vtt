00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:02.596
&gt;&gt;Linda: The United
States is at a moment

00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:05.306
where it could really transform
its assessment systems.

00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:10.306
Most of our testing is multiple
choice tests, pick one answer

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:12.946
out of five, which is
something you will never do

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.716
in applying knowledge
in the real world.

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:20.256
Our assessments need to
evolve to reflect the skills

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:24.586
and knowledge that we actually
value and that we need schools

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:47.626
to teach and our
children to learn.

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:49.686
&gt;&gt;Human beings are
naturally learners.

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:51.866
We are learning every
moment of every day.

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:56.376
In school, we have particular
things to learn and we know

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.926
that students learn more
effectively when we're clear

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.006
about what the goals are.

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.456
&gt;&gt;Chinasa: I kind of like, I
want like a goal in my head

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:05.606
about what to do with
information that I get.

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:08.906
So if they're going to teach me
how to do a one page equation,

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.406
I want to know what
can I do with that?

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:12.556
&gt;&gt;Erin: I look at the
beginning of the year and I say,

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:15.716
what are the big ideas that
I want students to know

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.436
in the whole year and what are
the major skills I want them

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:19.266
to be able to do?

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.666
And then I backwards
map those skills

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.596
and ideas into little chunks.

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:26.806
I try to have a really clear
learning outcome every day

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:29.776
that's measurable, so at the
end of class, students can say,

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:30.766
"This is how close I got

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.966
to meeting the outcome
for the day."

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.516
We use the language,
emerging, developing,

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:35.686
proficient or advanced.

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.656
If they know where they are on
that rubric, then I don't have

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:40.146
to own that for every student

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:41.656
and I think that's
really powerful.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:46.756
&gt;&gt;Linda: Assessment should
occur early and often

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:48.526
and throughout the process.

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:51.186
&gt;&gt;Lisa: I do a lot of
formative assessments,

00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:54.606
so formative assessments
meaning, it's not summative,

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:57.756
it's not a test at the end of
the week or the end of a unit.

00:01:58.016 --> 00:02:00.916
You're doing a lot of small
check ins with the students

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:03.916
to see where they're at and to
see that they're growing a lot.

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:05.176
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How do you know that?

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:07.406
&gt;&gt;Student: Because I read
it in the Saturn book.

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:09.236
&gt;&gt;Teacher: In the Saturn
books, so you're making a?

00:02:09.236 --> 00:02:10.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Connection.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:12.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: From text to?

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:12.456
&gt;&gt;Students: Tips.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:12.816
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Very good.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:15.676
&gt;&gt;Sheela: They are being
steered very gently

00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:19.816
and very strategically, and the
formative assessment gathering

00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:21.776
process is essential to that.

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:26.406
You really have to know what
kids know and don't know.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:31.386
&gt;&gt;Linda: In a lot of cases, we
give students written feedback

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:33.226
on the paper that they've
written but then we move

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:35.416
on to the next thing and we
don't give them the opportunity

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:36.986
to actually rewrite that paper.

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:40.786
And the research evidence
is extremely clear that one

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:44.906
of the strongest positive
influences on achievement occurs

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:46.926
when students get
formative feedback

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:48.816
that they immediately can apply.

00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:50.136
&gt;&gt;Chinasa: I think
that's one of the things

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:53.026
that the kids don't really
like, is doing the reflecting,

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.636
but I think it's actually one of
the things that helps us a lot.

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:58.696
I think doing it kind of
like helps you see the bigger

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:01.896
picture, because I don't think
that if I didn't do reflecting,

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:03.806
I wouldn't really think about
what I'm struggling with.

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:07.096
I would just kind
of want to move on.

00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:11.856
&gt;&gt;Linda: Summative assessment
just simply means an assessment

00:03:11.856 --> 00:03:14.016
from which we can
draw a judgment

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.736
about whether somebody has,
at that moment, learned.

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:21.626
A false distinction has
cropped up in the United States

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:24.236
which seems to suggest
that it's okay

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:26.146
for external summative
assessments

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:29.056
to just be multiple
choice tests.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:30.996
In other countries,
summative assessments

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:35.416
that occur periodically are
essays and oral examinations

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:40.876
and project based assessments,
so that what you're able to see

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:43.116
about what students
can do reflects more

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:45.216
of what you actually want
them to be able to do

00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:46.826
in the world beyond school.

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:49.036
&gt;&gt;Jill: So tonight
is exhibit night.

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:51.916
Every nine weeks, we have this
big celebration of learning

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:54.586
and the halls will be filled
with parents and children

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:58.126
who are all here to celebrate
what their children have

00:03:58.126 --> 00:03:59.826
accomplished in the
past nine weeks.

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:04.196
We also use exhibits to assess
the learning of our students.

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:06.546
I like to go up to students and
have them explain an exhibit

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.866
to me so that I understand,
did they get the big idea?

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:10.946
Did they just do a project

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:14.256
or do they really understand
what they did, why they did it

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:16.926
and what it means in terms
of the bigger picture?

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:21.066
What we find is that because
the learning is so rich and it's

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:23.666
so meaningful, that our
students do very well

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:25.146
on standardized tests.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:32.006
&gt;&gt;Linda: Many schools
that I've worked

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:34.086
with have graduation portfolios

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.496
where students have
to complete projects.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:41.216
They often need to collaborate
with others effectively as part

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:42.836
of the work that
they're going to present.

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:45.906
They need to communicate
in multiple forms.

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:49.126
They need to be critical
and creative problem solvers

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.536
because they're going to run
into barriers and obstacles

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:53.506
and they have to
solve them in order

00:04:53.506 --> 00:04:55.786
to complete this major project.

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:59.656
So the blend of the cognitive
and the non-cognitive skills

00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:03.546
that result often in them
defending their work to a panel

00:05:03.546 --> 00:05:08.766
of outside evaluators really
prepares them for the range

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:11.126
of abilities they're
going to need to have

00:05:11.536 --> 00:05:13.916
when they leave the
boundaries of school.

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:15.676
And I think it's possible

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:20.036
to value these non-cognitive
skills throughout school

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:22.826
in the same way we value
the academic skills.

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:26.916
&gt;&gt;Erin: We try to bring in
people from the community

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:28.996
to watch or judge
their presentations

00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:32.246
and then just do things that's
like, in your life, in a job,

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:34.396
you might have to make a
presentation to your boss

00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:36.216
about why your proposal
should work.

00:05:36.426 --> 00:05:38.786
&gt;&gt;Student: So ninety-one percent
of the people I surveyed said

00:05:38.786 --> 00:05:41.636
that fifteen dollars for
one unit is a perfect price

00:05:41.706 --> 00:05:42.006
for them.

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.966
&gt;&gt;Woman: Really nicely
done, good presentation

00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:46.356
and I really like your product.

00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:48.476
&gt;&gt;Erin: So trying
to model assessments

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:51.376
after real life experiences,
I think is really important.

00:05:51.666 --> 00:05:54.616
No one in their job, I
don't think, has to bubble

00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:56.456
in a standardized test.

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:02.956
&gt;&gt;Having a hundred and thirty
students means it's really easy

00:06:02.956 --> 00:06:05.646
to have no idea if your
students are learning anything

00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:06.786
because there's so many of them.

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:09.616
That's when in the last couple
of years, I've realized,

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:11.686
the more that I can get
them to take ownership

00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:13.546
of their learning, then
I don't have to own

00:06:13.546 --> 00:06:14.366
that for every student.

00:06:14.756 --> 00:06:17.436
&gt;&gt;Student: Something that I'm
good at is researching in books

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:19.806
and interviews and
articles and to make sure

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:21.876
that the information
is accurate.

00:06:22.276 --> 00:06:25.566
&gt;&gt;Linda: Ideally, assessment
is primarily for the student

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:30.506
and the student should own big
parts of the assessment process.

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:33.376
That can happen in
a variety of ways:

00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:37.406
one is that they are continually
engaged in self assessment

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.716
and peer assessment,
using rubrics.

00:06:40.056 --> 00:06:41.636
&gt;&gt;Student: So writing strengths.

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:43.556
&gt;&gt;Student: Creating good claims.

00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:45.276
&gt;&gt;Student: And then,
areas for growth.

00:06:45.816 --> 00:06:49.886
&gt;&gt;Student: I need to
analyze my evidence in depth.

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:51.786
&gt;&gt;Linda: When kids
have that opportunity,

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:55.146
they begin to value assessment.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:58.626
Assessment is for me, as
a way to get the feedback

00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:02.000
that allows me to become
the person I want to be.

00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:10.346
&gt;&gt;If we do this well, the kind

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.996
of learner we should produce is
someone who is self-initiating

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:17.556
and self-motivated, understands
the standards internally

00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:19.906
and is continually
driving towards excellence,

00:07:20.236 --> 00:07:23.866
is continually developing
their own learning skills,

00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:29.496
and is able ultimately to learn
on their own, independently

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:33.426
and collaboratively with
others, in a world that is going

00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:36.436
to be very unpredictable and in

00:07:36.436 --> 00:07:38.366
which those learning
skills are going

00:07:38.366 --> 00:07:40.976
to be the most important
determinant of success.
