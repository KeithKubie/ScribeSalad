00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.560
 Hey. 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.880
 Usually when someone comes in front of a red curtain, it is to say that you are going to see something scary 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.380
 and indeed, with the standard of the internet, you are going to see something very scary tonight: 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.420
 opinions. 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.560
 Oh my God! 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.500
 I know, I know. Sometimes opinions are very scary, especially if they are not yours. 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.540
 However, think of the first time Nostalgia Critic reviewed It and everyone got very angry 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.580
 and now everyone wants him to do a Stephen King review once a year. 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.100
 So, being the internet, we can all be adults and agree that there are better things to argue about. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.540
 My fiance said this would happen, so he wrote a spare speech for me. 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.940
 If any of your whining buggers have a problem with that, then you can fight that out with me! 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.380
 So that's better, 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.940
 Enjoy the review, have fun 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.100
 and remember, if someone feels irritated, 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.940
 then I will prick you even harder, asshole! 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Was 'It' almost 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.800
 So, I hear that your cinema version breaks all kinds of records. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.460
 You know, when mine was on TV, the ratings flew out. 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.040
 Viewing figures? What are those again? 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.000
 Success was measured before Netflix arrived 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.080
 Sounds stupid. 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.460
 It was that too. 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.500
 They said no one was looking at Family Guy, 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.300
 but the fans brought it back so that years later nobody would look at Family Guy. 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.160
 Well, now measure how far the greenhouse is cracking. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.400
 It is only a matter of time before people say that I am "It" definitive. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.940
 I was the first to appear in children's nightmares. 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.520
 The first is the worst, as any comment on YouTube would say. 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.560
 They are already looking back and remember how cool I was. 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.640
 I'll tell you your mate. I was almost "it." 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.580
 No, time will continue and then everyone will remember me. 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.300
 I was almost "it." 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.440
 I think I shouldn't be here. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.400
 You know, where I come from, we call it "IT audience" instead of "IT audience." 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.780
 Oh, shut up Moss and tell us who does 'It' better. 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 Yes come on. I'm scary. 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.440
 Do you know.... 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.620
 But I'm funnier. 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.920
 We are not supposed to be funny. 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.680
 We are damn clowns! 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.000
 This is even worse than my first episode in America. 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.280
 Hey guys. 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.600
 Pour in a vodka martini cupcake and let me participate. 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.000
 No. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.040
 We are not going to do that. 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.840
 No. 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.420
 Oh, come on, what's the problem? 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.500
 You always ruin 'It' for people. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.120
 Yes, children were scared of me once, 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.060
 but now they come to me and do "WA-HA! WA-HA! WA-HA!" 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.080
 Oh come on, I liked some things in 'It'. 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.120
 The children were good, you were good. 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.220
 And? 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.240
 I don't know, I fainted because of the Stephen King Drinking Game â„¢. 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.360
 Oh my god, does that game come with a doctor's warning? 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.100
 Yes, you see, he does this. 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.680
 He ruined scary things by pointing out their mistakes. 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.280
 Like asking why my head turning into a dog had to be scary. 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
 Well, why did it have to be scary? 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.380
 The "Pound Puppies" took over the recordings. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.140
 Forget it, you are not going to ruin our pleasure this time. 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.160
 Okay listen, you both try to figure out who the final version is. 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.220
 Is it not logical that I listen to both parties to find out who is better? 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.660
 Let me decide who 'It' almost was. 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.060
 No not really. 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.820
 Horrible idea. 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.880
 Bad luck, I'm not talking about "The Dark Tower". 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.420
 Good point. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.300
 You know what. Go ahead. Everyone in the world loves my movie. 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.340
 The president of the critics said, "If Jesus was a movie, then it was this movie." 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.480
 The United Nations Film Critics said, "Stop making films. Nothing gets better than" It. " 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.140
 And the holy church of heavenly criticism said, "No, but kill me. I fear you not, 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.180
 because I have seen 'It' and I know that nothing in life will be better. " 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.100
 "Going too far," you would say. "Going on a hype", maybe. 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.960
 I say no. 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.020
 I challenge you. 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:56.600
 I welcome you to find something that is not right in my version of "It." 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.700
 Okay, this is the cinema version of 'It'. 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.400
 I hoped you were intimidated by that. 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.900
 Was not me. 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.740
 'The' 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.600
 When the credits run we see a little boy named Georgie and his stuttering brother Bill. 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.480
 Okay, we exchange it for this dialogue. 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.740
 New white Bill, you think the SS Georgia is ready to sail. 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.200
 She certainly is. 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.860
 They? 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.500
 You always call a ship a "she". 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.040
 Even if it's called SS Georgia. 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.500
 Do you want to go to the real problems of this movie or not? 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.460
 Yes, then. 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.620
 He would like to test his paper boat in the rain, but he first has to get something from the scary basement. 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.200
 Yes, I am sure I will not be killed before the credits expire 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.840
 and everyone knows that sewer well scene, 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.380
 so I assume that these are light bulbs. 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.860
 But you don't have to be so mean about it. 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.480
 Georgia loses his boat in a sewer pit, where he meets the infamous clown, Pennywise. 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.820
 Hello Georgie! 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.780
 No! 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.040
 Hey wait, where are you going? 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.020
 Hey wait, where is he going? 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.840
 No child is attracted by someone who looks so scary. 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.400
 Yes, they were attracted to him and he's not even scary. 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.240
 Exactly stupid. 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.300
 One of the reasons that Pennywise scared people was because it is a good clown. 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.080
 He was fun and funny so he could trap kids. 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.820
 This guy can't even lure weird fan art to Tumblr. 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.300
 Hey, I was really scary. I feed on people's fears. 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.680
 But you do not feed on their stupidity, something must attract them. 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.660
 Do I have to lure them, okay? 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.300
 I have to go. 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.480
 Oh yes, that worked great. 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.000
 You know, we should have eaten it right away. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.500
 Agree. 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.920
 Mourning the loss of his brother, Bill gets, over time, a group of rude friends 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.180
 known as the Token Troop .. 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.140
 I mean, the Losers Club (Stumpers in NL) ... 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.840
 I mean... 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.160
 ... let's keep it at Token Club. 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.820
 It uses many of the traditional child style styles, 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.440
 but to be honest, it was the origin of this, so there is a little leeway, 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.460
 like when the Token girl, Bev, befriends the Token fat guy Ben. 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.600
 So you're the new kid in the street. What are you listening to? 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.540
 New Kids on the Block. 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.660
 Really? 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.380
 Yes really? 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.380
 Okay, it's the only 80s thing they ram through your throat. 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.540
 But it's stupid. 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.260
 Very stupid. 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.880
 Okay, do you want that or do you want to do what every 80s movie does and therefore wear this? 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.580
 All right. - We'll take the stupid joke. 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.520
 Good. Now go back to your romantic kind of relationship. 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.380
 I think I'll be attracted to you later. 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.220
 Something like that. 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.040
 Perhaps. 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.740
 Kind of. 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.320
 Strangely enough, the other characters are introduced early by frightening Pennywise, 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.100
 which is strange since we have to be afraid of that even though we don't know the characters well yet. 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.120
 Such as Stanley, the Jewish figure. 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.040
 I wonder why a Jewish temple would have a scary abstract painting of a woman. 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.000
 Could it be based on that woman there. 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.220
 I think I'm not going to tell anyone about this. 

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.160
 Yes, I have no jokes for that moment, that was really a scary scene. 

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.640
 Which is a shame, because some moments of shock are ruined because the film does not continue with its ideas. 

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.020
 For example, the fear of fear figure, named Eddie, is looking for his medicine. 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.940
 A scary-looking hand grabs it and holds it for him. 

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.980
 This is a brilliant approach, keeping the hand in the foreground, 

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.480
 so that the identity of the scary figure remains vague and with that you build up how scary he looks. 

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.280
 This is masterful, but when its appearance is revealed. 

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.100
 I have a cold. 

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.760
 That result is not scary enough, it is just a very sick-looking man. 

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.200
 He must actually be a leper, but come on, you could make it worse than this. 

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.740
 I think this is scary for someone with a fear of stains, but this is not so bad for us. 

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.860
 Shock moments can also be made less in other ways. 

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.320
 The black figure, named Mike, quickly sees a remains from a burned building. 

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.700
 This would be incredibly disturbing if the music once stopped. 

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.520
 Most of the music is very exaggerated. 

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.420
 If it should be pleasant, then the pleasure will continue as if Tinkelbel is being pressed into your ass. 

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.800
 You are wonderful oh so beautiful childhood is fun there is nothing wrong with that 

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.920
 And if it has to be scary, it will be better if it is a little quieter, 

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.220
 but there are not so many quiet moments. 

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:49.140
 Instead, the shivers that you are supposed to get are transformed into jumpscares that are thrown into your skull. 

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.040
 Listen, just like any soundtrack, a scary soundtrack is essential, 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.060
 but if it is used too often, it can become just like a smile band 

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.420
 where it is pushed through someone's throat while coming naturally. 

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.580
 Let's do this scene again, but we dim the music a lot 

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.840
 and focus more on scary silence and some well-chosen sound effects. 

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.820
 Didn't that seem creepier? Even the passing car wasn't much more spectacular. 

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.320
 Don't get me wrong, some moments of shock work very well. 

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.560
 Like the burnt, decapitated mind, its revelation and its movements are scary. 

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.180
 But, I have to admit it is a bit stupid when you see that it is still Pennywise. 

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.120
 Hold on, what do you mean by "stupid"? There is nothing stupid about me. 

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.800
 I'm the scariest thing on film. 

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.460
 Do you want to tell him or will I do it? 

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.900
 I think we should both tell him. 

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.120
 What, tell me what? 

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.240
 You are a clown! 

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.860
 Regardless of what you do, you always remain a bit stupid. 

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.380
 Just embrace it, you denying idiot. 

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.920
 That is not true! Do you remember that I am the .. 

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.560
 I mean Billy, frightened with his dead brother? 

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.960
 Look, I'm Jeff Dunham if he'd have been funny. 

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.500
 Well come on, that's scary right? 

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.100
 Yes, but it's kind of funny too. 

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.740
 I'm not supposed to be funny. 

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.580
 I get very scary when I run to him like that. 

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.360
 What is that? 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.180
 That's my thing, my frightening way of running. 

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.220
 You look and sound like a possessed version of Olaf from 'Frozen'. 

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.380
 Go make 'Ferngully' scary again, this is scary. 

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.480
 Oh my god, I'll play Benny Hill's music on this. 

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.840
 Oh my god, do that. 

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.560
 This is scary! 

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.600
 Oh, that's gold. 

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.600
 This was never funny until I met you. 

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.400
 There's a kid in the movie, I swear, he's in his own movie, and that's Richie. 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:21.020
 I think this kid is great, mainly because he is a nerd-like variant of Ash. Think about it. 

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.360
 He has all one-liners. 

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.620
 They say Derry is full of beaver traps 

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.380
 And that is it. Still guys! 

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.560
 Except if he doesn't have it. 

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.360
 Something, something, something your mother. Still guys! 

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.800
 He is super cowardly. 

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.180
 I don't want to go in there. 

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.300
 Except if he isn't. 

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.300
 Do you see this? This is my bat! 

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.940
 He is, oddly enough, the nastiest and coolest kid in the entire film, the constant contradiction. 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.200
 Nerd on 

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.400
 But other conflicting things are more distracting than fun. 

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.400
 Like the adults who don't see the blood while the child does, it is stranger in this. 

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.620
 Have you done anything to your hair? 

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.040
 I'm going to do some scary things there. 

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.960
 But then the children clear the blood while dancing to an 80s song. 

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.140
 The swinging blood cleaning scene? 

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.780
 Why don't you immediately add a whisk like in a girl's film. 

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.060
 See, you have no idea what you are doing. 

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.060
 Well, our version, by contrast, we made balloons scary. 

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.100
 No you did not. -A little? 

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.120
 Not a little bit. -Ienie-mini? 

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.240
 Stop now. -All right then. 

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.500
 The new film did, on the other hand, do. 

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.340
 What?! 

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.720
 First, all balloons are red, so they stand out more and serve as an ominous sign. 

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.660
 I bet that when people see red balloons, they'll think about 'It' for a long time. 

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.800
 Second, they are used to reveal something. There is always something behind the balloon. 

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.980
 The balloon itself is not scary, but more a build-up for the actual shock that is coming. 

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.040
 So when we see it, we get scared. 

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.900
 I even think the bullies are a lot better. 

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.440
 Yes, the ultimate overall Stephen King troop is actually quite well done here, 

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.400
 especially the leader, Henry, who not only has an understandable background, 

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.560
 but they also make it clear that his harassment is more disturbed than most other bullying. 

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.800
 It is not just standard, but they also say that it is quite disturbed. 

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.980
 I've been waiting for you outside the library all the time, Ben. 

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.440
 You had been waiting for hours and knew that I would come this way. 

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.360
 How dare you pinpoint my cinematic mistakes. Only for that ... 

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.700
 Oh my god, why are you dealing with him? 

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.440
 To be honest, we are hiding behind you. 

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.980
 Yes, we are afraid he will cut us. 

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.620
 Hey, it works. 

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.680
 But Ben manages to escape and runs into the Stumperds who look after his wounds. 

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.640
 Ask your. Why didn't we take him to a hospital? 

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.180
 Oh, me. Well, that's because the adults in the neighborhood don't care about the kids. 

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.560
 Okay, I know that, because I read the book. But outside of a couple who drive by in their car, that is not made clear. 

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.580
 Yes and even then people still live. They must have something of a medical building. 

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.560
 No time for that. Billy sees Bev walking for the first time in slow-mo. 

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.180
 Wait, didn't he just see her in the pharmacy? 

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.100
 But not in slow-mo. 

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.440
 But is that not usually used when you see someone for the first time? 

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.300
 Like when you see her first, are things slower? Why do you only do that later? 

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.220
 Is it "love at second sight"? 

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.900
 What? You don't know that. 

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.240
 Indeed, we do not know that. 

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.660
 If you don't know, I won't tell you either. 

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.760
 Who won it? 

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.760
 So Ben invites the Stumpers as a token of thanks for saving him. 

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.060
 Yes, I study disappearances and history of the villages I have just moved to. 

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.280
 Wow, your incredibly specific hobby suits us well. 

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.040
 I will give this to the film instead of letting the fat man be obsessed with: 

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.140
 Food! 

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.720
 Here he is obsessed with ... 

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.780
 Village! 

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.360
 It is a bit forced, but not as forced as this. 

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.020
 Oh my god, do you still like New Kids on the Block? 

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.540
 Yes, as clearly stated earlier. 

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.340
 Wow, that's so 80s. 

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.280
 Hey, someone else has noticed this incredibly clear photo of a clown with the city's founders. 

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.760
 I mean, we have to pause the whole movie to watch that poster. 

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.140
 While we also play a song about it. 

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.160
 I mean, he's hanging here so everyone can see him. I thought someone would notice. 

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.600
 Yes, this film is mostly timeless, but sometimes we have to kick you in with the 80s. 

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.160
 Yes, because we have only had five close-ups of the poster. 

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.760
 And only two of the scary clown here. Let someone else notice. Let someone else notice. 

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.280
 Did I mention that "Batman" and "Lethal Weapon" are in the cinema? 

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.420
 Wow, the 80s are so cool. 

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.240
 Let us never refer to it again. 

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:07.740
 Clown. 

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.940
 Shut up Richie! 

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.480
 Clown. 

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.780
 The tone gets crazier when Mike reappears in the film. 

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.340
 Yes, he had disappeared for quite a while, right? 

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.720
 I feel a little self-defeated. 

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.280
 There is only one thing we can do for this serious scene where we fight our fears. 

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.580
 Weird music and slow-mo. 

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.160
 You tru ... 

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.240
 Weirdly directing. 

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.020
 Do you remember when this was a serious and important scene? 

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.880
 Yes, now it's silly and stupid! 

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.060
 Did you see that? It didn't even hurt. I'm just a cartoon. 

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.320
 So they save Mike and decide to admit him to the Stumpers. 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.400
 Do you believe in UFOs, mental projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance 

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.140
 ghost photography, telekinetic movements, complete transmediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of Atlantis. 

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.600
 As long as I'm not being pushed away like that Jewish boy, I believe everything you say. 

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.400
 Which Jewish boy? 

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.100
 Shalom! 

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.740
 Oh yes, Stanley. 

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.740
 You had certainly forgotten that I was a character? 

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 It's all right, it's all right. 

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.080
 There are so many characters in this film that someone would get less time in the picture anyway. 

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.500
 In fact, I'm not there for half the time, then I'm a cardboard doll. 

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.100
 I didn't even know that. 

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.760
 That what do you think Mike? Do you want to join the club? 

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.360
 Okay, where do you want me? 

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.740
 Jewish boy in the back. 

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.260
 The movie becomes really nice again and not forced like, 

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.040
 You tru ... 

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.660
 .. whatever that may be. 

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.840
 After a scene where Pennywise comes to life in a projector, the kids go into a haunted house that 

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.680
 Frankly, it's like a haunted house in your neighborhood during Halloween and I mean that in a good way. 

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.860
 There are rooms with scary toys, cobwebs, doors that lead to moments of shock. It's fun, bloody fun. 

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.560
 Do not say that! 

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.100
 Don't say what? 

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.920
 Things like "fun, bloody pleasure." Does this sound like a voice that does "nice, bloody pleasure"? 

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.860
 I'm super scary and super serious in this creepy review of "It." 

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.520
 I change my body into all sorts of sharp things. 

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.580
 Oh, you mean by your bad digital effects. 

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.860
 Oh, that's really typical of your critics, isn't it? 

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.080
 I had completely forgotten that he was there. 

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.740
 Yes, you were not just for a nice opening. 

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.260
 I know how this works. 

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.780
 If you identify bad digital effects, that means that you hate all digital effects. 

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.500
 That is not at all what I said, but .. 

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.060
 I get it. You hate Pixar, you despise Jurassic Park, 

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.760
 You want to see Agent Hopps die. 

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.840
 Okay listen, digital effects are great and have come a long way, especially in horror movies. 

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.620
 CGI can make a ghost look like it is there and it isn't at the same time. 

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.000
 It is one of the few examples where secrecy really helps an effect 

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.200
 and it works well in this movie for half the time. 

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.640
 The scary painting that comes to life, the boy without a head. More than the hell of digital effects are very effective. 

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.660
 Great, that means you love all CGI. I'm glad we made that clear. 

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.000
 No, that's right. Just like all effects, there are good and bad ones 

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.700
 and when you use them so often in your film, the bad ones are more noticeable. 

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.320
 The fear of Pennywise is not that he is a transparent mind, he must really be there 

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:31.300
 and if your digital effects don't have the time to make it look like his hand turns into a werewolf or a monster, 

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.340
 because you had to use that time on other digital effects, fear is considerably reduced. 

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.760
 No, it was all great and you hate everything that is digital. 

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.400
 Like that blurry run effect. How did you do that? 

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.820
 Oh, of course. 

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.960
 You just filmed your face very close on the phone. 

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.380
 It costs thousands of CGI artists to copy this. 

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.980
 Are we still playing? 

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.320
 The children fight back against Pennywise, showing that they can beat him, 

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.380
 so of course this is the moment that they separate and each choose their own way. 

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.040
 See you soon, this is the moment that we separate and each choose our own way. 

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.360
 Oh yes, you really caught me there film. 

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.920
 I am sure they will never see each other again. 

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.180
 No, it's very sad. 

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.080
 Oh yes, too bad you never get together again. 

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.300
 Wait, why are we leaving anyway? He's on the run, we can finish him. 

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.400
 No no. This is the part where you retire. 

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.860
 But that clichÃ© is in everything. I know, I was in those clichÃ©s when they became popular. 

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.100
 We are not going to repair old clichÃ©s. We will add more instead. 

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.200
 Like which? 

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.800
 Well, the lady in need, to begin with. 

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.620
 Followed by the kiss of a true love to break the curse. 

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.040
 Are you serious? 

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.860
 Well, the graph says ... 

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.700
 Shall we go to a graphics bar, maybe talk about math. 

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.700
 Let's look at the graph. -Yes. 

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.160
 So the Stumpers come together to save Beverly. 

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.500
 She's down there. 

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.480
 Wait, what's that on your arm? 

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.860
 That is plaster. 

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.360
 Did you go to a hospital? I thought I knew you. 

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.360
 You'll all be going to the hospital soon. 

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.740
 Quick, Mike. 

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.940
 Damn Mike, we want you to sort of finish your story now. 

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.160
 Oh okay. 

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.060
 I had a reason to be here! 

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.200
 Awesome! Now I can tell you about my incredibly interesting background. 

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.200
 Uh, we're actually a little past two o'clock. 

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200
 We may be able to give you a bonus component on the Blu-ray. 

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.420
 Good enough. 

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.380
 Really, a hospital? 

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.120
 The sisters were probably delicious. 

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.820
 I thought it was a placebo! 

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.920
 Meanwhile, Beverly wakes up in the sewer, where ... 

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.380
 Oh, Christ. 

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.900
 What now? 

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.580
 Are you sure you're not supposed to be funny? 

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.480
 What, it's a scary dance of evil. You put it in your pants. 

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.480
 Yes, especially if you play this over it. 

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.660
 Hey, stop it! Stop that! 

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.500
 Oh come on, people just stopped playing 'Gangam Style' about it. 

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.340
 Oh yeah. Well here is something in my version of the film that your version didn't have. 

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.840
 People who really float (through the air). 

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.820
 Oh my god, really? 

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.820
 Yes, that's a very good point. For all those times you said "They float, they always float", 

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.360
 we never see anyone floating in your version. 

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.200
 That won't work. -Yes. 

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.580
 But okay, yes actually. 

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.900
 Sorry, he's a good clown. 

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.520
 They save Beverly, but she is hypnotized. So, as said before, 

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.440
 Ben uses the "kiss of true love" to free her. 

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.740
 You know what, I'm married. I love my wife. 

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.900
 That counts too. 

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.680
 You won't get away that easily. 

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.440
 So Pennywise tries to change all their fears. 

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.780
 Oh, hi kids. 

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.140
 You are just wimps. 

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.900
 The children confront their fears and defeat Pennywise, making them agree that they will return if he ever returns. 

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.980
 I think we succeeded. - That's true. 

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.540
 Ho, I'm sorry, what are you doing? 

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.540
 Kiss you. 

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.440
 Oh, uh, I think I have a better relationship with Ben. 

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.780
 I mean, he saved me, he writes poems for me. 

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.200
 Moreover, I just had a kiss scene with him. 

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.440
 Yes, get rid of my maybe girlfriend. 

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.180
 I'm not following this, it's the last scene of the movie. 

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.460
 Are we really going to end up with a half-baked relationship? 

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.500
 Well, let's see what the book says. 

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.440
 That is a good idea. That is where Beverly ends. 

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.020
 Yes I don't. 

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.020
 Super uncomfortable. 

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.500
 Uh, what do you think if we just do kiss hands? 

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.240
 'The' 

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.860
 And that's the best thing we've ever made as humans. 

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.880
 Cinematic flawless, spooky scary, 

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.280
 the greatest horror movie ever good super yes ... good. 

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.940
 Don't you think you're exaggerating it a little bit? 

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.400
 No, it's perfect and everyone who thinks otherwise hates movies. 

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.480
 Well... 

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.600
 Yes, film hater? 

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.140
 You can't say this is an "error-free" horror movie, 

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.340
 but, at the same time, you can't say he's bad either. 

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.240
 There are many shock effects, fun ideas, good characters 

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.860
 and, with all due respect, it is better than the original. 

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.640
 Generally I recommend it as a scary movie. 

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.880
 Deal with it, Ronald Horror Picture Show! 

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.540
 However, there is something that the original has and the new does not. 

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.100
 What then? 

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.320
 Personality. 

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.440
 The original was silly and strange, but it enjoyed it. 

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.000
 From weird effects, to excessive acting, to bizarre writing 

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.300
 and, of course, Tim Curry who gives a million percent. 

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.100
 It's not scary, but it's an over-the-top, fun TV movie. 

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.420
 This is trying an 80s movie, a timeless movie, 

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.540
 have subtle shock moments, exaggerated moments of shock, 

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.600
 adult humor, 

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.820
 the tone and style are everywhere and nowhere. 

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:57.360
 I admire that they have tried so much, but that does not always fit together, so that it has less identity of its own. 

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.720
 So, even if the cinema version is better, I will remember the original better. 

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.380
 So yes, it's good enough. I just don't think it's the game-maker that is built up so much by everyone. 

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.600
 But wait, you never answered the question. Which of us 'It' definitely. 

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.060
 Yes, scary or funny? Which one is it'? 

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.220
 Well, I'm probably not the right person to answer that, but I know someone who is. 

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.460
 You both! 

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.720
 Do you know how many incarnations there are of the Joker? Tons! 

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.500
 And do you know what the best have in common? 

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.900
 They are not Jared Leto? 

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.740
 Yes. 

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.700
 And they were both scary and funny. 

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.480
 Don't choose one, be it both. 

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.360
 As the world's most famous killer clown, I would say, 

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.740
 it's best to stop yelling and laughing. 

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.300
 Hey, wasn't I supposed to get your role? 

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.520
 Ho, gotta go. 

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.900
 Would you really get his role. 

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.740
 Yes and I almost had 'It'. 

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.540
 You know, overall, this review is very confusing. 

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.160
 That is your film in a nutshell. 

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.720
 Good point. 

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.440
 That's all people! 

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.800
 What are you looking at? 

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.340
 'The'. 

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.260
 What is it'? 

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.880
 That is the name of the film. 

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.540
 What? 

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.120
 'The'! 

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.860
 What is it'? 

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.120
 It is it'? 

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.080
 And what is that? 

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.740
 'The'! 

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.880
 So is that? 

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.120
 And that's it. 

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.080
 And what is that? 

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.860
 'The'! 

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.700
 So it's it? 

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.500
 Is that not it? 

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.580
 How should I know that? 

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.000
 Because if it wasn't, it could be something else, wouldn't it? 

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.740
 That is it? 

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.740
 Exactly. 

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.160
 And you watch it with them. 

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.440
 No, is they a completely different film? 

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.180
 What are you, a kind of clown? 

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.700
 No, "It" is the clown. 

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.440
 What? 

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.540
 "It," retort it. 

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.640
 Okay, we'll start again. It is like this.. 

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.840
 Let's not get John Carpenter. 

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.680
 I do not believe it. 

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.120
 That is your problem. You can't see 'It' if you don't believe it. 

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.580
 It drives me crazy! 

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.360
 Well, that's what 'Het' does. 

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.800
 "It" drives people crazy? 

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.140
 Now you get it. 

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.040
 You dirty, dirty bastard .... 

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.260
 What's the problem? 

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.960
 I would like to know! 

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.540
 Good night people. 

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.360
