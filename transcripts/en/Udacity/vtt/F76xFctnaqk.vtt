00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.011
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I've highlighted the two lines that we selected in the last quiz in this dark

00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:05.745
blue color.

00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:10.553
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'd like you to first to tell me what the point of intersection of those two

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:11.135
lines is.

00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:16.347
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then using that, tell me what our solution for x in the earlier equation

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.006
should be.
