1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,850
Religion can't be divorced from social,
political,

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,400
and historical context and issues.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,710
And so what we're gonna do today is
do one the first of two lectures.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,210
Now these are going to be sort of dreary,
boring,

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,530
typical Martin lectures, dreary
and boring historical survey. Uh,

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,550
and I just have to do it this
today on the Greco Roman world.

7
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:29,130
Tell you everything you need to know
what the Greco Roman world at least for

8
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,130
this semester.
And then next time next Wednesday,

9
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,810
cause remember we're
not meeting on Monday.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,560
The next Wednesday I'll do a similar kind
of lecture for everything you need to

11
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:42,090
know about ancient Judaism to put the New
Testament into its historical context.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,890
So you'll just have to survive these two
very historical survey lectures because

13
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,180
it's material that you need to know.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,780
I'll try to make it as
interesting as I humanly can do.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,020
We now find the New Testament in the
same book as the Old Testament as

16
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:01,530
Christians call it. And as Jews call
it, the Hebrew Bible or the Tanakh.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,000
Clearly early Christianity has got to
be studied in the context of ancient

18
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:10,590
Judaism. And so we'll do so next time
we'll look at the Jewish context,

19
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:13,140
for example, for the development of the
New Testament and early Christianity,

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,730
but to understand Judaism of
the time of Jesus and Paul,

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,770
which is centuries after the
chronological end of the Hebrew Bible,

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,790
we need to understand Judaism
as a Greco Roman cult.

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,500
It is a Greco Roman religion,

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,010
and that means the need to understand
at least a little bit about the Greco

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,690
Roman world. For us, we can start not
so all the way back at classical Greece,

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,890
but with Alexander the Great in
the beginning of Hellenization.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,160
That is the Greg Ization of the eastern
part of the ancient Mediterranean.

28
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,810
That's all Hellenization means,
making it Greek.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,780
Alexander the Great's father was Phillip
the second king of Macedonian king a

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,633
methadone,

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,160
and he conquered different Greek city
states by defeating Athens and its allies

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,100
at Kira Neha in 338 BC and I've got some
of these names and some of these dates

33
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,870
on the handout that you have before you.

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,730
Alexander himself was born in
three 56 he was educated a BCE.

35
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:23,490
Of course he was educated by
Aristotle beginning in three 43

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,140
he was made king after the assassination
of his father in three 36 BCE.

37
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,560
As your textbook points out
is urban points that, and
you probably already know,

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,440
but for some of you who may,
this may sound like odd lingo.

39
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,270
I'm using CE for the common era,
which is exactly the same thing as a d.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,390
And I'm using BCE for
before the common era,

41
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,360
which is back the same
dates as before Christ.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,220
We in religious studies tend to like
these terms rather than BC before Christ

43
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:58,221
and ady because Ada actually stands for
on no Domini in the year of our Lord.

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,280
And we in religious studies include people
in our departments who are in Judaic

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,500
Studies, Islam, Hinduism,
all kinds of religions.

46
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,980
You can imagine that people who are in
other religions might not want to call

47
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:13,690
things in the year of our Lord,
since Jesus is not their Lord.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,320
So in simply that,
uh,

49
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,730
the interest of reflecting the
plurality of our own departments,

50
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:23,110
we tend to use these terms rather than
BC and 80. But it means the same thing.

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,910
Okay.

52
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,730
Alexander defeated the Er,
the Persian army,

53
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,680
which at that time controlled all of
Asia minor modern Turkey and had even

54
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,060
threatened to control Greece.

55
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,650
He defeated the Persian Army
in Asia minor at Granicus,

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,680
the battle of Granicus in three 34 that
put Alexander and his Macedonian army in

57
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:50,540
charge of both Greece and Asia Minor.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,030
When Darious the second died,
who was the king of the Persians,

59
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,200
uh, Alexander himself
took on Darious his title,

60
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,760
which was great king after
defeating the Persians again,

61
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,020
he pushed his army all the
way to the Indus River, uh,

62
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,970
in India to the western part of what's
now India and what was then called India.

63
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:18,350
Also by Greeks. He wanted to go
all the way to the Ganges River,

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,810
but his army forced him to turn back.

65
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,260
He died in three 23 when he was not yet
33 years old and he died in Babylon of a

66
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:32,690
fever. That is of course, modern day Iraq.

67
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,770
After his death, his empire was
divided up among his generals.

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,160
And after some fighting and maneuvering
and negotiations for successors to

69
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:48,221
Alexander the great finally ended up
splitting up his large empire into four

70
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,800
smaller empires. And we call these
four successors simply the auto key.

71
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,270
I think that's actually not on your
handout. So I'll write it up for you.

72
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,610
This is a great word.
That simply means

73
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,410
this successors.

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,290
So the doubt of Koi and the Greek plural
diotic key as we often refer to it, uh,

75
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,450
ended up splitting his army into four
parts and four dynasties descending from

76
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,060
the four successors.
There were four generals of Alexander.

77
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,780
Now next time I in I lecture
on introducing you to Judaism.

78
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,520
I'll talk about the importance of at
least two of these empires because they're

79
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,200
very important for the history
of Palestine in Israel at
this time. But for now,

80
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:31,720
all you need to know is that
these four different kingdoms,

81
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:36,160
one was where we were, where we now have
Greece. Another one was where Syria is,

82
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,430
another was Egypt. And then there
was another, uh, further north.

83
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,050
But that's not as important for us.
The,

84
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,900
the Syrian Greek empire and the Egyptian
Greek Empire will become very important

85
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,770
for the history of Judaism and Jesus
himself also. But for right now,

86
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,900
all you need to know is
that all of these generals,

87
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:56,890
although there were Macedonians and had
a spoke Macedonian and not themselves,

88
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,820
but they had just like Alexander, they
hit adopted Greek language, Greek culture.

89
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,330
They educated their children in
Greek ways. Alexander, of course,

90
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:10,331
I've been educated by Aristotle when he
was a young and so he had adopted Greek

91
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:14,450
language and Greek literature and a
lot of other Greek ways. All of the,

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,890
what Alexander he wanted to do was to
take all these different peoples who spoke

93
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,891
different languages and had different
customs and use a Greek layer to sort of

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,710
unite his empire overall.
Now,

95
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,810
he didn't really care about
the lower class people as much,

96
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,300
so they could just still live in their
villages and out in the country and do

97
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,880
their farming and speak
their own local language.

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,360
But if you were going to be elite,
he wanted this,

99
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,120
he wanted to establish cities throughout
his empire that would be actually Greek

100
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,043
cities.

101
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,160
And you want it to have the elite people
all be able at least to speak Greek.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You have therefore one world and in fact
this whole dream of Alexander and it

103
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,660
was a very self conscious propaganda
campaign and a cultural campaign on

104
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:59,300
Alexander's part.
He wanted to make one world.

105
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,650
You really have therefore a for in
some way, the first time in history,

106
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,240
a dream of making all of his
empire basically universal,

107
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,990
a dream of a universal
vision for one world,

108
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,840
one world under one kind of culture,
one kind of language.

109
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,130
This really hadn't been a tip.

110
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:21,020
Did you see in the previous empires like
the Assyrian Empire or these kinds of

111
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,010
the Egyptian empire, when they, when
people conquered other people's,

112
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,900
often all they wanted was tribute.

113
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,200
They just wanted taxes and and food
and money and that sort of thing.

114
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,170
They didn't really care about turning
those people into Egyptians are into a

115
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,570
Syrians but,

116
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,450
and Alexander didn't really care that
much about the lower class are doing that,

117
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:41,990
but he still wanted the elites and so he
would plant Greek cities and settle his

118
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,720
veterans in different parts of his empire.
In Egypt,

119
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,320
in Syria all the way over and
sometimes in the western part of India.

120
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,790
And he would take his veterans of his
army and he would drum them out of the

121
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,720
army when they retired and he would give
them land and that build a city there.

122
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,900
And that city would be just like a Greek
city back home and they all would speak

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,640
what developed to be a
common form of Greek,

124
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,100
slightly different from classical Greek.

125
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,840
And we call that coin a Greek and Koine
a is just a Greek word that means common

126
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,943
or shared.

127
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,120
So the Bible is actually written in
Koine Greek because this was the form of

128
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:22,430
Greek that had become spread
around the eastern Mediterranean.

129
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,730
By the time the Hebrew scriptures were
translated themselves and by the time the

130
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,560
new testament writings
where themselves written

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,780
the Greek Polis,
which is simply the Greek word for city,

132
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,560
had several institutions that are very
important and will become important for

133
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:39,620
early Christianity and for Judaism. So
you need to know what some of those are.

134
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,800
The Polis itself is just
a Greek word for city,

135
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,040
but you can't think of this as
in huge cities like we have now.

136
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,250
What they would call a polis might only
be 1000 citizens are 5,000 so it wasn't

137
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:54,140
like millions of people.
It wasn't nearly as big as Rome,

138
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:57,660
which would be consist of a
million inhabitants fairly
quickly around this time.

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,370
The Polis, that's plural for
Greek city, the Polis, the the is,

140
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,320
they were much smaller than that,

141
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,770
but they would have several things
[inaudible] the city of the center,

142
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,830
the town would be the center of this, and
that's where the institutions would be.

143
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,910
That's where the government would be.

144
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,970
That's where the different buildings
would be that I'm gonna explain later.

145
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,560
But it also, the Polis also included the
surrounding farm land and the villages.

146
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,730
So Athens was the Polis for Attica,
but Attica.

147
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,180
But it was also the Polos for all of
Attica, all that region around Athens,

148
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,790
including villages and farms
and other small towns too.

149
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,430
So there was a rural dependency
on these Greek cities.

150
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,710
They all practice a certain kind of Greek
education. The Greek word [inaudible],

151
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,560
which is right there on your
handout means education.

152
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:47,490
But it also means more than simply rote
learning or memorization or running to

153
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,260
read.
Like we think Pi Day as the Greek word,

154
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,480
that means the formation of the young man.

155
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,400
And I say young men because
PR throughout all this,

156
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,440
it was mainly young men and boys who
are educated girls could be given some

157
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,530
education if their families
were wealthy enough, but the,

158
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,680
the city's didn't really concern
themselves so much with girls education.

159
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,730
Their family might,

160
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,580
but the city's concerned themselves
with the education of their boys.

161
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,730
So paideia referred to the education
of the young man, both mentally and,

162
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,700
but militarily.

163
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:18,270
So you were taught to fight and culturally
you might be taught other things

164
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:21,600
about culture. You might even have some
music training or something like that.

165
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,890
The place where this took
place was the goon nauseum.

166
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,120
Now the gym a good nauseum doesn't
mean what it means to us in English.

167
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,120
The gymnasium like Payne
Whitney over there, uh,

168
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,540
it actually comes from the
Greek word for naked goodness.

169
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,070
And the reason it was called the naked
place is because of course young Greek

170
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:45,060
men always exercised in the nude
and played sports in the nude.

171
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,460
And so this is where you did it.
So what,

172
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:50,880
where where you do this that that
can be called the naked place,

173
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,714
the goon nauseum.

174
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,600
But this also became the place where
you do other kinds of learning.

175
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,940
So if you were pro, if you were
learning rhetoric, for example,

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,940
you might practice giving
speeches at the goop nauseum,

177
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,390
but also men in town would just kind of
gathered that it was kind of the place

178
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,840
where men gathered and they'd gone to
school the same place you would meet your

179
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,470
friends.

180
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,610
You might play some games you might play
like checkers and these kinds of bones,

181
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,330
bone knuckle bones games that you can
still see if you travel around in Greek

182
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,040
cities throughout the the
ancient Mediterranean,

183
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,080
you can see where they've carved a
little game boards into flagstones of

184
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,450
different temples or
buildings in Greek cities.

185
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,550
So this would all take
place in the goon nauseum.

186
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,140
You also had what they call the
[inaudible]. When you were a young boy,

187
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,870
you would've studied just
reading and writing homer.

188
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,100
When you got to be about the
age of what you guys are here,

189
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,170
you might enter the f debate,

190
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,030
you have to become an [inaudible] and
that just meant that you were pasture sort

191
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:48,570
of early secondary training and now
you were being really in trying to be a

192
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,680
warrior and a citizen.

193
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,010
So the a where those boys who are between
age of maybe 16 or 17 and 20 or 22 you

194
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,530
would be, you had marched
together in a parade in town,

195
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,890
you would go on military training
perhaps together you would also engage in

196
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:06,580
sports together and you would develop
a camaraderie because you are expected

197
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:10,450
then to be the fighting force
for your city, your city state.

198
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,440
So the f abate or the FMLA
was this institution that
every boy had to go through

199
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,530
in order then to be a full
citizen of the city. You are,

200
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,160
y'all had had these political
structures that are in your handout.

201
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,590
The first political structure is the
demas. Demas just means the people.

202
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,610
It's just the Greek word for the people.
But it actually referred more, uh,

203
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,140
in politically to all of the male
citizens and in Greek cities.

204
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,200
By tradition,
only men were citizens of the city.

205
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,070
This will change in Rome because
it Rome women were citizens also,

206
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,980
although that didn't mean they were
equal to men. But in Greek cities,

207
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,200
men were citizens and
women weren't citizens.

208
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,470
But with the revolution
of democracy in Athens,

209
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,720
which also spread them
to other Greek cities,

210
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,670
partly because Athens did what
George Bush tried to do in Iraq,

211
00:12:58,671 --> 00:12:59,500
he tried to force,

212
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,830
they tried to force democracy on
other Greek cities around the eastern

213
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:03,820
Mediterranean also.

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,870
So democracies in Assam sort existed in
different places and ended up democracy.

215
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:12,871
The demas meant all the men of a adult
citizenship that is excluded people,

216
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,950
men who lived there from who came from
elsewhere. It excluded foreigners.

217
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,900
It excluded some laborers and excluded
slaves and excluded women that all the

218
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,900
men who are citizens, uh, had a vote.

219
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,010
And the Deimos referred to that
political body of voting men.

220
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,450
Now that democracy's
collapsed obviously later.

221
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,930
And Philip Have Mattson on an
Alexander did not promote democracies,

222
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,640
but they kept this idea that the demos
that is the adult citizen males of a city,

223
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,830
we're a political body.
And that's when,

224
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,150
if you had everybody come to the theater
for a, a big debate about something,

225
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,240
you could still have people voting on
certain things that the city might decide

226
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,150
to do. Although they couldn't rule
themselves completely by themselves.

227
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,260
Then you had a smaller council
that might be 50 people.

228
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,250
It varied the size according to the city.
The council is called the Boulay,

229
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,170
which is also in your handout.
And that referred to a cow,

230
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,870
a smaller council of older men usually
who made decisions that they then would

231
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,410
put before the whole, uh, the
demos, the whole bowling population.

232
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,960
And then you had the
term called the Ekklesia,

233
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,520
which is on your handout that really
did refer to the voting body of the

234
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:26,500
citizens or the gathering of the
gathered, uh, citizens together.

235
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,380
The EKKLESIA is a Greek word,

236
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,040
just means the calling out Ekklesia
therefore is what you would call it,

237
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,300
the assembly,
the Greek,

238
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,170
the at the Athenian Assembly who would
debate things in vote on things that the

239
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:41,740
Boulay the council would put forward for
a debate or a vote that was called the

240
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:42,550
Ekklesia.

241
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,440
This is very important because Zima
Ekklesia then in our Bible gets translated

242
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:51,060
as ecclesiastics does, but it's,

243
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,020
it's called Ecclesiastes these
because that means the preacher.

244
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,990
That's the translation from the Hebrew
word, the preacher Kohala for that book.

245
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,420
Uh,
so Ecclesiastes is means the preacher,

246
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,270
but Achilles Ekklesia is
the term for the church.

247
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,140
So this'll be odd and we'd
get to early Christian groups.

248
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,070
Why did these early Christian groups
decided to call themselves the town

249
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,180
assembly? Cause that's
the, about that time.

250
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,220
That's the basic meaning
of this term Ekklesia.

251
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,060
And then you have other social structures
of any city. State. For example,

252
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:23,540
you have a theater. The theater was a
place where you had performances by,

253
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,030
by the first century when
Christianity was coming around,

254
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,840
it was not so much the place where you
go to see necessarily high literal hi

255
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:33,710
theater. Like, like, um,
you know, Solomon or uh, uh,

256
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,920
I can't you rip a ds
or something like that.

257
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,510
What you would often do is go see he
farces or comedies or sometimes that the

258
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:46,280
Romans like to take a big theater and
fill the, the central part of the theater,

259
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,090
the coffee with water and in
stage naval battles, you know,

260
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:50,721
and that kind of thing.

261
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,270
So people have all kinds of
entertainments in the theater,

262
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,220
but it was also where often the demo,
so the Ekklesia would meet to have,

263
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,540
uh, meetings and Holler at each other and
have big debates. So the Ekklesia was,

264
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,620
was this city place and it would often
meet in the theater. You also had games.

265
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,220
So, uh, you had gum, the gum nauseum
where games would take place.

266
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,010
But also you had the hippodrome,
which is in Greek,

267
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:15,380
which basically just means
the horse running place.

268
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,360
This is when you have this big track.

269
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,860
If you have wandered around different
Greek cities, uh, that are dug up,

270
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,130
some of them will have the hippodrome
there and you can see how huge they were.

271
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:28,040
They had a huge stance and it was sort
of like a football stadium except it was

272
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,130
longer and narrower than what
our football stadium would be.

273
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,230
But it has rows of seats like that usually
made that over a hill or dug into the

274
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:40,160
ground in some way. And the hippodrome,
which becomes the circus in Latin,

275
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,460
that's just the Latin translation
of hippodrome. Cause there is,

276
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:47,360
you'll see Romans started adopting
a lot of these were originally Greek

277
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:50,000
institutions into their society also.

278
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,530
So the hippodrome is the circus in
Latin and eventually for the Romans this

279
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,510
would be very popular
for big chariot races.

280
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,460
That's the big thing for the Romans later.

281
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,920
And you'll also have bads that is public
places sometimes where only men could

282
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:07,400
go or sometimes women could
go or sometimes they would
be mixed in some places

283
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,330
or sometimes amount have men one day,
women at the time and mixed rounds.

284
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,910
Other Times. So different cities
had their bags differently.

285
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,860
But the bath would be a place where at
least especially the men would go after

286
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:21,410
they'd been working out in the
gymnasium and you go and you know,

287
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,880
this is where the public toilets were to.

288
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:26,130
If you can't wander around any Greek
city or Roman city of the ancient world

289
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:28,610
without seeing the latrine,
you can always find the latrine.

290
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,340
And they always had latrines
and Baz and you'd have the,

291
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,250
the cold room where you have cold water,
you'd have the tepid room.

292
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,240
We have kind of lukewarm water
and you'd have the hot room.

293
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,940
We didn't have hot water.
So this is where you go to relax,

294
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,180
to make a business deal, to
meet your friends, to chat,

295
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,480
to try to have sex, try to
meet somebody. You know,

296
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:49,410
all kinds of things go on in these bads.

297
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,060
But those basic structures are part of
any kind of Greek city in the ancient

298
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:57,960
world. And what Alexander
and his successors did was
they took that basic Greek

299
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:02,520
structure and they transplanted it
all over the eastern Mediterranean,

300
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,360
whether they were in Egypt or Syria
or Asia minor, Ernie place cells,

301
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,510
which is why you can travel right now to
Turkey or Syria or Israel or Jordan are

302
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,110
Egypt and you can see
excavations of towns.

303
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,320
And it's remarkable how they all look so
much alike because they're all inspired

304
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:26,670
by this originally Greek model
of the city, the next really.

305
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,000
So that's one of the most important things
about Alexander and his successors is

306
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,090
they hellenized the entire
eastern Mediterranean.

307
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,140
And that meant every major city would have
a certain commonality to it. It would,

308
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,870
it would have a certain coin a to it
that is a Greek overlay over what may be

309
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,290
also be there. The original indigenous
kind of cultures and languages.

310
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,540
The other thing you have is religious
syncretism. And I didn't put that down.

311
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,400
So just in case

312
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,490
the Greek word
soon crisis

313
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,540
means the mixing to a mixing together.

314
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,040
When Alexander gets to Persia,
unless side,

315
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,350
when he gets to Egypt,

316
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,930
he knows that there is this God isis, this
female got isis. That's very important.

317
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:21,300
You see statues of her all over the place.
Well,

318
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:24,510
Alexander just followed a customer that
had been taught by philosophy and other

319
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,750
kinds of things that, oh well
they worship Isis, but you know,

320
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,570
isis is sort of like a Artemis.

321
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,580
So sometimes you'd see they'd make statues
of isis look like statues of Artemis

322
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:40,170
back home. Artemis is the
Greek goddess of you might know

323
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,503
the hunt.

324
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,930
See all you guys really know your Greek
and Roman mythology that shows that you

325
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,560
did well on your sats.
I bet.

326
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,700
Then so we'll talk a bit about
what that means, but the,

327
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,900
with the different Gods and goddesses and
how you learned all this in mythology,

328
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,140
mythological courses in English in high
school, but we'll get back to that.

329
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,190
But the artist is the goddess of the
hunt. So these grease would say, well,

330
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,540
we have another goddess of the hunt,

331
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,830
and you'd find other goddesses of the
hunt or when they'd get to Jerusalem,

332
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,190
they see, oh, these people worship
Yahweh. Well, that's just Zeus.

333
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,710
That's just another, this is another
name presumes it's the same God.

334
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,060
They just have a different name for it.

335
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,680
Alexander took this tendency of
syncretism of mixing together different

336
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:23,280
religious traditions from different
places and he used it as a self conscious

337
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,110
propaganda technique.
He,

338
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:28,710
I haven't identified himself because
he started claiming divine status for

339
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:29,340
himself.

340
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,370
He went around passing out rumors that
his mother had actually been impregnated

341
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:35,310
by the god Apollo when he
appeared as a snake in her bed.

342
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,360
So Alexander is putting
himself forward as divine. Why?

343
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,650
This is not a Greek tradition,

344
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,090
but it's very much a tradition in the
east for for kings to be considered by

345
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:49,210
their people to be God's Alexander
says, well, if they can be God's,

346
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:52,390
that can be a god. So we start spreading
rumors that he is divine himself.

347
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:53,350
He probably hadn't believed it.

348
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,810
I don't think he necessarily lied about
it and probably believed that he was

349
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:58,390
divine and was,
and so he had a,

350
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,190
a godfather had a human mother and so
then he would identify himself with

351
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:05,440
whoever was a god in the different places.

352
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,160
So he would identify himself as
a Greek God with the Persian God.

353
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,060
He would identify the goddess Isis
with some Greek Greek goddess.

354
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,650
And so all the time these,

355
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:19,540
these different gods from different places
where basically all said to be simply

356
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,360
different cultural representations,

357
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,500
different names for what we're generally
the same gods all over the place.

358
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,960
Also though, what they would do
is sometimes they wouldn't try.

359
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,790
It has simply say these gods are the same.

360
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,610
What they would just as add
on more gods than just say,

361
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,540
oh well we've got to Egypt.

362
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,700
We found out there are a whole
lot more gods than we knew about,

363
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,660
or we get to Syria and look at all these
gods that the Syrians worship. Well,

364
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:43,960
we'll just add those into
our pantheon of gods too.

365
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,130
And this is part of what ancient
religion was like is that people were not

366
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:49,030
exclusive.
This,

367
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,510
you didn't have to worry bitch cause
you worship one God doesn't mean you

368
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,060
couldn't worship another God or several
guides or five guys are a hundred gods.

369
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,200
Gods knew that everybody was, they weren't
particularly jealous in that sense.

370
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,790
So this is the way people did.

371
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,410
But what Alexander and his successors
did was they made a sort of a conscious

372
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:10,300
propagandistic decision to use religious
syncretism to bind together their

373
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,134
kingdoms.

374
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,800
Now this will become a problem obviously
when we talk about Judaism because Jews

375
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,090
that the,
the Greek rulers,

376
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,830
we're trying to do the same thing with
Jewish gods and Jewish figures as they

377
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:24,550
had elsewhere.

378
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,400
And some Jews would go along with
this and some Jews would resist it.

379
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,741
The Romans,

380
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,650
when they came on the scene in the east
and they gradually became more and more

381
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:37,360
powerful, they destroyed Corinth
and a big battle in one 44 BCE,

382
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,020
Pompei was the drum in general who
took over Jerusalem and 63 BCE.

383
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,680
So the Romans were in charge
of Judea from 63 BCE on.

384
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,720
And this is very important because the
Romans, as their power grew in the east,

385
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,850
they simply moved increasingly into the
eastern Mediterranean and they adopted

386
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,310
the whole Greek system,
the Greek world.

387
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:02,080
And they didn't even try
to make it non Greek.

388
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,980
So Romans didn't go around trying to get
people in the east to speak Latin. Uh,

389
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:11,230
they, they might put up as an official
inscription in an eastern city in Latin,

390
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,420
but that almost always,
if it was official inscription,

391
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:17,050
it would also be listed in Greek.
So Romans who ruled in the east,

392
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:18,280
we're expected to speak Greek.

393
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:22,330
And by this time all educated Roman men
were expected to be able to speak Greek.

394
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,830
Well if possible.

395
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,050
So the Romans didn't try to make the
east Roman in that sense, culturally,

396
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,730
nor they tried to change the language.
Greek language,

397
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,200
culture and religions Grieco
different religions and is syncretism,

398
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,780
Greek education,
the polar structure.

399
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,620
All of these things remained in the
east throughout the Roman rule of east,

400
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,040
all the way up until the time
you had had a Christian, uh,

401
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,810
emperor with Constantine and later.

402
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,000
But there's one thing that the Romans
made even more of a that then the Greeks

403
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,850
had made of,
and this is the patron client structure.

404
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,840
This is a bit more of a distinctly Roman
institution, even a legal institution,

405
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,440
but it's important for understanding
both the Roman Empire as well as early

406
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,780
Christianity and its
patron client relations.

407
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,530
The household structure of
a Roman household was this,

408
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,150
and I say household
because our word family,

409
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,170
which we usually take to mean the
biological family, the father, the mother,

410
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,140
the children, maybe the grandchildren
made the extended family,

411
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,180
but we usually mean by it.
The immediate,

412
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:34,210
the the nuclear family with some extension
that use of the English word family,

413
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:38,540
although it comes from the Latin familiar
means something totally different.

414
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,230
In Latin,

415
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,970
the Latin word familiar didn't mean that
biological kin group it actually was

416
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:46,790
originally used for are the slow,
the slaves of a household,

417
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,840
the slaves and the freed persons of a
Roman household where are legally the ones

418
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:55,210
who are the familiar but so
when I say family we, we tie it.

419
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,490
We try to avoid even talking about the
Roman family because it means something

420
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:02,700
so different to them than
what it means to us. What,

421
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,320
so I'll tend to talk about the Roman
household because that's what's more

422
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:09,560
meaningful. Uh, sociologically,
when we talk about this,

423
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,600
the Roman household was constructed like
a pyramid. Imagine this is a pyramid,

424
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:19,460
not a triangle. At the top of
it is the head of the household,

425
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,323
the man,

426
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,320
the potter,

427
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,770
Familias and increasingly likely see
this Whitten and the New York Times.

428
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:32,950
Or you can use Bible in politics,
but it comes from the Latin who,

429
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,750
and it referred to the
head of the household.

430
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,560
Patera father familias is the household,
the family,

431
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,080
the potter. Familiars is the
oldest man of the household.

432
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,620
Under him is his sons.

433
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,210
Yes,

434
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,170
his daughters.

435
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,020
And then at the bottom are his slaves.

436
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,310
And here are his freedmen freed persons.

437
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,900
Yeah.

438
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,900
And then also you consider us in some
ways free people who are may exist as

439
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:12,894
clients,

440
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:18,290
but legally the word client in Latin
refers to the freed slaves of a potter.

441
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,544
Familias.

442
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,953
Now,

443
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,350
where's the wife in this picture?

444
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,620
Notice I didn't put the wife and
the mother in there. Why is that?

445
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,420
Because legally she's actually
not part of this man's household.

446
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:42,810
She remains part of the household of
her father and she's legally under the

447
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,720
control of her father probably or her
brothers and her father is dead or her

448
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,780
grandfather, if her grandfather is
still alive. But since life expectancy,

449
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,490
the ancient world was
much less than hours.

450
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,240
You didn't have usually
several generations in these
households because older

451
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,074
people just died.

452
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,550
The wife though is legally a part
of her own household over here.

453
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,520
Why did the Romans do that?
That's very different from the Greeks.

454
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:07,020
Very different from other people.
The ancient Mediterranean.

455
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,910
Why did they want to make sure that the
the daughters stayed in the households

456
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
of their fathers.

457
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,940
They did this because they didn't want
the upper class in Rome who are the

458
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,040
elite.

459
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,670
They didn't want any one household or
any small group of households to become

460
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:28,200
too powerful and if you have women
marrying off into other families and then

461
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:29,430
they leave that there,

462
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,210
the household of their fathers and they
are officially illegally of households.

463
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:34,110
My else that's,

464
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,060
that may end up increasing
those households that have
intermarriage coming in

465
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:43,440
and not so much into marriage going out
by keeping women under the household of

466
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:43,830
there,

467
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,210
the men of their original family that
the upperclass rooms tried to balance

468
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,940
these different households
in size and importance.

469
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,530
They didn't care about the lower class.
Really.

470
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,430
The lower class didn't really count much
what they cared about because Roman,

471
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,440
the Roman republic by this time was
basically a bunch of very important

472
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,170
households,
wealthy men and their households,

473
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,560
and they were the members of the Senate.
They were the night class.

474
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,620
They weren't people who ran Rome,
so they,

475
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,950
they didn't want one king to arise and
they didn't want a small coterie of

476
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:14,820
leaders to arise.

477
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,600
They wanted there to be some kind of
balance of power among the several major

478
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,940
households of Rome,
the families of Rome.

479
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,280
Now slaves obviously are in the potter
familias when a slave is freed and in the

480
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:27,480
ancient world in Roman par,

481
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,170
most slaves were eventually freed
unless they just die. Before long,

482
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,070
they became a freed man.
They didn't become a free man.

483
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,490
It became a freed man and
that was legally different.

484
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:41,700
So there's the status of
slave was Lois freed persons,

485
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,030
was Nixon highest in Roman
law and free people were next.

486
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,280
But even though they became freed,

487
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,660
they were still considered a member of
this guy's household as his client and

488
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:55,560
his Friedman. And they owe certain duties
to him. For example, they might, uh,

489
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,370
a familiar,
would often put a slave up in business,

490
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,150
give us a slave as enough money to have
to run a business and that the slave

491
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:05,640
could keep a lot of the income
from that business for himself.

492
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,720
And the slave could actually gather
together a bit of money for himself.

493
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:11,340
He couldn't legally own the money.

494
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,150
His master legally owned everything
that slave owned, but practically,

495
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,030
and in some legal contexts, what they
would do is they allow the slave,

496
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,810
the use of that money and
that's called the peculiar them.

497
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,470
Now when the slave is freed by the owner,

498
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,670
the slave could take the peculiar them
with him and then he can set up his own

499
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:33,300
business.

500
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,110
But he'd still be a client of the owner
because he's still officially part of

501
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:41,950
his household. So this
maintained even when, and why
would a person free of slave?

502
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,520
Well, if you have a sleigh that
slave can't actually sign contracts,

503
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,260
the sleigh might be your business manager,

504
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,730
but all of a slave could
do with the paperwork.

505
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,570
But if you need a sleigh representing
your business and you live in Rome and you

506
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:54,970
need somebody in Ostia,
the port city of Rome,

507
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,400
to be able to be there and
watch your inch, your inputs,

508
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,430
and your exports of your business,
you need someone who can sign contracts,

509
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,550
who can lend money, who can borrow
money, who can do things like that.

510
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,520
Slaves can't do that legally,
but Friedman can.

511
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,300
So rich Romans were often freeing
slaves and for their own purposes,

512
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:15,340
it was not like they were giving
them a great deal. This was part of,

513
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:19,510
they're constructing their own
business expansion, sons and daughters,

514
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:22,000
though we're still part of the household.

515
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,830
As long as the potter Familias was alive,

516
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,540
so son's legally was done
in their pop formula.

517
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,250
Now this is all legally and
officially was the case.

518
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,040
You wouldn't really see this
working all like this. For example,

519
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,830
I said wives were not really part of
their husbands household. Uh, legally.

520
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:37,511
That's correct.

521
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:41,590
But you see cases in letters and and all
kinds of stuff from the ancient world

522
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,610
that women actually did were more
unofficially part of their husbands house.

523
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,320
They ran it when he was away.
For example,

524
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,650
they told his slave she might have
her own slaves and her own property.

525
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,160
The wife had her own property that was
separate from the husband's property,

526
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,130
but in practical purposes,
most of the time they didn't.

527
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,570
They just mix these together and they
might use different things. So the,

528
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:04,540
the legal situation was set up to try to
keep the wives ownership and as part of

529
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,040
her a different family.

530
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,000
And so her money didn't go to her
husband and his money didn't go to her.

531
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,240
But this was a legal situation to try
to keep this balance of power among

532
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:17,110
households. Practically sons didn't all
live in the same place with their father.

533
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:20,320
They would get married and move off
to an apartment or some place down the

534
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:23,440
street or to another city.
But this is the legal situation.

535
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,580
Now when you go to jail,
I mean when you go to court,

536
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,170
slaves of course can't represent
themselves in court at all. They're not.

537
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,050
You don't have any legal standing,
but if you're a freed man, you're,

538
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,180
the other thing I should tell
you is that in Roman law,

539
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,510
if you're a manumitted as a slave,
you're made free.

540
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,800
If you're mandated in the normal way they
did it. That makes you a Roman citizen.

541
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,680
If your owner was a Roman citizen,
notice what this means.

542
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,810
Only the Roman Empire could
slavery actually start
being away that you can move

543
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:57,280
up in society because you could. If
you are a talented slave, your owner,

544
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,800
Mike Free, you probably would
for you when he freed you.

545
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:03,490
If he was a Roman citizen, you would
automatically become a Roman citizen also,

546
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,230
and your children would be Roman citizens
and although you are a freed man,

547
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:09,910
which was lower in
status in a free person,

548
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,680
there was something
privileges you couldn't have.

549
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,120
Your children would be if they were born
after you had been freed would be free

550
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,200
people not fried.
So within a couple of generations,

551
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,210
people could move up from being the lowest
slaves to two generations being free

552
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,050
Roman citizens.

553
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,120
So Roman slavery and freedom of that was
actually one way that a few people in

554
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:34,510
the ancient world recognized
some kind of social mobility,

555
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:37,030
which was very rare in
the in the Roman Empire.

556
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,950
Any questions about any of that?
Now,

557
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:45,140
why is this important for
the rest of this stuff?

558
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,110
This will be a very important cause,
a Christian,

559
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:52,040
how Christians charted out his house,
churches and their house churches fit.

560
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,190
Sometimes the model of a
Greek Ekklesia an assembly,

561
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,470
but sometimes the model
of the Roman household.

562
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,190
And so this household structure becomes
very important for the growth and

563
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:04,370
structure and even the theology
of Christianity eventually.

564
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,110
This is also important though for Roman
politics because if you're a free man or

565
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,280
even if you're a free person,

566
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:14,540
sometimes see free men would connect
themselves to have powerful Roman who is

567
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:18,140
higher status than them because they
could use him for, for important things.

568
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:18,740
For example,

569
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,980
say you want to take a your neighbor
to court cause your neighbor's starting

570
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:26,000
impinging on your land. Well if you're
of lower status, lower social status,

571
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,350
the judge is gonna look at you say,
you know, come on, you're poor,

572
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,370
your neighbor's rich.

573
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,820
I'm going to side for the neighbor
because Roman legal structures and even

574
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,870
citizen Roman laws.

575
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,450
If you're a judge and you have a rich
man and a poor man in your court,

576
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,040
of course you're going to decide for the
rich man because the poor man is has,

577
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,570
has incentive to cheat. He's poor,
but the Richmond already has money.

578
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:50,960
He doesn't have any incentive to cheat.
That's their logic.

579
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,581
But so,

580
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:56,720
so Roman legal system was really geared
toward the wealthy and the people of

581
00:33:56,721 --> 00:34:01,610
high status that for that reason,
if you want it to win a court case,

582
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,370
it helped or have somebody
represent you in politics talking.

583
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,070
It helped to have strong patrons.

584
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,520
So you'd have a patron who would be
higher class, richer, more powerful,

585
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:14,540
have some political power and you will
be loyal to your patron and your patron

586
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:18,440
within represent you in court. Try to get
you jobs, try to get you more business,

587
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,280
do all the kinds of things that
patrons do for their clients. Also,

588
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:25,790
if your patron wanted to
run for us a city office,

589
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,570
your patron would expect you
to be loyal and vote for him.

590
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,840
So lower class people.
Now what happens though,

591
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,790
when you have see the, your clients,
your Friedman, your sons, your daughters,

592
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:41,600
all of these are part of this pyramid
structure and they all benefit from a

593
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:45,000
strong potter familias and he'd benefits
by having a strong household and the

594
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:48,980
large house sold. But most of the free
citizens of the Roman Empire there,

595
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
all of Rome were poor people,
free and even citizens,

596
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:56,360
but they were poor people who
weren't part of any rich household.

597
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,040
So what do you have with
all these other people,

598
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:02,840
these other Romans around here who don't
have a powerful patron who don't have a

599
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,520
powerful Petrocelli's to help them out?

600
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,960
This is where Julius Caesar was
quite the genius. Julius Caesar

601
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:19,270
in came from a patrician family that
is a family of an aristocratic family.

602
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,430
But he started signing with a
party in Rome called the Polaris,

603
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,300
and I think this is on your
handout, correct? The Roman city,

604
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,920
the Roman Senate in the late part of the
republic. Yeah. Started dividing itself.

605
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,560
Two sort of parties, not
official parties. The factions,

606
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,060
the Optima test meaning the
best tended to the support,

607
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:50,061
the interests of the wealthy senators
and the few wealthiest families.

608
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,160
The papilla rs started representing the
interests of everybody else in Rome.

609
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,810
There that popularity has comes
from the work hard. The people,

610
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,100
Julius Caesar was from one of these
aristocratic patrician families,

611
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,380
although he didn't have a lot,
his family didn't have a lot of money.

612
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,570
They weren't really,
really wealthy, but he had,

613
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,490
he had great birth and so he started
getting more power politically and

614
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:16,050
financially by setting himself up
as the patron of the patron list.

615
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,650
They also it the general's ran their
armies this way, so Julius Caesar in our,

616
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,350
if you are really going to be important
in Rome, you had to serve as a general.

617
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,184
At some point,

618
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,410
Julius Caesar capitalized on his
role as a general of a large army.

619
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:34,200
That was at the time, uh,
winning battles in Gaul,

620
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,750
the modern France one.

621
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,530
One example about this is how
Julius Caesar was the patron,

622
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,320
the fo potter familias
in a sense of his army,

623
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:47,850
his soldiers is that one time the Senate
who had got a nervous about Julius is

624
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:52,470
growth in popularity in power.
They wanted to take some legions,

625
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:57,240
some Roman legions away from Julius
Caesar in Gaul and send them to another

626
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,320
general in Syria.

627
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,980
The reason they did this because they
wanted to take some of Julius has power

628
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,100
away. They was, he was, they were afraid
he was going to set himself as a dictator,

629
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,040
which of course he did.
Uh,

630
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,660
so they took these root Roman legions
away and this end to the Syria,

631
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,470
when they left Julius Caesar
out of his own pocket,

632
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,950
gave every soldier in
those legions a year's pay.

633
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,450
This is what patrons do.
You see,

634
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,660
he bought the loyalty of his soldiers
when they were being taken out of his

635
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:26,594
control.

636
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,830
This is the patron client structure
at work in the Roman army.

637
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,700
Julius also then set himself up in the
city when he started gaining more power

638
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,730
in Rome. Uh, actually he gained power
in Rome, mainly by military might, uh,

639
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,500
by kind of making the senate
nervous and winning a few battles.

640
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,450
And that was against the law.

641
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,090
It was against the law for Julius
Caesar to do that, but he did it anyway.

642
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,920
He tried to consolidate his power
though by putting forth policies that

643
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:58,970
moderately help the lower classes. He
didn't cancel taxes for a canceled debts,

644
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,640
but he mitigated debts. He, uh, you know,

645
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,400
ease some of the strains on the poor.

646
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,740
He was assassinated by conservative
Senate forces, you know,

647
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:14,720
Brutus and Cassius and others on
the ides of March, as you all know,

648
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:17,370
March 15th,
44 BCE,

649
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,690
he had adopted another Roman Octavian
and Julius Caesar's adopted son Octavian

650
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,030
then formed an alliance with Mark Anthony,
who had been,

651
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:32,810
Julia sees his friend and a
lesser known figure named Lapidus,

652
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,620
whom you don't really need
to remember because the end,

653
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:40,621
it turned out that Mark Antony and
Octavian fought a civil war Octavian one

654
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,220
and Octavian defeated Mark Antony.
And by this time, our candidate,

655
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,420
he had palled up with Cleopatra,
queen of Egypt,

656
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,150
and Octavian beat both of them and he
became the sole ruler of the empire.

657
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,310
In 27 BCE,

658
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,010
he refused the title of King and he
took the traditional Republican titles.

659
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,590
One of his propagandists
said this about him.

660
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,270
The pristine form of the republic
was recalled as of old or Augustus.

661
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,970
He had taken the title Augustus by
this time, which means the great,

662
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,010
he's himself said,

663
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,480
I transferred the republic from my power
to the dominion of the Senate and the

664
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:27,190
people of Rome. In other words, in his
propaganda, Augustus basically said,

665
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:30,730
I'm not a king.
I'm just another senator and I'm trying.

666
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:34,330
I'm giving the Senate and the
people all their power back, a lie.

667
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,460
All lies. See, allying in government
didn't start with our government.

668
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,640
So Augustus actually reconstituted the
Senate and it was just that a Senate

669
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,590
reconstituted by the emperor.

670
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,490
He became more and more the
patron of all the people,

671
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,090
and this is why the emperor would
forever them try to present himself.

672
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,110
He and his family.

673
00:39:56,111 --> 00:40:01,111
The emperor's family was in a sense the
patron for the whole people of the Roman

674
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,370
Empire, at least for all the Romans, the
potter familias of the entire empire.

675
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,150
This led to what we famously
called the Pax Romana,

676
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,800
the Roman peace,
because he had the end of long,

677
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:18,550
hundreds of years of civil wars and
other wars, at least within Rome itself,

678
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,670
there were always battles and wars
going on in the, on the boundaries,

679
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:25,900
the frontiers of the Roman Empire. But,
uh, within the, the SINFONIETTA entire,

680
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,810
there was a, an amazing period of
peace. Most people saw this piece. Uh,

681
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,440
many people in history say it is good.

682
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,770
It's debatable whether it
was good for everybody,

683
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,300
non Romans and poor people may have seen
the Pax Romana as more oppressive than

684
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:47,020
a liberation,
just like people saw the pox Americana.

685
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,573
Uh,

686
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,180
that way after the collapse of the Soviet
Union before the beginning of the Iraq

687
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:53,014
war,

688
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,240
the Romans maintain piece for one thing
by leaving local population's pretty

689
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,310
much alone when it came to local customs,

690
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,270
religions and living arrangements
when they thought it was necessary.

691
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,980
They maintained piece by
destroying communities and
forcibly moving populations.

692
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:12,580
But they tried to do that only when they
needed to do so to keep their absolute

693
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:15,670
control.
The Romans prospered by taxation.

694
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,330
They did held censuses, not universal
ones as mentioned in the Bible,

695
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:23,500
but that local censuses in order
to keep taxes high and fully paid,

696
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,491
but they didn't.

697
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:27,280
The Romans themselves didn't want to
be bothered with collecting taxes.

698
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,480
So they would have local
sort of higher class.

699
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:35,660
Local elites would for the
right to collect local taxes.

700
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,420
And so the Romans would take
the highest bid. In other words,

701
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:40,700
I would say if I'm a rich,
wealthy person in corn, I'll say,

702
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,080
I'll be the local tax collector and
I'll guarantee you I'll send around this

703
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:46,280
amount of money per year.

704
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,120
Of course the Romans didn't care
then how much I charged you,

705
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,070
the people of Corinth,
and it's a area,

706
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:54,740
actually the city of Corinth wouldn't
have been taxed because it was a Roman

707
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:55,340
colony.

708
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,230
And one of the benefits of being a room
in college that you ended up paying

709
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,510
taxes, or at least the citizens
that didn't have to pay taxes.

710
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,950
But the people in the outlying villages
and towns and farms and everything,

711
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:05,240
we pay taxes.
And if I'm the tax collector,

712
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,600
the way I make a profit is by charging
you a lot more than I need just to send

713
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:12,560
to Rome, Romans and care about this.
They just knew it was going to happen.

714
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:13,940
This is the way they
collected their taxes.

715
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,120
This is why the word tax collector is
such a bad word for everybody with the

716
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,500
Romans. Why you see in the,
you'll see in the gospels,

717
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,590
the term tax collectors and sinners.
Why?

718
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:29,060
Because the Jews didn't like the tax
collectors because they were being ripped

719
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:30,380
off by them.
Your hand up.

720
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,510
Well, number one, um, we'll talk
about who the historical Matthew is.

721
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,840
The figure in Matthew, in
the gospel of Matthew, uh,

722
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,390
we don't know much about his
actual history and he just appears,

723
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,970
but when it caused him a tax collector,

724
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:52,940
it doesn't necessarily mean that he was
the one who owned the right for that

725
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:54,620
whole area.
It just means he was,

726
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:58,490
he could have been hired by somebody to
sit at a roadside and collect taxes and

727
00:42:58,491 --> 00:42:59,324
tolls and stuff.

728
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,380
So the word tax collector
didn't necessarily mean
that the person themselves

729
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:08,250
were wealthy, but whoever had
the tax, um, let's things, right,

730
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,050
I'm looking for
franchise.

731
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,880
Whoever had the tax franchise for that
area would be someone from a wealthy

732
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:19,670
background, but then you'd hire
out of the people to do the taxes.

733
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,280
So these people, of course,
were very unpopular.

734
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,980
The Romans maintain peace to a great
extent by keeping the poor poor.

735
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,980
So the Pax Romana may have
sounded great if you are an elite,

736
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,230
but if you're,
we're not in the elite,

737
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,960
it may have seemed more
oppressive than anything.

738
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,570
There were some other benefits
so that the Romans did.

739
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:44,600
They made travel much easier.
They clear it. Pompei paid,

740
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,280
cleared the Mediterranean,
a pirates,

741
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:51,290
which is something that our governments
can't seem to do. They built roads,

742
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,470
maintained some communication
that you had a mail service,

743
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:58,240
although it was for official use only,
but this meant that you could get the,

744
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,430
at least the Roman officials could
get mail delivered fairly quickly.

745
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,420
They use even a horseback relay that
could go a hundred kilometers a day.

746
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:10,160
Soldiers were expected to be able to
travel 30 kilometers per day in full pack,

747
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,750
and that was only possible because besides
using the see the shipping lanes for

748
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:17,270
travel, which was much faster
than overland travel, they,

749
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,860
the Romans maintained roads.

750
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,960
They didn't really care about
roads for everybody else.

751
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,070
They wanted the roads for their army,

752
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,520
just like the US interstate system was
originally created for in case the army

753
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:30,530
needed to be moved across the country
very quickly if the Soviets attacked.

754
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,450
So this is the same way with the Romans.
They built roads for the army,

755
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,190
but of course other
people use the roads too.

756
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,810
This was why Christianity and other things
where we're able to spread so easily.

757
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,520
Why Paul was able to
travel around the empire.

758
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,400
He would prefer to go by sea if
possible because as much quicker,

759
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,540
but at least he could travel on the
roads that the Romans built and maintain.

760
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,790
As far as religion,
urban talks about this in your textbook,

761
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:55,080
so I won't go into a
lot of um, uh, detail,

762
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,370
but the common Hollywood idea that the
Romans were kind of oppressive of other

763
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:02,040
religions or the Christians
is just that a Hollywood idea.

764
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,770
The Romans actually were very
tolerant of local religions.

765
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,600
They didn't care what
God's you worshiped there.

766
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,840
Romans are actually very pious in the
sense that they believe that whatever land

767
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:10,674
they were in,

768
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,000
they should provide sacrifices
and honors for the local gods,

769
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,320
especially the important ones.
So the Romans would honor local gods,

770
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,890
other people's Gods. Every people was
allowed to use their own gods. Jews,

771
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:23,580
for example,

772
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,640
by since the time of Julius Caesar who
befriended the Jews because they helped

773
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,520
him out politically a lot, um,
he gave them certain privileges.

774
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:31,680
Jews didn't have to,
they could observe the sabbath.

775
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,750
They didn't have to do things on
the sabbath and they didn't want to,

776
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,620
they didn't have to serve in the army.
Uh,

777
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,010
they got to observe their own religions.

778
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,430
They weren't expected to sacrifice
either to the emperor, to other gods.

779
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,380
So the Romans basically were very tolerant
when they weren't tolerant was when

780
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:51,360
some religious group or club started
looking like they might be rebellious if

781
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:54,000
they started looking like insurrection
would happen. The Romans didn't do it.

782
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,350
So the Romans for example,

783
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:00,410
outlawed volunteer fire departments in
local places because they were afraid

784
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,930
that volunteer fire departments
could be a place where locals,

785
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,500
especially maybe lower class locals could
get together and Start Gossiping about

786
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:10,350
what they could do to cause
trouble for the, the Romans.

787
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,220
So the Romans were only concerned about
religions when it looked like those

788
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:16,680
religions were going to
cause political problems.

789
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,930
As we'll see next time Jews fell into
the system in any different ways.

790
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,780
Sometimes they were relatively
happy clients of the Romans.

791
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,980
Sometimes they were subversive
enemies, other Roman order. As I said,

792
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:30,630
they were officially
recognized by the Romans.

793
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,750
But this caused problems for
Jews sometimes in Alexandria,

794
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,140
the local Egyptian population resenting
the Jews because they were recognized as

795
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:44,661
a legal ethnicity in Alexandria and they
weren't given complete privileges of

796
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:48,870
the Greeks in Alexandria was a Greek city.
So there were a Greek speaking,

797
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,410
maybe people of Greek descent,
but if they fully adopted Greek customs,

798
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,010
they were considered Greeks.
The Jews were not considered Greeks,

799
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:58,200
but at least they were higher
in status in Alexandria,

800
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:00,990
in law then local Egyptians,

801
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,740
the Egyptians were the lowest in the city.

802
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,700
So the local Egyptians resented the
Jews because the Jews were recognized as

803
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,560
their own ethnicity and
given some privileges.

804
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,550
So this is why you sometimes had Jews
getting in trouble with local groups and

805
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:17,400
have violence with Jews in
different places. And sure enough,

806
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,660
pogroms arise in places local people
would, uh, you know, attack the Jews are,

807
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:24,320
the Jews would try to set
up an extra big, uh, uh,

808
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,880
meeting house for themselves and
it would cause local problems.

809
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,520
But these were not problems brought
on by the, these were local problems.

810
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,940
And part of it was precisely because the
Jews had been recognized by the Romans

811
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,110
as having a special status in some
places and this caused some kind of local

812
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:41,410
resentment.
As we'll see though,

813
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,860
the very fact that the Romans had allowed
this one universal empire that had

814
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:52,630
been created by Alexander originally
and with a Greek veneer and they allowed

815
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:53,220
the Latin,

816
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,490
the the west to stay Latin and the east
to stay Greek and they melded these two

817
00:47:57,491 --> 00:47:58,330
different things.

818
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,500
All of this was one of the reasons that
Christianity was able to spread at this

819
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,420
time in the way it didn't.
In fact,

820
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:09,690
you might even think that had had Jesus
come and had Paul lived had they tried

821
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:15,040
to spread this new group,
this new movement at a time,

822
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,280
500 years before this
are 500 years afterwards.

823
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,640
It may not have never happened because
it was precisely because there's one

824
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:26,350
world that run by the Romans and
maintained by the Romans that allowed the

825
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:31,180
spread of Christianity to a great extent,
both ideologically and you know,

826
00:48:31,181 --> 00:48:34,570
thought wise as well as simply physically.
Any questions?

827
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,030
Okay. Time's up. See you. Not
on Monday, but on Wednesday.
