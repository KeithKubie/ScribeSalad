00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This question is about changing the period of a mass oscillating on a spring.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's say you pull this mass back and release it and let it oscillate.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When you do this you measure some period, which we'll call T.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's how long it takes to go forward and backward.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, what if you wanted to double the period?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You want to take twice as long to complete an oscillation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I want to know what size mass should you attach to the spring.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Since I've given you no numbers, this should be in terms of m.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If you think the mass should be half as big, you would enter 0.5 here.

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you think the mass should be 10 times as big, you'd enter a 10 here. Good luck.
