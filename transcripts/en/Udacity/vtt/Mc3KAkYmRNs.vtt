00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.050
So, our portfolio page is looking pretty good.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.320
Especially now that we've got these adorable little kittens here

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.560
that just make me want to sneeze.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm only sneezing because I'm allergic to cats.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.540
I mean I think they're really cute,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.360
but I can't get too close to them without a Zyrtec.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.280
Anyways, so we're in our portfolio and

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.190
it would be awesome if we could say a little bit more about,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.670
you know, what we did here, and what we did here on our app and framework.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.990
But there's not a whole lot of space for

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.740
it, however there is a trick we can use.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500
We can click on it and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.370
bring up a modal which actually has more information about the project.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.450
This modal is a Bootstrap feature that uses JavaScript but

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.730
don't worry, in order to implement it you don't need to know any JavaScript.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.550
For this assignment I want you to implement a modal just like the one

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.990
we have here.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.740
Here we are inside Bootstrap's documentation for modals.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.080
This is in the JavaScript section.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.530
I'm going to scroll down to an example.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.070
All right, we've got our simple example just like the one we saw.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.150
This is the HTML that was used to create the modal.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.860
Here we have the trigger that opens up the modal.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.507
Notice that it's got two attributes we haven't seen before,

00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:09.120
data-toggle and data-target.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.430
In this example, these attributes are attached to a button.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.210
But, in our case, we'll be attaching them to the images in our portfolio.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.730
Inside the instructor notes,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.860
you'll find some HTML that looks a lot like what you see here.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.110
We want you to copy the HTML you find in your instructor's notes to your own

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.160
page, and it should be inside the body of your page, not inside any divs.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.240
Notice here that this HTML has an id which in this case is myModal.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.060
You can add as many modals as you want.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.970
Just make sure each one has its own unique ID.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.240
Notice how this ID matches up with the data target above.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.890
Modals here work because of the bootstrap.min.js file that you

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.690
should already have in your project.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.120
Go ahead and see if you can add a modal to your page.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.290
Once you've finished adding your modal, click this box to continue.
