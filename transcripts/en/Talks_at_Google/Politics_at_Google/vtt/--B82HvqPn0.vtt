[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:11.340
SPEAKER: So I thought maybe
you could start by just giving

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.402
a quick intro to All Out.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.610
For people who aren't familiar
with the organization,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.170
tell us a little bit about it.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.430
MATT BEARD: Yeah, sure.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.330
So as, I think, many people
[INAUDIBLE] over 70 countries

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.510
in the world, it is
illegal to be gay.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.330
And in 10 of those
countries, your government

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.250
can actually legally kill you,
just for being who you are.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.430
So what All Out does is it
enables millions of people

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.020
around the world to take
action on LGBT rights,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.560
and we do this with people power
combined with tech, strategy,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.760
and research.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.710
And we bring those
elements together

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
to enable millions of
voices to come together

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.400
to make a very, very loud
noise about LGBT rights,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.850
to raise the volume, to
protect LGBT people when

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.610
they are at risk, and
to grasp opportunities

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.670
when they come for our
equality and our dignity

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.970
around the world.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.870
SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.370
Awesome.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.830
That's a pretty good intro.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.390
So I guess we can dive into a
little of the specifics of work

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.750
All Out has been doing recently.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.210
I did want to give a
warning to folks in the room

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.140
and on the Livestream.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.200
Obviously, when we talk
about these issues globally,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.050
there's a number
of sensitive topics

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.670
that can come up, including
violence and sexual assault,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.750
and we're no stranger to those
issues in the west, either.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.020
But if at any time folks
feel the need to step out

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.740
of the room, that's totally
fine, and no questions asked.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.680
So let's talk a
little about pride.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.720
There was some talk
in the room before we

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.030
started about protests and
the importance of protests.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.270
And I know that one thing that
All Out does a lot of work

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.410
with globally is pride events,
pride festivals and protest

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.700
marches, and all that.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.360
So can you talk us a little bit
about why that is so important,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.550
particularly in our context,
where pride in San Francisco

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.950
is kind of a party
at this point.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.510
It's lost some of that protest.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.530
MATT BEARD: Sure, yeah.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.670
So I mean, I think there's
an initial question,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.140
as to whether pride in New York
or San Francisco or Chicago

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.510
or DC should only be a
protest, particularly

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.760
against the backdrop of the
current situation that we

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.986
find ourselves in.

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:23.610
But in many countries
around the world,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.320
that isn't even up for debate.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.540
Where it is illegal to be who
you are, taking part in pride

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.940
is a massive act of
defiance and courage.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.090
And it is visibility that
really makes the difference.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.940
If we think back to
the advances that we've

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.880
made in the United States,
Europe, Australia, Canada,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.680
over the last 50 years, it is by
LGBT plus people being visible,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.680
being out there,
that has actually

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.040
allowed us to make the
significant changes that we

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.850
have.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.660
And so All Out, mainly through
our crowdfunding program,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.910
which is called Grassroots
Giving, in which we

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.360
ask our global membership
to make small contributions

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.482
to fund frontline activism
or service delivery,

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.190
around the world.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.500
Through that
program, we have been

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.230
able to fund a number of
prides around the world.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.260
And we do that
because we believe

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.470
that those moments of
visibility, solidarity,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.950
community, that those
groups can have,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.340
through organizing
pride for themselves,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.710
are enormous catalysts.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.940
They're like a big battery
boosting those movements.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.190
What we find, though, is
that after a successful pride

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.290
in a hostile
environment, it really

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.200
kind of catalyzes the
movement for the whole year

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.940
and enables them to
live a really, really

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.900
effective activism.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.860
So we believe that what
happened in Stonewall in 1969

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.300
was a seminal moment, that
our ancestors have given us

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.200
something very, very
precious to work with,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.400
to take that tradition and to
spread it around the world,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.700
and to make sure that, as
LGBT people plus people,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.930
we remain visible.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.710
We remain physical
and on the streets,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.040
and we claim our rights in
a very clear and open way.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.130
SPEAKER: OK, and so you
said a successful pride

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.290
can have a lot of impact,
in terms of visibility.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.490
What does that look like,
a successful pride event?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.460
MATT BEARD: So a
successful pride event

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.220
in a hostile
environment, firstly, it

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.500
looks like an event
which is peaceful,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.200
where LGBT plus people
have not been physically

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.260
attacked or intimidated.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.450
It is an event where the
freedom of association

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.060
is guaranteed by the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.820
has been respected so
that people are allowed

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.500
to gather as LGBT plus people,
to be in one space at one time

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.670
together.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.470
And it looks like
an event where there

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.680
has been a critical mass
of people coming together.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.310
And a critical mass, in many
of the environments we work in,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.970
can be as few as 50
people, really, who

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.720
can really make a difference.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.570
When I worked at Amnesty
International, 10 years ago,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.500
I took part in one of the
first prides in Riga in Latvia.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.570
And there were
literally 50 of us

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.410
in that space and around
10,000 counter-protesters

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.950
trying to disrupt that event.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.770
We were protected by the
police in a very efficient way,

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.140
and so it remains safe.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.790
I went back 10 years later,
this summer, to Riga,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.830
and those numbers
had, basically,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.450
inverted, that there were
8,000 people participating

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.740
in pride and a very sad
looking group of Nazis who

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.380
were protesting against us,
probably around 50 or 60

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.130
of those.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.830
So that, for me, to
answer your question,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.540
shows the progress
that can be made.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.880
From that courageous
moment 10 years ago

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.680
when those Latvian
activists decided

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.850
that they were going to
stand out and do this thing,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.080
despite the risks,
despite the violence,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.320
despite the intimidation,
and in 10 years

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.020
they've turned that
thing around completely.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.200
And it was a joyful
occasion where, as I said,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.439
8,000 people were
able to come together.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.980
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.100
That's incredible.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.080
Quite a flip.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.075
OK, so let's talk about
some specific prides

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:29.950
that All Out has been
involved with recently,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.940
and we can see if folks in the
room have questions as well.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.400
So I know recently, you had,
in the same weekend, Swaziland

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.564
Pride and Istanbul Pride.

00:06:39.564 --> 00:06:40.230
MATT BEARD: Yes.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.271
SPEAKER: All Out was doing
work with both of them

00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:44.880
simultaneously, and there's
pretty different outcomes

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.920
from both, from
what I understand.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.560
So could you tell us
more of that story?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.720
MATT BEARD: Yeah, I'll
tell you about both prides.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.930
Very, very different stories
in both those places.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.780
I'm going to start
with Swaziland Pride.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.730
I have the privilege to be there
myself for Swaziland Pride.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.230
This was also part of All Out's
global crowdfunding program.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.380
So members from around 50
countries around the world,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.220
including African
countries, all participate.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.610
An average gift of
just $19 came together

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.330
to enable all of the security,
the logistics, everything

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.160
that was needed to run this
first ever pride in Swaziland.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.770
For those who don't know,
Swaziland is a tiny country.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.630
1.2 million people, just kind
of Northeast of South Africa.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.130
It is the final absolute
monarchy in Africa

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.830
and it is illegal
to be gay there.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.330
It is criminalized.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.460
And so when our
partners from Swaziland

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.120
came to us over a year ago
with the incredibly kind

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.320
of audacious idea of
running pride in Swaziland,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.150
we were super excited by it.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.760
Because it's rare to have
pride in Africa, anywhere.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.260
Uganda is one of
the few countries

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.610
that has managed, partially,
to pull off a pride event.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.920
And that this tiny country
with an absolute monarchy,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.050
with criminalized
homosexuality, that they

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.790
were going to take
this daring step,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.180
we found incredibly exciting.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.409
So we said, yes.

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:16.200
We will go out and we
will raise the money.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.220
And we reached the target
through this global support.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.190
It was a bumpy journey.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.190
We initially got all of the
police permissions in place.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.280
We had signed and
stamped documentation

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.960
that gave permission for this
public event to go ahead.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.840
But unfortunately, in the few
weeks leading up to the event,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.780
as is often the case in
Africa, the Christian right

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.960
mobilized significantly.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.450
They were placing editorials.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.800
They started a digital
petition through a platform

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.290
called CitizenGO, which is kind
of the opposite alternative

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.320
of All Out, if you like.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.820
They use digital technology
and people power to campaign

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.990
against sexual and reproductive
rights and LGBTQ rights.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.060
And they were able to
launch this petition, which

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.610
started to impact on the popular
discussion within Swaziland.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.495
And that affected the police.

00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:15.570
So three days before the
event was due to start,

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.301
the police just rescinded
all of the permissions

00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:19.800
that they'd given,
which they can do

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.480
because it's not a democracy.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.550
And we had to work
really, really hard

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.000
with diplomatic
channels, et cetera,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.150
to bring that permission
back, which we did.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.550
We did, with about
12 hours to spare.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.500
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.209
MATT BEARD: And
during that time,

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:42.000
there was a very, very
difficult discussion

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.110
about whether we would march
anyway, with all of the risks

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.070
that that entailed.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.020
We didn't come to
a final decision,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.320
but the police permission
was put back in place.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.510
Then we started to get
credible threats relayed

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.490
through our private security
company of a firebombing that

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.800
would take place
during the march.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.860
And again a very, very difficult
decision, not made by All Out,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.000
made by our partners.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.646
We always make sure that they
have agency in these things.

00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:12.020
But a very difficult decision
whether or not to go ahead,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.360
but we decided we
would go ahead.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.810
And so on a bright,
sunny Saturday morning--

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.780
it's winter there.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.350
It was warmish.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.050
In this field that you can
see on the slides right now--

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.090
it's a sports field--

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:33.870
around 300 LGBT plus
people gathered.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.820
I need to really
emphasize with the guys

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.290
that this was not only
the first ever pride,

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.110
but according to
our partners, this

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.440
was literally the first time
that more than about seven

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.280
or eight LGBT people had ever
come together in one place

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.460
at one time in this country.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.770
And you can see the
joy on the faces.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.330
This is before we
even started marching.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.350
It was incredibly moving,
even before we set off.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:03.630
But once we set off to walk
probably 200 or 300 meters

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.710
through the city of Mbabane,
the capital of Swaziland,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.050
I have to tell you that
I personally kind of lost

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.270
it and ended up in tears.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.730
Because we didn't
have soundtracks.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.620
It's not London
or San Francisco,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:23.340
but 300 people broke out in the
most beautiful African freedom

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.030
songs as we left this field
and marched onto the streets.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:33.120
And it was truly a moment of
absolute personal liberation,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.560
I think, for so many people.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.280
You could see the people
were literally kind of dizzy

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.890
with excitement and joy.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.360
And so it was a really,
really special moment.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.695
It happened absolutely
without any incident.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.610
There was no violence, either
verbal or physical whatsoever.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.440
We were able to come
back into the field.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.840
There was then a
festival, and we

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.800
were even able to run a party
in a private venue that evening.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.760
Again, some security
threats came through,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.000
but it all went off
without a hitch.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.274
And going back to my
previous point, when

00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:18.690
we talked to our
partners and when

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.720
we talked to some of the people
who were participating in this,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.950
there was an enormous
sense of just being boosted

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:31.080
by a massive battery of
power, that people finally

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.220
felt powerful.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.160
They felt they had agency.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.700
And we believe that the
ramifications of this

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.380
will go way beyond
Swaziland, that it

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.420
will go across the continent.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.970
Because it really was a
moment of significant success

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.980
for an LGBT movement in
a hostile environment.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.930
So the same weekend, Istanbul
Pride was due to take place.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:05.460
And my colleague, Uri, was
there to stand shoulder

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.330
to shoulder with our
partners in Turkey.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.670
We've worked with them
for the last three years

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.560
around pride to
raise visibility.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.990
We've run thunderclaps.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.540
We've run petitions to ensure
that the world is watching.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.360
Unfortunately, the same pattern
has happened for the last two

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.185
or three years.

00:13:25.185 --> 00:13:27.030
It happened again.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.590
And I was telling Alex,
just as a side story--

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.680
because we're in a tech company,
I think this is interesting.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.680
I was in a hotel in Swaziland.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.610
I happened to have a pretty
decent internet connection.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.120
And there were lots of
Facebook Lives coming

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.020
from Pride in Istanbul as
things started to become

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.760
difficult and violent.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.460
And I was actually able to
see my colleague on some

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.260
of those Facebook Lives.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.730
And was literally,
with WhatsApp,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:01.620
able to direct him out of
danger, as the police started

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.900
to engage, which I
found very, very surreal

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:12.520
and a real indicator, I guess,
of the power of technology.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.380
But to continue with the
story of Istanbul Pride,

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:21.360
as I'm sure you all
know, Istanbul Pride

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.900
is an organization that applies
for permission every year

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.770
to run the pride
parade in Istanbul.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.640
They neither receive approval
nor denial each year,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.470
so they go ahead
and do it anyway.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.640
And what usually happens is that
around 12 hours before they're

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.890
due to start,
there is a ban that

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.380
is announced, which
is particularly cruel,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.394
because it just doesn't
allow any planning,

00:14:45.394 --> 00:14:46.560
or any contingency planning.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.310
In terms of negotiations
with the police,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.470
it was agreed that
a statement could

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.290
be read out in four
places around the city

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.890
by LGBT activists.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.770
That happened, but
very, very soon after--

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:08.540
literally minutes after--
the police, with dogs,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.020
started to mobilize
around those four points

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.690
and gave people very, very
little time to disperse,

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.460
and eventually engaged.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.970
And they used a lot of bullets.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.620
They used tear gas.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.150
They used dogs against
people who were completely

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:35.570
peacefully claiming their
right to freedom of assembly.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.520
There was no registered
crime committed by anybody,

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.680
but people were viciously
attacked by the police

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.160
and by dogs.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.500
We had a lawyer on
call, who's also

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.670
an activist, ready to help
out if my colleague, Uri, were

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.990
arrested during that time.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.360
And he was simultaneously
beaten by 10 police officers

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.750
and attacked by a
dog, and had sustained

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:08.000
very significant injuries to
his left leg during that attack.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.810
And so Istanbul is a
moment to pause for us,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.780
a moment of reflection on
how far we still have to go.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.480
It was a massive contrast to the
joy and liberation and agency

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.490
we saw in Swaziland.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.890
We're not giving up.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.162
We will continue to stand side
by side with Istanbul Pride.

00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:32.870
We're already talking
to them and working

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.600
with them on, perhaps,
smarter strategies

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.814
next year to enable
this to happen

00:16:39.814 --> 00:16:41.480
in a way that won't
lead to people being

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.430
hurt in such brutal manner.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.370
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.380
Quite a contrast.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.357
Could you talk a little about
All Out's role in those prides?

00:16:51.357 --> 00:16:52.940
Because obviously,
as you said, you're

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.260
not organizing the pride.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.650
There are local organizers who
are leading on these projects.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.330
But what does All
Out actually do?

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.420
MATT BEARD: Yeah, so for
Swaziland, we, effectively,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.660
through our membership around
the world, we funded it.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.349
So we enabled that to
happen through funding.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:13.910
So we ran a round about four
or five months ahead of time.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.099
We ran a crowdfunding
campaign that

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:19.730
went out via email and social
media to our global membership.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.319
It told the story of a number of
LGBTQ individuals in Swaziland,

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:28.069
their personal journeys, and
how important pride would

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.570
be to them.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.390
And we asked our members
to make small donations.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.960
As I said, the average
gift around $19

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.500
to enable that to happen.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.102
Our appeals kind
of happen quickly.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.560
So when the email
goes out, there's

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.690
a series of three emails.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.690
It's over within a week.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.550
We know whether we've
reached the target.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.480
We reached the target and we
were able to remit those funds.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.910
And then we worked
with them kind

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.920
of as a friendly critical voice.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.570
We are really, really
very, very strict

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.230
on the idea that we don't
run these events, that we

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.330
give agency to
our local partners

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.290
to run them as they see fit.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.060
But we've also started to
collect some experience of how

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.760
pride happens in different
hostile environments

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.880
around the world.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.750
And so our role is also
to provide some advice

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.470
when is wanted and needed.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:27.050
In Istanbul, our role was
really as a long-term partner

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.350
to stand in solidarity.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.500
So we did lots of
media work around it.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.710
We wanted to raise the
visibility of the issues that

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.330
were being faced there.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.870
We provided this live
reporting service

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.450
from the ground-- which social
media very much offers--

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.554
with Uri providing a live
feed to our supporters,

00:18:44.554 --> 00:18:46.220
and then following
up with lots of media

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.740
work afterwards to really draw
attention to the human rights

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.396
violations that took place.

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:52.680
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.520
So do folks in the room have
questions about pride events

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.960
around the world or protests?

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.290
I'll pass you the microphone.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.950
For the LiveStream.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.820
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.080
Yeah, thank you for your work.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.000
It sounds like
you're doing really

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.510
courageous, difficult,
complicated stuff.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.940
It's amazing and very inspiring.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.320
My question has to do
with colonialism and how

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:27.680
you think about All Out's role
with respect to colonialism--

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.830
spreading ideas or ideologies.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.310
And especially in
Swaziland, Christianity

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:39.290
was obviously deposited
there colonially, right?

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.790
So I guess what
I'm actually trying

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.830
to understand is
how do you think

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:50.040
about the anti-LGBT forces that
exist in places like Swaziland

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.690
and Istanbul?

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.450
How do you model
them in your mind?

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.950
How do you think about
where they're operating from

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.380
or their reasons?

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.650
And how would you summarize
your goal with respect

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.930
to those forces?

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.240
Because I understand the
humanitarian goal of you

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.100
know you want LGBT people
to be free, and I 100%

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.020
understand [INAUDIBLE] is that.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.940
I just want to
understand the other part

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.919
for the political aspect.

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:20.710
MATT BEARD: Thanks.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.830
It's a great question, because
in terms of the work we do,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.490
and in terms of the fact
that All Out is registered

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.130
in New York and
the United States,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.600
and the United States is
a global superpower that

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.540
has been accused of all
sorts of neocolonialism,

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.240
and that I'm the [INAUDIBLE]
direction, I come from Britain.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.550
That also has that
experience 100 years earlier.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.420
We have to be really careful
about that narrative.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.920
And so I think your
question is a great one.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.810
I'll come to the meat of
the question in a moment.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.700
One of the things
I want to mention

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.340
is we try and work on a
communications narrative

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.460
that makes clear that,
particularly, in terms

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.560
of British colonialism,
that it is actually

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.000
homophobia that is the
export, not homosexuality.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.030
So there are 52 commonwealth
countries in the world.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.210
37% of those,
shockingly, are still

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.730
countries where it
is illegal to be gay.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.720
And most of those 37 countries,
even more shockingly,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.580
still have 19th century
British colonial legislation

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.290
that talks about
carnal knowledge

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.390
against the order of
nature, and criminalizes

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:48.750
the act of, basically,
penetrative male gay sex.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.890
So we work on our
communications narrative

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.270
that tries to flip that around.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.570
Because in many countries
around the world,

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.910
there is an internal
homophobic narrative

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.950
that says homosexuality
has come from the West.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.490
It's come from Europe.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.090
It's come from America.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.010
And we have to protect
"African" or "Caribbean"

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.530
or "Latin American"
or "Asian" values

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.730
against this gay invasion.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.610
And what we've been
able to do, partially--

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.820
it's a very big and long
job, it's a bumpy road--

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.670
but is to kind of
invert that narrative.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.480
So for example, when the
Commonwealth heads of state

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:36.600
came to London for their summit
just a couple of months ago,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.670
we projected onto the
side of the UK parliament,

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.130
making clear that
in 37 countries

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.360
of the 52 in the Commonwealth,
it is illegal to be gay.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.290
and We were calling
on the UK government

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.800
to apologize to the millions
of citizens of the Commonwealth

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.280
for that legacy of
British colonial law.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.560
But in terms of the second part
of your question of where that

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.190
comes from, where that
homophobia is rooted,

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.864
and how we deal with
it politically--

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.990
and I think it has to be
named, but it is often--

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.330
religion is often
used or utilized

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.350
or exploited by
powerful elites in order

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.680
to secure their positions.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.760
So again, our
counter-strategy is really

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.950
to attempt to work
with progressive faith

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.690
as much as we can,
because we believe

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.920
it's one of the most important
ways to unlock that narrative.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.030
So just to give you another
example of a concrete campaign

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.700
that we've been working on
over the last few weeks,

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.080
there is a self-declared
female imam in Berlin

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.100
who has established a mosque,
where men and women can come

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.540
together to pray together,
where LGBTQ people are welcome,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.800
where Jews, Christians,
atheists are welcome.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.630
It's an engagement space.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.070
And we have helped
her set this up.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:12.510
We've helped to set up a
community and engagement center

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.190
that brings people together.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.870
And we really believe
that by unlocking

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.700
some of those closed
doors of religion,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:25.240
that is one way
to work with this.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.670
And then the other way that
we deal with this, I think,

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.730
is to do what I've been talking
about a little bit already,

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.010
is to really ensure that--

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.260
All Out sometimes
very much takes

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.060
a back seat, that
it's our partners that

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.640
are very much in
the frontline, who

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.740
are being seen in the media.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.180
And we very much
create a narrative

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.346
that these are home
grown, as they are.

00:24:49.346 --> 00:24:50.220
It's not a narrative.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.270
It's reality.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.450
These are homegrown
movements, people working

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:55.856
for their own liberation.

00:24:58.712 --> 00:24:59.670
SPEAKER: Great.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.520
Other folks in the room?

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.500
You can just pass it right on.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.120
AUDIENCE: Very impressed.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.650
I took some notes.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.200
I like some of the terms you
use, like invert narrative,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.680
unlock narrative.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.190
I grew up in the Bible
Belt, West Virginia.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.690
There's awful lot of
good people there.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.380
I think it's really
important to address

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.722
the goodness in Christianity.

00:25:24.722 --> 00:25:25.680
MATT BEARD: Absolutely.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.100
AUDIENCE: And to never
use the word Christianity

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.439
without qualifying, somehow,
in a follow-up statement,

00:25:32.439 --> 00:25:32.980
or something.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.300
Because what's happening
is all this divisiveness

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:41.660
is causing Christianity to be
pitted against homosexuality.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.590
It's not true.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:47.250
If you actually read the Bible
or study what Martin Luther

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:51.180
King stood for, who was a
real Christian, what I think

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.520
is effective, in my opinion,
is confronting people

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.070
with their own
beliefs, which I think

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.900
is similar to what you said
about unlocking the narrative.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.900
So when I saw those happy faces
and the African freedom songs,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.460
I thought that was beautiful.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.280
So I just wonder if you could
talk a little bit about what

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.117
is effective besides--

00:26:10.117 --> 00:26:12.450
for instance, let me give you
an example of what I think

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.040
is not effective.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.450
One is my emotional immaturity
myself, getting angry

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.420
at my relatives, as I have.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.470
Kaepernick, the guy-- I'm sure
I mispronounced his name--

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.840
the football player who got the
Amnesty International's highest

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.890
award.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:32.160
I thought he was
ineffective, because you

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.060
can't take the anthem
protest very far without them

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.899
making it irrelevant to
what you're trying to say.

00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:41.940
I thought it was great
amnesty gave him an award,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.130
but in the '60s, they
thought these things out,

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:45.960
like what's going to work.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.741
So could you talk about
what's going to work?

00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:51.570
MATT BEARD: Sure.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.600
I'll preface it by
saying that I think

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.830
your own emotional authenticity
and integrity, I think,

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.710
should play a part
in the struggle.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.510
I think righteous anger at
the way LGBTQ people have

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.820
been treated for millennia
is part of the equation.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.790
I really do.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:16.050
Frankly, I think straight
people should be very grateful

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.440
that when we celebrate what
happened in Christopher

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.170
Street in 1969 through
pride, we do so

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.780
in a spirit of joy and
celebration and not anger

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.310
and revenge because we've
been treated really badly.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.540
So I do think it's part of
the equation, but only a part.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.930
What I think works
is a combination

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.690
of different theories of
change coming together.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.050
So I'll be really honest.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:52.370
All Out doesn't provide the full
spectrum of change ingredients.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.260
And the way I always talk about
this, it's like baking a cake.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.099
So to bake a cake,
you need the butter.

00:27:58.099 --> 00:27:58.890
You need the flour.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:27:59.639
You need the eggs.

00:27:59.639 --> 00:28:00.850
You need the milk.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:05.040
What All Out does is provide
people power to change.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.010
We bring together those
millions of ordinary voices.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:10.700
And together, those
voices raised the volume.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.110
They change hearts and minds.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.840
They change the conversation.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.805
And we believe passionately
in that theory of change.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.410
We call it new power.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.830
Our founder, Jeremy Heimans,
has a book out right now called

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.820
"New Power."

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.030
And it's about
peer-driven, participatory,

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.030
nonhierarchical change models.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.390
But, or and, we also
believe that that is not

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.160
sufficient on its own.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.470
So our friends at HRC, who are
working on high-level advocacy

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.760
in the corridors of power--

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.010
I mean, we have fewer friends
in the corridor of power

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.500
than we used to, but that is
also incredibly important work.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.860
Our colleagues at Human Rights
Watch and Amnesty International

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.340
who are documenting human
rights violations, that is also

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.740
incredibly important work.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.570
Friends in the legal
profession, who

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:08.620
are supporting strategic
litigation to challenge

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.530
criminalisation of
homosexuality, that is also

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.400
incredibly important work.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.610
So my personal
belief, really, is

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.980
that it is the combination
that is effective,

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.270
that all of those different
theories of change

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.070
are greater than the
sum of the parts.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:28.570
And when we can work effectively
together, it creates change.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.920
And I would actually take
that one step further--

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.080
and I know this is very kind of
vogue-ish to say in the United

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.170
States right now because of
the current environment that

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.310
we're in--

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.790
but I think if you can make
it also intersectional,

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.990
then it's even stronger.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.590
So we've been really trying to
work with the gender justice

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.140
movement, with the racial
justice movement here

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.320
and in the UK and in
the rest of Europe

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.240
to kind of form
intersectional alliances.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.620
Because so often, particularly
with gender justice,

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.420
our enemies are actually
the same people.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.884
And so I think its
really important

00:30:05.884 --> 00:30:06.800
that we work together.

00:30:10.265 --> 00:30:13.290
SPEAKER: Any more folks?

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.040
We can touch on a
couple of other things.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.850
I think we would be remiss
if we had you on Google

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.362
and we didn't talk a little
bit about digital strategies.

00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:24.070
That is, really, the
core of what you do.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.110
MATT BEARD: Absolutely.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:30.710
SPEAKER: And so we see a lot
of this, what is sometimes

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.080
called, slacktivism,
right or I think

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.660
you called it keyboard activism
one time in a conversation.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.207
And there's this
questioning, does it actually

00:30:39.207 --> 00:30:40.040
accomplish anything?

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.040
Can I, sitting in my room
at home on the internet,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.600
actually make an impact
elsewhere in the world?

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.904
And obviously, All Out
believes that you can, right?

00:30:47.904 --> 00:30:49.820
So I'm curious about how
you think about that,

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.590
and what kinds of things
people can do that are helpful,

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.581
what's less helpful, and how
we should think about that.

00:30:55.581 --> 00:30:57.080
MATT BEARD: Yeah,
so we passionately

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.450
believe that you can.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.390
We passionately
believe that you don't

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:06.470
have to give blood, sweat,
and tears to be an activist.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.630
Obviously, if you
can, that's awesome,

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.550
but not everybody
can or wants to.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.980
And there are ways
in which people

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:18.030
can use the power of virtual
activism, keyboard activism,

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.420
slacktivism, whatever
you want to call it,

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.880
to make a difference.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.350
And the way that that
difference happens

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.450
is through a multiplier effect.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.810
So me taking a digital
action on my own

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.210
isn't really going
to change the world.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:37.020
But when I join my
voice with thousands,

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.190
hundreds of thousands, sometimes
millions of other people

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.100
who are doing the same
thing at the same time

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:47.030
and creating a moment
of energy, that does,

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.460
actually, really create change.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.300
It creates change in
two ways, two main ways.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.820
I think, firstly,
as I've mentioned

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.050
before, it can kind of
change the conversation

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.500
or change the narrative.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.830
Sometimes we literally have
got hundreds of thousands

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.470
of people taking
action and talking

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.040
about a particular campaign that
we're running at the same time.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.370
And whether we actually achieve
the final outcome or not,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.430
that has actually moved
that conversation forward.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:21.980
It has challenged the
counter-narrative, that

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:27.290
LGBT plus people off unable
to look after children,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.090
shouldn't be getting
married, spreading disease.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.630
Whatever that
counter-narrative is,

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.070
it enables it to be challenged.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.410
And then on some
of our campaigns,

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:41.500
we know that we have actually
achieved a concrete outcome.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.630
We try very hard
not to be greedy

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:48.080
with attribution, because
of the cake metaphor

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.940
that I was talking
about earlier.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.481
Because sometimes
it's very difficult

00:32:51.481 --> 00:32:54.230
to know whether it
was the meeting HLC

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:58.340
had with someone in government
or the public campaign

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.870
that All Out did.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:04.040
But we know that we do
achieve concrete outcomes.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.870
I'll give you one
example where we

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.290
know for sure because the
decision-makers told us.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.740
So there probably are
people in this audience

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.560
for whom the name Steven
Anderson will ring a bell.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.410
Steven Anderson is
the Arizona pastor

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:23.410
who celebrated the deaths of
49 of our brothers and sisters

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:27.650
at the Pulse nightclub
in Orlando in his church.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:33.470
And pastor Anderson was planning
a speaking tour in South Africa

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.170
to spread that
message of hatred,

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:39.470
so we ran a global petition.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.280
We collected a dossier
of evidence against him,

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.380
and we presented that
to the interior ministry

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.475
of South Africa.

00:33:46.475 --> 00:33:48.950
As some of you may know,
South Africa's constitution

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.535
is actually the most
pro-LGBT in the world.

00:33:52.535 --> 00:33:56.540
It has very significant
provisions around hate speech,

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.120
and they responded positively
and denied him an entry visa.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.160
He got stuck at JFK.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.360
He couldn't travel.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.210
He was not able to spread
that message of hatred.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.010
And they came back
to us directly

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.580
to tell us that it was a
result of that people power,

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.449
of that mass international
community coming together

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:21.260
to draw attention to this
man's hate speech that

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.520
led to the decision to deny
him that entry visa into South

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.960
Africa.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.638
He then tried to change his
travel plans to go to Botswana.

00:34:30.638 --> 00:34:32.179
We didn't run a
campaign in Botswana,

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.179
but the Botswana government just
followed the South African lead

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:40.360
and then also denied him
an entry visa to travel.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.170
SPEAKER: That's a great example.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.980
And you also do I think a lot of
grassroots fundraising, right?

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.290
MATT BEARD: Correct.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.790
SPEAKER: Can you
talk about how that

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.100
works, sort of practically?

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.322
MATT BEARD: Yeah.

00:34:50.322 --> 00:34:51.830
When I came into
the organization

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.639
2 and 1/2 years ago, it seemed
a bit counter-intuitive to me

00:34:55.639 --> 00:35:00.080
that we had a database
of hundreds and hundreds

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.800
of thousands of global citizens
who, by definition, wanted

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.540
to stand up for
LGBT plus people,

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.960
but that we weren't
asking them for money

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.600
for our frontline partners,
like in Swaziland.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:17.400
So in 2016, we tested a couple
of crowdfunding appeals,

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.290
and they have the brand
name Grassroots Giving.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.720
And it kind-- we were
kind of surprised at just

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.670
how great the response was.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.400
People really wanted to feel
that they were contributing

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.660
directly to a tangible piece
of frontline service delivery,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.770
or activism.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.580
So in 2016, we tested
this by running an appeal

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.512
to keep a shelter for homeless
LGBT youth open in Poland,

00:35:41.512 --> 00:35:43.970
and we were able to keep that
open right through the winter

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.240
months so that the kids
who were in this place

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.780
weren't thrown out into a very
cold climate, but also a very

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.210
homophobic climate.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.170
And then we also ran a
crowdfunder for Uganda Pride

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:59.720
in 2016.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.920
Both those reached the target,
so in 2017, we rolled this out.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.890
We now run one
every single month.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:11.660
The defining moment, I
guess, for this program

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.835
for us came in 2017 during
the Chechnya crisis.

00:36:15.835 --> 00:36:17.210
And for those who
are in the room

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:22.130
or on the call who don't
know what happened there,

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.930
in 2017 in Chechnya, the
state security forces

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.860
started to illegally
kidnap and round up

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.140
men presumed to be gay or bi.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.680
They were taken to
illegal detention centers

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.650
outside the city of Grozny.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:45.010
They were tortured and, in
some cases, were murdered.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.960
It was the most
significant moment

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.290
of state-sponsored
persecution of LGBT

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:55.640
plus people since the Nazis.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.150
We had been a longtime partner
of the LGBT Russian LGBT

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.470
network, which was
organizing evacuations

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.230
of men who had either
survived the camps

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.800
or who were at risk
of going into them.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.010
And we said to them,
this is something

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.250
we should run through our
Grassroots Giving program.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:21.609
And we thought we could raise--

00:37:21.609 --> 00:37:22.900
the sums we raised were modest.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.304
So we thought we
could raise $20,000.

00:37:25.304 --> 00:37:26.720
That would have
paid for, perhaps,

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.640
six or seven evacuations.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.780
We hit Send on the email,
and within 23 minutes,

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.400
we had reached that target.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.640
And we ended up
raising $250,000, which

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.050
for an organization
like All Out,

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.990
is a very large amount of money.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.130
And that came from over
120 different countries.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:51.050
It was a massive act
of global solidarity.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:54.440
And in those very,
very dark days,

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.420
it was some form of
redemption, that there

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.030
was this generosity around
the world and a willingness

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.710
to stand up to that.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.560
We also ran an absolutely
enormous petition,

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.490
working with avowals.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:11.450
1.2 million people
signed our petition.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.970
Uri, my colleague, who I was
talking about earlier who

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.900
went to Istanbul, went to
Moscow to deliver that petition.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.966
And he and our activist
partners were arrested in Moscow

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:23.840
and were never able to
deliver that petition.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.300
We ended up having
to do it digitally,

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.940
and I'm sure it went
straight into the trash can.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:35.480
But that moment was very,
very special for us.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.490
So we continue to do
one of these appeals

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.560
every single month.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.760
Right now, we're raising
money for the mosque in Berlin

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.650
that I talked about earlier.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:51.140
But we've also ran appeals
for safe houses for people

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.030
fleeing from ISIS.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:58.880
We funded helplines for
survivors of anti-LGBT hate

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.760
crime community centers.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.290
A beautiful project
in Kurdistan in Iraq

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.540
to paint pro-LGBT murals
on public streets.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:14.000
So we continue to work with
our global network of partners

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.010
to see where there are
these projects that

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.250
require these relatively
modest, but sometimes very

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.160
transformational,
injection of funds

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.450
in order to make a difference.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.820
And we believe this is
another kind of form

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.510
of catalyzing, catalyzing
movements, fueling

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.015
movements around the world.

00:39:32.015 --> 00:39:32.640
SPEAKER: Great.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.098
Well, Matt, I want to thank
you so much for coming in today

00:39:35.098 --> 00:39:36.510
and chatting with us.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.540
And thanks for coming.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.080
MATT BEARD: Thank you.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.680
Thanks.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.430
[APPLAUSE]
