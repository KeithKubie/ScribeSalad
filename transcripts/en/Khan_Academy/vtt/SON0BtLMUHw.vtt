00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Instructor] We've spent several videos

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.820
talking about the costs of a firm.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.500
And in particular, we've thought about

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.820
how marginal cost is driven by quantity

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.810
and how average total cost
is driven by quantity,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.590
and we think about other
average costs as well.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.220
Now, in this video, we're
going to extend that analysis

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.500
by starting to think about profit.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.890
Now, profit, you are probably

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.830
already familiar with the term.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.270
But one way to think
about it, very generally,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.770
it's how much a firm brings in,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.880
you could consider that its revenue,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.140
minus its costs,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.860
minus its costs.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.860
And a rational firm will
want to maximize its profit.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.420
And so to understand how a firm

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.460
might go about maximizing its profit

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.780
or what quantity it would need to produce

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.590
to maximize its profit based on this,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.150
on its cost structure,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.270
we have to introduce revenue
into this model here.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.700
And in particular, we are going

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.410
to introduce the idea of marginal revenue.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.650
And we're going to assume

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.680
that this firm is in a
very competitive market,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.770
and so it is a price-taker.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.600
So regardless of how
much this firm produces,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.690
the incremental revenue per
unit of what it produces,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.930
maybe this is a doughnut company,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.350
the incremental amount per doughnut

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.300
is going to stay the same regardless of

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.250
how much this firm in particular produces.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.330
So let's say that the marginal
revenue in this industry,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.090
in this market, is right over here.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.450
So one way to think about it is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.300
this would be the unit
price in that market.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.170
So let me put that right
over there, marginal revenue.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.720
Once again, for every incremental unit,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.310
how much revenue you're going to get,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.300
so it would just be
the price of that unit.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.920
So how much would a rational firm produce

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100
in order to maximize its profit?

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.100
If the marginal revenue is
higher than the marginal cost,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.390
well, that means every
incremental unit it produces,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.610
it's going to bring in some
net money into the door.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.520
So it's rational for it to do it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.610
So it would keep
producing, keep producing,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.040
keep producing, keep producing.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.940
Now, it gets interesting
as the marginal cost starts

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.530
to approach the marginal revenue.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.440
As long as the marginal revenue is higher

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.640
than the marginal cost,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.010
it's rational for the firm to produce.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.310
But right at that unit

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.840
where the marginal cost is
equal to the marginal revenue,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.700
well, there, on that incremental unit,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.490
the firm just breaks even
at least on the margin.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.410
It might be able to utilize

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.590
some of its fixed costs a little bit.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.350
But then, after that point,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.120
it makes no sense at all
for it to keep producing.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.170
Why is that?

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.090
Well, if the marginal cost is higher

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.080
than the marginal revenue,
that would be like saying,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.500
hey, I'm gonna sell a doughnut for $1

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.580
even though that incremental doughnut

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.090
costs me $1.10 to produce.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.860
Well, no rational person,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.560
if they want to maximize
their profit, would do that.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.590
So a rational firm that's trying

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.730
to maximize its profit
will produce the quantity

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.270
where marginal cost
intersects marginal revenue.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.460
It will produce this quantity

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.440
right over there.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.090
Now, a natural question might be

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.090
how much profit will it make
from producing that quantity?

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.520
Well, all you have to do is think about,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.460
this is the marginal revenue that it gets,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.610
and another way you could think about it,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.270
because this is constant,
it's also going to be

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.730
the average revenue that it gets per unit.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.710
And this right over here,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.530
is the average total cost per unit.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.040
And so what you could do is,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.000
this is how much it's
getting on average per unit,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.380
and then multiply that
times the number of units.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.380
And what you get is the
area of this rectangle.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.400
So for those of you who
are more visually inclined,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.000
one way to think about it
is a profit-maximizing firm,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.440
a rational profit-maximizing firm,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.410
would want to maximize this area.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.820
Think about what would happen

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.630
if they only produced this much.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.230
Well, then they're
giving up a ton of area.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.200
Then the rectangle would only be this big.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.100
This would be the profit

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.000
that the firm is going to
be making from those units.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.480
And then if it decides,
for some irrational reason,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.410
to produce more than this quantity

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.900
that we settled on before,
let's say this right over here,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.440
notice even though that the base

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.410
of this rectangle is
longer, the height is less,

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.160
and this would actually have a lower area.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.850
And the reason why I feel
very confident that this

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.410
will have a lower area is
because, in this situation,

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.100
the firm is losing money on
all of these incremental units

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.870
where the marginal cost is
higher than the marginal revenue.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.300
So big takeaway, a rational firm

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.990
that's trying to maximize its profit

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.910
will produce the quantity
where marginal cost

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.003
and marginal revenue
are equal to each other.
