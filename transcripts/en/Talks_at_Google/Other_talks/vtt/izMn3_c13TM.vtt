00:00:01.427 --> 00:00:03.010
CLIFF: All right,
so we're good to go.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.760
Thank you all for
stopping by today.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.780
It's our esteemed pleasure
to welcome Ava Roy to Google

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.850
as part of the Talks
at Google program.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.790
She's the founding
director of something

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.300
called We Players, which had its
origins at Stanford University

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.180
and is now a prominent fixture
in life in the Bay Area.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.760
Essentially, it takes the
ideas from Shakespeare,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.870
making "all the world a stage,"
and delivering truth on that

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.270
and putting it into practice.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.950
They do site-specific
performances and installations

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.870
throughout the
Bay Area, anything

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.830
from the story of the
"Odyssey on Angel Island"

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.820
to "Hamlet on Alcatraz"
to, most recently,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.036
"Macbeth" being
performed on Fort Point.

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:42.410
And so Ava will
go ahead and tell

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.784
us a little bit
of the background

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:47.360
behind the productions
and what it truly means

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.120
and the effect it has
on art in the Bay Area.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.480
And so without further
ado, please join me

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.933
in welcoming Ava to Google.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.130
AVA ROY: Hi.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.750
AVA ROY: Hi.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.760
Thanks for having me, you guys.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.276
So I'm happy, while
I'm here, to give you

00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:07.150
a little bit of information
about We Players,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.920
and tell you about
what I do, and give you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.280
some examples of the work.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.010
But I'm really open
to a conversation,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.840
so if you guys have questions
or particular areas of interest

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.455
as I'm rattling on, please
feel free to chime in or ask

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:19.160
any questions.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.090
And there's a lot
that I can talk about.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.040
This is my life's
work, so there's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.320
lots of angles and directions.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.690
If there's an area of
particular interest or question,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.030
please chime in,
and we'll kind of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.310
pursue that avenue of things.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.280
But to start us off,
basically, We Players

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.160
is, as Cliff just mentioned,
a performing arts company,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.790
and we're dedicated to
site-integrated performance.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.400
And I've actually
sort of shifted

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.360
from calling it site-specific
to say "integrated" because I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.940
realize that, as site-specific
is becoming an increasingly

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.390
popular term and way
of staging things,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.730
that what I've realized
one of the things that's

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.970
really unique about the ways
that We Players create work

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.900
is that it's really embedded
in a very particular site.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.270
So each show is non-transferable
to any other site.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.710
It's very carefully
crafted and built

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.210
into the physical
environment with awareness

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.320
of the sort of historical and
cultural and environmental

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.650
energies and factors
of that space.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.840
And I'll give you some
examples to kind of make

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.320
a little bit more sense.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.290
But basically, we're
committed and dedicated

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.670
to transforming public
spaces into realms

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.460
of participatory theater.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.120
So that means that
nowhere is safe

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.560
and that everywhere I
go is a potential stage,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.490
a potential performance
environment.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.170
So I'm, hmm, your campus
is pretty interesting.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.104
But one of the things
that's been really special

00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:40.520
over the past five
years is that I

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.054
started partnering with the
National Park Service in 2008,

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:45.720
and since then I've
been able to develop

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.928
this really remarkable
relationship with the National

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:49.580
Park Service.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.580
And we've performed
on Alcatraz Island.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.010
I was the first theater
artist-in-residence on Alcatraz

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.270
from 2009 to 2011.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.792
I've been at Fort Point, which
is the Civil War fortress

00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:00.000
under the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.791
I'll tell you a little
bit more about that.

00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:03.630
We have a show there right now.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.710
As well as a five-year
cooperative agreement

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.668
with San Francisco Maritime
National Historical

00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:10.550
Park, which is, if you
brave Fisherman's Wharf

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.686
and get through that, right
after Fisherman's Wharf

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:16.060
and kind of before Ghirardelli
Square, right in that area

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.310
is Hyde Street Pier.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.510
And there's these incredible,
old historic ships,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.550
and we perform on
their ships, sometimes

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.230
while sailing around the Bay and
sometimes while they're docked.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.030
In addition, we've started
partnering with the California

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.990
State Parks as well,
and as Cliff mentioned,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.300
we've done a show
out on Angel Island.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.870
So basically, some of the
main hallmarks of the work

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.750
are that, as an audience member,
you're also a participant.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.720
And I'm not interested
in kind of doing

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.140
a bunch of crazy things to
get a rise out of people.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.556
I'm the first person, if I go
to a show, and they're like,

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:48.230
we have a volunteer, it's
like, I'm going to just hide.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.490
So it's not that kind
of participation.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.540
It's intended to
create conditions

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.820
for certain kinds of experience
so that you sort of drop

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.570
into this world of the play.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.550
And the idea is to kind of
create a sphere of performance

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.770
so that nothing is outside
of this world of the play.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.470
And so that just
by being there, you

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.980
are immersed, quite physically,
into this world of the play,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.167
and that you find yourself
participating kind of

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.250
without having to make a
conscious choice about it

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.970
necessarily.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.429
Now, the most basic level of
participation that is required

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:20.929
is that you have
to be on your feet,

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:23.130
and you have to physically
move to follow the show

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.640
because every scene happens
in a different location

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.990
and how the show
moves in the space

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.120
is prescribed by the space.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.310
So if it's a huge
island, we're moving

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.684
all around the island, up and
down levels, and in and out

00:04:32.684 --> 00:04:34.205
of buildings and outdoor spaces.

00:04:34.205 --> 00:04:35.580
At the fortress
right now, you're

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.530
not covering as
much mileage as you

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.730
would be on Alcatraz
or Angel Island,

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.360
but you're going up and down
these steep stairways, stone

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.154
corridors, the four stories
of the fortress itself.

00:04:46.154 --> 00:04:47.570
So you're physically
on your feet,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.740
and you're moving to follow
the show as it moves.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.310
Now, within that, you actually
get to choose and change

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.420
your perspective from
which you view the show.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.210
And this is where that more
personal level of participation

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.631
and choice and perspective
starts to really drop in

00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:02.880
because you can choose to
get really close to an actor

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.360
and be really, really
right next to them,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.580
or you can kind of draw back and
kind of get a bigger picture.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.920
If you are briefly distracted
by a flock of birds flying

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.340
overhead, or by the full moon
rising behind the warriors

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.715
as they battle to their death
on the roof, or the sunset,

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:19.730
or whatever other kind of
miraculous participation

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.030
from nature, that's totally
invited and, in fact, very much

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.640
part of the work.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.710
Because, while the shows are
very carefully constructed--

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.720
and I'm very dedicated to
telling the story of the play

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.300
as clearly and as
effectively as I

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.240
can-- part of staging
things in these kind

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.030
of multi-dimensional
stages, where

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.690
we're able to use distance and
proximity to our advantage,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.439
is that you can't possibly catch
everything by seeing it once.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.730
There's just too much going on.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.620
There's too much
detail in the space.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.950
And that my hope is that
in kind of participating

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.110
in the theatrical experience
in this way that we become

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.370
a little bit more adept at
paying attention to what's

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.642
happening above us,
behind us, below us,

00:06:01.642 --> 00:06:02.600
and this kind of thing.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.058
And that sometimes those really
special things that happen,

00:06:05.058 --> 00:06:07.990
like when a shaft of sunlight
comes in and lights up an actor

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.220
for a moment, of course I
can't get that every day.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.530
The light's changing every day.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.120
Temporality is actually a really
big component of the work.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.450
But when that happens,
and you realize,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.060
oh, my gosh, that's
the sun hitting Hamlet,

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.610
or whatever it
may be, my hope is

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.350
that brings us into a
greater appreciation

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.360
that this is a precious,
unrepeatable moment in time,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.010
and it will never happen
this way exactly again.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.695
Which, if we can practice that
in this kind of heightened

00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:34.320
container of the
theatrical experience,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.370
we might become a
little bit more facile

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.740
at appreciating that in
our day-to-day lives.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.620
So those are kind of some of
the hallmarks of the work,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.170
and I'll talk more
about as we go.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.090
But to give you
some examples, I'm

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.980
starting here with
what is easily

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.460
recognizable as
"Hamlet," although it

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.040
is played by a
woman in this case.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.000
But there's poor Yorick.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.020
And so "Hamlet" was a production
on Alcatraz Island, which

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.910
used the entire island.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.050
So the show starts on
the boat, the ferry,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.960
as you're riding over.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.081
And as you can see, the audience
is physically right there next

00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:08.580
to Hamlet, and
they're following him

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.610
as he is moving
around the island.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.210
In this situation, the
audience is following Hamlet up

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.010
a steep incline, and Hamlet
is chasing his father's ghost.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.324
And this is a
representation of the ghost.

00:07:20.324 --> 00:07:22.740
So one of the things I was
able to do with this production

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.340
is actually, through
this costume choice,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.100
have six different actors
dressed in this way,

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.940
and so we were
literally able to create

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.106
that effect of the ghost
appearing and disappearing.

00:07:32.106 --> 00:07:35.060
Now on the top of the
guard tower 100 feet above

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.890
your head, now on
top of the cellhouse,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.680
now in a window, and
then disappearing.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.416
So that as Hamlet's
running up the stairs

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:42.540
and seeing the ghost in
all these different places,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.300
the audience is having that same
experience following Hamlet.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.900
Where is the ghost
going to appear next?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.200
So again, that's kind
of one of the ways

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.180
of blowing out the stage space
and having that kind of really

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.887
multi-dimensional experience.

00:07:54.887 --> 00:07:57.220
This gives you a little bit
of a sense of our backdrops.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.830
Our scenic designer
is quite remarkable.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.970
But of course, you have the Bay
Bridge and San Francisco city

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.110
skyline.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.080
And these are some of the
just really precious things

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.190
about working in real
spaces that, of course,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.740
you can't achieve in
an indoor theater,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.880
actually having that
relationship to where

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.220
you've come from.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.540
You can see where you got
on the boat, San Francisco,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.510
and where you are now.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.780
That's the parade ground
on Alcatraz Island.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.530
These are old rubble
piles from what

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.520
used to be large buildings.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.830
Hey, welcome.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.730
So again, this kind of distance
and proximity thing, sometimes

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.340
the actors are right up there
with you really close to you

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.010
and interacting
directly, so there's

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.080
this real immediacy
and real visceral

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.860
experience with the actors.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.202
And again, every
scene is kind of

00:08:53.202 --> 00:08:54.910
specifically chosen
for different places.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.380
So the show itself is
chosen for the site.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.005
So Alcatraz is not a great place
for "Midsummer Night's Dream,"

00:09:00.005 --> 00:09:03.036
but it's a perfect
place for "Hamlet."

00:09:03.036 --> 00:09:04.410
But then within
that, after we've

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.520
chosen the show for
the space, then there's

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.390
the particulars of what scene,
what text, which monologues

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.170
happen where, and how can the
space and the story mutually

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.226
enhance each other?

00:09:15.226 --> 00:09:17.100
So when Hamlet's standing
there on the parade

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.600
ground with the
cellhouse behind him

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.090
and talking about
"Denmark's a prison,"

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.920
and "Oh, I could be
bounded in a nutshell

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.140
and count myself a
king of infinite space,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.210
were it not that I
have bad dreams."

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.715
He doesn't have to gesture
and gesticulate wildly

00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:33.230
to the prison to kind of get
what he means on a deeper level

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.510
and on a more visceral level.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.280
So similarly, I'll sort
of use ways of positioning

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.692
the audience to inform or affect
how you're receiving the text.

00:09:42.692 --> 00:09:44.233
So here, Hamlet's
going through, "Oh,

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:45.971
what a rogue and
peasant slave am I."

00:09:45.971 --> 00:09:48.470
And this is where he's feeling
"cabined, cribbed, confined,"

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.360
and trying to work out how he's
going to deal with the king,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.860
catching the
conscience of the king.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.970
So we have Hamlet
behind this chain link

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.790
fence and the audience
watching the scene through it.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.980
And this is actually an example
of when that shaft of sunlight

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.480
came.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.770
And on this one
particular day, it just so

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.870
happened the photographer
was there on that day

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.080
to catch this moment,
which, again, doesn't happen

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.610
all the time, but when it
does it's really precious,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:17.120
and you suddenly realize
there's a sense of wonder

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.340
that I think that we're
trying to achieve in theater.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.130
And when nature can sort of
step in and contribute to that,

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.890
it's pretty remarkable
and precious, I think.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.300
Again, here you have a real
closeness of the audience,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.636
and the actors were in the
hospital in the cellhouse here.

00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:37.010
And that's been
one of the things

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.010
as well, working with the
National Park Service, that's

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.551
been really special
is getting access

00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:42.036
to the closed areas of the site.

00:10:42.036 --> 00:10:44.410
So when you go to Alcatraz
Island, there's a lot of areas

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.500
that you actually
can't go into that we

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.083
were able to bring
our audiences into.

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:49.990
So you get to have this
really intimate relationship

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:51.202
with the space as well.

00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:53.160
And one of the things
that's so precious for me

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.230
is actually getting
to see the audience

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.640
and getting to see how
it's affecting them.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.052
So they're not somewhere
out in a dark theater,

00:11:01.052 --> 00:11:02.260
they're actually right there.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.510
And that is both
wonderful and absolutely

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.666
horrible for the actors
because you don't get to hide.

00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:10.040
Everything is
really transparent.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.070
Everything is really immediate.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.110
And so if the audience
is totally engaged,

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.880
as they are here with
Ophelia after she's just

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.180
gone through the sort
of worst breakup ever,

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.937
you can see the
empathy on their faces,

00:11:23.937 --> 00:11:25.520
and they're really
connected with her.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.010
Of course, if it's
not going well,

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.711
and they're like staring off,
then that's also revealed.

00:11:29.711 --> 00:11:31.210
So there's this
kind of transparency

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.130
that is kind of a
curse and a blessing,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.170
but really unique
for the actors,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.887
and you get to feed off
of the audience in a more

00:11:39.887 --> 00:11:40.470
immediate way.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.060
Yeah?

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.680
AUDIENCE: How do you deal
with the practical stuff

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.920
like costume changes?

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.660
If everyone's following
Hamlet around all the time,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.720
and he has to change
clothes, where does he go?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.050
AVA ROY: Yeah.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.633
Well, the audience gets to have
a pretty intimate relationship

00:11:51.633 --> 00:11:54.470
with the island, but we have an
even more intimate relationship

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.220
with these spaces.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.710
We really learn a lot
about all the secret kind

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.665
of nooks and crannies.

00:11:58.665 --> 00:12:00.790
You would be amazed at what
some of our green rooms

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.998
and dressing rooms look like.

00:12:01.998 --> 00:12:04.040
I mean, sometimes
they're decent.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.900
But sometimes they are little,
tiny corners of the island,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.060
or a little, like,
an old gardening

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.360
shed becomes a quick
costume change location.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.840
And that's actually a big
part of my process as well.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.360
I spend a lot of
time on the site,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.270
long before the actors come.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.150
So even longer before the
audience comes, really

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.660
getting to know the space.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.132
And it sounds maybe
a little funny,

00:12:28.132 --> 00:12:29.590
but in addition to
kind of learning

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.390
about the practical stuff, about
where's our green room going

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.181
to be, and where are
the bathrooms, and all

00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:37.170
those things, it's also
a lot about a real sort

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.885
of intuitive relationship
with the space.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.010
There's a lot of times
where I just go to the site,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.690
and I listen and try to
really listen to the site

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.890
and hear what it's saying.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.970
I really believe that
stones hold memories,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.790
and that all the spaces
we inhabit have a history,

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.300
and that history is there.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.895
And if we quiet ourselves enough
and slow down enough to tune

00:12:56.895 --> 00:12:59.820
in, we might actually hear some
of those echoes of the past.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.000
And that's more obvious
when you go to, like, Greece

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.550
or somewhere where there's
really ancient ruins.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.410
And it's somehow more
immediate to feel

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.730
that sense of that our
ancestors and ancient people

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.230
have walked those
stones, and that's

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:17.490
why the cobblestones in
an old town are smooth.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.680
You can feel that those
feet have walked over it.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.400
Well, that's true even when
it's a little bit harder

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.390
to access in some of our
more localized spaces

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.000
or our more immediate spaces.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.779
So there's a lot of spending
time in the space checking out,

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:32.820
what does the light do at
different times of day?

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.820
What's the weather like?

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.540
What are the natural
traffic patterns?

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.650
What are the birds doing?

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.290
What is the time of year are
we going to be in the space?

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.780
What phase is the moon in?

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.270
And letting all of those things,
both on a practical level

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.780
in terms of rain and wind
and those kinds of concerns,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.640
as well as on an
energetic level.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.387
Both work to kind of support
how the show works in the space.

00:13:54.387 --> 00:13:55.970
And here you can see
the audience kind

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.490
of backing up Hamlet and Horatio
as they walk to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.000
for the final battle with
the city behind them.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.319
And the final view of the
show, where you actually

00:14:07.319 --> 00:14:09.610
get a sense of the relationship
of some of these photos

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.140
I've showed you to where the
cellhouse and the lighthouse

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.680
is itself.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.766
So from Alcatraz-- we
did that show in 2010.

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:17.390
We actually had a
three-year residency,

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.015
so there was a couple
of other projects

00:14:19.015 --> 00:14:22.920
we did out there as well, but
"Hamlet" happened in 2010.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.680
And then we went over
to Hyde Street Pier.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.055
This is Alice Watts, who's
the first mate of the schooner

00:14:27.055 --> 00:14:29.390
"Alma." "Alma" is a
150-year-old scow schooner.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.632
She's the only boat in
the SF Maritime Fleet

00:14:32.632 --> 00:14:33.715
that actually still sails.

00:14:35.886 --> 00:14:38.260
This is actually from the
stern of the "Balclutha," which

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.410
is another boat at
Hyde Street Pier.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.630
Those are the actors
up on the stern,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.350
or what's called the poop
deck of the "Balclutha."

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.580
She's a three-masted
tall ship who's

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.666
actually sailed around
the horn 17 times, which

00:14:51.666 --> 00:14:53.540
is kind of cool in terms
of that relationship

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.539
to history and the past.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:56.060
This is before engines.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.140
This is before there
was a Panama Canal.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.150
So it's pretty amazing
to step foot on that boat

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.710
and feel that she
has this history,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.850
and that we get to play and
uncover some of her stories

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.010
through telling these stories.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.080
So back to "Alma."

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.300
This is the Cyclops
eating Barbies

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.670
on the stern of the
"Alma" while sailing.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.100
So this show was a production
of the "Odyssey" that took place

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.734
on "Alma," so she was a
60-foot floating stage.

00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:26.150
Something that's
cool about a scow

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.130
is they're a flat-bottomed boat.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.640
They were the original barges.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.670
So these were sailing barges
that would move hay and produce

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.920
back and forth from the San
Francisco Bay to the delta

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.257
and back and forth, and
so she doesn't heel.

00:15:36.257 --> 00:15:38.590
So for an audience, it's
basically like a floating stage

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.200
because you don't have the
classic sailboat bottom,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.770
and so we don't
heel side to side.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.610
It's like a raft with sails.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.980
So it's a really stable
vessel for a show.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.884
And here we are sailing past
our previous stage, Alcatraz.

00:15:50.884 --> 00:15:52.550
And that's been one
of the things that's

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.309
been pretty cool over
the past few years

00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:56.100
is now looking out on
the San Francisco Bay

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.040
and seeing all of these
stages and all of these places

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.780
that have been transformed.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.990
And that's one of my
favorite pieces of feedback

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.040
from audience members
is that they say,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.490
Alcatraz is now Denmark forever.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.740
Angel Island is now
Greece and Ithaca

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.040
and the home of Odysseus's
trials and tribulations.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.510
So these spaces are
transformed, and that's

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.690
something so special
about theater, right?

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.060
It's this ephemeral thing.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.750
It's birth as a death.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.036
It happens, and we let
it go, and it evaporates.

00:16:26.036 --> 00:16:27.410
And it's, as I
was saying before,

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.870
this kind of precious
and unrepeatable moment

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.652
that flies away,
but it can live on,

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:34.360
when it's really
effective, in the hearts

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.750
and minds and psyches of the
people who experienced it.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.250
And so that's one of the things
that's really rewarding well

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.958
after the fact, when
people come and they

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.660
say that these sites
have been transformed.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.630
And furthermore, that we've been
able to expose a lot of people

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.050
to these really incredible
gems of our local landscape

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.440
that people didn't know about.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.240
A lot of people don't know
that Hyde Street Pier exists.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.531
They don't want to go down
to Fisherman's Wharf because

00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:56.410
of the dense tourist experience.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.430
But if you just brave
it a little bit further,

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.660
you find this incredible park
and these incredible boats.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.660
And you can see kind of
closeness to the actors,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.150
so it's really happening in
front of you, around you,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.940
amongst you, and so forth,
as well as above you.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.640
Here we commissioned
some artists

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.130
to paint giant
backdrops on sails.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.310
So we have this kind of
10-foot eye painted on a sail

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.339
to help us tell the
story of the Cyclops.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.839
And we also were able to send
Hermes up aloft on the mast,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.380
so he's about 80
feet above your head

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.120
on the top of the rig
as the god Hermes.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.820
And then from the
stern of "Alma,"

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.560
you can look out and
see Angel Island,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.070
which was our next stage.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.087
So we continued with this
theme of the "Odyssey"

00:17:37.087 --> 00:17:39.170
for a couple of years, and
then took the "Odyssey"

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:39.970
to Angel Island.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.170
So while it was first a show
on a 60-foot floating stage,

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.470
we then blew that out
to a five-hour show

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.050
that encompassed a
five-mile perimeter out

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.830
around an 800-acre stage,
which was Angel Island.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.990
So here is Telemachus,
Odysseus's son,

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.000
waiting at the
beach in Ayala Cove

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.220
as the ferry full of
audience members arrive.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.410
And as soon as you arrive,
part of the idea, again, as I

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.240
was talking about before,
that the sphere of performance

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.820
is that we try to create an
experience where you feel

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.120
like the world exists
with or without you.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.190
And so you get to participate
for a time, and in this case,

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.150
when you arrive as audience
members from the ferry,

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.520
you step right into Ithaca.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.505
And the suitors are
playing games, and jeering,

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:27.820
and drinking, and partying,
and barbecuing meat,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.490
and you're sort of
brought right into it

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.495
and encouraged to play
tug of war with them

00:18:31.495 --> 00:18:33.250
or eat from the
barbecue or drink.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.400
And so there's this
whole world kind

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.490
of already happening that
you get to step into.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.850
Again, you get a sense
of distance as well.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.890
So we're close
Telemachus in this scene,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.020
but Mentor is appearing up
on the hillside behind him.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.200
This photo doesn't capture
it, but even behind him,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.992
even farther up the hill,
is Athena overlooking.

00:18:54.992 --> 00:18:56.450
So again, you get
to kind of really

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.130
challenge your own perspective
in terms of looking both

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.140
what's in the foreground as
well as what's in the distance.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.995
And here's the intrepid
audience trekking along

00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:07.386
after Telemachus.

00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:09.260
And it's a long journey,
and it was certainly

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.400
part of the intention to send
the audience on an odyssey

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.070
themselves.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.790
And it would sort of crack me
up when people after the show

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.420
would say, but I'm still
hungry, and I'm so tired.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.620
It's, like, yeah, yeah.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.360
Good work.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:24.860
You are.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.540
You should be.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.510
It was five hours of hard work.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.180
So we went to many different
worlds on Angel Island.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.610
With an 800-acre
stage, you can imagine

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.720
that there's many different
environments within that.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.404
So on the windward side of
the island, where we are now,

00:19:39.404 --> 00:19:40.820
there's lots of
wind, and you have

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.400
the view of the
Golden Gate Bridge.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.320
And so that was a good
setting for Aeolia.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.720
Aeolus was the king of the wind.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.110
So this is where we went
for the king of the wind

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.470
and used the wind
as much as possible,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.350
so using lots of
fabrics and kites

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.385
and things that embrace
the wind in that land.

00:19:58.385 --> 00:20:00.010
And you can see the
Golden Gate Bridge,

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.260
which, again, is a kind of
incredible scenic backdrop

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.657
that you don't get
in an indoor space.

00:20:04.657 --> 00:20:06.240
And some days there
would be regattas,

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.000
and there would be sailboats
going by and pretty fun stuff.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.360
And again, you can kind of
see Alcatraz behind Telemachus

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.375
and the city behind him.

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:19.260
So this awareness of just
expanding our relationship

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.730
to how we relate to the
spaces that we inhabit

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.550
and the spaces that we live in.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.470
So as we're moving
around the island,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.930
as you curve around the
west side of the island

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.030
and start heading east a little
bit, you get to the old quarry.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.890
And actually, this quarry,
a lot of the stone that

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.680
was quarried there
is at the foundation

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.340
of the financial district
in San Francisco and also

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.160
became Mount Olympus, which
has kind of a nice metaphor,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.683
but more importantly,
it's an 80-foot cliff.

00:20:48.683 --> 00:20:51.300
And that created
a really nice way

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.720
to actually have that feeling
of looking up at the gods

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.360
and then being truly
towering over you.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.947
So the gods were up there.

00:20:57.947 --> 00:20:59.280
You can imagine it in rehearsal.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.330
This is kind of
hilarious in terms

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.880
of directing because you're
yelling up to your actors, OK,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.610
more like this.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.420
Move to the left.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.700
Hike up that hill, come back
down, get notes, hike back up.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.620
And I'm focusing, of
course, on the joys

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.420
of how nature contributes.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.820
Often there was an eagle
that-- not an eagle, a hawk,

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.450
a red-tailed hawk that
nests nearby the quarry that

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.960
would often fly right over
Zeus's head during the scene.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.050
I mean, it's just
an amazing thing.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.050
Especially for people who
know a little bit more

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.710
about Greek mythology, you
know Zeus's relationship

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.700
to eagles and birds of prey.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.090
Some of the not-so-awesome
things that happen sometimes

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.410
when nature contributes
is there was also

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.660
a family of geese that decided
to nest on the hillside.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.330
And that became really
borderline for a while

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.840
there, because if those
eggs were to hatch,

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.900
we would not be able to use
Mount Olympus as Mount Olympus.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.840
And there was, obviously,
no other choice for that.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.300
So while it's fun to focus on
all of the really positive ways

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.805
that nature contributes, and
for the most part, that's

00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:07.680
my experience, there's
certainly some things.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.470
When a helicopter goes overhead
at exactly the wrong moment,

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.100
and you're in this
really deep soliloquy,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.270
and you either have to wait
for it or shout over it.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.321
But in any medium, whether
it's art or otherwise,

00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:21.820
there's constraints
and affordances,

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.520
and you work within that.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.070
So for me, a lot of the
affordances and blessings

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.830
of the environment far
outweigh the constraints,

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.190
even though there
were a lot of ticks

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.900
at the bottom of Mount
Olympus and things like that.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.790
That's not so great.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.740
So after rehearsal
in Mount Olympus,

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.330
everyone's doing
their tick check.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.060
So it's a pretty
unique kind of actor

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.110
as well for whom this is
a good fit because it's

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.490
certainly very
demanding physically.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.050
There's a lot of old
batteries on Angel Island.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.370
Angel Island actually
has 130 years

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:01.470
of military history, which
is kind of rather unknown.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.410
A lot of people focus
on the immigration story

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.950
on Angel Island, which is
a really important part

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.949
of the island's history.

00:23:05.949 --> 00:23:09.270
But there's also a huge and
longstanding military history,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.990
and so there's
these old batteries

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.530
from World War I
and World War II.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.363
This was the Cyclops'
cave, and the audience

00:23:14.363 --> 00:23:20.849
was locked inside this dark
cave and needed to escape.

00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:22.390
And actually, when
you step outside--

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.848
I don't have a
photo of this here--

00:23:23.848 --> 00:23:27.461
but when you step outside,
we felled a eucalyptus tree,

00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:28.960
which are non-native,
and so they're

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.724
trying to thin them out
on Angel Island anyway,

00:23:31.724 --> 00:23:32.640
so we played our part.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.650
But we felled a eucalyptus
tree and shaved the end of it

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.696
down to a spike, and
it's covered in blood.

00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:40.820
So when you actually step
out of the Cyclops' cave,

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.941
if you know the
story, you realize

00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:44.440
that this is the
stake that Odysseus

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.785
has used to poke out
the Cyclops' eye.

00:23:47.785 --> 00:23:50.160
And something that's cool is,
if you don't get the story,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.050
you're not left out.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.758
What actually happens
is that when you're

00:23:52.758 --> 00:23:55.130
walking from site to site,
you start to overhear--

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.380
and I'm often sort of incognito
in the audience tuning

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.460
in to this-- and you
start to overhear

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.899
people talking to each other,
and people explaining it.

00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:03.440
And one of the most
remarkable things

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.460
is that little kids are some
of the best interpreters

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.920
because they're
totally able to engage.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.170
They're not sitting in a seat.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.760
Well, none of us are, but
we're moving and moving around.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.270
So the kids really get to
run and follow the actors

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.560
and get up really close.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.140
And because of the Percy Jackson
and "The Lightning Thief"

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.610
phenomenon, they know the
"Odyssey" really well.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.810
So it was amazing to be walking
on the trail between scenes

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.602
and hear people
talking to each other

00:24:28.602 --> 00:24:31.060
and asking each other questions,
audience members who maybe

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.310
didn't come together and
maybe didn't know each other,

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.780
and then little kids chiming
in and giving more information

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.350
about, no, no, no, that was
Circe and that's Calypso.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.110
So that's pretty
special, that parents

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.109
get to bring their kids.

00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:43.600
And it's not a
kid's show, but both

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.852
get to really experience
it in a full way.

00:24:47.852 --> 00:24:49.560
There's also some
audience participation.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.370
I focused on just the moving
and following the shows.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.730
There's some situations where
you can choose your path,

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.364
and you can only choose
one, like in life.

00:24:58.364 --> 00:24:59.780
So here we meet
at the crossroads,

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.380
and Zeus meets you
there, and says,

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.110
you can go one of
three directions.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.854
You can go to the
island of Temenos,

00:25:04.854 --> 00:25:06.520
where sacred beauties
will anoint to you

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.228
and sing to you and
soothing and whatnot.

00:25:08.228 --> 00:25:10.609
It was secretly
the best way to go.

00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:12.150
But most people felt
like they needed

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.390
to prove their mettle in
the obstacle course, which

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.260
was held on the Nike
Missile launching site.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.910
So that's a Cold War site with
subterranean missile silos,

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.690
and we transformed that into the
land of Scylla and Charybdis,

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.070
two of the most fearsome,
loathsome creatures

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.130
known to mortals.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.160
And the third option
was to climb up a hill,

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.830
hike up a little hill, and cheer
on the hero of your choice.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.380
So here, Zeus gives
you that choice,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.202
and you can either
run, literally run,

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:38.160
to the obstacle course.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.743
You can hike up the
hill and watch it.

00:25:39.743 --> 00:25:41.750
Or you can follow the
bard, [INAUDIBLE],

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.040
who will sing to you as
you go to the chapel.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.619
So you have these options.

00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:48.160
Here's Zeus up on
the hill with those

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.980
who chose to watch
the obstacle course.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.920
And these are tentacles
of Scylla coming up

00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:02.120
from the silos, and the audience
braving their way through.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.050
At some points, you
meet Hermes on the path.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.430
He often is on various golden
things, golden scooters,

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.240
golden bicycles,
golden transport.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.880
And this is the
island of Temenos.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.470
And I want to pause
here just briefly

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.210
because, while only less than a
third of the overall audiences

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:24.170
actually got to see this
scene, this location was

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.500
a place that some things
happened that really reminded

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.470
me and gave me so
much fuel and juice

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.230
for why put in all
the work to do this.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.780
I'm really interested in
ritual, and that performance

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.880
is born out of ritual,
the first storytellers who

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.880
were gathering around
fires and telling stories.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.380
And so I'm really
interested in what

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.140
ritual can teach us to make our
modern-day performances more

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.630
than entertainment and something
really sacred and really

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.640
special, or at least create
the possibility for that.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.580
And that happened on
a number of occasions,

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.329
where there were no
words in the scene.

00:26:56.329 --> 00:26:58.870
There were three women dressed
all in white in an old chapel,

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.520
in a World War II-era
chapel, and they

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.080
were singing
beautiful harmonies.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.490
And you came in,
and they just sang.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.610
They didn't speak.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.444
But you would walk in and every
traveler, every weary traveler,

00:27:10.444 --> 00:27:11.110
they'd bring in.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.300
You were like three hours
into this five-hour ride

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.492
at this point, so you
are tired and hot.

00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:17.450
And they bring you in,
and they wash your hands

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.230
with eucalyptus-scented water.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.640
And they walk around, and
they dip flowers in cold water

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.470
and touch it to your forehead.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.070
And really, really
simple gestures

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.360
that have no
religious connotation,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.867
but I saw so many people
walk up and receive it

00:27:31.867 --> 00:27:33.700
as if they were receiving
communion, I mean,

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.100
actually bow to these women
with tears in their eyes.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.620
And when the women
would come around

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.370
with these little flowers, they
were like flowers to the light,

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.010
like, don't forget
me, don't forget me.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.980
And for me, that was a
really precious reminder

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.390
of what can happen.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.110
That there was a kind
of spiritual energy

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:53.270
and a kind of real
communion with the actors

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.270
and with the environment
and with what happened.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.330
And this, again, was
without any words

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:01.000
and without any telling you
how to feel and without, again,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.520
any religious connotation,
but some really special energy

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.995
was shared in that space.

00:28:05.995 --> 00:28:08.320
So it reminded me that
that's, in addition

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.850
to being really grand
and glorious and fun,

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.190
that it can also be
really sublime as well.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.420
You travel to Circe's house.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.330
I'll move fairly
quickly through these.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.130
We went to the
House of the Dead,

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:25.480
which is a stage in
an old hospital, kind

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.970
of burned-out skeleton
of a building.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.430
The dead emerge on four
floors above your heads.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.315
We go down to a
beach where Calypso

00:28:33.315 --> 00:28:35.430
is and wants to
keep you forever.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.820
And Hermes appears on
his latest golden ride,

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.507
his golden speedboat.

00:28:40.507 --> 00:28:42.090
So again, this is
one of those things,

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.760
you know, you're four
and a half hours in,

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.930
and your back is to the water,
and you're facing Calypso.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.080
And you think, this
is pretty nice.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.210
All these beautiful
women who just want to,

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.490
like, massage my hands and
take care of me forever.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.364
And the next thing you
know, from behind you,

00:28:52.364 --> 00:28:55.520
you hear this sound of
trumpets, and you turn around,

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.400
and there's Hermes
and his entourage.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.300
So besides using
levels, in this case

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.530
we also got to use the water
in the distance behind you.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.450
Here's Hermes showing off.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:09.300
That Hermes.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.500
And we leave Angel Island, and
we move to Hyde Street Pier.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.000
This is Hyde Street
Pier, which I've

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.810
talked a little
bit about already.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.400
This is a hysterical
shipwrecked woman in a rowboat.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.820
So this is "Twelfth
Night," which

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.210
starts out with a shipwreck.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.730
And so the audience
actually met on the beach

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.188
and didn't really
know it was going

00:29:27.188 --> 00:29:29.030
to happen until
they started hearing

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.500
these wailing sobs of a woman
on a rowboat, who then jumps out

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.422
of the water and runs
up onto the beach.

00:29:35.422 --> 00:29:36.880
And we actually
got a lot of people

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.097
who would call in
and say, there's

00:29:39.097 --> 00:29:40.430
a hysterical woman on the beach.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:41.080
What's going on?

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.621
And luckily, all of
our park partners

00:29:42.621 --> 00:29:46.360
were able to pretty quickly
translate that, no, it's OK.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.920
And then from there, the
show moves down the pier,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.816
and we use all of the
different boats in this case.

00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:54.190
So you can see
the audience close

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.810
to the actors on the
pier, the audience,

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.422
actually, on the other side of
the pier watching from a boat.

00:30:00.422 --> 00:30:01.880
So we're just trying
to use as much

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.340
of the full and total
environment as possible.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.950
Again, proximity
with the audience.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.750
It's pretty fun to
get these moments

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.040
of people's appreciation.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.248
This woman's feeling pretty
tickled about being right

00:30:12.248 --> 00:30:16.040
next to that actor, and
of course, Malvolio.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.650
If we have time later, I'll
show you some video of the show.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.467
But I'd like to move on
just so that I can tell you

00:30:22.467 --> 00:30:24.800
a little bit about "Macbeth,"
which is the current show.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.940
So we're three
weeks into the run.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.570
We have three weeks left,
Thursday through Sunday,

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.660
"Macbeth at Fort Point."

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.730
And this is the fortress.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.330
So when you step
inside, this is a sense

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.830
of what it's like inside with
the Golden Gate Bridge soaring

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.880
overhead and the
three sisters working

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.960
their charms on the heath.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.130
And one of the things that's
really amazing at Fort Point,

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.200
and there are so many
things, and in fact,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.010
in all of these shows, that the
natural sonic landscape really

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.015
informs your experience.

00:30:54.015 --> 00:30:57.540
So here at Fort Point, you
have the crashing of the waves

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.440
up against the
fortress walls, which

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.220
is sort of mirrored by the
sound of the rumbling traffic

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.370
over your head.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.430
And on foggy days, every
five seconds or so,

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.500
you get this deep, low
base note of the foghorn.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.230
So our music director
is really trying

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.296
to incorporate these
sounds into and embrace

00:31:14.296 --> 00:31:15.170
what's already there.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.890
So we're not trying
to push that away.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.067
We're saying, yes, this
is what the space is like.

00:31:19.067 --> 00:31:20.650
That's why it's
perfect for "Macbeth,"

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:25.360
and how can we have our
work kind of merge with that

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.840
rather than push against it?

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.554
The fortress, this is kind
of within the interior space.

00:31:32.554 --> 00:31:34.720
So sometimes you're on the
open heath in the middle.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.136
Sometimes you're
moving in and out

00:31:36.136 --> 00:31:39.864
of these kind of dark
corridors and so forth.

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:42.030
And it's pretty incredible
as you're walking around.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.380
I mean, at first, you're just
like, OK, seven million bricks.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.796
And then you get
in close, and you

00:31:45.796 --> 00:31:49.030
realize there are vibrant
lichens of all different colors

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.270
growing on the walls, and
there's all these patinas

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.670
that you would spend a lifetime
in a stage shop creating

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.754
that are just natural
because it's so old.

00:31:58.754 --> 00:32:00.170
Again, it gives
you a little sense

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.925
of the scale of the space.

00:32:01.925 --> 00:32:03.800
And as an audience,
you're moving up and down

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.210
all the levels of the space.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.030
The three sisters are kind
of omnipresent in a way.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.700
They also act as the
servants, and so they

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.120
can be anywhere and
everywhere, so they're

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.180
sort of watching and observing.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.230
And they are the ways
that the walls have ears,

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:24.790
so they're gathering
all of this information

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.262
throughout the show.

00:32:27.262 --> 00:32:29.070
There's poor, dead Bankwell.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.780
And here as well, there's
two different groups.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.832
Sometimes you're moving
all as one group.

00:32:35.832 --> 00:32:37.790
Sometimes you're splitting
into multiple groups

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.740
and seeing things in
a different order.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.380
Sometimes you're seeing things
from different vantage points.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.680
So every site kind
of has its own way

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.250
of informing how
we move through.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.090
With Angel Island, it
was fairly processional,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.570
one route all the way around.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.650
With other sites
like Fort Point,

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.017
because some of the areas
are so confined and narrow,

00:32:57.017 --> 00:32:58.850
and you can only fit
so many people in them,

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.650
we'll break you up and
have you see things

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.485
in different order and
different vantages.

00:33:03.485 --> 00:33:05.360
And sometimes you actually
get to go indoors,

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.705
which is a rare treat, and
encounter strange and sort

00:33:10.705 --> 00:33:15.320
of inverted domestic tasks
that the witches are up to.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.170
Again, just another
sense of the scale

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:25.130
of the space, interior space,
and the poor, dead Macduff.

00:33:28.367 --> 00:33:30.700
And then, one of the things
that's really fun about this

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.080
show-- I don't know if fun is
the right word for "Macbeth"--

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.870
but that we start in
the daylight, and that,

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:42.060
as the play descends into deeper
and deeper darkness of psyche

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.260
and soul, the light
descends as well.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.810
And I mentioned very briefly
earlier about temporality

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.710
and how season and time
plays a big role in this.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.280
So that's the
durational experience

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.210
of the "Odyssey," being
on a five-hour ride

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:59.640
and feeling tired and hungry and
getting cranky at some point,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.110
and then getting
your second wind,

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.520
and that aspect of temporality.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.240
But certainly also relationship
to natural daylight

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.596
and the change of light and how
that can work with the show.

00:34:09.596 --> 00:34:11.429
And here you have the
audience participating

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:14.300
as Birnam Wood is
storming the castle.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.870
Hi.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.179
So that gives you
just a little bit

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:22.920
of a sense of some of the
ways that we use space.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.260
And again, that
every single site

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.770
has its own constraints
and affordances and stories

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.170
and energies and
can really inform

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.929
how we use the space,
how we move through it.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:38.120
As much as possible trying to
have the sound and the costumes

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.070
all really feel like
they belong to the space,

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.194
and they come from the
space, rather than something

00:34:42.194 --> 00:34:45.574
where we're bringing onto it.

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:46.558
Yeah.

00:34:46.558 --> 00:34:47.170
Yeah?

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.920
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about the evolution

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.820
of this entire concept
from a personal standpoint?

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.531
AVA ROY: Sure.

00:34:53.531 --> 00:34:54.030
Yeah.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.655
AUDIENCE: How did
you come to do this--

00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:57.597
murder mystery
theater or, you know--

00:34:57.597 --> 00:34:58.930
AVA ROY: No, I went to Stanford.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.960
That's how it happened.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.980
What does that mean?

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.480
Yeah.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.980
So I went to Stanford,
and I grew up

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.300
in a very small town in
Western Massachusetts.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.745
But that small town has a
company called Shakespeare

00:35:08.745 --> 00:35:10.860
and Company, so I grew
up studying Shakespeare

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.651
and performing in lots
of Shakespeare shows

00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:14.220
since I was, like, 12 or 13.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.636
So I had a real passion
for Shakespeare.

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:19.010
But then when I
got to Stanford--

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.470
I had never visited the campus.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.270
And honestly, I
just felt at a loss.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.353
I felt like I was on this
really, really beautiful

00:35:24.353 --> 00:35:28.020
country club that I didn't
know how to relate to.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.770
And so, honestly,
starting this company

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.950
was a way of building a personal
relationship with that space.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.610
When I shifted from feeling
like I didn't belong to oh,

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.900
this is my playground.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.330
And what happens if I tie
banners to the clock tower

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.040
and have people use these
incredible stairways

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.810
and sculptures as the backdrop?

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.877
So the shift for me, and that's
been a shift that started there

00:35:47.877 --> 00:35:50.210
that's been fundamental in
the way that I see the world,

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.170
is what happens if
we invite ourselves

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.430
to be citizens of the world?

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.170
And that everywhere
we go, we allow

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.690
ourselves to say, how
do I have a relationship

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.090
to this environment?

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.370
What does that mean for me?

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.900
And so, it really started
as a very personal practice

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.830
of wanting to marry my passion
for Shakespeare with finding

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.734
a way to kind of
belong to the space.

00:36:11.734 --> 00:36:13.650
And then I found that
as I started to do that,

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.440
it became very
much an experiment,

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.466
a social experiment, of
what would people do?

00:36:18.466 --> 00:36:20.090
If Romeo and Juliet
are getting married

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:20.920
in the middle of
the quad, and you

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.470
have to either walk through it
or avoid it to get to class,

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.700
what would people do?

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.790
And so asking that as a question
has just immediately, I mean,

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:35.950
immediately provided so many
amazing encounters and moments

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.140
of beauty and
surprise, where people

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.290
would drop what they were doing
and join the parade because it

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.630
was so precious and so unique.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.940
And so I feel like that really
inspired me to just keep

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.926
asking these questions
and keep asking, what if?

00:36:50.926 --> 00:36:54.830
What's right outside-- what's
right around the corner

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.000
of our imagination?

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.100
What might happen here?

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.070
What has happened here?

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.350
What could happen here?

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.510
So it's very much an
open-ended question

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.270
and a way of relating to space.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.730
And again, doing these shows
throughout the Bay Area,

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.230
it's a big part of
my mission to try

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.296
to get people to
connect with these gems

00:37:11.296 --> 00:37:12.670
of our local
landscape, of places

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.720
that we drive over the
Golden Gate Bridge,

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.170
or we pass by, we pass
through, rather than pausing

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:22.550
in for a time and actually
kind of checking it out

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.710
and being with it.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:28.310
So I think we can kind of
practice that all the time.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.810
Yeah.

00:37:32.226 --> 00:37:34.760
AUDIENCE: How do you deal with
the acoustics in the spaces

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.390
that you work?

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.140
AVA ROY: How do I deal
with the acoustics?

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.120
The acoustics are
really challenging.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.810
One thing is working with
actors who are really

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.840
practiced at breathing
from their bellies.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.420
So in life, this
is useful as well.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.920
When you speak from
your throat, you

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.090
tend to blow your voice out.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.522
And when you speak from a
deep, supported belly breath,

00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:55.730
you can project much further.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.872
So part of it's training
and chops and experience,

00:37:58.872 --> 00:38:00.830
and part of it is just
straight up challenging.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.310
I mean, when you
come to Fort Point,

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.935
it's likely that you won't catch
every single word because when

00:38:04.935 --> 00:38:06.634
the wind comes up
and is fierce, you

00:38:06.634 --> 00:38:09.050
have to be aware, as an actor,
of where the wind is coming

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.290
from and let the wind carry your
voice in the right direction

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.942
rather than the
opposite direction.

00:38:12.942 --> 00:38:14.400
But as I was
mentioning earlier, it

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.770
is one of the constraints of the
spaces, of working in this way,

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.690
is that sound can
really be an issue.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:25.350
But I'm so interested in the
living word and the living body

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:29.310
that I really try to avoid
technology as much as possible.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.040
We use it when we
need to and when

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.610
it will support and
make it possible.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.110
So at Fort Point,
we're using lights

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.050
because the show
happens at night,

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.700
and it's great to embrace that.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.980
But as much as possible, I want
to work with natural elements,

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.810
including the natural
instrument of the voice.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.360
But it's challenging, for sure.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:48.860
Yeah?

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.575
AUDIENCE: Do you start with
the show [INAUDIBLE] location?

00:38:51.575 --> 00:38:53.200
AVA ROY: That's a
really good question,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:39:00.410
and it's a difficult one to
answer because it's both,

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.910
I guess.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.660
That sometimes I have
a long list of shows

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.710
I'm interested in,
and then, as I'm just

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.850
exploring and
scouting, sites will

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.870
emerge that seem like
a really good fit.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.760
And sometimes that first hit
is like, boom, this is it.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.850
"Hamlet on Alcatraz" done.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.640
Like, there's no other
choice, you know?

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.860
And sometimes it's
like, well, OK,

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.561
that seems like a good lead.

00:39:19.561 --> 00:39:21.060
But let me sniff
it out for a while,

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.476
and spend some
time in that space,

00:39:22.476 --> 00:39:24.340
and read the story
while I'm in the space,

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.860
and ask more questions,
and do some research,

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.450
and see if it's
really a good fit.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.020
Sometimes I get
that initial hit,

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.450
and then I go and look at
half a dozen other spaces

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.870
only to come back
to the first one.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.720
And a lot of times,
I go to a space,

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.410
and it's the space
that informs the story.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.520
I go, and I
investigate the site.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.830
And then, through that
being in the place

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.980
and listening to the place
and doing some research,

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.900
the story will emerge.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.110
So it's kind of
a dance, and it's

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.320
a little different
with every location.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.651
Yeah.

00:39:52.651 --> 00:39:53.151
Yeah?

00:39:53.151 --> 00:39:54.567
AUDIENCE: How much
of the audience

00:39:54.567 --> 00:39:56.819
knows what they're
getting in to?

00:39:56.819 --> 00:39:58.360
AVA ROY: That's a
good question, too.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.080
How much of the audience knows?

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.320
Well, you get a fairly
lengthy confirmation email

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.370
when you reserve for We Players
because it's kind of like, this

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.420
is how you need to prepare for
your journey, really, really.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.320
So when you come to the
"Odyssey on Angel Island,"

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.140
it's like, bring water, bring
snacks, wear closed-toed shoes,

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.150
bring sunscreen, wear
hats, and we mean it.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.594
Whereas Fort Point,
forget all that stuff.

00:40:22.594 --> 00:40:23.760
You need your winter parkas.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.240
You need hats, scarves, gloves,
and maybe a flask of whisky.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.530
No, don't say I said that.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.900
So there's lots of
different ways of preparing.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.800
So you do get a
fairly lengthy email.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.960
It's still amazing to me,
even though we have it

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.501
on the website, and we send an
email, and we send a reminder.

00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:42.080
And at the reservation, we say,
do you have something warmer?

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.460
Because that's a cute
dress, but I think

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.310
you're really going to
want a warmer layer.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.880
But there's still people who
show up in the wrong gear,

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.550
and they learn pretty quickly.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.020
But we do really try to
help the audience prepare.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.742
That said, it's also
an acquired skill

00:40:58.742 --> 00:41:00.200
coming to a We
Players performance.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.240
You can really tell the veteran
audiences from the new people

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.370
because they know that when
they hear the music-- music is

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.680
huge in moving the audience.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.740
The pied piper phenomenon
is a real thing.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.220
People will move
without instruction

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.720
to wherever the
sound is coming from

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.520
or where the
musicians are moving.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.010
And so veteran We Players
audience members hear

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.740
that music, and they're moving.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.560
They're there.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.490
They know that you can
get up right up close

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:27.555
and kneel down and be
really close to the actors.

00:41:27.555 --> 00:41:29.430
Where other people kind
of take a little time

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.942
to figure out what's OK.

00:41:31.942 --> 00:41:33.400
And it's really
great because we've

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.460
been doing this for long
enough that we always

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.760
have some of those
more seasoned audience

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.100
members in the crowd
who really help create

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.750
the culture and the
vibe of the audience.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.160
You know, I was talking before
about how for the actors

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.012
it's totally transparent, this
relationship to the audience.

00:41:51.012 --> 00:41:53.220
But that's something pretty
unique about the audience

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.680
as well is that you're
next to each other.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.060
You're not pretending the
person next to you isn't there.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.960
You're negotiating
with each other.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.320
So in a way, it is kind of
this heightened sort of version

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.290
of being in the
world, where you have

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.310
to negotiate with the
people around you.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.726
If someone's taller than you,
and they're in front of you,

00:42:12.726 --> 00:42:13.660
how do you deal?

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.618
Are you proactive, and
you get in front of them

00:42:15.618 --> 00:42:16.960
and kneel down?

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.570
Do you reposition yourself?

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.580
So there's these kind of
like little interesting

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.860
social questions
and experiments that

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.740
are happening within dropping
into this world of the play

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.270
and following the story.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:34.050
CLIFF: So I think one final
question before we head off.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.757
So you use a lot
of the same cast.

00:42:35.757 --> 00:42:37.590
There's a lot of veterans
that come through,

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.375
and you don the actor's mantle
from time to time as well.

00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:43.750
So how do you approach that
in terms of, like, recruiting

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:47.820
people and training folks
to your style of theater,

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.647
and what's it like to
perform in your own shows?

00:42:51.647 --> 00:42:52.230
AVA ROY: Yeah.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:58.270
Well, it's really been
interesting in the past.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:03.030
When I started
this, I was 18, 19.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:05.972
And so I was directing, and
producing, and stage managing,

00:43:05.972 --> 00:43:08.180
and making all the clothes,
and et cetera, et cetera,

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.060
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.630
And so over time, as
things have evolved,

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.360
I've obviously, like
most growing startups,

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.901
have tried to delegate
and share and step out

00:43:21.901 --> 00:43:24.275
of some of those roles so that
I can do the things that I

00:43:24.275 --> 00:43:26.350
am doing more fully.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.980
So to that end, I
sort of stepped away

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.390
from being in the shows until
recently, where one of my,

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.240
actually, oldest teachers, who
I've known since I was like 11,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.912
has become a really close
collaborator of mine.

00:43:36.912 --> 00:43:39.370
And so when I have a co-director
and assistant director who

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.810
I can really trust, then I
feel like I can be in the show.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:45.242
So I actually play Lady Macbeth
in the current production,

00:43:45.242 --> 00:43:46.950
and that's thanks to
having a co-director

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.090
who's really incredible
and who I work well with.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.920
And so it's been really a treat
to be able to kind of stretch

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.870
my acting muscles again,
thanks to having an outside eye

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.090
that I can trust.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:03.420
As far as the actors,
there are kind

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.160
of repeat offenders,
people who I've

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.310
worked with for a few years
and continue to work with.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:12.710
I audition every year, so I'm
always looking for new people.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:19.880
And my auditions are like a
three or four-hour workshop

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.560
experience, so that
alone helps to sift out

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.810
the people who are the right
fit because you don't get

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:29.450
to come in and do a five-minute
monologue and go away.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.440
You have to really commit to
being there for some time.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.400
And for me, that's
both a way of getting

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.620
to know not just how well do
you audition, but how are you?

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:39.890
How do you play?

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:40.730
How do you listen?

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:41.680
How do you work?

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.555
Because that's what
we're really getting into

00:44:43.555 --> 00:44:46.502
is months of working together,
and that's really important.

00:44:46.502 --> 00:44:48.710
And vice versa, I feel like
it's important for actors

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.597
not to just have the director
kind of being all-knowing,

00:44:51.597 --> 00:44:53.180
standing behind the
table judging you,

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.220
but actually, how do I work?

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.922
Do you vibe with how I work?

00:44:56.922 --> 00:44:58.630
Is this going to be
a mutually-beneficial

00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:59.720
collaboration?

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.160
So that's a big part of how the
audition process and a longer,

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.590
more durational
audition process,

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.100
for me, helps sift
out people who

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.700
are a good fit for
this type of work.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.230
And also, holding auditions
for specific shows

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.810
in the site they're
going to be in.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.619
Because if you can't get to
Angel Island for an audition,

00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:20.660
it's probably not going
to work out great for you

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.660
to be there every weekend
for six months or something

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.430
like that.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.520
So for some people
that I've found

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.560
that I've been working
with, they really

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.290
are just so invigorated
by being in these spaces

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.430
and being outdoors.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.810
And it's just not for
everybody, and that's great.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:39.460
It's better to know that and
say, no, I'd rather actually

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.730
be in an indoor space with a
more controlled environment.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.350
So part of it is having
really honest communication

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:48.450
with the people I'm working
with, auditioning in the space,

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.634
doing more durational,
physically-intensive work.

00:45:50.634 --> 00:45:52.800
Because there is kind of
like an actor-athlete thing

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.380
going on, where you have to
hike and climb and be excited

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.430
and turned on by that, not
just willing to survive it.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.010
And I find that for people
who are really into it,

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.770
the elemental forces
actually become

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.980
a source of incredible power.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.960
So when we first started
working at Fort Point,

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.915
it's easy to feel really
overwhelmed by how windy

00:46:14.915 --> 00:46:16.310
and how cold it is.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:18.370
And for some
people, there starts

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.260
to be a shift of
like, actually, I'm

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.590
going to use this
wind and this cold

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:26.230
to empower me rather than feel
totally overwhelmed by it.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.890
So asking those questions
and paying attention

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.570
to how people
respond to the space

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.570
is a big part of
selecting the tribe.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.320
AUDIENCE: Non-Equity?

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.500
AVA ROY: For the
most part, yeah.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.500
It's actually a very
difficult thing,

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.200
because with Equity
rules, the rules

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.380
aren't made for this
type of theater.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.745
So in Equity, it's like you
can't carry your own props.

00:46:47.745 --> 00:46:49.570
Like, well, but if you
have to go two miles

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.390
to get to your next scene,
you might need to carry your--

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:55.312
so it's an interesting
conundrum for sure.

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.020
CLIFF: All right.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.436
Well, Ava, thank you very much
for speaking with us today.

00:46:58.436 --> 00:47:01.090
And we look forward to more
amazing shows in the Bay Area.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:01.430
AVA ROY: Thank you.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.770
CLIFF: So thank you very much.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.380
AVA ROY: Thanks, you guys.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.280
Thanks for having me.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.587
[APPLAUSE]
