00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.870
In April 1851, Alfred C. Hobbs boarded the
steamship Washington bound for Southampton,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.870
England.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.040
His official duty was to sell the New York
City-based company Day and Newell’s newest

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.830
product – the parautopic lock – at a trade
show – London’s Great Exhibition.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.369
But Hobbs had something a bit more nefarious
up his sleeve, or rather in the small trunk

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.939
that accompanied him on the ship.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.580
In it sat a large assortment of picks, wrenches,
rakes, and other slender tools.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.120
You see, Hobbs wasn’t just trying to sell
his locks.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.340
He was trying to prove that his competitors’
locks were, quite simply, not good enough.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.230
He had the tools, skills, and charisma to
do just that.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.540
Alfred Hobbs was about to launch the Great
Lock Controversy of 1851.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.049
Of all the locks at the Great Exhibition in
July of 1851, the “Detector” was thought

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.160
of as top of the class.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.690
Patented in 1818 by Jeremiah Chubb, it had
become the most widely used and prestigious

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.170
lock throughout England.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.460
In fact, in 1823 Chubb was given the distinguished
honor of being the sole supplier of locks

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.400
for England’s post offices and “Her Majesty’s
Prison Service.”

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.540
Chubb_lockBy 1851, Chubb &amp; Son and their “Detector”
lock was so highly respected that they were

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.610
given the assignment of creating a special
security display cage that housed the great

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.330
Koh-i-Noor diamond, a 186 carat diamond that
currently sits in the Crown of Queen Elizabeth

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.770
which is locked in the Tower of London.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.060
Numerous picklocks in London had made attempts
at getting past the Detector with no success.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.670
In one instance, a picklock who had been imprisoned
was offered his freedom if he could figure

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.909
out a way to pick the Detector lock.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.170
He couldn’t do it.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.570
What made the Detector so difficult was that
the lock had a built in anti-lock picking

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.260
mechanism which, if triggered, would render
the lock inoperable, even if you had the key.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.140
This trap worked such that if you lifted one
of the pins beyond what the key would have

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.600
done, it triggered the lockdown mechanism.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.110
By this, you could also tell if someone had
tried to pick the lock, if your key suddenly

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.110
stopped working.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.560
To get the lock to work again, a special regulating
key was needed, which would reset the lock

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.530
such that it could be opened once again with
the normal key.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.849
The “Detector” was thought to be in a
lock class all to itself.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.160
That is, until Hobbs got to it.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.230
According to a report filed by Benji Johnson,
“an agent of the state of New York appointed

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.700
to attend” the Great Exhibition, Hobbs wasted
very little time in proving that Chubb’s

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.280
locks were not impenetrable.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.910
As the report read, “Soon after the exhibition
opened, Mr. A.C. Hobbs, of New York, who had

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.900
charge of Day and Newell’s locks, obtained
one of Chubb’s locks and opened it in a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.880
space of 10 or 15 minutes, in the presence
of several gentlemen.”

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.680
As one would imagine, this did not sit well
with many an Englishmen who were using the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.860
Detector to lock away their homes and valuables;
most of all, it did not sit well with Chubb

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.920
&amp; Son.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.640
They challenged Hobbs to try something a tad
more difficult, a Chubb’s lock attached

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.520
to an iron door of a vault in Westminster
that was a “depository of valuable papers.”

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.790
Hobbs sent out an invitation for them to come
watch him pick, “Gentlemen- An attempt will

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.330
made to open a lock of your manufactured on
the door of a strong room…

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.459
You are respectfully invited to be present
and witness the operation.”

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.819
At approximately 11:35 am, in front of the
iron door in Westminster, Hobbs met his skeptical

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.819
onlookers.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.072
He took out from his “waistcoat two or three
small and simple-looking tools – a description

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:23.319
of which, for obvious reasons, we fear to
give” and went to work.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.680
Within twenty five minutes, he had the lock
open with a “sharp click.”

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.100
He had once again successfully picked a supposedly
impenetrable Chubb lock.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.390
Witnesses, hardly believing their eyes, asked
him to do it again.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.990
So, he relocked the lock and picked it again.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.270
This time in seven minutes and “without
the slightest injury to the lock or door.”

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.010
England’s illusion of the security of their
possessions had been shattered.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.959
After making his presence quite known at London’s
Great Exhibition, Hobbs continued his lock

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.080
picking tour in England.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.379
For instance, later that summer, he picked
the “monster” Bramah Precision lock, which

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.390
had never been picked since it was manufactured
in 1790.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.620
This scared the Bank of England enough that
they had all of their locks swapped out for

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.870
Day &amp; Newell’s.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.730
Dubbed by the newspaper “The Great Lock
Controversy,” the London Times wrote, “We

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.709
believed before the Exhibition opened that
we had the best locks in the world,” but

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.430
no longer after Hobbs’ demonstrations.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.459
Skeptics doubted Hobbs’ ability, asking
if the locks were picked properly, if he had

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.440
cheated, or even, if they hadn’t seen it
themselves, that it was all an urban myth.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.610
Even major publications, while admitting that
Hobbs did do what was asked, doubted his skills.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.319
Said Bankers’ Magazine, “the result of
the experiment has simply shown that, under

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.979
a combination of the most favourable circumstances,
and such as practically could never exist,

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.120
Mr. Hobbs has opened the lock.”

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.539
So how did Hobbs acquire his prodigious lock
picking skills?

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.361
Hobbs father died when Hobbs was just three
years old, so as soon as he could work, he

00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:49.939
did so to help support his family.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.219
Thus, at the age of ten, he began his professional
career as a farmhand.

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:58.089
He eventually moved to wood carving, carriage
building, tinsmithing, and harness making.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:03.599
Around 1835, he earned an apprenticeship with
the Sandwich Glass Company (now a museum sixty

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.080
miles outside of Boston) where he learned
to make doorknobs and the locks that went

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.740
with them; he soon also became very talented
at picking those locks.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.770
He took those skills to Day &amp; Newell and quickly
became a very good salesman.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.410
After all, what’s a better way to sell locks
than to easily pick your competitors’ locks

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.770
in front of your potential customers?

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.259
Before showcasing this talents to Britain
in 1851, Hobbs picked his way across America.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.050
He hopped from town to town calling on banks
to challenge him to open their safes, all

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.389
in the name of selling Day &amp; Newell locks,
of course, and sometimes for prize money.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.210
For instance, according to a story recounted
in A History of the Old Town of Stratford

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.990
and the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut written
in 1888, while on a job in Lancaster, PA replacing

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:51.020
locks at a bank in 1848, a cashier showed
him a newspaper ad placed by a “Mr. Woodbridge,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.300
of Perth Amboy” offering $500 (about $11,000
today) to the person who could open the lock

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.969
on the safe in the New York’s Merchant Exchange
reading room (now the National City Bank Building

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.199
at 55 Wall Street) within thirty days.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.649
Hobbs proclaimed to the clerk, “That is
my money” and left for New York right after

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:11.409
finishing the job in Lancaster.

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.279
Hobbs met his challenger in New York and after
parameters were set: three arbitrators were

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.839
to oversee; he must use instruments of his
own; and if he was not able to open the lock,

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.259
Hobbs would have to sign a certificate declaring
the lock perfectly safe and recommend it to

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.279
the public.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.180
Woodbridge’s lock was extremely cleverly
designed.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.680
Besides having 479,001,600 possible arrangements
of the pins, it was “rigged” such that

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.030
if the bolt was pulled before the tumblers
were perfectly set, anything in the lock would

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.349
be seized and you’d be unable to remove
it, thus making the lock impossible to pick

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.470
at this point with tool(s) stuck inside it.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.619
So the picklock couldn’t try to open the
lock until he or she knew the tumblers were

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:52.270
set just so.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.069
After everyone went home for the day, Hobbs
was given access to the safe and began work

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:57.569
on the lock at nine pm.

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.409
In just two and a half hours, he had figured
out the correct setting for the pins, and

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.229
laced a thin metal wire into the lock to pull
the bolt.

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:08.259
Of course, he needed the arbitrators to witness
what he’d done to get credit, so he waited

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.990
until the following morning when they could
be called upon.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.210
At ten am the next morning.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.409
Mr. Woodbridge, who Hobbs had requested attend
him along with the arbitrators, found Hobbs

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:19.409
standing in front of the safe with a crowd
surrounding him.

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:24.319
Again from A History of the Old Town of Stratford
and the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut:

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.389
Mr. Woodbridge came and there being quite
a crowd around, he called from a distance:

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.279
“Hallo, Mr.Hobbs, what is the trouble?”

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.020
“There is something the matter with the
lock,” said Mr. Hobbs.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.499
“What is it?” said Mr. Woodbridge.

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:39.689
Mr. Hobbs then carefully moving the wire,
pulled the door of the safe open and said,

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:43.229
“Your lock won’t keep the door shut.”

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.259
Carrying around an extensive set of lock picks
during his trip to England wasn’t exactly

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.960
a recipe for smooth relations with the bobbies
who didn’t know who he was.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.689
As such, along with his box of lock picking
tools, Hobbs also carried with him a letter

00:07:54.689 --> 00:08:00.589
from the Chief of Police of New York City,
George Matsell, vouching for Hobbs’ character.

00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:03.929
1851 was a rather vulnerable time for English
citizens.

00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:08.099
It was the first time that England’s urban
population outnumbered the rural population,

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:12.219
meaning more people gathered in small spaces
which made security more of an issue.

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:14.261
Additionally, the Great Exhibition had brought
citizens from across the world, foreigners,

00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.080
to London and to the untrusting eyes of its
citizens.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.520
Plus, a rising middle class valued their possessions
and property immensely and wanted to guard

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.520
it.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.150
All of this rendered Alfred Hobbs and his
lock picking skills both a point of fear and

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.150
admiration.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.099
Chubb’s locks, despite its humiliation,
continued as Britain’s industry standard.

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:36.520
In fact, Chubb still operates today making
safes that are “trusted the world over.”

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.729
Alfred Hobbs stayed in London for nine years
and began his own lock manufacturing company,

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:41.910
Hobbs Hart Company.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:47.060
He eventually returned to the US in 1860,
but the company stayed in London, on 76 Cheapside

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.990
Ave., bearing its famous name.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.540
It remained there for another ninety plus
years, until 1954, when it was bought, by

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.610
the Chubbs Company.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.060
Hobbs, upon returning to the United States,
didn’t go back into locks.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.220
He worked at the Howe Sewing Machine Company,
helping Elise Howe engineer and design the

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.740
lock-stitch sewing machine.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.650
Eventually, he joined the Remington Arms Company
at the request of the company’s founder

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.350
Marcellus Hartley, who was looking for a “mechanical
genius.”

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.710
Hobbs proved to be just that, filing a dozen
patents for the company in firearm ammunition

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:55.370
manufacturing.
