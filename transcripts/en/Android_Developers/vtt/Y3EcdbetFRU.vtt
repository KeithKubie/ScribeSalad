[APPLAUSE]

00:00:01.697 --> 00:00:04.030
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: All right,
good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.880
Thank you for
joining the session.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.977
So, I'm Mo.

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:09.310
I'm the business development
manager covering the Middle

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.680
East, North Africa, and Turkey.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.650
It's a pleasure to be here with
this amazing set of panelists.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.030
I'm so excited to talk to you
about emerging markets, why

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.050
they matter.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.690
I'm so excited that I've
been up since 4:00 AM today--

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.490
had nothing to do with
two screaming kids

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.127
at the same time, it's just
pure excitement about the topic.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.710
So I'll just walk
you through a couple

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.360
of slides of why we are
particularly excited, as Google

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.450
Play, about the emerging markets
before I invite our panelists

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.740
to join me on stage.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.470
So if anybody has been
living under a rock,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.400
Android is pretty big.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.920
It's going to be growing quite
a bit over the next few years

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.780
as well, external projections
putting it at over 4 billion

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.940
in a few years time.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.650
But what we're seeing is that
2/3 of all new Android users

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.500
are actually coming
from emerging markets.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.158
So if you are looking at the
next wave of growth for you,

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:03.450
this is where you need to
be, and these are the markets

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.420
you need to be investing in.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.900
And you might be thinking,
oh, yeah, that's great,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.140
we'll look at this
in a few years' time.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.270
But the opportunity
is real today.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
So for our EMEA-based
developers,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.570
we looked at where are you
getting your installs, what

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.860
are the top markets?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.720
And what we found
was three of the four

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.790
top markets in which
we're getting installs

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.480
are actually emerging markets.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.050
Those are India,
Brazil, and Russia.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.330
And again, you might be
thinking, that's great,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.930
we're getting users.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.250
But do they actually
bring in any money?

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.020
And the truth is, they do.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.170
So again, looking at
the top 30 countries

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.480
by spend for
EMEA-based developers,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.700
we found that six of
the top 30 countries

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.893
are, again, from
emerging markets.

00:01:46.893 --> 00:01:49.060
And that's a rate that's
going to continue to go up.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.850
So we're seeing around
60% year on year growth

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.990
in spend coming from
emerging markets.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.080
So don't just take it from me.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.790
We have an amazing
set of panelists

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.580
who are going to share
their experiences with you.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.350
And hopefully this
will be a discussion

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.300
that will get you
excited and leave you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.229
with some ideas of how you
can go after these markets.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.174
First up, we've got Saad,
who's the CEO of Miniclip.

00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:17.086
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.843
SAAD CHOUDRI: Hello, everybody.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.260
I've already passed
the first test

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.430
because I thought I was going
to stack on those stairs.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.350
Also, thank you, Google.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.110
Let's clap it up for our Google
account managers, everybody.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.845
Let's clap it up, yes?

00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:39.130
Let's get the energy up.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.700
Yeah, so we're Miniclip.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.240
One of the games that we're
well-known for is 8 Ball Pool.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.810
It's got a very large audience.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.380
We have 200 million
players every month

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.435
engaging with our content.

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.060
And one of the areas that we've
been working-- and particularly

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.940
with Google-- on
quite strategically

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.723
is 8 Ball Pool in India.

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:05.640
It's probably not a
territory that many of you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.130
guys are focusing on.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.270
And the question would
be, is this something

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.520
that you should be looking at?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.135
I would say India is just
one of the emerging markets

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:15.510
that you should
be talking about.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.800
Because we will talk
about others in a bit.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.490
But one of the things
that we've definitely

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.470
seen in growing our
audience in India

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.390
is just the changes
in consumer behavior,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.150
just down to something
so simple as data

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.220
plans being far more affordable
for the standard consumer.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.290
Once that started
happening in India,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.720
we saw a massive, massive uptick
in users in that territory.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.940
Because obviously, we've
got a multiplayer game.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.920
And when you've got
a multiplayer game,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.130
it does take up
your data package.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.070
But in India, they
really responded well

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.540
to that kind of simple thing.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.380
So we saw a lot of growth there.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.497
And I don't know how much
you want to go into--

00:03:58.497 --> 00:03:59.955
around the monetization
techniques.

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:01.205
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:04.360
SAAD CHOUDRI: But we've actually
seen some good monetization

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.860
there.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.070
We're in the top-grossing
charts in Android.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.150
You can see it for yourself.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.420
And I would say it's a very,
very meaningful territory

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.795
for us, and it's in our top
10 of revenue generators now.

00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:16.003
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Fantastic.

00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:17.010
Thank you, Saad.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.670
Next up, we have Kristina, who's
a VP of growth for Memrise,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.170
a great language learning.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.510
KRISTINA NARUSK:
Hello, everyone,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.630
and thank you for
Google for the invite

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.770
to share some insights
from Memrise as well.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.860
So Memrise is a
language learning app

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.290
with 40 million learners from
more than 180 countries all

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.910
around the world.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.490
In terms of emerging
markets, although we

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.360
are based in London, in Great
Britain, the emerging markets,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.470
especially Russia,
Poland, Mexico, Brazil,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.400
and even Turkey, are
quite an important part

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.680
of our user base growth.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.630
And it would be very exciting to
share some insights and things

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.330
that we have done and
experienced in these markets,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.790
in the panel.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.010
It sounds very trivial
and straightforward,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.600
but one of the key
learnings so far

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.550
has been that the
more you understand

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.100
the markets, the more you
understand the local need

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.580
for learning a language,
the better you're

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.500
set for a correct
value proposition

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.530
and delivering the
promise that people expect

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.240
from different countries.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.260
And it can be something
as simple as providing

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.110
a US English course instead
of a British English course

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.670
for Brazilians.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.250
Or investing in the right
languages to offer Russians.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.700
So small details like that
can make a big difference

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.350
and give a lot of guidance to
the product teams and business

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.850
as well.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.308
So really excited
to be here today.

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:55.517
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Fantastic.

00:05:55.517 --> 00:05:56.466
Thank you, Kristina.

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:57.924
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.690
Next up, it's my pleasure
to introduce Anatolijs,

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.416
who's the CEO of Game Insights.

00:06:05.416 --> 00:06:07.781
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:11.310
ANATOLIJS ROPOTOVS:
Thanks, guys.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.160
So we launched Guns of Boom,
by first-person shooter

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.550
for Android around
14 months ago.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.450
But the story behind its
launch starts much earlier.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.290
Like two years ago, we
decided to use Turkey, then

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.190
Russia, those emerging
markets as a test bath

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.290
to validate the game.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.740
And in contrast, the many tier
1 launches, like let's say,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.040
let's try launching in Canada
first, we used those markets,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.870
and we discovered that we have
to support low-end devices.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.010
We have to address loading
speeds, device performance,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.690
data consumptions.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.660
And I think tackling
emerging markets first

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.560
has allowed us to enter many
other markets, including India,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.040
Brazil, and other
markets that are growing

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.500
at a huge, enormous
pace of millions

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.840
of millions of downloads.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.490
So I think the biggest success
behind our presence in Google

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.510
Play was that we have integrated
a way for players to upload

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.730
their replays to YouTube.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.080
A lot of those emerging markets
have creators and influencers

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.980
that are eager to share
the content locally.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.070
And the spread of
that is enormous.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.030
It's thousands and thousands
of daily video uploaded

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.630
to YouTube, and the consumption
rate is really high.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.090
The other essential
part is tackling what

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.030
we call tier 0 pricing matters.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:45.480
It's creating the unique value
proposition for as tiny value

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.050
as it gets, for the smallest
price tiers out there.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.460
So try that.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.430
Do that.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.760
And if you start
with those markets,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.280
it's going to be much
easier to scale globally.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.440
So this has a couple
of key takeaways.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.970
I guess we'll discuss more.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.900
Thanks to Google.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.350
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Wonderful.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.020
Thank you.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.590
Thank you so much, guys.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.880
All right, so one of
the first questions

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.360
that we got from developers
is, OK, yeah, emerging markets,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.350
that's great, but
where do we start?

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.540
Where do we go to?

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.240
For you, what was
the decision factor

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.350
to go after these
specific markets

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.060
other than a personal interest
in just visiting those markets?

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.530
SAAD CHOUDRI: I guess we
saw a lot of user growth

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.669
in India because of the
change in the data providers.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:38.230
And whenever we see users
growing that dramatically,

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.235
then you just pay
attention to it naturally.

00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:41.860
We've all got our
analytics dashboards.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.680
We can all see what's lighting
up and what's growing.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.010
And so then you just kind of
naturally make that choice.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.240
I have seen, from others
and especially for us

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.390
EMEA-based developers, I
tend to think anything that's

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.390
close to home is a
little easier as well,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.070
to kind of concentrate on.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.510
But for us, it was the fact
that we saw audience growth

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.560
in India, as I'm sure
many people have seen

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.810
across other emerging markets.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.490
We've also seen that
growth in Brazil,

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.482
which is why we're
concentrating on Brazil as well.

00:09:13.482 --> 00:09:15.190
But if you see players
downloading stuff,

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.530
then you tend to
kind of see what

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.160
you can to try and
further encourage

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.550
them to play your games.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.633
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: And was
it a similar experience

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:26.590
for you-- follow the
users, basically?

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.420
KRISTINA NARUSK: Yes,
Memrise has mostly

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.330
grown organically so far.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.220
And I mean, language
learning is something

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.220
that people in almost
every single country

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.260
tend to and want to do.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.920
And you can focus on so many
different regions and areas.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.310
But for us, one thing was sort
of organic new user numbers

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.660
that we obviously monitored.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.330
But a not less
significant factor

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.820
was actually
subscriber user base.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.850
So we started
seeing trends where

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.860
it was easier for
us to convert people

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.970
and to make them
Memrise subscribers.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.570
And we actually
then saw that, OK,

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.200
if there is already organic
interest, then what can

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.040
we do to actually improve the
value proposition and offering

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.170
so that more people
from these countries

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.552
have a reason to use our
app and learn languages.

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:18.760
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Fantastic.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.218
ANATOLIJS ROPOTOVS: Well even
though we started with the US

00:10:21.218 --> 00:10:23.950
as the global launch
market, we figured out

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.220
that, based on the number
of YouTube uploads,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.250
the game resonates well with
a variety of emerging markets.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.440
So we had to tackle that.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.850
We went to Google Play team
to talk about those markets,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.040
went to local Playtime
events, learned more about it,

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.710
worked with local creators.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.950
So it was more of a
discovery process--

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.450
where do we put
our efforts into?

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.910
And especially like
just optimizing

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.030
for some of those
markets, it might not

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.800
be really as self-explaining.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.290
So it was quite
a learning curve.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.610
But once we got couple of first
countries in, it got easier.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:05.560
So now I think if we look at
top eight countries, seven

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.370
of them--

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.170
in terms of monthly downloads--
are emerging countries for us.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.780
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Fantastic.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.460
So you see the user
growth somewhere,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.190
you decide you want
to go after a market.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.400
And typically one of the
things we advise our developers

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.960
is to actually localize
for those markets.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.920
But localization can be
a quite broad spectrum,

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.940
from just translating
text in-game, all the way

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.940
to actually customizing
characters, changing

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.320
the in-app experience
for different markets.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.130
How do you decide where do you
want to be on that spectrum?

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.110
SAAD CHOUDRI: Well, we
take an approach when

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.660
we build the games to try and
reach the biggest audience

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.530
possible.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.890
So I mean, for Pool, for
instance, everyone asks us,

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.660
what do you do to
culturalize or localize

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.515
the game-- apart from strings.

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:53.140
I mean, there's not
much to culturalize

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.057
if you think about it.

00:11:54.057 --> 00:11:56.760
It's a stick kicking a
ball into a pocket, right?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.760
Like, that's the game.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.030
And if you can't understand
that, don't oversell it.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.260
But the point is, if you can't
understand that globally,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.010
then that's going to
be a difficult thing.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.040
So I think it's a
bit unfair to ask us.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.680
If you were making an RPG game
or maybe even a shooting game,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.300
it might be a different thing,
in terms of character design

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.030
and look and feel.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.400
But for us, what we do
see in localization,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.010
and what we've learned
over the last year is

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.630
the things and the
promotions which

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.240
tend to be popular
in tier 1 markets

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.100
don't necessarily translate
into the emerging markets.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.590
So we've seen-- if you look
at our top in-app purchases

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.350
and the top things
that people buy,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.050
it is almost skewed in
India compared to where

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.170
it would be in a tier 1 market.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.320
In a tier 1 market, they
would be more open to, say,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.180
a gotcha mechanic, or some sort
of a card pack or something.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.580
Whereas in the
emerging markets, we

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.890
tend to find that the hard-nosed
value for soft currency

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.010
is what people want.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.177
They want to know exactly
what they're going to get.

00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:06.290
That's been our finding.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.240
And therefore, our
localization efforts

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.370
means that our promotions
need to cater for that

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.710
and what we present
to that audience.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.550
So that's where we
kind of sit on it.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.100
KRISTINA NARUSK: Yes,
we have paid attention

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.160
to different phases of the
user acquisition funnel.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.310
So there are things
that you can do

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:29.600
to be a lot more relevant
on Google Play product page

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.180
already.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.640
So making sure
that you highlight

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.660
things that these people from
the emerging market countries

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.550
are really interested in.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.500
You can customize and sort of--

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.450
even the selection
of screenshots

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.080
that you prioritize to
upload to the Play Store

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.000
can teach quite a lot about
what the users appreciates

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.820
from these countries.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.390
And even making the
content relevant.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.810
So Memrise offers tens of
language pairs and tens

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.630
of languages to learn
for different users.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.830
It's important to understand
what are the top ones.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.170
D Turkish people want to learn
English, German, and Russian?

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.990
So there's no point
in prioritizing

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:14.540
Brazilian Portuguese
or Spanish for them

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.330
in order to actually
be super relevant.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.430
And then, also, pricing--

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:23.090
I think localized pricing
is something that has really

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.280
unlocked opportunities
in different countries,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.920
and where it can make a
big difference whether you

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.440
get sort of half a
percentage of people

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.790
to pay versus a few
percentages of people to pay.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.972
So there are different
things to look

00:14:39.972 --> 00:14:41.430
at, different stages
of the funnel,

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.300
and optimization opportunities
almost everywhere.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.300
ANATOLIJS ROPOTOVS: So on our
side, I think back in January

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.340
we ran one of the global events,
which was the Lunar New Year.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.290
And it was kind of
counterintuitive

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.160
for us, as a local event
that was launched globally,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.470
has performed as
well as Christmas

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.530
or something like that
in the US, but globally.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.690
So Lunar New Year was accepted
by everyone across the world.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.870
So since then, every
single local event,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.990
we try to launch it globally,
we try to see how that works.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.300
Like nowadays, like
we recently rolled out

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.070
local content for India.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.430
And it was well-received.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.570
And I think it's just because
of that collectible nature

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.740
of things inside our game.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.440
People just want
to try all of that,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.110
and they want to have all the
costumes, all of the suits,

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.620
and they want to try it all.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.402
So I think it might
work in different ways

00:15:37.402 --> 00:15:38.610
for different types of games.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.255
So you have to try
different strategies.

00:15:42.255 --> 00:15:43.880
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI:
So one of the things

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.430
that you obviously know is
that purchasing power varies

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.630
between tier 1, mature markets
compared to emerging markets.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.740
How do you cater for that?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.157
How have you thought
about pricing

00:15:54.157 --> 00:15:56.570
when you've gone, actually,
after emerging markets?

00:15:59.282 --> 00:16:00.740
KRISTINA NARUSK:
So the first thing

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.820
we have looked at and
tested quite a bit

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.930
as well is to see
what is the sweet spot

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.730
for different
subscription plans.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.990
So it's very easy to set
up monthly, three-monthly,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.770
six-monthly, annual plans,
and then see which one works

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.060
and how to kind of find that
good spot for the exact price

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.940
that has the highest LTV
and long-term potential

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.620
for the app.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.610
So there's a lot of ways
how to experiment with that.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.690
We have seen that, in
some emerging markets,

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.460
people tend to pick the cheapest
and also the shortest period

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.510
subscriptions.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.270
And then thinking of
strategies how to change that,

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:52.550
and how to make the longer plans
either more affordable or more

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.180
appealing, and communicating
the right value.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.750
The latest experiment
we did was I

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.140
was in Mexico, where we saw that
there is a very high proportion

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.869
of users who instead of
going for annual price, which

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:10.099
is the overwhelming
preferred one for Memrise,

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.760
70% of people from
Mexico actually picked

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.099
the monthly price.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.540
And without doing
anything else but just

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.109
increasing the monthly price
subscription fee a little bit,

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:24.680
we see the shift towards people
preferring the annual suddenly.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.290
So just experimenting
around that, and really kind

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.900
of understanding the
dynamics and the levers

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.240
that you have with the
Google Play tools as well

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.112
can get quite
interesting results.

00:17:34.112 --> 00:17:35.320
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Anatolijs.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.860
ANATOLIJS ROPOTOVS: Yeah,
for multiplayer games,

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.220
it's much harder people.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.050
People in the US might complain
about lower-tier pricing

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.800
in the other country.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.160
But we found a sweet spot.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.350
Players might spend
hundreds and sometimes even

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.910
thousands of dollars
inside those games.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.140
So we figured out that
giving out the free, kind

00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.200
of cheaper starter packs, it
be worth tens or even $100.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.060
In some of those
same margin markets,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.420
for much smaller
price, it really

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.160
doesn't effect the game play
or game economy that much.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.480
So that's what we opted in for.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.790
We are creating those packs
that might be worth $100 in US,

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:22.220
and we do one-time offers, the
regional offers, and giving

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.633
them one time at much,
much lower prices.

00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:26.800
And that worked well for us.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.420
It converts the users in
those regions much better.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.170
And it's a great
value for the price.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.550
So you have to find what
you are going to give away,

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.070
even for as low as $0.15.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.730
It needs to have the value.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.330
And if you try to
compare that to US price,

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.830
it might be just the one
med kit or one ammo pack.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.650
But that doesn't sell
well in emerging market.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.910
You have to create this
whole bundle worth $0.15.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.540
And we are OK with that, because
there is just so much more

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.438
things to explore and buy
once they get releases

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.730
or seasonal content, or the
[INAUDIBLE] maps, or things

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.640
down the road.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.790
So we're totally fine
given the way those bigger

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.770
packs initially for
much lower prices.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.145
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI:
And with this,

00:19:08.145 --> 00:19:10.550
do you not worry about
users from the US

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.327
switching over to
emerging markets

00:19:13.327 --> 00:19:15.160
and trying to take
advantage of those packs?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.952
ANATOLIJS ROPOTOVS: So
since these are only

00:19:16.952 --> 00:19:19.150
starter packs for
new users that you're

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.410
able to acquire in
the first weeks,

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.940
it's not really a big issue.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.340
It's not like something that
you could get six months

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.850
after you play the game.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.200
So that's how we manage
to address this issue.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.040
SAAD CHOUDRI: So OK, I've got
a question for you, Anatolijs.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.020
So what you're saying is, you do
a geopriced starter pack only,

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.960
but then afterwards, you
just have standard pricing

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.740
across the globe.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.380
ANATOLIJS ROPOTOVS: Well, we do
have some discounts, and deals,

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.410
and things like that.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.830
But yeah, well, some of those
deals are kind of still pricey.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.950
So we don't really
adjust the value

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.170
of the currency
for those countries

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.090
because that's the question.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.630
You can't really do that.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.470
Too many people will try
to switch the region.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.690
Like other platforms
like PC platform

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.060
is also dealing with
that, and too many players

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.000
are trying to buy the
currency in another region.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.210
So we don't try to do that.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.490
SAAD CHOUDRI: So we did that.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.950
We did a whole
geopricing activity

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.900
where we changed
prices completely.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.920
I'm not going to talk
about that question.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.540
We're working with
your team right now

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.890
and your Google Play engineers
to try and resolve that.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.420
That's totally an issue.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.273
If you change prices
in one territory,

00:20:25.273 --> 00:20:26.690
and you've got a
community, people

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.400
will go and try and
game the system.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.870
VPNs are easy to get,
particularly on this platform.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.460
I think we need to
acknowledge that.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:40.100
But it's too early to tell with
geopricing for us right now.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.480
We definitely saw an
impact in conversion.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.180
We definitely saw
people spend more.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.070
And for us, it wasn't
just a starter pack.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.650
It was across the whole store
and across the whole economy.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.030
And the reality right
now is we're not sure

00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:00.830
how that's affected LTV, because
we don't know if people are

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.940
doing more purchases,
little and often,

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.935
or if they're still
buying the one

00:21:06.935 --> 00:21:10.160
pack that they would have done
before, but got more for it.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.990
So we really are still
balancing that thing.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.370
But ultimately, for us, I think
the more important question

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:21.770
is, how much are you getting
in terms of the share of wallet

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.900
for that consumer
in that region.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.020
And from what we see in
these emerging markets,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.460
we're very encouraged
by the fact

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.950
that they are willing to
spend on entertainment.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.640
The fact that there is a
willingness to spend on IAP,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.230
I think, is a very
interesting thing.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.620
Because I actually think
that emerging markets have

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.110
got to that step before
even the tier 1 markets.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.710
I think it took a long time
for free-to-play and IAP game

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.850
mechanics to really be seen
as the de facto business

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.435
model here in tier 1 markets.

00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:54.560
Because if you think about
it, even 5, 10 years ago

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.650
we were having debates about,
is free to play the future?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.520
We know it is.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.830
And no one really talks
about that anymore.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:05.090
But in emerging markets, they
don't even think about it.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.270
They don't worry about it.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.830
So that's where I think
the geopricing stuff needs

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.780
to be considered around
the share of wallet

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.740
for that consumer.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.240
Because obviously
an Indian consumer

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.780
does not have the same
disposable as a US consumer.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.000
But we've seen, in
China, that change.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.460
And obviously you
just have to look

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.980
at the kind of macroeconomic
situation of some

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.740
of these countries and nations,
that will eventually change.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.860
So we feel like being there
early, making these steps,

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.360
and understanding how
the consumer behaves

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.833
is super important.

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.250
So that's what I'd want to
reinforce in that conversation.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.620
ANATOLIJS ROPOTOVS: I think,
across our games portfolio,

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.203
throughout the years,
we've definitely

00:22:41.203 --> 00:22:45.410
seen some of the markets
transitioning from emerging

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:47.420
to much more mature markets.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.430
Perhaps southeast
Asian markets that

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.650
now have many more
payment [INAUDIBLE],,

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.760
and people are just
used to paying that.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.670
So I think it's just
a matter of time

00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:00.110
when we will see more spending
power in those countries.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.350
And in a year or
two, we're going

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.540
to talk about those
markets not as emerging--

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.160
remember that BRICTS had China
in it as an emerging market.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.710
Now we don't speak about China.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.700
So now they call
it still BRITS--

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.543
like Brazil, Russia, India,
Turkey, Saudi Arabia.

00:23:16.543 --> 00:23:18.960
SAAD CHOUDRI: I've heard of
MINT as well, which is Mexico,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.210
Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.910
I've have heard
all of them, yeah.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.410
KRISTINA NARUSK:
Yeah, we are seeing

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:30.770
an interesting correlation
between the business

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.780
performance of certain
regions and markets

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.080
and the deep intention of
people to learn a language.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.580
So an interesting
case has been where

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.450
we interviewed a significant
amount of our subscribers

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.840
from emerging markets as
well, and then plotted it

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.580
against data.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.260
And we saw that, for example,
Russia, and Poland, and Turkey

00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:00.410
as well, where people can
learn one level, any language,

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.310
for free, and then
have to subscribe.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:07.220
The speed and the
conversion rate

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.280
at very early stages
of user onboarding

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.040
was the highest in countries
where the language learning

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.400
intention tends
to be sort of less

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.770
casual, less a kind of fun,
hobby activity, and more

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.110
kind of need, and
sort of aspiration

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.580
and professional
improvement related.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.450
And it's quite
fascinating, because it

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.070
gives a lot of
insights for product

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:39.200
and then tweaks and improvements
in your onboarding as well.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.280
If you know how to
nail this need versus,

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.870
yes, we can match the needs--

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:46.890
correlation.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.260
So it's quite
useful to understand

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.460
the behaviors and the
motivators behind users

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.582
of apps for these purposes.

00:24:57.582 --> 00:24:58.790
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Fantastic.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.290
SAAD CHOUDRI: Can I ask
a question of the crowd?

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:00.550
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI: Yeah.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.850
SAAD CHOUDRI: And if
they're going to engage.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.480
How many of you are
taking active steps

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.490
to do something in
emerging markets?

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.830
Just one, two, three--

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.960
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI:
That's a decent number.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.585
SAAD CHOUDRI: It's
a decent smattering.

00:25:13.585 --> 00:25:15.117
But OK, and how many of you--

00:25:15.117 --> 00:25:17.700
obviously you're considering it
because you're listening here.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.760
But how many of you think it's
probably a waste of effort

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.608
or you don't have the
resources to really attack it?

00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:29.150
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI:
You can be honest.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.483
SAAD CHOUDRI: You can be honest.

00:25:30.483 --> 00:25:32.930
One-- one person, two, three.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:33.470
Come on.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.870
There's no more?

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:36.650
OK, all right.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.840
So actually everybody
believes there's effort.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.000
And I think, actually,
the reality of this

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.330
is it's not a lot of effort.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.710
It's not a lot of effort.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.040
Because to be honest,
what you guys have

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.050
done over the last few
years, I think we--

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.940
again, Google has
done a great job.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.640
And it's easy for me to
say this on a Google stage.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.590
But Google has done a
great job in allowing

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.990
us to have the
tools to really make

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.380
efforts in emerging markets.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.350
So I think if you're
looking to do it,

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.933
and you haven't
really done anything--

00:26:04.933 --> 00:26:06.260
because a few people haven't--

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.410
it's just literally go into
Google Play Developer Console,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.170
and you can start.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.670
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI:
That's very true.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.837
SAAD CHOUDRI: I know you're
not allowed to say that,

00:26:15.837 --> 00:26:17.004
but it's easy for me to say.

00:26:17.004 --> 00:26:18.837
MOHAMMAD EL-SAADI:
Obviously, when I say it,

00:26:18.837 --> 00:26:19.820
nobody will believe me.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.180
I'm paid to say it.
