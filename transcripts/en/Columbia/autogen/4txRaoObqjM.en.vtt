however the question of the wheel is

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519
however the question of the wheel is
 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.729
however the question of the wheel is
complicated first of all what was the

complicated first of all what was the

complicated first of all what was the
first wheel like now here we have we

a lifting bar one of the things you know
 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.190
a lifting bar one of the things you know
is that if it will slide onto the bar

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.200
is that if it will slide onto the bar
 

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.910
is that if it will slide onto the bar
it will also wobble and so you put on a

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:02.920
it will also wobble and so you put on a
 

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.010
it will also wobble and so you put on a
sleeve that you type in in order to hold

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.020
sleeve that you type in in order to hold
 

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.840

it in place or find other some other way
 

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.360
it in place or find other some other way
to hold it in place because the problem

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.370
to hold it in place because the problem
 

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.640
to hold it in place because the problem
is that if you have enough enough leeway

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:14.650
is that if you have enough enough leeway
 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.320
is that if you have enough enough leeway
for the wheel to go onto a rod that is

factor the way you defeat the wobble

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:26.410
factor the way you defeat the wobble
 

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:33.089
factor the way you defeat the wobble
factor is by having the area through

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:33.099
factor is by having the area through

don't make it tighter but by making it
 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.570
don't make it tighter but by making it
wider it means that the leeway for

in order to get to a wheel this was

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:06.470
in order to get to a wheel this was
 

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.150
in order to get to a wheel this was
enormous ly labor-intensive to make that

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160
enormous ly labor-intensive to make that
 

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.200
enormous ly labor-intensive to make that
wheel and when you got down to it you

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.210
wheel and when you got down to it you
 

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.070
wheel and when you got down to it you
had a you did have a wheel but you had a

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.080
had a you did have a wheel but you had a
 

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.710
had a you did have a wheel but you had a
very heavy wheel if you take the density

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720
very heavy wheel if you take the density
 

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.190
very heavy wheel if you take the density
of oak and you'll calculate the size of

of oak and you'll calculate the size of
 

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.400
of oak and you'll calculate the size of
the wheel and you had my my calculation

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:34.410
the wheel and you had my my calculation
 

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.800
the wheel and you had my my calculation
is that you must have had a wheel that

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:36.810
is that you must have had a wheel that
 

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:46.040

240 pounds of wheel you add the weight
 

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.990
240 pounds of wheel you add the weight
of the axle or if two axles if you have

of the axle or if two axles if you have
 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.410
of the axle or if two axles if you have
four four wheels then you add the weight

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.420
four four wheels then you add the weight
 

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.900

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:12.290
as yoke wheels you have to worry about
 

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.360
as yoke wheels you have to worry about
you have to worry about the surface now

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:16.370
you have to worry about the surface now
 

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:23.230
you have to worry about the surface now
the wheel evolves from this beginning

demand to make it lighter to make the

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:34.950
demand to make it lighter to make the
 

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.290
demand to make it lighter to make the
wheel lighter and lighter and lighter

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:36.300
wheel lighter and lighter and lighter
 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.810
wheel lighter and lighter and lighter
now for this most primitive type there

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820
now for this most primitive type there
 

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.640
now for this most primitive type there
are two possible ways to make it lighter

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:45.650
are two possible ways to make it lighter
 

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.110
are two possible ways to make it lighter
both of which show up although we don't

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120
both of which show up although we don't
 

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.830

is to fix the wheel to the axle so it

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:02.550
is to fix the wheel to the axle so it
 

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:07.130
is to fix the wheel to the axle so it
doesn't turn in other words to take two

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140
doesn't turn in other words to take two
 

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.160

unit turns so then you don't worry about

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:13.680
unit turns so then you don't worry about
 

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.520
unit turns so then you don't worry about
a wobble you can nail the damn thing to

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:16.530
a wobble you can nail the damn thing to
 

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.740
a wobble you can nail the damn thing to
the axle or fix it however way you can

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:18.750
the axle or fix it however way you can
 

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:25.190
the axle or fix it however way you can
it's a fixed a fixed unit and you might

it's a fixed a fixed unit and you might
 

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.500
it's a fixed a fixed unit and you might

from the early 20th century you'll find

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880
from the early 20th century you'll find
 

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.360
from the early 20th century you'll find
that one of the most common designs is

rotating you can tell by looking at this
 

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.810
rotating you can tell by looking at this
if it is round then the wheel is

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820
if it is round then the wheel is
 

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.280
if it is round then the wheel is
rotating but if it is square then the

wheel is not rotating so you know you

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.040
wheel is not rotating so you know you

because square holes do not show up all

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:41.730
because square holes do not show up all

other way to do it was to take the nave
and make it a separate piece of wood so

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:54.590
and make it a separate piece of wood so
 

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.340
and make it a separate piece of wood so
then what you're doing is you're taking

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:57.350
then what you're doing is you're taking
 

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.860
then what you're doing is you're taking
your big piece of wood and you're

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:00.870
your big piece of wood and you're
 

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.450
your big piece of wood and you're
cutting a big hole in the center and

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:04.460
cutting a big hole in the center and
 

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.620
cutting a big hole in the center and
then you're inserting in that big hole

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:07.630
then you're inserting in that big hole
 

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.600
then you're inserting in that big hole
a separate piece of wood that's the day

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:12.610
a separate piece of wood that's the day
 

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.420
a separate piece of wood that's the day
that comes out on both sides you can

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:15.430
that comes out on both sides you can
 

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.360
that comes out on both sides you can
also of course then have different types

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.370
also of course then have different types
 

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.980
also of course then have different types
of wood you can have a harder wood

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:19.990
of wood you can have a harder wood
 

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.610
of wood you can have a harder wood
perhaps for the knave heavier wood and a

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:23.620
perhaps for the knave heavier wood and a
 

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.180
perhaps for the knave heavier wood and a
lighter wood for the wheel itself and so

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.190
lighter wood for the wheel itself and so
 

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:32.420
lighter wood for the wheel itself and so
we have specimens of inserted names

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:32.430
we have specimens of inserted names
 

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.860
we have specimens of inserted names
nevertheless there's sort of a limit to

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:34.870
nevertheless there's sort of a limit to
 

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.850
nevertheless there's sort of a limit to
how far you can go with that when once

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:38.860
how far you can go with that when once
 

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:49.720
how far you can go with that when once
you've tried that idea so

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:49.730
 

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.350
my mother was a physics professor and

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360
my mother was a physics professor and
 

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.030
my mother was a physics professor and
she taught me that if you're at a

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.040
she taught me that if you're at a
 

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.610
she taught me that if you're at a
blackboard and you want to draw a round

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:57.620
blackboard and you want to draw a round
 

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.570
blackboard and you want to draw a round
circle and you're right-handed draw it

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:01.580
circle and you're right-handed draw it
 

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.210
circle and you're right-handed draw it
counterclockwise if you do it clockwise

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:04.220
counterclockwise if you do it clockwise
 

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.040
counterclockwise if you do it clockwise
it will be it won't look right but if

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.050
it will be it won't look right but if
 

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.350
it will be it won't look right but if
you drop counter clockwise it will be

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360
you drop counter clockwise it will be
 

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.620
you drop counter clockwise it will be
pretty round so if you learn nothing

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:14.630
pretty round so if you learn nothing
 

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.760
pretty round so if you learn nothing

you get rid of the wood after all you

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:53.630
you get rid of the wood after all you
 

00:22:53.630 --> 00:23:01.210

through you need wood where the rubber

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:04.340
through you need wood where the rubber
 

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.460
through you need wood where the rubber
hits the road but you don't need all

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:06.470
hits the road but you don't need all
 

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.280
hits the road but you don't need all
that wood in between so people started

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:09.290
that wood in between so people started
 

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:20.140
that wood in between so people started
to cut out chunks of wood and a cut out

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.150
to cut out chunks of wood and a cut out
 

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.660

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:23.670
 

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.120
so they saved a lot of wood and lo and

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.130
so they saved a lot of wood and lo and
 

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:35.970
so they saved a lot of wood and lo and
behold and invented the spoke because

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:35.980
behold and invented the spoke because

behold and invented the spoke because
once they discovered that you could

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:37.770
once they discovered that you could

lighten the wheel by cutting out the
 

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.620
lighten the wheel by cutting out the
wood then they thought well actually you

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:43.630
wood then they thought well actually you
 

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.420
wood then they thought well actually you
don't need one big piece of wood at all

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:47.430
don't need one big piece of wood at all
 

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.660
don't need one big piece of wood at all
all you need is the center part of that

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:51.670
all you need is the center part of that
 

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.380
all you need is the center part of that
contacts the axle and an outer part that

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:55.390
contacts the axle and an outer part that
 

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.280
contacts the axle and an outer part that
contacts the road surface and you can

00:23:59.280 --> 00:23:59.290
contacts the road surface and you can
 

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:06.860
contacts the road surface and you can
simply use rods to connect the two

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:06.870
 

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.690
technologically this is an enormous

technologically this is an enormous
 

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.250
technologically this is an enormous
advance in manufacturing terms it is a

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:14.260
advance in manufacturing terms it is a
 

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.310
advance in manufacturing terms it is a
huge problem

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320

any farmer could make a solid wheeled ox

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880
any farmer could make a solid wheeled ox
 

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.390
any farmer could make a solid wheeled ox
cart and if you look at the ox carts of

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:27.400
cart and if you look at the ox carts of
 

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.670
cart and if you look at the ox carts of
turkey in the early 20th century they

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:29.680
turkey in the early 20th century they
 

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.730
turkey in the early 20th century they
still have solid wheels says the spoke

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:32.740
still have solid wheels says the spoke
 

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.230
still have solid wheels says the spoke
did not drive the heavier solid wheel

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240
did not drive the heavier solid wheel
 

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.050
did not drive the heavier solid wheel
out of existence although they did start

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:40.060
out of existence although they did start
 

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.950
out of existence although they did start
to taper the wheel so the solid wheel

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960
to taper the wheel so the solid wheel
 

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.760
to taper the wheel so the solid wheel
would have be smaller that side where it

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:47.770
would have be smaller that side where it
 

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.310

so there's some improvements in the

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:51.430
so there's some improvements in the
 

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:56.370
so there's some improvements in the
solid wheel but but basically the

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:56.380
solid wheel but but basically the
 

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:02.190
solid wheel but but basically the
problem with the axle are with the if a

difficult to do it also raised a

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.090
difficult to do it also raised a
 

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.010
difficult to do it also raised a
question of what is this outer rim does

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:14.020
question of what is this outer rim does
 

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.940

it mean you have to to have a wooden

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:17.950
it mean you have to to have a wooden
 

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:22.200
it mean you have to to have a wooden
hula hoop or something do you have to

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:22.210
hula hoop or something do you have to
 

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.970
hula hoop or something do you have to
have a single hoop of of wood which

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:26.980
have a single hoop of of wood which
 

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.680

could be complicated particularly with a
 

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.190
could be complicated particularly with a
large diameter and so I said well no you

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.200
large diameter and so I said well no you
 

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.840

can make this out of segments

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:34.850
can make this out of segments
 

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:47.370
can make this out of segments
so it's one segment shoe segments and

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:47.380
so it's one segment shoe segments and
 

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:55.060
so it's one segment shoe segments and
then you could use pegs to pass in the

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.070
then you could use pegs to pass in the
 

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.419
then you could use pegs to pass in the
segments together and then you'd have a

00:25:58.419 --> 00:25:58.429
segments together and then you'd have a
 

00:25:58.429 --> 00:26:00.580
segments together and then you'd have a
certain fixed number of spokes for each

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:00.590
certain fixed number of spokes for each
 

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.669
certain fixed number of spokes for each
segment to help hold it in place and

segment to help hold it in place and
 

00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:08.649
segment to help hold it in place and
these segments these segments were

00:26:08.649 --> 00:26:08.659
these segments these segments were
 

00:26:08.659 --> 00:26:09.930
these segments these segments were

and we're somewhere else were not found
 

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.380
and we're somewhere else were not found
but in the two where they had the wheels

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:41.390
but in the two where they had the wheels

the diameters were close to five feet no
 

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:54.110
the diameters were close to five feet no
yes close to five feet about 57 inches

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120
yes close to five feet about 57 inches
 

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.460
yes close to five feet about 57 inches
those are big wheels and there are other

00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:58.470
those are big wheels and there are other
 

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.880
those are big wheels and there are other
excavations in Central Asia that show

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:01.890
excavations in Central Asia that show
 

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.710
excavations in Central Asia that show
wheels of comparable size and with

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720
wheels of comparable size and with
 

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.350
wheels of comparable size and with
zillions of spokes and these show up in

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360
zillions of spokes and these show up in
 

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.230
zillions of spokes and these show up in
tombs because if you have a really

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240
tombs because if you have a really
 

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.260
tombs because if you have a really
really fine ride you want it to be

really fine ride you want it to be
 

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.030
really fine ride you want it to be
buried with you so so chariot burials

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:19.040
buried with you so so chariot burials
 

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.470
buried with you so so chariot burials
