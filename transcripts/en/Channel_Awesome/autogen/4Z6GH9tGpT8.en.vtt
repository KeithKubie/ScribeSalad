know again this is only a part one so
 

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
know again this is only a part one so
we'll<00:12:51.110><c> see</c><00:12:51.200><c> how</c><00:12:51.320><c> part</c><00:12:51.589><c> two</c><00:12:51.710><c> does</c><00:12:51.980><c> as</c><00:12:52.130><c> well</c><00:12:52.250><c> but</c>

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:52.490 align:start position:0%
we'll see how part two does as well but
 

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.090 align:start position:0%
we'll see how part two does as well but
for<00:12:52.580><c> a</c><00:12:52.640><c> part</c><00:12:52.910><c> one</c><00:12:53.180><c> I</c><00:12:53.510><c> really</c><00:12:54.470><c> enjoyed</c><00:12:54.890><c> it</c>

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.290 align:start position:0%
um but I think I think that's an
 

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.829 align:start position:0%
um but I think I think that's an
important<00:12:57.680><c> point</c><00:12:57.800><c> because</c><00:12:57.920><c> I</c><00:12:58.190><c> know</c><00:12:58.250><c> that</c><00:12:58.839><c> some</c>

00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
