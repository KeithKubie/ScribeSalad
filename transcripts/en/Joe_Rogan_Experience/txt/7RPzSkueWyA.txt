Whatever feels comfortable for you. But it's pretty good at picking up your voice. You just want to know, you don't want to have it that low. You definitely want to have it in front of your face. Okay. It's like a radio one. It's not a stage one. So like it's a sideways Mike. If you see it like the Mike is in. Oh yeah, I just go. This is how I do it. I have this like right in front of my face. Okay. Plus people don't get to see as much of my face. It makes me, me staring. I like it when I used to sit there used to hide behind it. Like, like hey, I'm half robot. Half man. All right, let's do this. Three, two, one

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       By the way. Our guest is little Esther and Esther is a very funny standup comedian here in Los Angeles, California. And uh, she's our first female guest ever, ladies and gentlemen. So how about a round of applause? 50th episode? Yeah. Also, this is our 50th episode and we, we, you know, we just never found a girl worthy. But you're here, you're here. They're all worthy. They just don't want to come over. And, and not only that, it's my house so I can't bring porn stars over embers will usually do have boards doors on, you know, well, you know, you can do all you want. It's just the issue is I have little children that are girls want them being really good friends with the porn star and said, I want to do it in Maryland. Does, you know she's obsessed with porn star. She actually bought off of Ebay, Jenna Jamison socks or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       Sweater off of Ebay. Wow. Did, did it smell like jizz fairy princess fairy princesses. It was cute. She's a nice person. I bet you could meet her. If you ever went to the fcs obsession with her. What is the obsession like she does so many things that I would not do and it's just cool and exciting and she's pretty, and she wrote a book that was good. You actually liked her book? I loved her book. I've read it like three times. I bought it in high school and I used to have to put like a fake cover over it so I could read it in high school. No one know what I was reading. Whoa. Yeah. Um, so was that like, like, like inspiring to you or not? I mean, yeah. When you say that she does like a lot of things that you wouldn't do.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       Yeah. Like she's important star. Um, and she's just so different from me. Like I'm like a little, thank you Brian. Brian just put a floppy dick and asters lap that's from the ones they made them. It's sort of a proof of concept device. Like they didn't make it so that anyone can use it obviously because it's too soft and it wouldn't really be functional unless you just into disappointment. But, uh, they just wanted to show that they could get this deck. It's very, it's disturbing. You know, a lot of it's circumcise too. Yeah, it's soft. It's kind of crazy that the norm is to cut a chunk of your dick off. That's the norm. If someone said this to me, I don't remember who it was they're talking about if he had a boy, would you circumcise it? I said, no. I said, it's, I think it's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       I go, what? You want to chop a piece of skin off someone's Dick? And it makes it less sensitive and the whole deal. And he goes, yeah, but it looks better. That's what I saying. It does look better, but I don't. Does it really? No, really? I think so. I don't know. I don't know. I don't get it. Have you had both? No, I haven't. Oh, have you seen the other one in person? No, not in person. I think when it's soft, yeah. It looks very animal like, yeah. When it's soft, it's like the skins over it. It's like an elephant Dick. It's just like, eh. I never seen it soft. I whoa, what the fuck are you talking about? Get a rock hard. And while that's you, you're just very sexy, circumcised men around you. They can't help themselves. It's um, it's a terrible thing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       You're chopping a Jew. I mean, people, Ooh, it's hard gene. You know these people in Africa, it's ridiculous. It's not a hygiene issue. I'm sort of against it because it's to look tissue you sort of against it. Yeah, because like, it's like you said, it's cutting skin off. That seems just wrong. It's not like a, it's helps anything. You know? It's not like he cut skin off and then you could see behind your back like, oh no god, I bought back there, but this is an extra piece of skin. Let's get rid of that skin. Dude, there's an eyeball back here. This is crazy. You don't believe in like having an umbilical cord still like as grownup. That's stupid. What? Well, I mean, and you're like, don't want to modify the body how it is, you know, that's not a good analogy at all. Terrible knows you.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       That's all he ever does. Dry Low fucking stuff in the conversation. There's tracks put some silly nonsense, but it's funny to get their haircut. She doesn't, she gets angry and mad. No, I just, I appreciate a good analogy. So when a bad one is presented to me, explain a good one. Then that's also like that like piercing your ears. You're modifying your a little teeny piece of your body, your skin Stenek thing. Well, so is the Dick thing? Yeah. What else does it for you? The issue is that it changes the functionality of the penis. You no longer like when the four skin is over your penis, your penis is much more sensitive because it's protected. Now your penis is all like calloused and like tired out role and against your underwear and it's rubbing against your leg. It's like, it's, the tip part is really supposed to be protected by skin so that it makes it even more sensitive.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       So you'd have way more problems with premature ejaculation apparently because it will just feel better. It was as good as it feels now. It feel even crazy better. You know, people who go to wounded to feel better, but that's ridiculous. Why would I want more sensitivity? You know, we'd like to talk about penises and show it's good. I forgot to warn you. I get to talk about penises. So, yeah, right. All my stand up is very clean. So it was Jenna Jamison, the only, um, you're not though. You're dirty, right? Yes, you are clean. Are you kidding? You're not dirty as in like fuck, fuck, fuck. But you're a dirty as in like the subjects you bring up. Abortion jokes are not really insults. I like to install the abortion insult. I like to insult hot women because some of them are mean to me. So. So you insult them with abortion jokes? No. Well, okay. Like people say that blondes have more fun. That's fine. I've never had to have an abortion. So that's, that's the joke.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       I've never had to have an abortion. It is kind of a tricky thing. If you really break it down as to what it is. I mean you're, you, it's alive. You know, it's, it's, it's inside your body. You're hosting it and you know, you get to terminate that because it's inside your body. You get to pull the trigger. But whoa, that's a crazy gray area because it comes out, it becomes a person. It's very strange. I mean I understand why people would do it. I do as well, honestly. Cause I wouldn't, I have nightmares about having children and it's not happening, but it's, I don't know, just, it's just basically saying that one women are whores and I don't particularly blondes. But Jenna Jamison is a huge support. Like your, your big idol. Well she is, but I like, it's, I'm really just insulting

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       like the blonde, the, it's not all the specific ones. The ones that like are mean to me and like picked on me in high school. Um, what did they used to do here? Like throw like bloody tampons at you when you walk down the hall and stuff. No, I just did a pilot audition where that happened to me. Okay. Every audition I've ever been on, the breakdowns are traumatizing cause I'm listed as unattractive and like Chubby. But anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       yeah. So Michael, Charles, what these boots, before you go anywhere with this, obviously something happened. So tell us what, what these guys did to you that makes you want to bring them up specifically?

Speaker 3:          00:09:31       Um, nothing really. I just think that sometimes like you go out and you see like the hot chicks that like wear mini skirts and tons of makeup and like I'm, when I'm ever in their vicinity, like I'm like this like in jeans and a tee shirt and sneakers and I feel like they like look at me and think I'm retarded.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       Okay. But are they actually doing anything to you or are they just looking hot and you're getting Yang?

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       Um, they're just looking hot and I get angry. Whoa. No weird. No, they're mean to me. They're mean to you. Okay, let's go there. Um, do they mean to you? Okay, well one I used to go to, like I would go to movies and people would follow me into the movie theater and like yell things at me. Like they were meeting, like I was picked on, like what you face stinky farts. Like Esther, the molester, he molested girls that you knew. Um, yeah, I think people just picked on me because I like was a nerd. Is that normal? Yes. That's normal. Yeah. Yeah, but it's just those kinds that you grew up with. It's really all blocked me. I believe it. I love how I have a blog that's called Esther with hot chicks.com and I just take pictures with hot people and talk about them. Really? Yeah. One of the pictures is me and Brittany Murphy, his grave site.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       It was great. It's just the pitcher for, and there's like this like this, like square of flowers on the ground and she's just sitting there like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:10:52       I like it. I love it. Don't get me wrong. I love attractive women. Like I'm obsessed with them to the point of like, I could be a lesbian, but there's someone's that I just, they get me mad and I don't like them, so I want to say mean things about them. Like if they, it basically this started, we can also too, because I get heckled a lot by hot chicks and they're like, you're a Dork. And like I just come back at them like, no, you're a disgusting, filthy whore and no one likes you and I'm not gonna listen to you because I'm not interested in having sex with you.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       Wow. So they're, they're, they're tricks don't work on you there. I'm not a psychologist. I might think you have an issue. I don't have an issue. Might be an issue here. It seems like, it certainly seems like it's an issue. What's the issue? Well, I mean you've got an anger towards a very specific group of the part of the population. Girls that are attractive. No, I don't. I like them. We did them with clients with assholes. Is that wrong? But yeah, because you made it attractive. Like they're attractive and their cons. So it's really like what it is is like being attractive. They have this extra gift that you wish you had. Like they're, they're hotter, they're in the group. And then the current part is like, well, they're just cuts, plea. You've thrown it all together. Just the fact that they're attractive, it's really, doesn't mean anything.

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       They're just assholes. If they're hot and they're nice, they're great. I, but I think that Alpha hot woman is mean. It's like the biggest disservice to the world because you're not representing duty. But yeah, but, but you see what I'm saying? Like you don't necessarily have to lump in hot along with cont just so happens that they're hot, but the real issue, is that correct? Yeah. And that's your enemy. It's the clients. It's not hot girls. Sometimes people like to see the nerdy Jew girl attack. They'd like to know that I'm attacking the hot women. Right, right. But if you do it for no reason, it's one thing as you're attacking me for no reason. Absolutely. Okay. But it seems like you have a reason that maybe they might not be involved in personally, we might be a reason. It's like you're, you're going back to four years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       They're in the moment and they're like, what the fuck is this chick screaming at me for just cause I'm hot? No, cause they're conti. They're just [inaudible] know what I'm saying. It's like what the, the hot part is irrelevant. It doesn't mean anything. Well, it just makes it worse because not only are they acting a certain way, they're getting treated a certain way cause they're hot. Ultimate enemy to a girl probably is a hot chick. That is also a kind of, so really the problem was weak dudes that are willing to treat hot chicks and in a superior way. Right. There's through really problem. Of course you understand it. They're like hot chicks are like super celebrities. Literally if I go into like a really pretty girl, like wearing like a hot outfit, I just look at her like she's a princess and like want to talk to her.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       If she's nice then so you have this love hate thing going on. Very strong and I just don't know yet. Have you made out withdrawals and stuff? Um, yes. My Freshman Year of high school I kind of see that fluff site real quick video tape with two other girls in my high school though of us making out and touching each other's boobs and it made us very popular. Wow. So you guys released it online or have it? Uh, I do. I don't know how to play it cause it's not like an old, totally, you just need the cables. Brian knows how to get it online. But it's also illegal because I was 13. No, no, no. We can put cat, the cat faces on the heads. They'll never know. You know, that's a tricky thing man. You can't really, if they could prove that she was 15, you know how dangerous that is.

Speaker 1:          00:14:22       Girls are getting arrested. High school girls are getting arrested because they send boys pictures of their Posey and that's child pornography. So this woman, yeah, and I mean it's sexting. That's what everyone's calling it. Sexting. But the courts are calling the child pornography. Right. It's a cute name to use. So it doesn't sound like they're sending child pornography. Yeah. This one girl, um, she's 15 years old and they arrested her for child pornography because she sent some boys pictures of her pussy and then he sent them to everybody and she was obviously the source. So, and they all got, everyone was in trouble and so they, they wound up like taking it to court and they moved it. They changed the, the charge to possession of criminal tools. Oh my God. So instead of child pornography, possession of criminal tools, because her phone, her cell phone was a tool for crime cause she took a picture of her pussy with her cell phone.

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       Like man, we need some new laws. Like we need some new laws to catch up with 2010 and this technology, because we're using like fucking smoke signals and you know, the, the, the, you know, the, the, the Pony Express. I mean we're using that kind of technology to deal with kids. You know, you, if we're in an area where kids have phones and the phones have cameras, they're going to take pictures of their assholes. They just get to do everything. They're going to take pictures of everything they can. They're kids. They're curious. They're more likely to do if they know they're not supposed to. They don't have any willpower. They don't know that things are gross or embarrassing or shocking or, yeah, they make terrible choices. We need some laws, man. They need some new laws. He's still film yourself like a lot nick, by yourself. Do you ever want to be a porn star?

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       No. I think when I was younger I was like that a little bit and then I sort of went through like a transition of liking stand up comedy so, well, how'd you get into San Diego? Porn lays just the message. They go together a lot, like of like same Tripoli's Nice. Show it the porn mixed with comedy. It just seems like like salt and pepper. It just seems like they're supposed to go together for some take two go together. Well, because it's like you can't take yourself too seriously with either one of them. Right. You know, and you're looked down upon by a lot of people to, you know, like mentally disturbed to do both. Yeah. Yeah. The reason why you get into all of them is there's a deficit. There is always a, an unusual need for attention is either touched by your mother or a hit by your father.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       What's, and it doesn't necessarily, I've actually met comics that have good families. They're just, they're funny. Yeah. Porn stars are having, I've never met a porn star that doesn't come from some chaos. Right. Have you ever seen that? What's that one porn star that's a dad is like the porn star manager. Uh, have you seen that? It was like on that HBO show. Uh, I did see that. I don't remember her name. I feel like it's sunny lane. No. Is it sunny lane? Maybe funny lane is that, it might be Google that shit real quick. But it was the most disturbing thing if you haven't seen it. She was on the show with her parents who manage her porn career and they were talking about terrific. It is, it's so awesome. Like she won the number one video of the year. That's our daughter. They're all like all excited and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       It was like, it was so twisted and weird. And then she wound up working as a whore and a brothel and the dad was talking about the brothel. Like wow. They give up, they feed them, they give them food. I saw that it was clean. Like whoa, truckers can just come in there and fuck your little baby's mouth. And that's not weird to you. All they have to do is come up with 150 bucks or whatever it costs. They can fuck your baby's mouth and you're happy about it. Yeah. Wildly feeder. They feed it. They feed

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       sick Jack all day. Yeah. It was a very disturbing, but I think any kid that comes from that background, you know, you're just, you know, that's your parents probably your foot, your shit's going to fall. This. Yeah. Any chick that comes from that background is just fuck man. What chance do you have? I mean, you know, that's the one thing that I see. So clearly having babies, you see how you behave with them and how, you know you can influence their behavior and calm them down and put them, get them to think about things like explain things to them. You know, we don't do this because if we do this then it's going to hurt other people's feelings. And then you have them repeat it. Yeah, we're going to hurt other people's feelings. So we don't want to do that. And she'll stop herself and say things like that to me.

Speaker 4:          00:18:31       So it's like her mind is off in the right direction. But if you're, if that, if that's your mom or you know, if that's your dad, you're gonna act one way. But if your dad is like you stupid fucking content, you're just like your mother and then also your and your two and you're like, oh, I don't think that that's not happening. I mean people are out there. There's a story I read. It was a heartbreaking story. A guy who is with his, uh, his girlfriend's baby and it wasn't his baby. The baby was two years old. He beat it to death two years old. So I don't think that, I mean 90, I think in my opinion, 99% of all the problems that we have in our society is the way people are raised. 99%. Totally agree. People raising, get the fuck Outta here with this.

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       Who is calling me during the podcast? How rude. One robot voice. My mom, she heard I was talking about her cause from Dhl. Joe Has not paying attention to the positives. I can fuck what the fuck. Cock soccer, I'm calling put me online. You don't got the technology Brian and get that shit together. Come on Cock sucker. I want to be able to call in. I got questions. Um, 99% in my opinion. I mean that's a fake number. I just pulled it out of my ass as a a good, a good chunk of the reason we're fucked. It's because the way people raise kids, you know, no one is raising kids to, to look at the entire human race as one giant organism and just to be as cool as possible and make as many positive connections as possible. We're all raising kids to fucking go out there and compete and go kick ass and be the best to make money and get ahead and then what Di, you know, fuck we're, we're messing it all up or we're not enjoying the time here and now we have, we have all this fucking cool shit going on in, in this country and everybody's pissed off about the future.

Speaker 4:          00:20:15       It was sunny lane by the way, that they like show her parents packet. They show parents, her parents packing, uh, for her like putting clothes inside thing, her suitcase, there's your toothbrush and here's your ass cream. I watched one of reports after that and I felt so dirty. I felt like I shouldn't have been watching it. Like I was like her counselor or something like that and I was watching her porn, you know. You know what I'm saying? Like I felt like I knew she was fucked up then. You know, I knew there was just a lot, a lot of issues. And then I watched this video and

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I'm like yeah what am I doing my watching her suck someone's Dick for gross as so die and or yeah, yeah you said d the amp varied rap band for for those who don't know it's from South Africa. I think though the American way of saying it. Cause even Jim Kim, Jimmy Kimmel said die Antwoord or something like that. He didn't say it like all weird and I think this is, there's like an American way to say it and maybe he just fucked up cause they provide, I pre, pre told don and then he went and checked on it and yeah. And they all said at the same way. Hmm. Guy From South Africa told me was Deann Vert Danford whose DNV? [inaudible] well let's, let's listen to Ninja say it. Put on that Ziff side video and listened to him. So, all right. Have you, are you familiar with them? Asked her.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       Um, I've heard a little bit. I'm obsessed. I'm obsessed with them because they're so, it's a legitimate, it's like in this world of like, I mean, not zen, anything wrong with lady Gaga. I think lady Gaga was very talented. I really do. I know I like her. I think she's talented. She's got a great voice. She's hard. She's got a killer body and she, you know, she's out there making noise. I mean, for, for whatever reason, but it's not working on me. You know what I'm saying? It's like, I see what you're doing. I see that you're working at, and I appreciate the mastery of, you know, working in controlling the media and having all these people on your side and lady Gaga doesn't work for you. You don't like that. So she's not saying shit to me. It's all just, you're singing songs and you're wearing meat on your tits.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       And it's like, okay, it's not legit to me. Listen, it's not, what I'm saying is it's not, it's not someone who is being, it's not genuine to me, these feeble, I like what they're doing is like this fucking, first of all, it's ugly.

I heard you guys saying that she was, she's Hoxie. Yeah, Lady Gaga has got a Funky mug. But you know what, that's why she's working so hard. Yeah, she was hot as fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       She'd be like those kinds of the club with no ambition. Exactly right. That's why you have to be a little bit, I appreciate it. I appreciate Lady Gaga. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with her. I mean it's not my kind of music. I, there's a couple of songs that I enjoy, but it's not, it's boring to me that mum poker foods like just hocked deck. This is, this is the real shit. This is uh, this is um, what's his name? Ninja that high tech or whatever his name is. Well just hit play. This is DJ hoc deck that up the mother fucking beat box dog. I love the South African accent to bring that next level shit.

Speaker 6:          00:24:10       Oh, okay, well do you don't have it says the advert and they says, what does that is the answer. Yeah. And then he goes to answer to why audios, whatever. Actually I like lady Gaga Music. I liked that song operator where she's like telephone, where like, you know, like it starts scrambling up in the song. Just like if you were talking on his cell phone. Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I think that's a good song. Don't get me wrong. I think she's creative music too though. Yeah. I like dirty people. I like dirty people. I like people would fucking dirt under their fingernails, stinky breath and good stories. But when I first met her, she didn't wear deodorant. It had to talk her into wearing, oh my God. Are we being open about our situation here on the show as being friends? You guys be in pals making video for friends and you, um, you, you just smelled her and you're like, hey, this has got to change.

Speaker 6:          00:25:02       Right. You used to be like that too though. Like you didn't like wearing deodorant at one point. Still don't. I like on like a monkey. I think that if a man likes the way my underarm smell, then we're a good match. Really. He can deal with a lot of other things like a genetic or like whatever it is. Yeah. You don't want to deal with some weak dues pushed off by a little under set. I think it's cute. I like that fragile. That's a great conversation. But when you're trying to be a struggling actress, and then she was on the Jimmy Kimmel show as her brother, no sister as her sister and her part was Jimmy Kimmel's head right underneath her armpit. And can you imagine it was stinking? No, she was probably, well maybe it's just me. Cam, we'll call you back. Wash yourself before you went on.

Speaker 6:          00:25:50       Well, I got the call to do that show. Like literally I had 30 minutes to get there. So No. So when you got there, did you smell your underarms and give a little check? I'm pretty sure I was fine. You're pretty sure no one ever thinks they stink though. Yeah, but mentioned Jimmy Kimmel's nose right in her arm pit for like how long did it take the film? That shit. Yeah, he's probably going to think, oh this girl stinks. So you have to have a perfect stinky girl. Yeah, you have to be at like a professional. You're a right. So when you, when people talk vegans, they'll automatically think stinky feet close. Literally just, I dunno, I like it because I think dairy is bad for you and that makes me feel sick. That's Diaz. Jose, we've got a fucking problem. But soy milk actually tastes pretty good. Like soy milk lattes. That motherfucker just put

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       your phone off the hook. Yeah, I can't, it's not like it's in the other room and just have the, he said he's one of those add guys that'll keep calling it and then when you answer he'll get angry at you. What the fuck? Cock sucker. I called you five fucking times. Like, can I take a nap? Is it okay if I take a nap? I called you cocksucker you don't call me back. Don't call me back. What the fuck's going on? Funny. I'm sorry. We were talking about um, hippies and so you became [inaudible]. I'm sorry you're not a, you're not a hit, but you're vegan because dairy is bad for you. You just want to do it for health reasons. For health reasons basically. Yeah, I thought about doing that. Yeah, it's good. I feel better and I like, it's easy though in Los Angeles to do it because there's so many restaurants that have vegan like cake and you know, stuff like that. Cook. That's what you need. Cake.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       Well, I'm like really concerned about animals, but I don't want to make sure that this cake cake available, then I can do it. Right. Well, when you don't smoke or drink, there's very few things you have in life. Right, right, right. Why don't you try drinking? They'll mellowly like, like wine. I know a lot of people enjoy wine. You just don't like the taste of it. Or 21st birthday. I went out to dinner with my parents and had a glass of wine and I had one sip and spit it right back. I was so gross, I couldn't handle, one's an acquired taste, but I like it. I don't know why people acquired tastes. So I tried to acquire the taste of caviar once I was on a plane, they serve caviar and I'm like, okay, I'll try this. I'm like, this is ass. This is so stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Why would anybody pay a lot of money for this stupid tasting thing? It tastes like, smells like, tastes like warm smell. Like, like after a rain looks like a weird thing. Like, well it's not that bad, but it's a weird thing. I was like, why don't we do acquire a taste for something that's a Shitty, unless it's like super healthy, but wine I like, I, I genuinely like it and I think it's an acquired taste, which I just contradicted myself. But it goes well with certain things. Like if you're eating like meat, like steak, like a big juicy red ribeye and you're just chewing into that and you'd just feel that blood and that texture and then you have a little swig of Merlow to go with that. Ah, it's probably the best thing to put the whole entire world. It's fucking good. Then it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       Then it's good. Then it's just like they go together somehow or another. But if you just like hanging out with your friends and it's hot outside and like, let me get a glass of wine. I was like, yeah, why do you want, you know, you want me to it up Gatorade or one you'd rather, you'd probably have to start off with wine coolers. I think that's how everyone starts off as drinking wine coolers and then one day you go, I'm going to get a chardonnay or Pinot Gris. Yes. If I'm not interested in it. Like what's the point in starting? I feel like it only because it's going to cause trouble in my life. Wine's going to cause trouble. Like drinking. I've never drank, I've never been drunk. Well, you know, there's, there's, there's that, I mean, you could look at it that way or you could look at it that you're not going to have as much fun. Right? I mean, it is true. These are, I mean, these are, this is a legit way of looking at, I mean, people will argue, you know what, eagles sober people have plenty of fun sober people. I'm going to say this and I love you, but you're not nearly as interesting. It's not

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       all my funny friends, all my fascinating friends all either smoked pot or do mushrooms or do something and they fuck around with their mind. It's just everything in moderation. And you know, you don't have to not look at Stan hope. There's no moderation there, right. It's just everything while you're alive. Yeah. But it should be, that's what you should focus your whole entire life on. Everything in moderation except like heroin. But that's for me. And you may be, but I think for other people, they really don't mind burning the candle at both ends and seeing how long it takes til they die. Right. I mean, if you really look at it all objectively, it's like, you know, what is this an 80 year trip, a 90 year trip? If you're lucky, it ends for everybody. If it's not that enjoyable, isn't there an argument for a much more enjoyable fucking completely chaotic 47 years?

Speaker 4:          00:30:25       Oh my God. You know, drugs and alcohol. Yeah. Wait until you get your shit and then you level off. I mean, look, I'm not saying it's the way to go. It's certainly not the way to go, but it's a way to go. It's a way to go. You know, and it's, it's a way that's produced a lot of pretty fucking incredible artwork. That's, you know, every great musician, every great comedian, they've all fucked her head up. They've all done it. Every single one of them prior Kennison Mitch Hedberg mean just go down, stand hope, go down the line of all the guys that I really appreciate watching, they're all fucking either pot Ed's or they've done a bunch of crazy shit and lived a fucked up life. So it's not, I mean, it's not your Yogi, Vegan, you know, eating beans and sitting in the Lotus position way to go. But that way ends to man that way. Fucking shits out. And you're, you're crapping in your fucking the loin cloth.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       No, that's the dilemma that I have is like a lot of the comedians that I'm friends with constantly tell me, you'll write better, you'll be more creative. So that's sort of what's making me, it's made me consider it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:28       Well, it's also a testament to your character though, that you've got this thing in your head where you don't want to be a fuck up. Right. You know, it's like you have like, like a plan or you have, uh, you know, a guideline that it's like safe to operate in. You know, you're looking at like, I don't want to be a loser. I don't want to be of this. I don't want to be that. So I don't want to fuck around with drugs and I don't want to be like all these people. I mean, there's, that's, that's legit too. Have you ever become addicted to something so drastically before that? You're just, it scares you to try things like, I mean, you barely want to take Tylenol. You told me, you know, like you don't like taking,

Speaker 3:          00:32:03       um, I'm not, it's not like I've ever been addicted to anything crazy. Like no, but I, I think my, okay. Growing up, my parents, I've never seen them drink, they don't drink and they don't, they don't smoke or it just was never around it. And also I think it comes back to like high school, all the cool people started drinking and I was like, oh, I get it, but I don't need to do that right now. And I just sort of never started. Right. You're a rebel and being sober. Uh, yeah. I guess

Speaker 4:          00:32:31       you're fighting the status quo. You guys want to drink and party and have a good time. I'm going to listen to Morrissey and cry. Fuck you. Exactly, exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:32:37       And suffer from my art. No, I mean, yeah, they're really surprise. You're not really religious because it seems fucked up and all these other ways. How come you haven't followed Jesus? Yeah. Do you think you'll ever find Jesus? Is that right around the corner for you? Brain is too big for that

Speaker 4:          00:32:54       whoa. Strong words. Well, what do you think about scientists and all these like really intelligent, educated people that become Christians?

Speaker 3:          00:33:02       I, I don't know. I, if someone provides me with evidence and proof, I'll take a look at it. But I, I didn't, I wasn't raised with any religion and I, I mean I would like to believe in God and I think that people that do believe in God lead much happier, better lives than I ever will. But I just can't.

Speaker 4:          00:33:20       Yeah, that's an interesting thing, isn't it? Yeah. That a lot of people who are like Super Christian, it's like they have the answer. They have Deann word in their head and because of that they, they have like a piece about them. They, you know, they believe that this is going to end. It's going to go onto the next thing. And all this could be ironed out if we just made IOWASCA legal. If all these people that have these religious ideas of all these people that are confused and don't know what the fuck's going to happen if they really got a chance to go over to the spirit world and you can do it. If you want to go to Peru, do you want to go on a shamonic vacation? You'd cross you like a few hundred bucks and you get to stay in a hut for a few days and then I'll just cook up Iowasca and you'll sit around and drink it with the Shaman and they'll blow tobacco smoke in your face and you will fucking travel to the spirit world where you will get to see what it's like on the other side.

Speaker 4:          00:34:07       You will get to talk to your dead ancestors. You'll get to commune with mother Earth and see the leopards in the fucking jaguars and the snakes in the trees. You could do it. Do you know what Iowasca is? No. Iowasca as this crazy jungle brew. It's a good, see, it's a psychedelic brew that they've made by combining two plants. And, uh, these people have been taking it for thousands and thousands of years and they go over there and they have trips. Like people gonna have trips. Like we're, you know, they'll organize like big vacations while they'll send 20, 30 people into the jungle. And you know, you've got to take a boat to get to these fuckers. You know, they're like living like people been living for thousands and thousands of years. Very difficult to get to them. And then you can do Iowasca with them. What, like, who decides to go do that?

Speaker 4:          00:34:51       A lot of people do. They want to, you know, there's a lot of people that have had, see, we don't think about it in this country because it's all illegal. All those drugs are schedule one drugs. But in a lot of countries, for thousands of years, everyone's had these rite of passage, uh, things in their life. You know. I mean, for some people it's pain. Like there's tribes in the Amazon that they, they have these gloves with bullet ants in them. It's the craziest thing. I, it's, I've, I've found it online on Youtube. You can find it. These guys did a bullet ant. Apparently one aunt staying is like literally getting shot by a bullet. It's like my friend described it as like feeling like he got his arms slammed in a car door over and over again for hours. He said is the, is the most intense and excruciating pain and they stick their hands into these gloves that are filled with bullet ants and they'd just the bull Jews Jack them and they have to keep the gloves on for like 10 minutes and then for hours and hours during the in they're crying.

Speaker 4:          00:35:43       They're in incredible agony, but these are rites of passages and these rites of passage. The idea is that you have to have something that perturbs your normal state of consciousness, something that completely blasts you out of this current, like you know, this mundane state of existence in order to signify that you've made a transition, like this is going to be a very difficult thing to do. But once you've done this very difficult thing than the regular life, normal life, you're going to appreciate this so much more. You're going to feel like, like privileged, you're gonna feel like you've made this rite of passage. Like you've become, someone evolved, you know, you've, you've, you've reached the next level in the video game. Well, with Iowasca, you know, these, these rituals were totally painless, but psychologically very scary for people because you're, you're literally giving up control of your consciousness and connecting to this, this web of consciousness that's surrounds every life form on the planet and every life form that ever existed, they're all interconnected somehow.

Speaker 4:          00:36:41       And you, you realize during the four hours that you're on his trip, you realize that my God, like I'm like, everything's insignificant. It's not just that you're insignificant, it's earth isn't significant, but it's not as at the same time, it's like it's all connected in this weird, strange way that we don't understand. And that the way I was described as that life might be just one frame and an infinite movie that lasts forever. You know? I mean, you really do have to look at it like that. Well, IOWASCA provides this vision. IOWASCA provides you with this, like this, this, this, this idea, this way of looking at the world, you know? And that's totally illegal. It found interesting. And it also sounds to me, my first thought is very, very dangerous. Yeah. But not see, but the DMT, the chemical that it makes is a chemical to your own brain producers.

Speaker 4:          00:37:32       Oh Wow. So it's not, it's not dangerous at all. I mean, nobody's dying from this stuff, but people dying from cigarettes, people dying from alcohol to dying from a million different things that are not worried about, you know, but people are worried about doing this crazy thing. Well, this crazy thing is scary because you're going to give up control, you're going to go someplace, you're gonna. But that's what these rites of passages are all about. That's what like really, really figuring out, like really having a better view of life. You know, like, uh, like, like you really feel like you're evolving. One of the best ways to do that is to just really objectively look at what this life is, you know? And it's very hard to do that while you're in it. And what these psychedelic drugs do is they pull you out of this life and they let you look at it.

Speaker 4:          00:38:14       I mean, if they are religious experiences, this is the root of all religious experiences in psychedelics. I believe. So you want to do it right now? Try some. All right, so these people who have all done these like all throughout the past, you know, um, I think that's probably the original religious story. And then somewhere along the line they, they got twisted and more twisted more. And then instead of like seeing God as like, like really God is us and we're all together in this thing and it's this weird sort of like insane momentum behind like all life in the universe, everything together, all this one big thing. But you can't really see it in your everyday life and allows you see it when you did take entheogens are when you take mushrooms or something like that. And I think that's what that was the original message while that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:38:59       So that's why religion is good for you. I mean, that's why religion like why it can help you. Like why? Like people that do it live a happier life because in a way they're right. I mean, they're not really right that there's a dude in the clouds with a harp and he's got a book and Saint Peter Goes, so what have you done while she, oh, you did this. There's not that, it's not that, but there is something else. I mean it's a very, very likely that we are just like one part of a much, much, much bigger thing. Yeah. I don't doubt that. I just write, I guess I just don't believe in, I don't like to hear people talk about you're going to go to hell. Well that's, that's, that's the negative aspect of it. But the positive aspect, I met a lot of Christians that were really happy, really nice people because they really did believe that they were a part of something bigger.

Speaker 4:          00:39:48       They really did believe that they were doing the work of someone bigger and they really are. I mean, it really is what you're doing. Positive Shit. I mean, although the, the ideals of Christianity, the real ones are, you know, love your brothers. You would love yourself, don't commit crime, don't commit murder. Don't fuck your neighbor's wife. Like that kind of shit. Like that's all. I'm a subscriber. There's a lot of other stuff thrown in there. Like you're allowed to have slaves and beat your wife. But you know, you got to know that some Douche bag stuck that in there and they'll put the teams up here right here, 50 slave and fucking in the ass, you know, but, but the root of it all, like the ideas behind it, it's obviously clearly a guideline for living life and being happy and creating a harmonious culture.

Speaker 4:          00:40:29       I think that's good. The root of all those almost positively is come from psychedelic drugs for crazy murderers, monkeys that ran around and taking drugs and they sat back and just went, whoa, wait a minute. What are we doing here? What is this? It's not just me. It's not just you were a part of a Web, a network. The trees are intelligent, the dirt is alive, and they just have this intense feeling for you know, five, six hours or however long it is, depending on how many mushrooms they've eaten. And then they start to rethink. I'm turned off by the word drugs like that. Yeah. If you think about it like they're just consuming things in nature and this is happening. That's sounds a little different too. Yeah. Well that's cause we drugs, you know the idea we've, you know, put it as pills and that fuck your world up.

Speaker 4:          00:41:10       That's the problem is how can you have one word for everything? How can you have one word that includes coffee and cigarettes and heroin. You know like how are those together? How has, how has coffee and meth together, how are they in the same drug? But they are. How was, how was rockstar energy drink? How is that and should have it like a drug one through 10. Like it's a trig Wu. But here's the problem. Schedule One. Schedule One is like the least dangerous shit. It's marijuana. Heroin. Like the laws are completely fucked up. Mushrooms are scheduled one. Nobody's dying off. They need to start off a little bit slower than that though. Needs to be like level one, like, you know, at caffeine and you know, it should go through all the drugs, you know, he's like, that's a level six I had, she'd be logical. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:41:55       I have. I think I'm such a control freak. Like I've heard people talk about mushrooms and it sounds like, oh, you go through this exciting experience and that's really cool, but what if I'm like, I don't know. I feel like I would just get freaked out and be like, take it away. Like make it stop.

Speaker 4:          00:42:07       You might, because that's what happens if you try to control the trip. Yeah. If you are really worried and you, you know, look, you, what you're doing is very difficult. Okay. You're a single girl, you're 22 years old and you're committing to do stand up comedy in Los Angeles and you're, you weigh about 35 pounds and you look like you're 12. I mean, what you're doing is, that's a fucking dangerous thing. Did you have any friends out here?

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       Um, yeah, my best friend from college.

Speaker 4:          00:42:36       Yeah. And so you moved out here with her, with him and met him here. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, what you're doing is very, very risky and I bet your mind in your mind, you want to minimize all the outside risks as much as possible.

Speaker 3:          00:42:49       Glare. Yeah. And I like, I'm not against it morally at all. I mean if I, you know, I've achieved nothing so far, so it's like once I start to get somewhere and feel accomplished, I'm sure that I will sit back and like take a hit of something.

Speaker 4:          00:43:02       Right. No, I totally know what you're saying. I totally know where you're coming from. When I was a kid, um, uh, when I did martial arts, I never did any drugs. I never did anything. I hate only drunk or gotten drunk. Maybe like I could count on my hands and my fingers like maybe eight, nine times in my whole high school career. You know, it was like, oh, my friends would be fucking hammered all the time. I'd be going to parties, but I don't even, it was eight times. So it's probably less than that all throughout high school. All I did was, so I always thought the same way. I always thought that drugs are for losers. Yeah. Alcohol and drugs and you know, want to smoke cigarettes, you're going to be a zero. It's gonna fuck you up. And you know it just until I was like 30 that I smoke pot again.

Speaker 4:          00:43:40       Yeah. I think I may be done at once or twice, like over the years, like drunk at a party or something like that. But it was never like, Ooh, I'm going to smoke pot and like think about shit. Never. I would never even think of that. It'd be like, you fucking loser. You need pot to think about shit you fucking pussy. Like that's was my mentality. But it was the same reason. It was like, I was like hyper control freak. I was trying to like be successful. I didn't want to be a loser. I was gonna fucking go out there and I had a very similar attitude that you do, you'll about all these, this anger that you have towards these hot chicks. Yeah. You know, I mean, I had that same thing, you know, with towards, you know, I don't know who it was. It was a lot of different people.

Speaker 4:          00:44:15       I'd probably have an Asian man, much less specific. No, I've always enjoyed fine. I really nice guys. Um, as I totally know where you're coming from. Don't let anybody talk you into it. But the idea is once you become like a little bit more stable with your life, you know, then you start considering the idea of, you know, just fucking around with your consciousness. You don't have to do dangerous shit though. Yeah. Start off slow. Yeah. Start off with shotgunning we'd Af you know, whatever with another person and then next move on to, if you're going to smoke weed, just moat. Know who you're smoking a weapon. Just smoke a tiny bit. Yeah, just like a little baby hit or no, because then you'll just be like, ah, you just be like relaxed and silly and then you'll just have cool conversations and you won't be paranoid.

Speaker 4:          00:44:59       You know, like so many people come to me and they go, dude, I tried pot. You was listening to you. I tried pot. I got fucking super paranoid man. I told he fucking freaked out. I couldn't drive. I had to stay at my friend's house for like eight hours. His wife has tried to kick me out like it's always this terrible, terrible story. And Mike Gamble, you got to high stupid. Yeah. You weren't supposed to smoke five joints here first time. That's supposed to fucking a time travel. Right. You know when you smoke too much weed bend, you just lose time. We just ended up in play when I was in high school. I got super, super high. Me and my friend Josh and my girlfriend, there was one time that I deviated from my plan and uh, we were like 15 and my stepfather had weed and it was really good weed.

Speaker 4:          00:45:37       My stepfather was a super hippie who was like long hair, computer programmer, the whole deal. And he had some bomb ass weed and uh, it was one of the reasons also that I never smoked weed. This is, I just always assumed that it was terrible for you because of this experience. So we were over my girlfriend's house and we smoked this pot and then we would just appear in rooms. I was like blip and now I'm in the kitchen. How do I get the kitchen blip now I'm on the couch. I mean, we were all doing this. I mean we were our little 15 year old, weak ass brains were way to just, there's no way we had the experience to deal with this kind of weed. It was, it was craziness. And from then on I was like, I could just be fucking, I just wake up and traffic driving, you know, like what if, what if that happened?

Speaker 4:          00:46:22       What if I have flashbacks, you know, to me I considered like, wow, I've dodged that bullet. I learned the pots for losers, you know, it's not even the case. My, I didn't get stone the first time I did it. I like would get stone like three times or something like that and nothing would ever happen. And then finally one day I got to stone and I just wanted to watch cartoons all day. You should try it. And it's good for your asthma. Even though you say it's bad for your asthma, it's actually really good for your ass. It's, the smoke is not good for asthma. No, no, you don't have to smog it too. There's a thing called a vaporizer and they brought her, just makes mist and when it makes us miss, it's really pretty cool. The missed. Um, like it seems like, like you're blowing fog almost out of your mouth and like a lot of people go to d because they're like, I don't even, I mean I'm feeling there's no smoke. Like they feel like they're not getting enough. But you are, you're getting the burned off THC crystals only for you. You'd want only like three volcano bags full. Three full bags of volcano. Definitely. Good for you to contemplate to his, I'm thinking about jumping off a bridge. We'll start freaking the fuck out. I saw the craziest thing. I saw her do stand up the other day and I you about it. But it

Speaker 8:          00:47:30       was amazing. Uh, there was, what does it? Saddle ranch. Oh, it was like the worst audience ever. It was just people rowdy, not paying attention. The comments were chatting on sunset? No, it was a universal universal center and there was even comic right next door to John Lovitz his club. Yes. There's like a little standup thing going on. Yeah. And so like there, there's even stand up comics. They're just waving their legs and their arms while they're on stage. Just trying to get attention. It wasn't that bad. Wow. And then she gets on stage and everyone just, it was weird. Everyone just shut up and then started applauding and clapping and it was amazing. I've never seen somebody Turner room around biker and like, I saw three comics go up and fail. And how, how good were the comics that went up before? Uh, I mean they were pretty good if you were to listen to their jokes. I'm not saying they're the best or anything, but they're decent, you know. And then the two guys from, uh, ways that repo man. Yeah. And I dunno the show. Yeah. Yeah. Like these big buff guys that have to have some true

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       TV. There's only one repo man. It's with Emilio Estevez bitches. All right. I'm not watching your shelter. You change the fucking name. Okay. You can't be repo man. Yeah. Kevy even repo men, that's done. You know. Totally even want to say Cosell repossession ink. That's cool. You can't change. Make the name of your show one of the greatest cult movies ever and then make a cheap fake. Yeah. You're cheating you cons. Yeah. You're making it fake. Yeah. You Fox. So what about a reality show? Asked her, would you be down for that following little Esther around? No, I don't know. I guess would while little Esther, how about this? How about a reality show with you and Brian were, Brian just gets you to do terrible, terrible things like that video you guys made. What is it? Where can people find out if you've got a little esther.com she has her on there. It's called an Ester is spelled with a t. H. E. S. T. H. E. R. Yeah. [inaudible] dot com and a, it's a video of Brian literally legitimately getting her to try cigarettes for the first time. Alcohol for the first time. He got you to try all these things.

Speaker 8:          00:49:22       Like I just stepped it though. And I barely am hailed the cigarette and yeah, it was, it just reaffirmed everything. I already, I'm like, this tastes discussing, this makes me feel sick. Like it reaffirmed everything. The only thing he liked was the shoplifting. One guy, she went back, sack tee times. It's like, I'm just doing more shit from this place. I

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       shoplifting. I just said, did you stop it for real gummy bears? Like, you know how they have all the candy out and really did shoplifting. Yeah. Took a few pieces of candy. Whoa. Yeah. And we'd go to jail for that. Right. You're talking about they're middle men again. I thought it was just a setup. They were samples. Okay. Okay. I was free. Right. It was legit. I think there's like a uncalled law that you're allowed to sample a, when you go to those candy shops, you're allowed to sample one to see if you want to buy it. They have it open. It's like a little gummy bear that's not really shoplifting. Oh, okay. It is though, because if everyone just knows one stove, gummy bears, everyone's told gummy bears. I smoked cigarettes, uh, when I was 15, I smoked one and I didn't like it and I just, I was like, this is disgusting. My sister won up getting hooked and that was another, it showed me like, okay, this is obviously not good. And then when I was about

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       23, I did some, there was like a bunch of comics, they were doing some sketches and we were trying to put together some sketches and one of the characters was this guy who was like this cigarette smoking, like um, like poet guy who was like, what was writing terrible poetry and smoking cigarettes all the time and like smoking, like, so I had to play that guy and I was like smoking the cigarette. Like I smoked cigarettes all day while we rehearsed this and my hands were shaking, my whole body was freaking out. I must've smoked like at a no cigarettes ever. I must've smoked like seven cigarettes. That's crazy, dude. I was shaking. I was shaking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, and I couldn't talk all that good. It was like my words are coming out. It was like I needed breasts in between my words. I was like, Dow fucking crazy that people suck down two packs these things a day.

Speaker 4:          00:51:14       Whoo. That's a, that is the biggest mind fuck in the history of our society is that cigarettes are not just legal, but that cigarette and tobacco companies are allowed to send money to politicians and put politicians in office and contribute to their funds so that the politicians support them and give them good laws and make sure that they can continue to sell their shit and stores everywhere. You know? Meanwhile they're killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. I can't even think about it as it so crazy. Like if something, if something gives you cancer, like if they find out the diet coke no fucks you up or something like that, you've got to get rid of it. You got to pull it off the market. It's a fact for sure that cigarettes fuck you up. It's so disgusting. I can't handle. I like their new commercial for like the nonsmoking thing where it was like broken glass, you know, we're recalling broken glass and he was like, only if co companies, you know, recalled products that wasn't, uh, you know, they should read recall cigarettes the same way.

Speaker 4:          00:52:11       You know, it's all about that money, man. It's all about the money. There's too much money on cigarettes. It's a multibillion dollar industry. People like them and I support the, if you really want to have a cigarette, you should be able to do whatever the hell you want to do. You know, if you want to smoke. So I like cigars. Kevin James and I smoke cigars sometimes. He's the only one that really struck them with, he likes, you know, Ari, Ari and I smoke cigars or mature for cigars. Look man, they taste good. I like it. It's, again, it's an acquired thing. It's like you can enjoy it if you have a big fat fucking piece of meat and sit down with a big cigar. It's fun. But you could do it. You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want. But the idea that you know that this isn't like something that people are trying to stop.

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       The idea that you have these people that are politicians but they're not like coming out and saying Lazy Jen, we'll do it. We've got a real issue here. We're losing loved ones were getting sick. We're losing time on the job. This is costing employers money like and it's costing you your enjoyment of this time here you're addicted. This little fucking country cigarette man, we've got to stop this shit at the same time. No one's unaware that that's what it's like. Yeah they are, but we were babies. We need someone to step up and say it. You know, if they, if all of a sudden you know the fluids in the news, all they have to do is put the flu in the news and say we have to be careful to wash your hands and this and that. The flu is in the news and then everybody goes home.

Speaker 4:          00:53:21       The fluids in the news. You knew about the fucking flu. Goddammit. The is always coming every goddamn winter. It's the same thing. It's a new flu. This year. It's the pig flu. Next year it's the bird flu. It's a fucking flu. You get sick every year. Well, you know, don't touch things that shitheads touch. Wash your hands. Take probiotics, eat acidophilus in yogurt. Take care of your body. Take your vitamins, get some sleep. It's all fucking, we all know it, but we need to hear it. We need to hear it. We need daddy to tell us though. Flu. Get your flu shot. Ladies and gentlemen, Wash your hands. You can use this. This is PRL. This kills 99% of all bacteria. I like your purple bottle that's on this couch. It's like parral with shit. Like on the bottle. That's probably chocolate. It's like a joke. That right there. The joke. It's like the cleanest solution is covered with poop. It doesn't look like poop. Oh, you know what it is actually, it looks like a piece of tape that's been peeled off at the sticky stuff is here and the sticky stuff is accumulated. A bunch of dirty things. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:54:17       Hmm. Ah, so good point though, Brian. Just going to put this on my ball back. So it feels like, so if you were to ever do a show where it made you just try a bunch of things, would you like if you got paid for that show, would you do things like that you would never do? Like, like eat a raw, you know, medium rare steak. Would you uh, you know, try to be a stripper for a day or you know, like do shit like that? I wouldn't do like weird, weird stuff. Like I wouldn't not, you brought me, that sounds really not even like if you were being paid for it, like each episode you're getting $5,000. I don't know. That's a really, uh, I'm, no, why not? Cause I like to use my brain, but you're that afraid of me. I'm not, I've eaten meat. I mean, and every now and then I'm like, okay, yeah, I'll have a bite of that cheeseburger. But, so I'm not like super strict and I grew up eating meat a lot. What made you stop eating meat? I'm just kind of reading different books and getting bored and just trying to learn different things and yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:55:16       I really miss about health health, some main reason. Yeah. So, so you're like very concerned with making sure that your life is in order. Yeah. Very concerned with your health and very concerned with, you know, don't doing anything dangerous and your future and everything like that basically. Is that to offset all the danger you take in this fucking crazy risky career?

Speaker 6:          00:55:35       I think so. Yeah. And I mean, I also don't, I don't know. You don't, you don't, you can't trust many people. I mean, I'm hanging out at comedy clubs till three in the morning where everyone else is a guy and in their thirties and you had been trying to take advantage of you. Oh, well I think that goes without saying. Really. No. I mean, no, no one does anything crazy. But I mean, they'll try to kiss you when you didn't want it. Yeah. We all might say names. Yes, that happens. So we know the story. So you were in speaking of or you were in Don [inaudible] Dingdong show or were you in the no, I was on the Dingdong show. I was in, he has a band called the bears Kennedy overdrive that I was a part of for a year and a half actually. That's the air guitar band. Yes. They, they pretty much

Speaker 8:          00:56:24       our a part of for a year and a half. Yeah. As Jesus Christ. How much patience do you have is actually

Speaker 3:          00:56:30       really uh, integral like part of my comedy career I guess because I like developed a lot. I got a lot of stage time. I was there every night to like sometimes three in the morning was even no one in the audience. And like I played this character that's actually had a little Esther videos sort of came about because I play this character that, you know, don goes, is there any a dancer in the audience? And I'd be like, be sitting in the audience like, Oh, I can do it. And then on stage and everyone's like, oh my God, who let the 14 year old in here? And like it just wouldn't just improvised stuff every night. And it was actually a pretty cool and so you were doing this even without an audience? Um, yeah there would be audiences a lot, but some nights there were not audiences and wow. Don is very, he's a die hard performer and he's one of the smartest people I think ever. He's so funny and there's very fine cheese is a great guy. Oh my God, he's so funny. He's so weird. He's crazy. And he's just like literally, I feel so lucky that I got to develop with him cause he's definitely like made a big part of the character.

Speaker 4:          00:57:31       So you developed this character doing that, right. And then so that is who you are when you go on stage. No, you're you when you go on stage. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:57:40       Which is really weird because like when I first met her, she was the little character person. And so like I thought all right, this girl is like a little girl and then you meet the adult person. It's so weird cause you're, you are like uh, you play like you're, you trick yourself into thinking you're a kid.

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       Yeah. I mean I guess it's more, let's honestly, it's probably more like multiple personality disorder and don't say anything. Maybe bipolar. No, I don't know. I just like, sometimes I act like a kid and I just get into it and I commit to it yet.

Speaker 4:          00:58:08       Okay. What's the trauma? There's no, what has gotten you into this, this form of a performance and communication? What it was gotten. You understand the economy something. Huh?

Speaker 8:          00:58:18       My, I'm trying to figure it out. My theory and you can tell her, my theory is that one day she's going to like drop her car keys and bend down to pick it up and there's going to be this huge flash in her head and she's going to remember all this shit that she's totally blacked out. I literally have no idea. I'm be a scientist with your theories. Doesn't it seem like it's something like that would happen like the $6 million man for guy. My Dad used to kiss me on the tummy too hard. You know the problem with those,

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       those types of memories that like, you know, Roseanne's that or she remembered being molested when she was two or something like that. You're real memories from back then are a ghost, you know, your, your body first of all isn't even the same body. Every single cell in your body changes over every seven years. So a lot of times you're, they don't even know where the memories are stored. The only, the only options are that it's not a local, but the memories are somewhere out in the ether and you can tune into them and access them like a cloud, which is ridiculous. And then the other option is that they're in the neurons because the neurons are the only things that don't get swapped out, like with cells.

Speaker 3:          00:59:18       I do remember being breastfed. Do you? Yeah, I really,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       yeah. I was breastfed really late years. Three and a half, three and a half years old. Most people do. At what, six months is the Max usually? Sometimes three. My wife does it for a year. A year? Yeah. Three and a half years ago. She remembers it being done though. Really good for you. Yeah. I have one memory of being brown. Oh, there's a woman that I know who did it to her four year old. Wow. Yeah. Four years old. Four years old. The kid would get upset. She would just worry about a tip. But can you, can you imagine remembering at Joe? Can you remember? No, I have heard that people can remember really in depth things about their childhood. I have some distant ghostlike memories from being very young, like five and four and three and one very clear. One of her very traumatic moment when I was young I was about five, but the other ones are like goes, what's your traumatic moment? My Dad beat the shit out my mom. Right, right, right. No mine. The youngest, I can remember my mom says I was three and a half for my great grandmother was sitting on this bench across this like a farm field and I guess there was a, a nes ate chicken nest or something like that nearby. Uh, uh, I think it was chickens and I was walking towards her and I got too close and then like maybe five chickens like attacked me. Like, like I just remember my great grandmother being too old going, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       Oh help him. He's getting attacked

Speaker 4:          01:00:36       cause she could walk over and stuff like that. And I just remember my mom here, my mom would go, oh my God. And she runs up and gets all these chickens off me and I had like bloody phase and everything like that. How old were you? I think like three and a half. Four to went on a chicken slaughter. Rampy yeah. I would have killed those chickens with baseball bats, but that was my kid. I would have smashed all those little cunty chickens. I remember cause one hit me right in between you and they kind of got your eyes, just chickens get sick if once you can get sick and he falls to the ground, right? Yeah. The chickens will just pick at it. Death. Really? Yeah. They'll peck the dead. They'll start eating and eating his eyeballs. He in his brain. Yeah. Pack the shit out of him. Chickens are cuts. What's your most dramatic moment from your childhood as the youngest? You can go, I can't even think of any thing. Okay. So do you think that the trauma was all being ostracized by the cool kids and that you know, being forced on the outside and forced to think that you're a piece of shit and you're not special and so then you have this motivation to show that your specialty, your performer, that you can make it, that you could be successful?

Speaker 3:          01:01:33       I think I, but I also think at too comes from like my family. My mom is Christian and my dad's Jewish and my mom has like this big, a big family with like a lot of cut. There's cousins and aunts and whatever. And I always sort of felt like I was like the one Jew like that no one liked and they'd like, I was not included in a lot. And I think that is like mostly it because it's school. When I was little, I was finally, I was like a leader in like my teachers always said like, oh, Esther's kind of bossy and people follow her around like so I know that I was confident early on, but I think like just having a family where I felt like I wasn't a part of what they were a part of made me feel like, well then I don't care and I'm going to do my own weird stuff. And so yeah, that seems pretty active.

Speaker 4:          01:02:17       So you, you felt almost like as a young kid,

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       because they're one side of the family was not Jewish and you're Jewish and you had, you couldn't mix in, you felt there was other Jewish people, they just didn't like her. That's what you're saying. No, cause she's saying your mom's side, right? The Non Jews. I don't, but I didn't really associate it with being Jewish. Now I do a little bit, even though that might not be fair of me to say, but it's like I just, I didn't really fit in with everyone. So your, your mom was Jewish. Christian. Okay. So you weren't raised Jewish though. So you're not a Jew? No. So what are you saying that I, my dad's a Jew. Right. But at your camp, you're not a Jew. Technically have to, but you're not Jewish religious wise. Right. He comes from the mother. But people that are not Jewish, if they know that you're have one Jewish parent, it's sort of like, Oh, you're a Jew.

Speaker 6:          01:03:04       A lot of people are like that. Yeah. Jewish people say I'm not Jewish and non Jewish people say that I am. No one wants me in their group. Wow, you've got this thing, you've got this. I'm on the outside looking in thing. I do. I sort of like the, the Rogan board posts will start coming in. Whoa. George try to cycle. Why isn't he doing it? Doctor Phil Voice through a girl on the show call called, Oh my God, there's, they said so many mean things about me. They're like, she's 20 Felix 25 and she's like a weird child lady cleaning my house.

Speaker 6:          01:03:44       Oh, I understand. It's okay. And then one said that I have the face of a 14 year old and the stomach of a 34 year old. That is rude to you, that motivate you in any way? They want to go to the gym, do some crunches. I do want to go to the gym. Yes. But I um, I mean being in stand up like one of my comedy mentors is Ari Shaffir and he constantly tells me that I'm, that I'm like need to lose weight like I'm used to. Yeah, he tells you that. Was he talking to him? I wrote him this text message cause we had the same agent. I'm like all right my, our agent said that cause I put that little extra video out and he was like, he said that that video is going to hurt me and it's dirty and things they're going to ban me from the casting directors won't talk to me and our response back was lose weight.

Speaker 6:          01:04:37       Wow. Did he say something like you will always be no, he told me, he's like, you're going to die alone and it's going to be your fault. He's so mean to him, but I enjoy it. I don't know. I think it's, I think it's funny. He's funny when he's mean instead of Juju thing you think or do you think that is how he talks to ladies? That's how I talked to the lady. He knows you don't want him, so he's lashing out at the same way you do with those hot chicks, I guess. Yeah, and every time like a hot check, I'll walk by. He's like, she taught her than you. [inaudible] is rude, but the good thing about that kind of rude thing amongst friends is when you hear it from someone else, let's try to hurt your feelings, but it doesn't work at all. Shut up stupid. Yeah. I got this the first time

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       I've heard that dummy. Exactly. Yeah. All right. Do you ever say anything negative to him? Not really. I'm pretty nice. I, I've got some ideas, some shit down for claim to give you some information. Shit's discuss. So I bought hall and you haven't seen Jew clam. If you just googled Jew cloud, it is. You should. Fear has had apparently ferocious hemorrhoids his entire life and they have malformed his bottle. He says it's all back to normal now, but I don't believe him. I don't even think he knows what the fuck normal is. He always thinks it's supposed to feel like sitting on bubble gum. Yeah. It's like you remember that chick that got her face bitten off by the chimpanzee? Yeah, we fixed it. We fixed your face paint. No, fixing that bottle. That thing is, I don't know what happened, but uh, so you've seen his bottle on a video? Yeah. So he didn't take that it would hurt your career at this, you being dirty stuff? No. Most a lot of people, all the comics don't think it will. I mean the Disney channel probably won't look at me anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:06:15       You don't need that shit. You're funny. If you're funny, just keep doing comedy. Keep doing what you think is funny. Look at Sarah Silverman. She's dirty as foxes and everything. Selling fucking books are in the New York Times bestsellers and movies is always on television. You know, you don't have to be clean. Yeah. That's nonsense. That's if what that's all that is is people with a, they're shortsighted with limited imagination that are trying to sell you. That's all it is. They think that they have to sell you as someone who squeaky clean. Why the why? That's what everybody else is doing. You know what, what is your personality like? What's coming out of your own brain and obviously your brain is very complicated. It's not going to be right down the middle and squeaky clean and always, you know, fucking softball bullshit, you know, whatever the fuck's on your mind, what it out, you know, it's harder and it's easier. It's harder for a little bit because you know, then people were like, why is she swearing? I don't like when she talks about cock, but then after a while, you know it's good because you're like, hey, you want to go see that little list or yeah, I love, she talks about car people know and then they'll go see it and look forward to it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       You need to talk about cock on stage more. I don't actually ever super clean onstage. Yes. Wearing no. I mean sometimes it will slip out, but because that video is pretty dirty. It is. But I don't say anything dirty. And the video is [inaudible] dot com as well. Yeah. I just make other people say dirty things, right? Yeah. But you're pretty demented onstage though. How am I diminishing like squeaky clean? Like, Hey, we went, did I wear my heart on my sleeve? Like I'm very much whatever mood I'm in, I just go, well that sounds like fun. I'm going to cunty mode. I didn't want to pee up here performing, but that's what he does really want to fuck me, whatever like that. But sometimes you have to be like that to discover things. Hmm. That could

Speaker 4:          01:07:59       true. Or it could be an excuse for not controlling your behavior that you look at it. Like why I don't want to be organized. Because if I was organized and I wouldn't be creative, a lot of people like they don't develop discipline and they don't do the things they're supposed to do and they'll somehow or another justified in their head, well, hey then this is how I discover this is high. Take chances up there. It's like the brilliant point actually. But I, I'm, I'm working on my organizational skills, but no, I sometimes you have very prepared things and sometimes I'm just like, I'm going to, I just want to try and riff as much as possible. I think that's a great thing. I riff a lot. I do a lot of question and answer stuff on my shows. But what's important to me is I got to go on stage with a good frame of mind.

Speaker 4:          01:08:39       You know, it's very important but I mean you're talking probably like these 45 minute sets or whatever. I'm talking like a three minute potlucks out of the comedy store. Like I might be in a country mood, but even that like why, why go up there then? Why, you know, I mean yes and no. I mean why not take some chances? Who knows? But it's not like that all the time at all. I've had friends that have had real problems with not being able to regulate their state of mind before they go on stage. And like you'll, you'll have some sets that are great. And then other sets where you can tell there's like, there's like some disconnect between them and the audience. You know, we had a buddy that was going through a long stretch of shitty sets and he wasn't telling us what apparently his girlfriend had broken up with them and moved out and he didn't tell us and we, we were were like, what the fuck is wrong with this dude?

Speaker 4:          01:09:22       Like when you talk to him, he's like barely there. It's like, it's weird like something's going on. And then one day, you know, we were eating and he told us the whole story. I'll, she broke up with me and this and I'm like, we were going to say anything like you fucking Weirdo. Like for like months, you know, we're like a, so that was a check. Everything good. Yeah, everything's great shit. And meanwhile we were wondering what this dude was falling apart on stage, you know, like kind of harness that and talk about the breakup. Then you create a lot more stuff if you're saying, but especially if you're a man. A lot of times the problem with men is when men get dumped, it's like their, their, their reason for existing is like there, it gets questioned. For a lot of men, like when they're there, they're worth is like gone to zero.

Speaker 4:          01:10:09       You know, they, they don't feel valuable. They feel like a loser. You know, like a man gets dumped, a woman leaves him for another man. She takes off and like your step by yourself, like you don't feel worthy to go on stage and talk. You don't feel like anything you have to say is valid. Like you're a zero. Like that chick just broke up with you and she's probably got another dude's Dick in her mouth right now and you're thinking about this and you're like, fuck. And you, you know, you make mistakes and you call her or trying to get her back and he say stupid shit. Like let's just try one more time. And then she says no. And then she hangs up the phone. You're like, what the fuck? I'm just a loser. And then tried going onstage right then and there and they're ready.

Speaker 4:          01:10:42       Go, you know, ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Mike mcfuck stick and Mike like, fuck stick goes up there and just eat shit. I've had to do that, but I've never done to anyone. I always get broken up with really always. Oh, I've only had like four boyfriends, but wow. Well, you know what? You're going to get the opportunity to dump this new one. You can. You could, you could fucking pull the strings on this one. This can be your first. What are you guys talking about? I don't know. Her just got some new boyfriend. It's really cool to have the black. Did they blocked in big, big block too. Um, have you ever dated a black guy? No. No you wouldn't. What about a mud race?

Speaker 6:          01:11:18       What's the Monterrey one? Just make sure if you're an ignorant racist in some, I don't know Brown people. No, I'm not an ignorant racist. I'm just making jokes. You know, some jungle dude. Some fucking, I don't know. I don't date on this date. A dude from Vietnam? I don't think so. I don't know. I ever meet. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:11:41       And wouldn't choose smoke cigarettes? No.

Speaker 6:          01:11:46       What do you look for in a guy besides red hair from, um, I don't know. I don't really look for things in guys. I just, if a guy like is, I don't know. There's nothing. I have no answer.

Speaker 4:          01:12:00       What's it like going from Chicago? Meaning like Chicago guys, regular dudes eating sausage and shit.

Speaker 6:          01:12:04       Well, I'll say this. I went literally two and a half years in college. No boy ever hit on me and I was like, no, I didn't even kiss anyone. Like I was two and a half years in college. Yeah. In College. Pillows get fucked. Everything gets fucking college. But I didn't, I didn't drink, I didn't go out. I wasn't social. I was really into comedy and stuff then. But I mean sit in like meat guys during doing the comedy stuff. Not really. Not of interest to you or then? I think both. Really? Yeah. I mean I went to like one of the big 10 schools. So there's all these like really pretty Midwestern like sweet girls. Yeah. Why? Like all those guys, the sorority people, you know, people go from them losers. I'm like there, I'm like the weird

Speaker 4:          01:12:56       nerd. And did you ever do comedy at a Sorority? No, I didn't. No, no, I was living in Boston. I did a fraternities couple times. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It was just like basements and shit. Go down the handle, like a little mic set up and 50 dudes in a room and tell call me strange. There's a lot of places to do comedy. When I lived in Boston, there was a ton of like satellite rooms and bar rooms and you got to get all kinds of different looks. You know how you're talking about the saddle ranch, you know, those, those are terrible shows to do. Yeah. But they're good shows to do to, you know, up to a certain point. Some guys just, I remember, uh, um, who the fuck was it? Freddy? Freddy Soto was the first one to say it. He, uh, you know, he was a very funny guy that passed away a few years ago, but he was a comedy store regular. And dudes would always be like, Hey Freddy, I'm doing a show at, you know, the Mikes pub down the street on Tuesday nights. You know, and you want to come by and do a set. And He'd be like, thank you. But uh, you know, I only do comedy clubs like I'm done. I'm done with all that nonsense because the nonsense the have to deal with when you're doing comedy in a non comedy club, you know, the bar and the noise and people talk and especially in Hollywood, you know. But those are good too. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:14:08       Oh yeah. I mean I'm desperate for that right now. Stage is stage time.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       It's, I'll take what I can get. But yeah, I definitely prefer the comedy club setting. I mean who wouldn't,

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       but don't you think that it's good to do those shitholes yeah. Cause it makes you like really grab people's attention. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:14:23       I mean you have to really command everyone in the room and also you have to just sort of deal with the fact that some people are not going to pay attention to you and they're going to drink and they're going to heckle. And they're going to shout, show me your tits. And you know, stuff like that. You just, it's, it's part of that and it's, it's fun, but it also will show me your tits. No, no, no. You don't know. But I laugh at, I don't hate it. I'm like, okay, you're drunk and you think that that's funny if you say it so I understand and you don't know how to be funny in another way. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       Cut it down. You break it down like guys just sitting there like was from Iowa so we roll. Yeah. Girls on stage and say show us your tits cause you never know. I'm just taking a chance. You did all the Improv classes too, right? Like the second city and shit. Like a bio in Chicago and travel and Joe, what does that,

Speaker 3:          01:15:12       it's like, it used to be called Improv Olympic. It's like where Chris Farley, all those Improv people. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:18       And you were just going to give us the abbreviation. Like everybody knew what the fuck you were talking about. They, I think [inaudible], I think they just call it Iot are not allowed to call it some kind of like Olympic lawsuit Olympic or Improv Olympic really can, you can have a club Improv with all the comedy clubs. I would think that that would be more of an issue. Well I think Olympics is actually like a ne, isn't it? An Olympics? Like a name? Like it's like a coca cola. Yeah. Oh is it really? Yeah. So it's called Io trademark the Olympics because I think they made it, didn't that, wasn't it around in the Greek days? Oh yeah, no. Yeah, it wasn't. It was it. Yeah. The Olympic cows. Oh, how long does the Olympic Games are going on for? Was a lot of Roman numerals connects, you know, you look at that, that's like, someday there's going to be UFC in Roman numerals is getting too many numbers. Totally have to go with centuries, two x's and shit. Did you ever think to like maybe try like a Saturday night live skit or is that something you wanted to do? Like kind of like a, you know, like a live Improv? Yeah, totally. I mean, I grew up watching that show. That's like, would you prefer to goal like a comic or would you still be a comic or is it, is it the comic thing that you,

Speaker 3:          01:16:25       I dunno. I mean I, I'm playing everything by ear. You know, I don't know what's going to happen with, but I'm interested in all of it. I just like getting on stage and making people laugh and being myself. Right? So I'm playing characters too, but right now I think it comes in phases. Sometimes I'm more interested in what can I, what character can I create and what can I do? And then other times I'm like, I just want to be myself and talk and what are my thoughts and how can I get them out there? And that's sort of what I'm in right now. Just stand up.

Speaker 1:          01:16:50       It's way harder for a way harder for a girl to get into comedy. Way Harder when you're on stage, people don't want to hear you talk. A lot of men do not want to hear a woman talk for 10 minutes or an hour. And how many dudes want to go pay to see Ellen degenerates do comedy, you know, three to know that aren't gay. You can come on. Really.

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       I mean it's like one of those. I mean, you might, I would, I would have a dad. She's good. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's like you have some no name woman headliner at the Improv in Cleveland. Good fucking luck selling tickets. Good luck. It's conti. Mcgillicuddy from fucking from nowhere. Where's she been? Well, she was on comedy central wants. Wow. Yeah, whatever. Let's go to the movies. You know, it's very hard to sell tickets. It's very hard at black. I though the like, look at that black guy. Probably funny. I'll take a chance. Yeah. Black Man. Probably funny, right? White girl. The fuck is she got to say since this silly bitch out to say what's your favorite

Speaker 3:          01:17:41       comics? Um, I really into Louis C K right now. I love his show. Louie. Yeah. Great. Great. Great question for me to add.

Speaker 4:          01:17:52       So what I was saying about, but girls doing comedy, like you, you don't get as many different things you're allowed to talk about either you can't have opinions on, you can't call people don when it comes to politics or opinions on, you know, the president or opinions on the way the world should be run. Like you enter into like a danger zone where there's knee jerk reactions where people automatically don't want to hear a young girl with opinion.

Speaker 3:          01:18:17       Right? Well already. Yeah, because I look so young people sort of don't trust that I have a brain and on top of the fact that I'm a girl. But so I mean, luckily like I'm not right now, at least where I am, I'm not talking about political stuff and topical stuff. I'm really just sort of talking about what are my thoughts and feelings on myself or on the situation that I just experienced. Like it's just, you know, I'm not getting into in depth in Paul,

Speaker 4:          01:18:43       what would something, I'm sure, but, um, but what if something happened and it was relevant to your life? Like what if there were some new political decision or some new local law or whatever that is relevant to your life. You might start talking about it and saying, yeah, like, you know, like what if you had a really good friend and the friend was trying to get married and they were gay, and then all of a sudden the law passed and you couldn't marry gay people anymore, couldn't get married.

Speaker 3:          01:19:04       You would say something about that, right? Yeah. That would upset me and I'm sure I would talk about it

Speaker 4:          01:19:08       and then there'd be some guy in the audience goes, fucking, if I wanted to hear your fucking opinion, I'd be a to you.

Speaker 3:          01:19:16       Yeah, I don't know. Then I would just say like, thank you, sir. Please sit back down. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:19:21       So you're preparing your prepare yourself for all these people to say shitty things to you.

Speaker 3:          01:19:25       Yeah, I mean, I'm used to it. I mean, like you said before, you know, if you get it from your friends first, when you get it from the outside world, it's not so bad.

Speaker 4:          01:19:31       Yeah. Yeah. Our sphere is helping you, but I have always admired chicks doing comedy. It's, it's more difficult than men doing it I think. I think it's a, it's a totally different animal and it's like, it's like women's mixed martial arts too. You know, like a lot of people don't like watching women fight like Yo, much more crazy. It is for a chick to be fighting. That's like a dude fighting with swords. You know, like men want to fight, it fills, it's normal. But for chicks to actually train and fight and pick a girl, I'm like, listen bitch, at six weeks we're going to throw down. You better fucking ready and then you run it up pills and shit and throwing sandbags around for a girl to actually do that. That bitch has got to be crazy.

Speaker 9:          01:20:08       You know, like off the deep end. Crazy like 10 times crazier than a man is doing it.

Speaker 3:          01:20:11       The, they're tough cookies. I once had lunch with this chicken knock Amera she's like an undefeated champion boxer and she like just, they're tough.

Speaker 9:          01:20:21       That's where she's really hot. You wish really, you would have went with it? Probably she reigned over and just grabbed the hairs on the back of your neck and just ball them up and just controlled your head. Just about, my cat's trying to get in here, get out here. You fuck. Would you let her happen? Did that? I guess I would. Yeah, you would. And you would let her. So you're down for a lesbian experiences. Just the chick's got to pull the trigger. Not the, I guess I, I mean, I'm pretty easy going, so whatever happens, you're pretty easy going.

Speaker 9:          01:20:55       There's no guys that ever say that. What you're thinking about gay sex? I'm pretty easy going. My family, my family thinks I'm a lesbian. Really? Yeah. Why is that? Because you're not married with a child already that well, no. I think just my mom is when I went through college and not, didn't date, my mom's like, oh yeah, maybe you're a lesbian. I have a neighbor who has a gay son for sure. Really? Yeah. The kids like 10 now. Oh, and I've been saying the kids gay forever. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I mean I've been saying like, look, there's this kid is gay and everyone's like, you can't say that. You know, he's around his mom all the time. His Dad's always working. I'm on stop it. Stop it. The kid's gay

Speaker 3:          01:21:35       sometimes, you know? I mean in my opinion, I think you're born gay and it's like being a comedian. This is actually important to me. Like you're born a comedian and you just figure it out as you go along.

Speaker 9:          01:21:46       Yeah. I don't think you're born a comedian. I think you're raised in a fucked up way that makes you want a lot more attention than a normal person gets and a, it's to compensate from the lack of attention that you got when you were younger and that's why I become a performer. That's why everyone becomes a performer. I think that's probably a more intelligent way of looking at it. Maybe not everyone, I shouldn't say everyone cause some, I've met some people that just got into it and they had great childhoods.

Speaker 3:          01:22:09       I did. I had a great childhood I think, and no one believes me. I did.

Speaker 9:          01:22:13       Doesn't sound like it from all the shit you're saying. You were tortured. I mean, I was tortured by everyone else, but I'm really close with my mom and dad. It doesn't have to be a mom and dad, you know? It could be just all the feelings of alienation that you felt when you were younger. Yeah, I think that's a good, I always wonder like I have this crazy theory that gets over talked about on this show that the entire world, that everything, all the events, car accidents, you dropped the book, you know, you move into the, the, this lane in the parking lot. Like all these things are all somehow or another connected like some giant fucking mathematical program and that really shitty parents and shitty situations growing up that like coming out of those things, it's like the force, the negative force of those things makes the rebound like so much greater and it makes the, the, the creativity so much greater with a person that makes you know, makes the to perform,

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       you know, and the crazy ability to create something special because the fact that you desperately want this attention and then all these people benefit from that and like, you know, like people that go to see it like wow, they had this great time. Why they have a great time? Well they had a great time because somewhere along the line this kid got fucked with, you know, so that negative of that blossoms out and becomes this performance and then it's all somehow another balanced out. That's pretty intense. I mean it is. I mean look, that's where sluts come from, right? Sluts come from, they don't, they didn't get enough attention. It's always the same story, but guys, look, men, it's very convenient that slots exist because if every time you had sex you have to be in some like fucking serious relationship and God, that's a lot of work.

Speaker 1:          01:23:49       You know like maybe sometimes I'm confused. I don't know where I'm at. And you just want to go around and fuck around. Well you need slots man, or a flashlight or a flashlights. I liked the way you segway young lady. You really know how to work this. I see big things. When are we expecting the literal Esther podcasts? You can start your own podcast in the works. It's in the works. Is it really? Yes, it would be good. I think you'd be good at that shit. Yeah. And you could, I can, you can interview Unicorns and stuff. Yeah, it's a good way to develop material too. So you're doing like three minutes sets for the most part, like five minutes on Sundays and Mondays. And then like whenever I just searched for bar shows and spots at the comedy clubs. And so yeah, like I'd say eight minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:24:32       It's like a good, what's the most time we've ever done on stage? Um, like 20, 20. That's like the weird, that's like when it begins to get strange. Yes. Right. Like you'll like God, am I still up here? I'm still talking like the transition between like those little short sets and like doing a real set, you know it's definitely different and especially too like I've gotten so used to just having to prepare three or five minutes. So now it's like harder to be like oh I have to keep going. Yeah it's definitely how you use Twitter, Twitter, a lot to write, don't you? Cause I ever since I was like, I guess in high school I used to carry a notebook around with me and just anything that like struck me as weird, I would write it down. And that's sort of like how I've transitioned.

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       Like that's my Twitter page now and it just so I can remember it because I want to make it something later. Twitter is great because it gives you only 140 characters, which makes it kind of an art form. Like you have to edit. And funny and usually that's good though. I always find that I get too verbose. There's too many words. If I just, you just leave me alone with everything already got done. Blog. And so 160,000 characters long. I'll just keep going. But really it should be a couple sentences. You don't use extra words. It helps comedy. That's like a good comedy tool. Yes. Yeah. 140 characters is perfect. It's not even a text message. You know? You just gotta be safe. Be able to say something funny, really quick. It's just a, it's a strange thing that we can connect to each other like this. You know, there's never been a time in human history where it's so easy to get in touch with human beings. You don't need a magazine, you don't need a

Speaker 9:          01:26:04       new station. I mean, look at this. We're just talking right now. We're, we're, you know, my fucking office and we're connected and hundreds of thousands of people download this. It's, it's very strange. You're going to have a lot of new people masturbating to you. Oh

Speaker 6:          01:26:16       yeah. No. Thousands right now. There's guys with dig out right now. You're so wrong. Zero. Elster you're so exciting. Oh No. You just became a hundred times more exciting. Why all the stories you've told God damn girl. Uh, does that freak you out? No. Do you think you've ever posed for playboy? Um, I actually interned for playboy in college and that's not the same thing. Um, I don't know where ever were you ever thrown into the humanics? The Hefner mixed? No. No. I was not. I was not on that pretty side of things. If you got famous, you know, and you got an offer, do you think you pose for playboy? Probably. I mean, what? Hustler? No. No, not too much in penthouse. I don't know the difference between all of them, but I was a nude model and different sheet. All of them.

Speaker 9:          01:27:02       Playboy playboys, impossible to jerk off to. Right. Unless you're desperate. If you're jerking off to play ball, you might as well be jerking off the JC Penney's catalog. Who are we kidding? They're all impossible to jerk off to. Now our brains, I've gone past photos. Uh, you know, not necessarily if you gotta do what you gotta do really trapped in Alabama in a hotel room, there's no internet connection. Now there's a seven, 11, and you just close your eyes. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:27:24       Thinking about like my cousin or something cause was kidding. I said her dream weaver. We'll have to end with that song. Can you continue to download that song? That's how we're going to end the podcast back. Yeah, but I like playing a song from the 70s yeah, I think it's cool. Yeah, it's cool. I like I said earlier, like I have a thing for very pretty put together ladies being

Speaker 9:          01:27:49       Mrs. Reagan had a really interesting point. She said that she thought it was funny that playboy used to be like the girl next door and penthouse was like these really skanky whores. She goes, but now it seems like Penn houses like regular girls, they look like more like real girls and playboy. It's like all these bleach blondes. It's like the same look over and over again. The Holly Madison type look, it's like, it's a, an an manufactured look. It's like that's become the look of playboy. And I think it happened when somebody around, when Hugh Hefner stop fucking, he just like, just like fucking, you know what I mean? It wasn't like what he was attracted to. Yeah. There's like all of a sudden, you know, we used to be like the girl next door man. But somehow on another girl next door is not as attractive as it used to be to a lot of people. A lot of people would just rather have the whores, you know, it's just like lit. I want big stupid looking fake tits and dirty. I want to know that you're going to definitely take it in the mouth right away.

Speaker 6:          01:28:42       You know? I don't want to have to talk you into anything. You're a freak here. Dirty Bitch. Professionally. They do like that. Why? Because we're sad. Sad little monkeys. Well, it's exciting. It's exciting. It's exciting wars. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you don't get that. I don't know. It seems because it's rare. Yeah. Yeah. It is exciting.

Speaker 9:          01:29:03       And why are they doing it? They're doing it because they've got a deficit, right? Something. Yeah. The same thing that the reason why people become comedians, except usually there's abuse involved in porn. Yeah. Almost always. Every single one that I've ever really sat down and talked to after a while, you get to the heart of the matter. There's something, something happened that shouldn't have happened.

Speaker 3:          01:29:19       Also, to be a comedian, I think you have to have a very strong brain and be really, I think you have to be really smart.

Speaker 9:          01:29:25       Yeah. Yeah. You can't, it's hard to, you can't just be molested. No, no. That would be nice. What have you got? A good body. You can have like a chimp brain still do porn. There's, there's a lot of open miker is that when you watch them, you can totally go. I don't think even if this guy did it for 20 years, he will ever get it. You'll ever be funny. Yeah, so I think that that there's, there's something to that. You have to be definitely smarter or at least at some level with something. Yeah. There's a lot of people that they don't understand what it really is. You know? They don't know what the fuck they're really doing. I've had friends that do it that they tried to do it and I've thought they'd be able to do it and then they could never figure out how to talk to an audience like, like a, just like a bunch of people, you know, they could, they never figured out how to and be themselves. They never figured out how to tap into it and they just were terrible where I thought they were like Eddie Bravo was, he bombed. Like he did it like nine times. He bombed horribly, like six of those nine times. He could never get it together. But if you talked to him in person, he was always funny. He would say funny shit. Like, why? Why can't you go up there and do that? Like what is it?

Speaker 3:          01:30:28       We will have an idea of like being a standup comedian and they don't realize you just be yourself.

Speaker 9:          01:30:33       There's that. And there's also some people when they're forced to be on stage with that spotlight on them and there's a bunch of strangers who don't know them and you know, you're demanding the strangers attention and then you, you really start to make, uh, like an audit of your own thoughts. Like, are these words, these shots, do these, do I really need to be the guy in front of the microphone or am I an idiot? And you know, those all, any weird fucking insecurities you have about who you are, just come spilling out when you're trying to get people to laugh and you have a microphone and you're the one that gets the mic and the light is on you and

Speaker 3:          01:31:03       shit. It's scary. I think if you can accept that, you're going to say things that people won't laugh at and it's going to be a year, it'll be okay. I think

Speaker 9:          01:31:12       a little more comfortable. Yeah. But that's sucks. Decks sucks hard to be up there. And you be the one who's commanding the attention and said, look at me, look at me, look at me. And they're like, okay, I'm looking what? Um, okay, what else? Um, yeah, there's something crazy that happened, you know, hey, they can't think about it. Oh, I know, right? Does that feel in a tailspin feeling when you're bombing? Oh, Ooh. And then you're driving home and you're like, fuck, fuck. Oh my God, I forgot about it for a second, then. Fuck you remember it again? Shit. Fuck. Oh. Have you ever led a heckler get to you? Like having the heckler ever women against one against, you know, all hecklers or retards? There's no genius. There's no genius. Fucking brilliant, awesome dude. I hecklers all cunts. They're all dumb cons. Don't understand what's going on or where they are.

Speaker 9:          01:32:04       Like they're so stupid. Yeah, well, you know, they're just, they really wished they were up on stage. They just don't have the balls or the brains or whatever the fuck it is. It's just our society has gotten used to having its own input constantly. And Youtube videos, let me call my aunt. She's taught, she's fucking talking nigger, nigger cunt. I said that at a certain point in time. I wanted to get to, I want to, um, get to a point where every video that I have that's on Youtube to somebody just writes nigger cunt in the comments just because he can and no one can stop you. You know, it's like, it's because you can and your name is luck shod nine, six, four. You know, you could just, who are you? You're nothing. You're just have voice out there screaming into the abyss. Do you think there's ever going to become a part point that like we are all like having to be like social security numbers on the Internet.

Speaker 9:          01:32:55       Meaning you cannot no longer Joe Rogan for you are going to be your social security number and like they're going to take it that way. Cause I think that's social security Gump number. No, because if that's the case, then people will be able to get your information. I mean, not, not, not, not actually. Just having a number like this. So she took your fucking name, you cowards, you know what's your name? Is Your name? Bob Smith will peep. Fucking Bob Smith. You Pussy. I'm Joe Rogan. Why do you gotta hide? Well, I love, you know, I don't want the people at work to know what I'm doing. Well then you know what this, that's a legitimate point actually not making fun of a legitimate point for a lot of people. You know, you know we were reading about this the other day that the um, the number of people that get drug tested on the job, random drug tests.

Speaker 9:          01:33:34       It's like 40%. You walking tests and set. Yeah, I'd make sure you smoke pot if you know it's still testing on smoking weed. I don't why you editing those videos from them. Trust me, I don't, I don't really test Ya. What I do is just, I'll just collect your urine. So like a hobby of mine. I showed her that Megan icicles out of it. Tell me about drinking your own. Well, you could just drink it. You can drink your own. Does it really do anything? I don't know. I mean you take vitamins once. Do you know if it's good for you? I mean you got to read a lot of peer reviewed papers on the effects of vitamins. Then you have two objectives. We analyze your own performance and you have to think, okay, was I working extra hard during that time? Does that maybe why I feel better?

Speaker 9:          01:34:11       I was like, was I watching what I eat? You know, to really be sure that a vitamin is benefiting you, you've got to have a lot of thinking about it and you have taken over a long time and then not take it. So I dunno, I only drank my piss a few times. Doesn't taste that bad. Would you ever drinks really in the back of your head was like super healthy? Yeah. What'd you drink? So you, which maybe tasted if we get some PR, you know Google searches, well there's a lot in, you can't Google search because there's a lot of nutty websites. They want you wearing crystals white. You took your fucking recycling, your, your, your sperm as well. I noticed every time I type in symptoms and to Google, I always like, oh, you have aids, you have Crohn's disease. Oh, when you tap into your own stuff, like if it's just like runny nose, back pain, you have aids, you know, you end up at some message board. It's like you should

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       just throw this symptoms into iTunes and download Elton John Songs instead. There's a recent study that suggests that all cancer is man created, that cancer did not exist until human beings started fucking around with chemicals and polluting the environment and eating things. They're not supposed to be eating and eating processed foods and an unnatural diet and that in the natural form, if people just ate plants and animals and you know, and hunted and fished and there was no pollution in the water and we lived like a nomadic hunter gatherer existence. No cancer.

Speaker 3:          01:35:27       Yes, I, that's a spirit man. I agree with. I've always thought that that's,

Speaker 4:          01:35:32       so what does a history of breast cancer then? Is that just a history of being susceptible to pollution? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:35:36       I mean radiation, all who know? I don't know the twist and sucked. I don't think that's, how do you know? As I said, I don't think that breaks down DNA. You know, like you're doing this constantly and breaks down the DNA

Speaker 4:          01:35:49       bay. It's like the Lance Armstrong analogy. The reason why I want to use the last one of those balls because it's always rubbing up against that seat. The ball just get tired of it. It makes sense. That ball just tap the fuck out.

Speaker 3:          01:35:59       You never know. I mean, but some of it they say is genetic too. I thought

Speaker 4:          01:36:02       I'm going to get Tonkin. Yeah, well that's what I don't understand. Is it genetic? If is cancer people, it's genetic that people get cancer. Is it a in if they haven't proven which they have not proven. This is a theory that all cancer is manmade. I'm sure there has to be a bunch of people that don't believe in it that also feel just as strongly. But if, if it is all man made, then all that a genetic predisposition is you're more susceptible to whatever these toxins are that's creating this ailment in your body.

Speaker 3:          01:36:30       Um, right. Yeah. I, I don't know. It's, it's hard because yeah. What can you have a genetic predisposition to have cancer?

Speaker 4:          01:36:39       Yeah. I mean, if, well not if what these people are saying is that all cancer is because of pollution and chemicals and shit. You're not supposed to have in your body in the first place. Stuff that didn't exist in nature until man started tampering with nature. If they're right, then no, you're just more susceptible to all this bullshit.

Speaker 3:          01:36:54       Right. I mean, what's, what actually kind of boggles my mind is that I can eat peanuts and someone else will eat a peanut and die. Yeah. Cause it's so weird. Yeah. And we have the same body. We all have long. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:37:07       And whatever. Right. Well that's when the autism argument gets really trippy when you start talking about vaccinations, you know, and people go, well, vaccinations can't cause autism. They don't cause problems with kids. They don't do anything. You can't even get a kid peanut butter. You're not supposed to give a kid peanut butter, but it's okay to shoot all these chemicals and these live viruses in the child. You're sure every child is going to be cool with mint, not necessarily. Right. You know, and then of course they're going to have every scientific study possible. They will highlight the fact that, you know, there is no connection between this and that and that and this. But when you research it, you find out that they're the, uh, um, um, uh, vaccine. Courts in this country have given out thousands of different awards to families because of brain damage caused by vaccines. Oh my God. Thousands of different kids. I mean, it's not just one, and this is what they've awarded money too. So it's not a great, it's on a black and white

Speaker 9:          01:37:56       area. It's fucking, it's tricky. Different people's bodies respond differently to all sorts of things. That's why I never tell people smoke pot, drink beer, do this because some people can't. Some people just drink one beer and all of a sudden they, the switch goes off in their head and they're fucked and gone. It's not mean. It's probably not you. But for some people they have some weird biochemical setup and you know, it makes them more susceptible to cancer. You know, it makes them more susceptible to this, makes them more susceptible to that. And that's just like a tomato. Like if you don't know you're allergic tomatoes, you eat a tomato, now, Bam, you're dead. But my friend's wife, her whole life has had problems with wheat and she didn't know it. She didn't know she had an allergy to wheat. So she had all these health ailments, didn't know what it was, didn't know what she had fatigue.

Speaker 9:          01:38:36       She'd get headaches, all these different things. Cut Out. Wheat gone. It's nuts, man. I fear I haven't, I feel like I have something like that, you know, like, yeah, totally. Because there's some times where it just seems like I'm allergic to something. I should really get it tested out. But then it goes away. You know, like guessing checking. It's really annoying to deal with your problem, Brian, is you're still smoking cigarettes. I mean beef, you know, when I wasn't smoking cigarettes, you know, and you weren't smoking, you were only not smoking for like a year. So your body was probably trying to recover from the factory. We're smoking constantly for your whole life. I mean when you say when you, I'm not smoking the majority of your life you've been smoking. So even you saying when I'm not smoking, you're not the in the peak of health going and fucking drinking weaker at shoes or Greg, we've got good weird Greg through thought guy.

Speaker 9:          01:39:23       You know, I mean health is such a tricky thing. As I've gotten older, like I'm sitting here, my back fucked up or hurt my back last night and Jujitsu it's not fuck that was just some sort of a muscle pull. But as you get older, like for sure I recognize the differences in good and bad behavior and the like, you can still have a good body and keep your body healthy and have all this energy, but you have to be way more diligent than when you're younger. You have to really make sure that if I eat like shitty food, if I go out and have a big fat, stupid cheeseburger and ice cream Sundae and I will fucking wall is a good motivator. Like that hurts later sort of. It's not that it hurts, I just feel like a lard ass. I feel like I got hit with a tranquilizer dart.

Speaker 9:          01:40:03       That's why like I'm up fucking bear at the circus that ran a muck and proud fired fucking Darta normally just lay in it. I don't want to hang over. You see people dealing with hangovers. I'm like, what's that? Goddamn cheeseburgers are awesome. You know I went to five guys for the first time the other day. Yeah. Yeah. Not as good as in and out. Not as many choices and no shakes. I haven't been to the counter. The counter is that another one? That's a good one. And so it's still pretty fucking awesome. Don't get me wrong. I mean if I'm looking for something to eat and it's right there, I'm going in, but the lack of shakes, it's really disappointing. It's weird how the hamburger places in La, I don't think it's, it's spread out out of la too much, but like how there's all these now trendy burger places now in La. Have you noticed this? That flood out of nowhere you oh no. The poor thing out

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       your habit is another one. There's the one cup of Colab in there. I've been to those. Those are pretty decent. Yeah, it was a decent, weird how that just came out of burgers or on the burgers are delicious and Americans love murdered meat. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:41:05       we love it. We love getting somebody else to do all the dirty work and packaging it in a nice circle. Nice flat circle. Cook it up, give it to me. I don't want to have to do anything. I don't want to go out and fucking grow grass and then have the cow eat the grass. Then shoot the cow on the head and hanging up by its ankles and gut it and process it and chop it up and grind it down and then press it and then cook it and just give me a burger. Right. Okay. And Burger King and Mcdonald's. Who knows when that fucker was actually cooked. I mean those things are just sitting in a bin and they flip it onto a pad, throw it in the microwave.

Speaker 1:          01:41:40       I had McDonald's the other day and it's weird how you actually don't even think about it when you're eating it that, hey, this is actually really supposed to be like a hamburger. It's not supposed to be like I Mcdonald's. You know? It's like different tastes. Right? It's like I always get the two double cheeseburger meal. Yeah, there's like hamburger cookies. That's hilarious. But yeah, you don't really think of it like, wow, this is like really good cow. You know? This is a good hamburger. No, it's, there's a website online where a dude has a, he's running a running tally. I don't know if it's legit, but I think you said it's like 180 days so far. He kept a happy meal and it hasn't rotted yet. Was dried out sitting there. Yeah. He's got all these photos of it. It was on the board was on the road and boy thing ever seen that and he's got a photo of it at 180 days and it looks like perfect today. Preservatives are really scary. You know, what the fuck is that doing to your body?

Speaker 9:          01:42:32       Ooh. Some stuff that keeps things from growing on it that's not good to have in your body when your body consists of a bunch of different positive organisms that are helping you, you know all these different bacteria that you need like acidophilus and probiotics and what is happening when you're eating. They're going to war or those preservatives going to war with the, the good bacteria in your body.

Speaker 1:          01:42:54       Dead bodies were just decomposing a lot slower than they used to. I don't know really. Yeah. That's interesting. It sounds like some pita talk. This is what I've heard, man. I don't give a fuck how quick I rot the end of all the whole thing. When you die in your hair, still still growth. Is that true though? Oh, I hope not. I heard it was maybe a little bit because it's growing, right? I mean to think like what it was already going to grow kind of pops out like a little

Speaker 9:          01:43:22       cycle to it. Hm. I Dunno. There's a crazy story I watch on HBO once where they had that. Do you remember that guy, Dr Baton? He was a the autopsy guy. I believe. That's his name. Doctor Badden, HBO, real autopsy. I forget what the name of the show. Well, one, one of the most fascinating ones was this one guy. His wife died. Okay. And he kept preserving her and like he was, I dunno if he worked at a home or whatever the fuck

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       he did, but he somehow or another kind of embalmed her body and created like a little fleshlight little plastic teeth. Okay. No, it wasn't his wife. That's why it was so creepy. It was one of his patients and he fell in love with their pa some somehow or another, he got this woman's, I believe it's a patient. I'm fucking this whole story up now, the bottom line is this dude had a corpse in his house that he kept preserved and he would cover it with like gallons and gallons of perfume and he designed like a little plastic vagina. It would fuck this plastic vagina. Yeah. And he stole the body from the grave yard, like you went into the grave, brought it into his house and was like covering it with perfume. I had bought crates of perfume. [inaudible] blotting. Yeah. This rotting fucking hunk of meat that used to be this woman and he's sticking his dick and like this little garden hose that he's created for her vagina. I to try it once. Try once. And people, a lot of Tequila. A lot of people do freaky things to dead Bot. It's just like something to them like desiccating a corpse is like a huge crime. You know, like people that's like, it's offensive to society. It's like for a lot of people it's like the ultimate taboo. Like dig somebody up in their head. Look, look at me. I'm a retard. I got these fake skulls everywhere.

Speaker 6:          01:45:06       All around. Like what is different though? Yeah, but what is this fascination like what is the fascination with skulls and shit? Like this is a real one actually. It's totally real. Oh my God, she's retarded. Additional. It's anything real. It's got tribal over its head. Could. Yes. If you were a Maori living in nosy, are you really? If someone's going to tell me something, why? Why are they lying? I don't know. Right. Cause you wouldn't lie. So it's good for you to be around a bunch of scumbags. It's good. I have to be pretty careful. Yeah. You gotta be careful to carry a knife to the comedy store. How'd you become friends with Brian on his show? He's on my video and thought it was funny. And then what did he do? Did he bust a move? What did he do? You can tell and I can't remember. I came up the year, I was like, I just went to the, no, wait, where did he say, can I be your stalker? Oh God, Brian. No, I said, your video was cool. And then I said I'm going to be stalker. And then every time I walked by it I think I was like, you're so awesome. Or something like that. Don't like that. Wow. Really smooth pickup movies. Pickup. Well, it's worked.

Speaker 6:          01:46:23       We've successfully made a lot of videos. They get pretty awesome. You guys just killed the shit out of this conversation. Fucking faggotry so what is gay?

Speaker 4:          01:46:36       Yeah, you can't say that right? How? How sensitive are you to that? Like the idea that there's certain things that are offensive to talk about and, and, and expressions. Like you can't say gay, like that's gay, like that really bothers a lot of people. Um, it's

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       hard. I mean sometimes I say oh and bumps friends, you'll say that's gay, right? Not really. I've tried to police myself on it a little bit, but it's definitely, I know, I know that it's not rooted in some sort of evil hatred. I love gay people. I, like I said, I probably am gay, so it's hard for me. I don't know. I, but it's tricky, right? Sometimes people say it and they don't mean it. I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:47:13       I say faggot all the time and I do too. Yeah. Sometimes people get mad at me and they'll say like, you know what you're saying is hateful, this done? I'm like, no. So I want to meet are not hateful mean like feelings or hateful. Right. Intent is hateful. Yeah. But if you were thinking about, you know, you are the type of person who is ostracized as a child and all these pretty constantly kept you on the outside. What if that was a word that they use all the time for you? What if you actually were gay and you were gay at a young age and you know, it was like, look at her that fucking gay loser and then you're around people and they're like, that's gay, that's gay. I'm like, Shit, I'm gay. And you're saying this movie is gay? What the fuck, man? Yes sir.

Speaker 3:          01:47:50       Suck. But I think you can't give words that much power. And if you do, it's not, it's not smart. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:47:57       But is that easy to say because you're on the outside of it maybe. Yeah, probably. I think about that sometimes, but other than that, I think stop it. Faggot. Fucking get over it. It's a big deal.

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       Yeah. I mean some, I dunno, I, I really think that if you're not racist really, and if you're not hateful of gay people, really then say what you want.

Speaker 1:          01:48:15       I mean, there's certain things that are fucking gay men blow drying their hair. Always gay. You don't want to dry your hair naturally. Well, you want to accelerate the drying process, right? Fuck. Like who? Your pace mass. Those are gates. So gay, they even call them facials, but yet all it is is like, hey man, you like to open your pores. You don't have your face doesn't break out. You're gay. You know, but it's real though. You're going to be like, that's gay. If you have bad skin, you want to clear your skin up. I think you should get a lot of you came over to my house and had a face mask on with like blue he back. Well we believe that they do face mask, brow face mask. What you were before you go to bed or American psycho. Yes. Do you ever read that book is all about facials and masks and fucking so he wasn't gay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:58       He was crazy scary. It's like a red bull and are not read well cranberry and vodka cranberry and vodka is, you know like the second you throw triple sec into that shit that's caught a cosmo and if you can't drink a cosmo that's fucking gay, but yet it's just a splash of triple sec. I like girly drinks. I try to white Russians. I like white Russians. That's kind of girly. I like 'em Pina coladas and shit stuff with it's, I don't get it. People think that they're so refined that they like these. It's just like you want it to taste like candy sometimes, but sometimes you don't. I like Jack Daniels to sometimes I like a beer, you know, like a Sam Adams in a shot of Jack Daniels that's like, that's to ass tastes, you know? So it's not candy at all, but it's weird. How are you? The older you get you start liking things like, like I never liked blue, but then around 24

Speaker 9:          01:49:48       I'm like, oh, blue cheese is awesome. You know? And like we have these things, you have these things just like that though. Like I never used to like pickles and now I'm fucking addicted to pickles all lives I still don't like yet. Blue Cheese is tricky because it's mold. Yeah, right. You know we, when we were cheeses boulder. Yeah, right. A lot of cheeses. When we were on fear factor, we used a lot of expensive cheese for the stunts because some of them, there was a, there's a cheese shop in Beverly hills that has like really authentic French cheeses and all these different European cheeses that are like really, really strong. Like their smell is horrendous and somehow none of these freaky fucks in Europe. They, they get into this stuff and they would bring it out to the set and that we would open up the tubs and make everybody smell out and they'd be like vomiting, like literally people be dry heaving and this is some shit that was really expensive and now it is just a funky, powerful cheese.

Speaker 9:          01:50:39       And we would throw that, that was like a secret ingredient that we would throw into a lot of the blended shit that people had to eat that smelled horrific. The reason why it smelled Baz worms don't really smell that bad when you grind them up and have to throw that funky fucking shit cheese and that's what made it smell better. Yeah. Worms. The smell like worms, especially because they're fresh worms. Well they're for, it smells like dirt kind of because they're really, that's all they are. They're like tissue and dirt. You're drinking dirt, you know, but the worms that we're, we're getting, we're getting these worms come from dirt farm so they know what the fucking worms are eating. It's all, you get them out of the fish supply shop. So been really eating worms is not, not big a deal. The big deal was this fucking cheat.

Speaker 9:          01:51:18       Then this cheese is expensive and people are like, did you get that from ODG? D is, Oh this is Smith is one to buy his bid to flow for whatever reason, people just got into those fucking creepy smells. I recently found out that I am a video game tran, transsexual, video game, transsexuals. Anytime I, I'd never even thought about that. You play as a girl? Yeah, I always plays a girl at like, I just got this new game called fallout new Vegas where it's like you're, you're, you're looking at an ass the whole time you're running around the whole game and it's going to take you months to beat this game. And I'm thinking, I don't want to look at a man's ass. I'm gonna pick a girl character, you know? So I, I write and I think back, I've always like Tony Hawk, you know, any kind of video on Microsoft, Laura, I'm always playing girl characters.

Speaker 9:          01:52:03       I always pick girl characters. I've been sucks though, is the guys end up hitting on you thinking that you're a girl and so that then it makes you even feel more gay. Well, how often do you hit on them back? Do you walk around and pretend that you're a girl? Yeah. Especially if I don't have a microphone. I'll just like turn around a couple times, you know, shake it a little. Yeah, that's a big thing right now. See, I'm out of the loop video games, but a lot of people are talking and they're online. They're talking on microphones, right? Well nowadays, yeah, usually and shit. That would be annoying, man. I don't want to hear all these little nuggets. It's weird because video games, if you ever thought, you know what, I don't think people are racist against black people and that much anymore. Second, you go online, bullshit. All, all, all the rules are out. It's just nonstop racism. It's just like message boards. It's same thing except they don't have to worry about their account being good for six months a year and keep talking

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       on the message board. Right. You figured this is the one game want to see you, you nigger cunt.

Speaker 8:          01:52:51       It's really weird though when you're playing a video game and it's usually like, you know, like one other person and it's just like an 11 year old kid and you're like, so hey, how old are you? And you're like, you're like, oh hey. That's great. Uh, so, uh, we should go over here and get the sword. Oh, okay. I feel like you seem very strong. Video Games are like 11 year olds and like 37 year old. No, no, no. There's

Speaker 4:          01:53:15       people that are playing video games all day. Video Games are addictive as fuck. They're awesome. That's the problem. There's so much fun to play there. So God damn addicted. I need to find one though. I would like, it's a weird thing to me. It's a weird thing to me that we have like this level of connectivity with like Twitter and Facebook and and and you know, message boards and stuff like that. We have this crazy level of connectivity where we're way more immersed in each other's lives than we've ever been before. But yet it's easier to be anonymous and to be country with people. It's easier to like say shitty things cause you're not saying it in front of him. You don't have to deal with the social consequences of looking him in the eye and insulting them. You just, you fucking shit and they can just do it.

Speaker 4:          01:53:56       It's, that's a weird thing. It's like we're more immersed but we're more disconnected. It's like, and we're slowly becoming more and more used to, you know, being able to be shitty to people with no repercussions and not worried about it. And being able to take out all your own personal bullshit on some just random stranger online and attack them and try to break them down. And you really, like, you're going about your day and total silence, like you're sitting in front of Kiva, click, click, click, click, click saying the meanest, nastiest, most harsh shit than me. While there's no sound coming out and you're walking around your house, you're pouring yourself coffee and you going back to the message board and typing some more horrible evil shit. And you know, it's, it's a very strange thing that, you know, it used to be all our interactions that we had, the ones that were designed for, or we look at each other and then all of a sudden someone invented a phone as well, now you're interacting with somebody who can't see anymore, and then all of a sudden the person becomes faceless and now they're on a message board and now you're just a name and like, whoa.

Speaker 4:          01:54:50       Yeah. And your Avatar is buckwheat, you know, it's like, okay, who is this guy's got buckwheat from for the rascals as this photo. I don't even know who the fuck he is. They tell me that I'm ugly and yes, exactly. Dude. So many people have been exposed from my message board, like so many people that were like really super conti, but they fucked up and somewhere along the line, one of the Internet sleuths figured out who they were and then through their photos up and all their Facebook photos and then you get to see, oh, you're a douchebag, right? Oh, here you are. I mean, how many times that happened on the Rogan board? Oh, totally. All the time. Oh my God. We had this one guy who was an asshole. He was so mean to everybody like on, and he couldn't tell him to stop doing it. Like at a certain point in time it was like, fuck dude, you know, stop being a Douche bag and a contrarian. Every time I fucking argument comes up, you're insulting people and saying, we found out he was like 700 pounds. Okay. And he had would post on this weight loss forum and he got his stomach fixed. He was a staple

Speaker 9:          01:55:44       or, yeah, it was always like super critical of anybody who did anything to their boat. You, you don't have the heart and the willpower to do it on your own. You've all, he says, fat fuck living in his own shit is on apartments. Where is why he's such an asshole because his life sucked and then it was exposed and flop. Oh, found that guy and just posted all of his photos and all of his testimonials about it. It was a totally different person on this site, on our side, which is a mean nasty asshole on that website. He was all about like, it was like, you know, positive like Oprah stuff. Yeah. Like he was on Oprah. He was like, well, just trying to get used to the Diet. Lol.

Speaker 9:          01:56:21       Yeah. I mean you, you learn a lot about a person's character when they're anonymous. Totally. You know, you get to know, I mean, one of the things I found about my message board is there's like three plus million posts on it now. I mean, it's been around since like 1998 there's thousands and thousands of members and every day there's thousands of posts and you, you really can get to know someone just by reading their words. You know, you really can, because weird situations will come up. We'll someone will say something, you can take it one way, you can take it another way. You can be upset, you could be insulting. You could be, you know, you could listen to their criticism and agree with it and you know, have an own your own introspective and objective viewpoint. But people are so attached even to these little anonymous fake names that you know, you criticize their anonymous fake screen name in, that shit hits personal and then they go after you and then they go after each other.

Speaker 9:          01:57:10       And I see these flame wars like back and forth. I'm like, how much of this would really happen if you guys were standing in front of each other? None of it, right? I think they have those awkward meetings of like the people from the Internet and then no one says anything. We've done that a bunch, which we were doing that in the 90s on my message board. The first one was like evil and circle jerk or the Houston circle jerk, I think it was nine, nine, nine, nine or 2000. We were doing it like before I was on fear factor. We would have these, these message board meetings where people would, you know, come from the message board and we would, we'd all be in Houston or whatever and we'd all go out to dinner together and you got to meet the creeps too. There was like a few guys that we were hanging out with.

Speaker 9:          01:57:48       Like, now I know why he's such a shit head. Like you meet the guy in real life, it's like fucking shifty and weird and looks like you'd Roofie your drinks and you know, there's, there's always a guy that you meet. Like we went to a strip club with one guy from the message board and uh, uh, one of the strippers came over and put her hands on them, just like, would you like to dance? Don't touch me whore. And we're like, Whoa, don't touch me whore. And she went over and told the bouncer and the bouncer came over to him and he looked at me like I was going to say, I'm like, dude, go get away. You're done. You're done son. You're a fucking creep will touch me. Whore people are really hurt. And uh, but you know, it's on all of them. I mean it's like he didn't come off that way online, which is strange.

Speaker 9:          01:58:28       He would say mean nasty shit. But like normal, like everybody else would say mean nasty shit. It's like kind of commonplace. He never like saw that, um, you know that in his online thing, he just seemed kind of annoying. And then, you know, you see him in La in real life, you're like, oh, you're a fuck you're a mess. You know, you never know. And then there's people that won't even meet us, which is like a whole new thing, you know. Flaco he is this guy named Flaco and he, I won't even come meet us. I don't know why. Well cause he doesn't cause he attacks everybody. He doesn't want you finding out what's, what's really wrong. He knows we love him. Yeah. Well not call, I had mad balls. We got this guy named [inaudible] who is a on our website. He's been on my websites.

Speaker 9:          01:59:10       It's like the, I like 2000 or something. Maybe not for that. Maybe even before that. Yeah. And uh, we were doing a show in San Francisco and somehow or another came up, we were talking to him, it was like five years ago. More, more than five years ago. So I said, you want to come out to San Francisco, man, I'll fly out. So he's like, okay. Like he went with it and he goes like this troll online. Yeah. Likely fucking with people. And like nine 11 happened and he was like, two hours later, he's already, you know, too early, too soon. He's ruthless. Like fucking with people and stuff. But we hung out with them and he was a nice guy. He was nice when we hung out. We, I gave him a pot lollipop. He could handle it. He threw it up, threw up in the street.

Speaker 9:          01:59:48       God, I forgot about that. Pot lollipops are very powerful. If someone tries to give you pot like edible pot, don't do it. Don't do it. Runaway, do not do it well. They'll say like, oh, it's just a little bit, you need to be an experienced pot smoker before you start fucking around with edibles and last, you know that like this is your very best friend and your friend made these brownies and she told you, listen, there's you just, if you take a quarter of this, you're going to be fine, but that's it. Just a quarter and we're not going anywhere anyway. We're just going to sit on the couch and watch TV and it'll be weird, but you're going to be okay. And you go, okay, I trust you, let's do this. But if you're just like hanging out at a party or something and someone says, Hey, you want to pop cookie?

Speaker 9:          02:00:28       No, you did not want a pug times. People at the comedy store, I've been like, eat this pot Brownie. You've never tried. So irresponsible. God, thank God I'm, those are fucking freaky. The fuck out. We were talking on the last podcast about I got to high on a flight and I hit a pot cookie and um, some dude fart on Melanie Griffiths head long story, but I got so high, get so high that I almost peed myself. I literally thought about doing it. Eating pot is way more strong than smoking it a hundred times. Not really like five times more powerful. It's like you, you get way too high. Way Too quick visual on top of it. Yeah. We did some more happy and mellow like you know, muscle relaxer type kind of body buzz that's more visual. It's going to fuck with your visuals and everything.

Speaker 9:          02:01:16       Can you close your eyes? You see cartoons fucking see like cartoons moving around and changing shape. Like I saw all these looked like they looked like 1960 Spiderman comic books, like that style of drawing. But it was all like animals that didn't exist. It was all like an, and they were constantly changing like every, every second, every half a second. It was a new animal and they were animals that didn't exist. All drawn like Jack Kirby style. You know, like early marvel comics and they were just moving and they were like all two inches long and the entire sky was filled with them. Wow. That's on us. I just close my eyes and watch that for like an hour lucky. So we, I can't even freaking out though. Couldn't, it was too high to enjoy it. I can't even imagine. It's kind of like dreams. You know how dreams, yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:02:05       It's like, it's like that, but you're in railroad eating pause is really too introspective too. It makes you like really start thinking about your life. Like I broke down my whole childhood. I'd, I started thinking about my eating. You start really like considering all of your behavior and the way you interact with people and all the things you've done wrong and all the things you would love to take back. And you know, it's just, it's really just fucking, it's a mind fuck because it's another, it's another chemical. It's another chemical. When you eat it, you should know that this is your, your liver produces a chemical called, uh, 11 hydroxy metabolite. That's what it is. And it's only when you eat pot, you don't, it's not active in psychoactive doses when you smoke it. So it's literally different than being stoned when you're smoking it.

Speaker 9:          02:02:48       Very dangerous. So don't let those assholes just give you a pot Brownie. That's Douchey, Douchey, a little girl, he just popped Brownie. You're the quarter curled up in the fetal position in the puddle of pis cause there's no way to make it stop. No, there's no way. No way you can try coffee, but that doesn't work. You just get like hyper and high at the same time. You know, you're still nervous and freaked out and they're still be paranoid. I remember once I was a bad acid trip and for some reason I always thought that drinking a bunch of milk was supposed to do something. So I remember sitting there fucking sweating my ass off. Panicking, just chugging milk. I remember I might've done a whole thing of milk, but then there's something where your body just starts rejecting milk. I just start puking milk everywhere a chirping and I just remember the next day I forgot I had done it and I just went into the kitchen and it's just milk all over the floor.

Speaker 9:          02:03:44       Were you living at home where you live? It alone. I was living alone and a little one bedroom would suck. If you had explain this shit to your mom, why is there milking cheerios all over the floor? Uh, I didn't realize that um, like lactose had a real effect on you. I never really paid attention to it until I started drinking raw milk. Raw Milk is just milk that hasn't been homogenized or pasteurized and you can get it at like whole food stores. I don't know if they have it anymore. They might again stop kicking against milk completely though. Right? Why? Because it probably what you're about to say. Well the raw with raw milk, it's, it's dangerous where you don't want to let it go too long. You don't want to like keep it around like you can't, like you get a court and a milk, you like, you get a carton of milk and you look at the expired expiration date.

Speaker 9:          02:04:35       It's like a month. How the fuck is this gonna stay good for a month? It's because everything worthwhile has been barbecued out of it. I mean there's still protein in it and sort of still calcium in it, but for the most part, all the enzymes, all the things that allow you to digest it correctly, they're all gone. But when you get raw milk, you get everything in it and it's really easy to adjust. It's like, it feels totally different. Like it feels different in your body. Gross though. No, it tastes good, man. I was drinking raw chocolate milk, but I think they stopped carrying it because I think it's dangerous. Wholefoods used to be like, these take chances, but then they found out that Kombucha, like this stuff that, I love this stuff. I'm a big fan of probiotics is very important. Like probiotics are fucking huge for your health.

Speaker 9:          02:05:15       So I take acidophilus and I, I drank probiotic drinks like this Kombucha Shit, but apparently it's, and some of them, if it sits too long, it ferments too long. Then it becomes more than one half of 1% alcohol. So then whole foods like pulled them out. All of their stores. Are they back? I will. They have some Kombucha, but do they have the GTS Kombucha? That's like the real shit. That's the real shit. Like you get chunks of the mushroom in it or the fungus, like someone shot loads in your drink. You don't get that out of the week. Kombucha, the wheat Kombucha is just have it out of the tap now in whole foods. Yeah, that's stuff that they're growing. They're making it. That's weak. You know this company Gts, that was may. Again, that's, that shit is powerful. That's the kids. I haven't gotten sick in over a year.

Speaker 9:          02:06:00       I would get sick constantly because I'm always traveling, traveling and shaking people's hands and you're going on the road and you're in planes and you're, you know, all that common in contact with all these different germs and bugs. Like for a long time, like every couple months I'd get a cold for the longest time because all the traveling with this stuff, never, I don't get sick, I don't, I don't get sick and I'm always getting like four hours sleep. Then I take a flight, I get tired like normal and everything, but I'm not getting sick anymore. And Ajay huge chunk of that is this stuff. And acidophilus acidophilus milk culture. So it's a bacteria that originates from, yeah, you keep it in the refrigerator and uh, it's a live bacteria to healthy bacteria, but it's a very aggressive, healthy bacteria. When you eat acidophilus, all this negative stuff that you come in contact with when you're like, you, you touched someone's hands and they'll get like a cold or a sickness.

Speaker 9:          02:06:50       You're acidophilus attacks, all that shit. It's like having warriors in your body to fight off bad germs. And since you don't usually eat yogurt because you don't like milks, uh, you should really look into it. Probiotic supplement. Yeah, the Kombucha is a great one. It's a great, I'll see them supplement though, because I noticed your nails always have like the, the calcium lack. Zinc. What's wrong with your nails? What do you fucking Weirdo. You know what's wrong with her neck? Cause I take a lot of pictures of her hands. The hand model? Yeah. You're a hand model. Yeah. I was an American girl magazine catalog. Your hands are tiny. They're so small. It's like where's the rest of the, her feet? Her feet are smarter than wow. Those are those. My daughter Lola is feet might be a little bigger than yours. She's too.

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       Let me take my shoes off. She did go on the playground. That's hilarious. Yeah. I didn't see you guys look like you're in the same grade. We have the same Halloween. How did we get on this hands and feet thing? Uh, because it's Kirk calendar. What point? Yeah. How the hell do you know? Because I thought that was cows. When you have the white lines on your nails, that's kind of a lack of calcium. Has that started when I went vegan. So there is downs. Whoa. Really? Yeah. There's also, yeah, you should totally take a some kind of calcium via, you know, I don't supplement calcium. I think it's, yeah, but you're supposed to have a certain amount of calcium. Oh, I get calcium. Broccoli as marketers. The lines. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. You don't eat broccoli. Yes, I do. To you like crazy Broccoli as how much house you and then what then I think it had, I don't, I'm not going to say, but I think it does. It has a lot of calcium, so a lot of protein to broccoli as protein. That's why gorillas love Broccoli.

Speaker 9:          02:08:30       If you go to the zoo, they throw gorillas and chimps always turned on Broccoli. They're really want to eat monkeys, but they don't let them. Yeah, I think that's so fucked up. They don't let animals in the zoo kill things. At the very least, they should be allowing them to do what they're naturally put on this planet to do. You know when you're sliding a cold tray of meat into a cage and a lion looks at that meeting, he was like, what the fuck, man? Let me tell you some shit. Can Be killed. Some shits on it. Get some of that. Is it sad?

Speaker 6:          02:08:58       Yeah. Do you, are you an animal rights person? Um, I'm not out there doing anything for it, but I believe in it and I, I like the people that are, I appreciate them.

Speaker 9:          02:09:09       The only problem with that is if you don't kill some of them, then they will overpopulate. Let's say if we stopped killing cows and stop killing chickens and stop killing deer. If we were really did that, we have a real issue. Is that really true? I'm sure. Of course. Well, it's definitely true with dear. One of the most important thing about controlling deer populations is make sure in the population doesn't get too big for the resources that they have available to them. You can't have a bunch of deer starving to death and getting sick and diseases because there's no food, you know, and deer, we'll just like rabbits, just like rats, just like any other animal. That's wild. And especially in a competitive environment like that, they breed as much as they can. I mean the, the, the pump out as many little baby deer as possible.

Speaker 9:          02:09:47       And I want, if you, if you go to a place like where I lived in Boulder, I lived in Colorado, they don't, nobody in Boulder's all nutty, crunchy and no one's shooting deer. So the deer like fearless, so they're everywhere. So you have to be very careful when you drive it around. Could you get slammed into him at night? They'll just jump in front of the road and all of a sudden, you know, there's, there's a fucking deer with his antlers through your windshield, goring you to death, you know? But that happens to be Paul. It's tricky. So if you're not eating cows and you're nodding and Glam and you're nodding what you're going to have to do something, you have to separate them, keep them from breeding. You ever to do something to control the population, you're going to have to be proactive about it.

Speaker 6:          02:10:21       I mean that, I'm not against eating meat. I think it's, I would, I don't like, and what makes me cry is when, yeah, exactly. I watched a documentary called Food Inc, which I literally have never so hard.

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Yeah. You don't, you ever watch Anthony Bourdain's show? No, I, no, I haven't seen that actually. Good show. It's called no reservations. It's on the travel channel. He's a chef and it was really interesting guys, one of my favorite shows and he goes all over the country and all over the world even and uh, goes to all these different cultures and sees like what they eat and talk to the people there and tries to find out their traditions about their food. Kind of really fascinating. Well one of the things he did, he went to this place in Maine and this, this uh, it's a restaurant in Maine that does everything. They have their own farm, they grow all their own produce, they grow all their own animals. They slaughter their own animals, butcher their own animals and then serve them and cook them. And it was really interesting.

Speaker 4:          02:11:10       Yeah. Because here's these, these guys, I mean this guy was petting this peg and he's like, you know, it's kind of weird cause you know your pet net but then you're also like looking at it like, wow, this is going to make some Nice Bacon and there's some ham right here. And like it's a real, it's the reality of it and you know, that's what they're there for. They're not going to live forever if you don't eat them. Okay. They're eventually going to die. These are temporary creatures and it's like to give them as much freedom and dignity and you know, and to treat them as humanely as possible before you kill him, you're still killing them. The real problem is that right? The real problem is not the killing them. The real problem is the suffered suffering before he killed. Horrible because this didn't seem offensive.

Speaker 4:          02:11:45       It seems shocking to me. Like does this guy was petting this pig talking about it being bacon and ham, but you still petting the pig and the pig like wasn't freaked out at all and the pig was eating well. And it's like, okay, well I mean that's the food chain. Yeah, I guess. But that's the problem with a lot of the animal rights people and the animal rights movement. It's like they don't believe in the food chain. They believe we stop killing animals, period. But if we do that, like you have to take into consideration that a lot of animals are here and they're here as prey animals. Like in the natural cycle of things. If you have deer, well you have to have mountain lions. If you don't have mountain lions take out these deer or coyotes to take out these deer, well we'll, who fucks gonna eat all the deer w what are you going to, you're going to have a just gigantic overpopulation of them.

Speaker 4:          02:12:26       What are you gonna do? You're going to start breeding mountain lions and now you have mountain lions everywhere. You have millions of outlines and millions of deer. Like really? Is that the solution? Well, something's going to happen, right? I mean, we look at this Utopian Granola fucking Unicorn way of life that you know, hey man, we should just leave the animals alone. We're kind of past that. We can't really do that. There's, there has to be some sort of a, if you were going to stop eating animals through, who would have to be some sort of strategy for dealing with overpopulation and right now we can't even control that with animals like cats and dogs. We have a hard time. We're killing them and fucking, you know, the rescue places are killing them left, right Pete? It kills them. Peta kills animals left at rice,

Speaker 8:          02:13:02       all the animals on boats, so they stroke, they're still alive. There's so much extra water out there and you just let them float for the rest of their life. Holocaust of animals, we keep killing animals and keeping them in cells as sad. So many chihuahuas that are fucking murdered or put to sleep every year, especially in California because people just by Chihuahuas and then send them back to the, like if you go to the pounds, they're shipping chihuahuas out of California to other states to try to get rid of them because there's so much to over Chihuahua population. You know, it's, it's like instead of killing

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       all these swabs in Paris with, I'm on a boat to go in Paris Hilton. Totally. Yeah. I loved her in high school though. I bought her, I bought her book, her book between her and Judge Anderson, who's been the bigger influence on your life? Um, I wouldn't call them influences. I would just call those pretty girls that I'm interested in. People that you're interested in. Yeah. Oh my God. I loved when their true Hollywood stories, when we're on the Hilton sisters and then, um, Jenna Jamison. Yeah. There was another Hilton. Whatever happened. That one, she kind of faded out. Hilton, she's still around and, but she puts up, I used to follow her on Twitter and they were so dumb that really disappointed cat stacks. There's, I hate cats stacks. That's her Twitter name and it's all about her fucking all these rappers. She fucks all these rappers and she gets videos of her with these rappers and then she's like, he'd be all doing cocaine.

Speaker 1:          02:14:21       Dick Holly get logged this. They get Bailey, fuck me and, but she's got like a hundred thousand fucking more than that. Almost 200,000 Twitter followers on Twitter. I have a, I used to want to follow up points or center where they do not stop tweeting. They tweet, go on and get my workout on every all day, every day. Children looking to connect with someone that loves them. I like to follow, not the porn stars. I like to follow them, but then when I look at them replying to a guy, then I like to go to his website and see what does that guy have to say? These guys that are tweeting the porn stars car. That's where the fucking real interesting shit is. You know I went to this one guy and it was like silence of the lambs. It was like kicking in the door with the flashlight flashlight with the fucking pistol, like going, oh shit.

Speaker 1:          02:15:10       I went to this guy's Twitter page and it was all him interacting with porn stars and a lot of it was like crazy talk. A lot of it was like, you know, you are incredibly inspirational to me. I just think it's amazing how you put yourself out there. My God, I mean, I don't know how you do it, but it moves me and I feel connected to you. And um, since you've contacted me and this guy's going on and on and on like 10 tweets in a row, the same person, you know, when you know you get nutty, it's like, dude, you can't recognize the concept of 140 characters. No, it's 140 and 140 more than 140 more. And like, I just stopped reading your shit. Sorry, I can't read that. This guy had like 10 10 to one porn star. What's really weird is the people that, you know, all the porn starts have like their shopping lists, their Amazon wishlist.

Speaker 1:          02:16:00       I did know about that until like a year ago. How gross is that? Oh, it's totally guys. Instead they just pumped that shit all day. There was somebody that said something the other day, I can't remember who it was and I hopefully I'm not friends with this person, but they said something like, uh, Oh, you guys getting mad at me for pumping my Amazon wishlist. I showed you my boobs yesterday. Come on. Really? I need to be paid for this. Right. I need to be paid for my boobs. Jesus Christ. Just give me the PS three slim. I just want it. How weird is that? The Amazon wishlist? It's like, come on, I know you're a loser by me. Some shit. What's really weird is that I, I uh, is how many people actually buy them stuff? Oh, that guy with the 10 fucking tweets to the porn star. He's definitely butter their underwear stop.

Speaker 1:          02:16:47       Like when I used to know this girl that did it, porn, uh, she, she would get like shoes from the guy and then like outfits and then like a purse and then sunglasses. It was like this guy felt like he was dating her. Oh, you think about it like 10 years ago, there was no way for a creepy guy on the internet to contact a porn star and now he has Twitter and connects. You look at our response letters back and if he, yeah, if he does something cool like buys her a new purse, you know for sure she's going to say, Oh mg, thank you so much. You're so sweet. Yeah. And then maybe she's going to come to Cleveland and fucking show her pussy at some club. You know, they do that. They go on the road. All these things. While a lot of these girls, she's poor girls that you know that the industry has fallen apart.

Speaker 1:          02:17:34       It used to be the porn industry. You know, they could just get into porn and they could get a vivid contract and we a ton of money while the Internet crushed it. You know what I mean? There's free porn. It's everywhere else buying porn. It's like this. The business has completely fallen apart. The business model just eroded because of the Internet. So why the recession happened? The Internet before, well, they had a legitimate fucking beef. You know, they were talking about people getting bailouts. They're like, what about the porn industry? Right? We're like, we're going to bail you out like you dirty birds. That's pretty fucked up too. True. It's a legit business where billions of fucking dollars are coming from it and millions and millions of people all throughout this country are enjoying porn and it's a legit, it's a legit business to bail out, but no one would ever dare spend your fucking tax dollars keeping some fucking porno house at Chatsworth or over, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:18:22       Yeah. It's crazy. Right? Totally. What was really weird to me is I don't get the whole, like I say, like you like gin and Jamison and you're just like, ah, you know, you can't find any videos, agenda. Jamison on the Internet for some reason the Internet is broken or whatever. For Jenna Jamison videos, what? Right. So you see there's a video of her that costs $10 and it's just her getting anal and then [inaudible] name. Okay, well as an example, right? They do with a way more than 10 bucks is what I'm trying to say. Here's, here's miscellaneous hot girl over here, anal video for free. Why would you, why is there that big of a difference to pay 10 bucks to see this girl, Dude, oh dude, guys become obsessed with a girl, becomes their jerk-off girlfriend. I use that, I guess, uh, porn it as masturbation and then once I'm done, I'm not watching porn.

Speaker 1:          02:19:07       Something still they fixate on one chick, they'll like, they'll have this one girl, you know, for whatever reason, she just does it for them. And they did decide. They've jerked off a couple of times to her and it was very satisfying. So decided they're only gonna go to her videos at one time. This is really embarrassing. I'm my space messaged a porn star that I liked, but did you say I really like you? If you're ever in La, you should come to one of my shows like a girl, Bree Olsen. Whoa. Free Olsen. Black Dick. Like a champ. She's so cool. Like a duck to water. She is so cute. And then the guy that I was dating saw the message and it wasn't really embarrassing like walking through the casino [inaudible] she was like, what is this mind space mass? It is checking your my space. That's a symptom of a greater evil.

Speaker 1:          02:20:02       That guy was looking for Bri Holsten God Dang them bitches out to writers. I would be offended. They were looking at my master's. Yeah. What's that? Oh, I ever, I don't know. Have you ever had someone pick up your phone and just like, let me see who you're texting. Get the fuck off that. Yeah, you got to grow up. I did want to touch people's phones. Can't talk to my phone. Whoa. Nice. Woo. Bri, Bri Olson. Um, no one takes a big black dick in the ass with a smile. She's so innocent looking. She's so innocent looking and she sounds innocent. She's very vocal coach. She still, she's got that giant black snake in her anus and she's like, Oh fuck my ass. And like, whoa. Do Isis. Taylor is, no, she's the last month pet a pet of the month. She's pretty hot. Then you got through our videos and she just had black Dicks, like two black dicks in her ass and stuff like that just ruins a girl because I don't even want to say the names, but uh, is there a few poor girls that have done those? A gangbang videos. That's, that's the number one. Ruiner oh, like when it's like 98 cops in 10 seconds or more than that. There are hundreds now they're up to the hundreds. One girl just broke the record recently. I think she went like 600 and then her friend there were, I believe they were on open Anthony, they were talking about this and her friend, she was talking about how her friend just broke the anal record and she was mad that her friend, like, I'm going to go get that record to see these people are insane.

Speaker 1:          02:21:36       I actually don't necessarily blame them as much as I blame the people surrounding them that are like, yeah, keep doing it. Well, you know, yes and no because listen, you're dealing, you're dealing with a fairly finished product and you know, if it's a shit sandwich, it's a shit sandwich. What are you gonna do? You're gonna scrape the shit out and put mayonnaise down, lay some new fucking meet and we're going gonna make it ham and falafel. No, it's a shit sandwich. This bitch is crazy. If she's, if she's a blow these guys out of videos, she's going to be blown someone at a concert or she's going to let somebody fuck her in the middle of a bar while a bunch of people watch she's nuts. You know, you're, you're not going to be able to fix her unless you have a time machine where you can go back in time and stop her stepfather from fingering her. You're not going to be able to fix, or I film it and then go back in time 10 more minutes and then stop it.

Speaker 9:          02:22:26       I don't even know what you just said. If Future Shit. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean, unless you, you, it's all what we said earlier. It's all about the way they're raised. You know, all human beings, that's our number one problem is that we're not concentrating on schools. We're not concentrating on, on educating people about parenthood, providing people with child support and child, you know, childcare and you know, making like positive environments for children to grow up in. And then of course people are angry because they can't get what they want. They're told the, you know, the world's their oyster, but meanwhile they're living in a world of shit and they're in their projects and just, and they're having babies and no one wants to give them money and they got no money and he's got no fucking happiness and shit. Shit, Shit. Kid grows up angry, fucked up, begets more angry, fucked up behavior.

Speaker 9:          02:23:10       And then it all comes from that. It all, it seems so simple, but yet there's no resources put towards it whatsoever. No one is on TV. There's no politician saying we have to do a way better job of raising children. We have to do a way more responsible job of parenting. We have to understand what the actual role is. It isn't just this is your kid and you're the dad. No, no, no. You are in charge and managing the development of a new human being and you can make that life incredible positive. Really. Like you can set connections in that child's mind that are very positive and loving and friendly and make that person an asset to any community that they're in. Or you can create a monster. Right? Yeah. It's a huge deal. I mean it's amazing too how it's so easy to become a parent and how he, yeah, it's sad.

Speaker 9:          02:23:57       It's so easy. My accident by accident you have to go to, yeah, it should be hard as fuck to make pre Paul people. It's just that again, if it wasn't, I wouldn't have made a person, you know, I mean honestly my wife got pregnant by accident, but you might have like if they made it like a college, like he had to go through like four years of like strange baby wouldn't have done it, but maybe you would them maybe it wouldn't have done. It would be such a special thing that you'd be like, I want it. I want a baby. I get say that man. But you're you, if you're, if you're selfish, which I frick certainly was, and you get used to your freedom and you think about a buy a baby as an infringement on freedom and like, I'll do it someday. Maybe someday, maybe, maybe when I'm ready.

Speaker 9:          02:24:38       Maybe when I got this in line, maybe when I got that I didn't have a kid til I was 40 but in all those things before the baby's actually born, either you don't really understand what it really is until you have one. And then when you have one, all that selfishness, it's like, no, no, no, no, no. This is like a part of me. Like this isn't like a new person that I have to take care of. It is, but it's a part of me. Like you, you, you have this connection to that child that really doesn't exist until you have that connection. And you have to sort of be incredibly ready for that. Yeah. You gotta be ready and done everything you want to do or you become ready as it happens. You know, sometimes it does. Ed. He's had a few friends, girls that he dated that were just scan aromas and all of a sudden they got pregnant and they had kids and they just changed everything.

Speaker 9:          02:25:23       Went Veg, started doing yoga. Stop fucking around, no drinking, no drugs, clean sober, going to meetings, you know, getting their shit together, having a good job, starting their own business because I got a few stories of that because it's just like the overwhelming responsibility in love you feel for this kid. I think it either clicks or it doesn't, and you raise it porn, star mushrooms and babies. That's what it's all about folks. Getting mushrooms to babies, raising children the right way and giving people mushrooms. So we realize we're all connected. This is my platform for 2012 I want to run for president. We think not president. I'm going to run for president when president of the Internet. I'm gonna Start my own thing. I think the regular president thing is all rigged. It's all bullshit. You know? It's like, you know you're not in, it's like campaigning to be a character on a cartoon.

Speaker 9:          02:26:10       It's like the cartoons already written like we don't need you. We already have our players. We already have, the roles are in, no matter what your, it's a Democrat or Republican or an or a cookie. It's an independent, whatever it is, Green party, libertarian or whatever he was. No one's taking you seriously stab a crat or it's Republican. It's a fucking game. It's a game that's already set up. We need a new game president of the Internet. Well will it president Internet to kick out all the cuts. Stop all the bullshit. Make everybody nice. I would set up the Internet at the same way I set up my message board. Why have one room, which is shit talking one on one, which is like for everybody. That's cool. If you're nice and you're cool and even if you're kind of slow or you're, you know, whatever, as long as you're not a Douche bag, just go on there and post and try to have a good time and try not to spam and try to, you know, engage in interesting conversations.

Speaker 9:          02:26:56       But if it become a douchebag, we give you a pink name. And we send you to the retard room and you could still go to shit talking one oh one but you can't post anymore. It's pretty much like how it is now though. You, you either out of prison are in prison or you get the electric chair again, there's analogies. He's motherfucker, they're there. They don't make any sense. This whole strange. You're saying you would have your world or your country be like your message board where you're either in the normal mess up or the country. I'm talking about managing the Internet. I'm talking about being president, the Internet, right? Eventually we will live in a world. You see, well, we'll not be a regular world. We're going to be connected, right? And when that happens, I think we should set it up like a message board.

Speaker 9:          02:27:37       Got to have a Douche bag room, right? Which is prison. But it's not because you don't want to put someone in a cage. Prison is for fucking real assholes. You know what? Prison, yes, he, terrible analogy. But prisoner would prison really should be for his people will hurt people. Whether you steal from them with you and when they bring you into prison, you know, ideally it should be all right, sit down. We've got to figure out how to fix your life. But that's not what it is. It's like, here's a guy who's going to rape. You want me to keep me to join a white gang? Because you're white. You know, you need to get down with the Latinos because you're Mexican. You know, fuck how we know that that goes on and there's nothing done about it. Well, there's a website, stop prison, rape.com.

Speaker 9:          02:28:20       It's stories. Meanwhile, the stores, that dude's beat off to Wellesley, it's probably not even real stories. It's probably just some sick fuck. It was like a fan of prison rape. Like some dudes are a fan of civil war reenactments. Yeah. He's faced like letters to home from a civil civil war soldier. This guy is faking it. No prison rape stories. And on that note, ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of the podcast. We'd like to thank, um, little Esther for coming.

And Don's a great guy and he's, the problem is the new comedy store is kind of not appreciating dawn's efforts. So this, if this doesn't work, he might be kind of forced out of their, like Brody Stevens has been, last time I was, I saw the Dingdong show, there was a schizophrenia comic, I forget his name and he said, yeah. And he used to do open mic with him and he took off all his pants and he only was wearing, uh, a, uh, what's that thing that you hate and you like thongs, fanny pack. He was only wearing a fanny pack, but his balls were so long, his balls were hanging below the fanny pack. That's odd sound. It's, that's just to kind of show you what craziness happens when you're, yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:30:47       You know, if you're on an asset, it's definitely the show for you. The guy that created the movie that made the movie windy city heat, which is unbelievably funny. Yeah. Don Barrett's is a special character. He's a real institution at the comedy store. I mean, I can't even think about the comic store. I'll think about dawn Barris. He's always been one of those guys has done crazy late night sets there and he's just a fun dude and awesome. And he works for the Jimmy Kimmel show. He warms up the crowds and he's always, you know, doing sketches and stuff. He's a great guy. Great Guy.
