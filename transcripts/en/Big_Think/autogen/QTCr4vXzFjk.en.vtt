it I think in the full in the field of
food and the big problem that we have is

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320
food and the big problem that we have is
 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.560
food and the big problem that we have is
the availability and the hunger that is

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570
the availability and the hunger that is
 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.010
the availability and the hunger that is
present in the world I don't think that

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020
present in the world I don't think that
 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.279
present in the world I don't think that
is necessary and the question that

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289
is necessary and the question that
 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.140
is necessary and the question that
follows of the answer that follows is

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150
follows of the answer that follows is
 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.620
follows of the answer that follows is
that will there be availability in time

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630
that will there be availability in time
 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.180
that will there be availability in time
to come so the environment and how we

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190
to come so the environment and how we
 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.670
to come so the environment and how we
take care of the environment and the

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680
 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.980
introduction of technology of industry

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990
introduction of technology of industry
 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.159
introduction of technology of industry
of whatever altering things are they all

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169
of whatever altering things are they all
 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.980
of whatever altering things are they all
for our benefits and ultimately are they

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990
for our benefits and ultimately are they
 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.250
