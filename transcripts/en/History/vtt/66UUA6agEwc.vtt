00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.880
Congratulations, bladesmiths.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.210
You've made it to the second
round of this competition.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.790
And now that your blades
have been tempered,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.830
it's time to turn them into
fully functional weapons

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.880
by attaching handles to them.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.460
However, we've got
the added enjoyment

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.960
of including a hidden lanyard
hole in your pang design.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.460
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.000
Your three hours starts now.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.710
Let's talk a little bit about
this recess lanyard hole.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.210
The one thing that
I'm nervous about

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.920
is that these guys are
going to get into a focus,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.750
and they're going to get their
glue on there, they're going

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.920
to put their pins, and
forget to give a little

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.210
hollow for that lanyard.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.000
[chuckling] Welding.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.080
The first thing I have
to do in this round

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.580
is fix this void by adding
material without heating it up.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.040
But you can't do one
without the other.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.750
If I apply too much
while welding this void,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.380
it's going to ruin the temper.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.750
Oh, no, no, no.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.580
It's really easy to want to
cool off that weld quickly.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.750
And what you wind up with
is a weld that's solid.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.710
But the metal on either
side of that weld

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.750
is now brutal as heck.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.540
BRENDAN: Dave doesn't like the
way this fits in his hands.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.540
It's the weakest
part on the blade.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.620
I can only remove so much
without it just snapping,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.290
flying across the room.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960
And then it's back
to square one.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960
And square one will
be me scratching

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.620
my head in my own shop, reliving
this event over and over again.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.880
Putting a hidden lanyard
hole in that the handle is

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.620
going to be no problem at all.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.790
But I feel like
three hours is not

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.080
enough time for me to finish
the 500 things I have to do.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.380
My biggest worry is, there's
no transition between my blade

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.830
and the handle.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.830
I really need to resolve that.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.080
So I'm adding a guard.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.170
An unprompted
guard-- has that ever

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.250
happened here in the forge?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.750
I've never done a
hidden lanyard hole,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.000
but anything's easier
than a cold foge.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I chose G10 for the handle.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.460
And I'm going to do a
little razzle dazzle.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.620
This handle is going
to be beautiful.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.960
Your cutouts on
your handle material

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.670
should curve, match up with
the back end of the hole,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460
and then curve
out again, so when

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.000
you push the lanyard through,
it just slides through the hole.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.750
I'm grinding away
at the grinder,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.250
and taking as much
meat and handle

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.250
off, because that's exactly
what they told me to do.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.670
But to do a good
hook job, you want

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.380
a little meat on your blade.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.210
So I'm going to leave
mine a little thicker

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.330
than the other guys.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.880
I get a little advantage there.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.960
Brendan has grabbed
some handle material.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.540
It looks like
quarter-inch Micarta.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.120
BRENDAN: This piece
looks like it's going

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.620
to be just the right thickness.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.330
I won't have to
take away that much.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.830
And then I gotta put a
nice little hidden pocket

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.380
so you can put a lanyard
through that lanyard hole.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.000
What I'm doing is using
the natural radius

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.380
of this grinding belt
wheel to just router

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.040
out a sweet little pocket.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.210
Now, the one thing I hope is
that that lanyard hole should

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.710
be bigger than a quarter-inch.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.540
There's nothing worse
than having a lanyard hole

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.540
that it's really tough
to get a lanyard into.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.880
That ain't bad.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.250
I like it.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.250
You have 60 minutes!

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.920
That's 60 minutes remaining!

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.170
BRAD: I'd glue the handle on,
and the holes don't line up.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.920
I'm totally paranoid that
the epoxy was getting hard.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.080
This could be a disaster.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.880
[groans]
Oh, whoops.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.880
[laughs] I realized I just
grabbed the wrong side scale.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.420
Good thing I realized
that before the epoxy set.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.210
It went together fairly well.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.580
But it's crazy.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.420
There's just not much time left.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.420
I'm usually relaxed
at home doing all

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420
this with some music playing.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.330
I feel like a clock
is just killing me.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.250
Bladesmiths, there are only
30 minutes left on that clock!

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.460
JEFF: The second round, and even
making it here, I'm in heaven.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.580
I'm enjoying every minute of it.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.250
It may not look like
it, but I'm smiling.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.080
It looks like he's kind of
going with that nap look, where

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.960
you put a lot of little
dents and grooves

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.460
all over everything.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.210
Done right, it can be a
pretty comfortable handle.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.040
Done wrong, it's just a million
hot spots throughout your palm.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.880
I fixed everything the
judges wanted me to fix,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.290
and I'm just going to town.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.540
I'm just cruising along.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.250
MAN 1: It still looks
like a really beefy knife.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.080
MAN 2: He seems to
like the heft of it.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.750
But people also
think their babies

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.120
are cute when they're not.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.960
[laughter]

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.960
JEFF: I think I've got the
best blade going in so far.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.750
So I think I'm going
home to the final round.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:43.500
10, nine, eight, seven six,
five, four, three, two, one.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.830
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.670
This round is over.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.960
I'm confident that
I fixed the issues

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.460
the judges had with my knife.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.330
But Jeff's handle
looks pretty sparkly.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.460
I don't know.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
Maybe he is Magic Mike.
