I'm Destin from Huntsville Alabama. This is Sadie and Spotsy. On the International Space Station,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.070
if you're free falling in one position, without touching anything, with no

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.070
spin, is it possible to wiggle in such a way that you're able to rotate to a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.100
different angular position and then stop? On Smarter Every Day we demonstrated this

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
with a high speed camera and a cat, who is a non holonomic system and can do this

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.140
by extending his legs, arching his back and twisting in a very specific pattern.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.170
So can humans do this on orbit? You want to say hey to the astronauts?
- Hey.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.910
- Thank you. We look up to you guys.
