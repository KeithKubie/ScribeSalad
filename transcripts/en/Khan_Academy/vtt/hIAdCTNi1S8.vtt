00:00:00.536 --> 00:00:02.386
Voiceover:We've seen
multiple times in our life

00:00:02.386 --> 00:00:08.402
that distance can be
viewed as rate times time.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.048
What I want to do in this video

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:12.367
is use this fairly simple
formula right over here,

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.033
this fairly simple equation,

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:17.700
to understand that units
can really be viewed

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.633
as algebraic objects,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:21.767
that you can treat them like variables

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:24.236
as we work through a
formula or an equation,

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:25.766
which could be really, really helpful

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:29.033
to make sure that we're
getting the results

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:32.933
in units that actually make sense.

00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:36.566
For example, if someone
were to give you a rate,

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:40.968
if they were to say a rate of, let's say,

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:45.034
5 meters per second,

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:47.433
and they were to give you a time,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.833
a time of 10 seconds,

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:52.104
then we can pretty, in a
pretty straightforward way,

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:53.002
apply this formula.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.500
We say, well, distance
is equal to our rate,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.693
5 meters per second times our time,

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:04.167
times our time, which is 10 seconds.

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:07.100
What's neat here is we
can treat the units,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.302
as I've just said, like
algebraic constructs,

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.967
kind of like variables,

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:13.101
so this would be equal to,

00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:14.561
well, multiplication, it doesn't matter

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:15.926
what order we multiply in,

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:17.653
so we can change the order.

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:21.258
This is the same thing as 5 times 10,

00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:25.300
5 times 10 times meters per second,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.001
times meters per second times seconds,

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.600
times seconds.

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:32.541
If we were to treat our units

00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:34.038
as these algebraic objects,

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:34.956
we could say, hey, look,

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:36.966
we have seconds divided by seconds,

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.567
or you're going to have
seconds in the denominator

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:40.700
multiplied by seconds in the numerator.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.500
Those are going to cancel out,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.167
and 5 times 10, of course, is,

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:47.702
5 times 10, of course, is 50.

00:01:47.702 --> 00:01:50.700
We would be left with 50,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.473
and the units that we're
left with are the meters,

00:01:53.473 --> 00:01:54.633
50 meters.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:55.701
That's pretty neat.

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:56.669
The units worked out.

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:59.700
When we treated the units
out like algebraic objects,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.088
they worked out so that
our end units for distance

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:06.233
were in meters, which
is a unit of distance.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:08.233
Now you're saying, "OK,
that's cute and everything,

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:10.499
"but this seems like a little
bit of too much overhead

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.366
"to worry about when I'm just doing

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.233
"a simple formula like this."

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.433
But what I want to show you is that

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.634
even with a simple formula

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:20.069
like distance is equal to rate times time,

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.433
what I just did could
actually be quite useful,

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:23.767
and this thing that I'm
doing is actually called

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:25.366
dimensional analysis.

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:26.900
It's useful for something as simple

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.767
as distance equals rate times time,

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.766
but as you go into physics
and chemistry and engineering,

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.701
you'll see much, much, much more,

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:35.838
I would say, hairy formulas.

00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:37.633
When you do the dimensional analysis,

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.525
it makes sure that the
math is working out right.

00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:42.766
It makes sure that you're
getting the right units.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:43.366
But even with this,

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:45.966
let's try a slightly
more complicated example.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.837
Let's say that our rate is,

00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:52.767
let's say, let's keep our
rate at 5 meters per second,

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:55.501
but let's say that
someone gave us the time.

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:57.856
Instead of giving it in
seconds, they give it in hours,

00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:01.633
so they say the time is equal to 1 hour.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:04.033
Now let's try to apply this formula.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:08.034
We're going to get distance is
equal to 5 meters per second,

00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:13.366
5 meters per second times
time, which is 1 hour,

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:15.366
times 1 hour.

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:17.233
What's that going to give us?

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.100
The 5 times the 1,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.033
so we multiply the 5 times the 1,

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:22.700
that's just going to give us 5.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.730
But then remember,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.835
we have to treat the units algebraically.

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:27.700
We're going to do our
dimensional analysis,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.166
so it's 5,

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:34.309
so we have meters per second times hours,

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:35.532
times hours,

00:03:35.532 --> 00:03:38.167
or you could say 5 meter hours per second.

00:03:38.474 --> 00:03:40.167
Well, this doesn't look like a ...

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:42.115
This isn't a set of units that we know

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:43.500
that makes sense to us.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.750
This doesn't feel like our
traditional units of distance,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.036
so we want to cancel this out in some way.

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.100
It might jump out of you,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.700
well, if we can get rid of this hours,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.233
if we can express it in terms of seconds,

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.433
then that would cancel here,

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.034
and we'd be left with just the meters,

00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:58.845
which is a unit of distance
that we're familiar with.

00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:00.234
So how do we do that?

00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:02.500
We'd want to multiply this thing

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.900
by something that has
hours in the denominator

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.033
and seconds in the numerator,

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:10.300
times essentially seconds per hour.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.035
How many seconds are there per hour?

00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:15.366
Well, there are 3,600 ...

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:16.368
Let me do this in a ...

00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:17.233
I'll do it in this color.

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:20.233
There are 3,600 seconds per hour,

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.135
or you could even say that

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:27.233
there are 3,600 seconds for every 1 hour.

00:04:28.324 --> 00:04:29.709
Now when you multiply,

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:31.966
these hours will cancel with these hours,

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:34.366
these seconds will cancel
with those seconds,

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.506
and we are left with,

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:39.567
we are left with 5 times 3,600.

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:40.233
What is that?

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:43.301
That's 5 times 3,000 would be 15,000,

00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.037
5 times 600 is another 3,000,

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:50.100
so that is equal to 18,000.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.700
The only units that we're left with,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.422
we just have the meters there.

00:04:53.422 --> 00:04:54.198
18-

00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:56.429
Oh, it's 18,000,

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:59.300
18,000,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.473
18,000 meters.

00:05:03.673 --> 00:05:04.679
We're done.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.233
We've now expressed our distance

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:08.366
in terms of units that we recognize.

00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:11.033
If you go 5 meters per second for 1 hour,

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:13.900
you will go 18,000 meters.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.033
But let's just use our little

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:17.039
dimensional analysis
muscles a little bit more.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.833
What if we didn't want
the answer in meters

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:20.500
but we wanted the answer in kilometers?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.833
What could we do?

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.433
Well, we could take that 18,000 meters,

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:27.100
18,000 meters,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.343
and if we could multiply it by something

00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:32.100
that has meters in the denominator,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.501
meters in the denominator

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:35.767
and kilometers in the numerator,

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.339
then these meters would cancel out,

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.700
and we'd be left with the kilometers.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.705
So what can we multiply it

00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:42.700
so we're not really changing the value?

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.785
We want to multiply it by essentially 1,

00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:47.633
so we want to write equivalent things

00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.500
in the numerator and the denominator.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.766
So 1 kilometer is equivalent to,

00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:55.766
equivalent to 1,000 meters.

00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:56.633
One way to think about it,

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:58.433
we're just multiplying this thing by 1,

00:05:58.433 --> 00:06:01.633
1 kilometer over 1,000 meters.

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:03.236
Well, 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters,

00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:05.700
so this thing is equivalent to 1.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.702
But what's neat is when you multiply,

00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:10.766
we have meters canceling with meters,

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:14.103
and so you're left with
18,000 divided by 1,000

00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:16.311
is equal to 18.

00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.033
And then the only units we're left with

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:20.833
is the kilometers,

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.700
and we are done.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.233
We have re-expressed our distance

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:25.500
instead of in meters

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.835
in terms of kilometers.
