philosophy there might be a layer of
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.640
philosophy there might be a layer of
explicit philosophy and of course there

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
explicit philosophy and of course there

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
stories and there isn't anything under
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.650
stories and there isn't anything under
the stories except maybe behavior you

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
the stories except maybe behavior you
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.359
the stories except maybe behavior you
know and that's so implicit it doesn't

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
know and that's so implicit it doesn't
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.000
know and that's so implicit it doesn't
even actually count it's not a cognitive

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
even actually count it's not a cognitive
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.910
even actually count it's not a cognitive
operation and so this is the story these

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
operation and so this is the story these
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.140
operation and so this is the story these
are the stories that are underneath our

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
are the stories that are underneath our
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.009
are the stories that are underneath our
culture and so there better be something

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
culture and so there better be something
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.770
culture and so there better be something
to them that's what we hope and but more

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
to them that's what we hope and but more
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020
to them that's what we hope and but more
importantly maybe we shouldn't toss them

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
importantly maybe we shouldn't toss them
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.880
importantly maybe we shouldn't toss them
away without knowing what they mean

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
away without knowing what they mean
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.030
away without knowing what they mean
because if we toss them away then we're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
because if we toss them away then we're
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560
because if we toss them away then we're
throwing everything that we depend on

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
throwing everything that we depend on
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.170
throwing everything that we depend on
away as far as I can tell and we will

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
away as far as I can tell and we will
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150
away as far as I can tell and we will
pay for it we'll pay for it individually

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
pay for it we'll pay for it individually
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.130
pay for it we'll pay for it individually
because we'll be weak you know because

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
because we'll be weak you know because
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779

then someone else who's firm in their
convictions can you're their puppet like

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
convictions can you're their puppet like
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.020
convictions can you're their puppet like
instantly and then you're also the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
instantly and then you're also the
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700
instantly and then you're also the
puppet of your own doubts right because

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
puppet of your own doubts right because
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529
puppet of your own doubts right because
unless you have convictions

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
unless you have convictions
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750
unless you have convictions
you're gonna generate doubts like mad

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
you're gonna generate doubts like mad
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549
you're gonna generate doubts like mad
because everyone does and then the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
because everyone does and then the
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.679
because everyone does and then the
doubts win and and you'll be paralyzed

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
doubts win and and you'll be paralyzed
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.080
doubts win and and you'll be paralyzed
because there'll be you know 50% of you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
because there'll be you know 50% of you
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270
because there'll be you know 50% of you
moving forward and 50% of you frozen

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
moving forward and 50% of you frozen
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.250
moving forward and 50% of you frozen
stiff and that'll be enough just to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
stiff and that'll be enough just to
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.210
stiff and that'll be enough just to
lodge you in place and so ok so there's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
lodge you in place and so ok so there's
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830
