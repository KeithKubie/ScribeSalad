by a wave now then you raise a question

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500
by a wave now then you raise a question
 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.110
by a wave now then you raise a question
what happens if you change the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120
what happens if you change the
 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.300
what happens if you change the
vibrations of these waves can you then

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310
vibrations of these waves can you then
 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.060
vibrations of these waves can you then
drift into other universes can you then

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070
drift into other universes can you then
 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.370
drift into other universes can you then
drift into other planes of existence and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380
drift into other planes of existence and
 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.140
drift into other planes of existence and
at the atomic scale the answer is yes it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150
at the atomic scale the answer is yes it
 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.200
at the atomic scale the answer is yes it
turns out the waves can split at certain

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210
turns out the waves can split at certain
 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.750
turns out the waves can split at certain
key junctures like an ocean wave can hit

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760
key junctures like an ocean wave can hit
 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.610
key junctures like an ocean wave can hit
a barrier and then we have two ocean

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620
a barrier and then we have two ocean
 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.580
a barrier and then we have two ocean
waves so it is possible that quantum

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590
waves so it is possible that quantum
 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.890
waves so it is possible that quantum
events can actually split universes

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900
events can actually split universes
 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.580
events can actually split universes

Mars to Jupiter to outer space parts of

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660
Mars to Jupiter to outer space parts of
 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.930
Mars to Jupiter to outer space parts of
me lose in all directions so there's a

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940
me lose in all directions so there's a
 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.720
me lose in all directions so there's a
finite probability that I will go to bed

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730
finite probability that I will go to bed
 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.050
finite probability that I will go to bed
tonight and wake up on Mars tomorrow now

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
tonight and wake up on Mars tomorrow now
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.490
tonight and wake up on Mars tomorrow now
of course it's a very small probability

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500
of course it's a very small probability
 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.159
of course it's a very small probability
I can calculate it I would have to wait

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169
I can calculate it I would have to wait
 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.629
I can calculate it I would have to wait
longer than the lifetime of the universe

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639
longer than the lifetime of the universe
 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.880
longer than the lifetime of the universe
for that to happen so chances are I'm

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890
for that to happen so chances are I'm
 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.350
for that to happen so chances are I'm
not going to wind up on Mars tomorrow

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360
not going to wind up on Mars tomorrow
 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.530
not going to wind up on Mars tomorrow
however

is possible and I can even calculate the
 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.420
is possible and I can even calculate the
probability that I will wake up on Mars

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
probability that I will wake up on Mars
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.340
probability that I will wake up on Mars
tomorrow so anyway to answer your

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350
tomorrow so anyway to answer your

question a everything is vibrating be
these vibrations are vibrations of

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150
these vibrations are vibrations of

universes do separate and do all sorts

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090
universes do separate and do all sorts
 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.660
universes do separate and do all sorts
of crazy things but in the main they

average out so when I look at myself in

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890
average out so when I look at myself in
 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.690
average out so when I look at myself in
the mirror on average that is me but
