00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.340
The United States has stopped winning wars.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.380
It has stopped winning wars since World War
II.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.599
And the question is, why have we stopped winning
wars?

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.710
We have the best troops, we have the best
equipment, we have the best technology, we

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.750
have the most money.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.480
So what's the problem?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.200
But since World War II, you know, Korea is
a stalemate, Vietnam went communist.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.770
There's Afghanistan, Iraq these are failures.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.840
We must be honest with ourselves, these are
failures.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.059
But this is not just a US problem.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.170
The West, quote unquote, writ large, does
not know how to win wars anymore.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.520
Look at France in Indochina and Algeria; the
British in Palestine and Cyprus; the Soviets

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.129
in Afghanistan; Israel against Hezbollah in
Lebanon.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.839
The question is, what does it mean if the
West can no longer win wars?

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.610
It's an obvious question, but nobody wants
to ask it because the implications are too

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.050
terrifying to behold.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.520
And the answer is: war has moved on.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.170
War has changed.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.060
It has new rules, and it looks nothing like
World War II, which is our model, our strategic

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.940
paradigm.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.690
And as long as we keep this up, we will continue
to have forever wars.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.020
One of the new rules of war is that we will
see the return of mercenaries, of private

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.320
force, of private warfare.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.770
You know, they say mercenary is the second
oldest profession.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.410
Private war has been around for a very long
time, but we've forgotten it.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.320
Mercenaries have only been sort of underground
for 150 years.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.050
Now they're coming back.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.850
And most of military history is private military
history.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.170
The reason it's come back is because the US
resurrected it, ironically, with the Iraq

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.250
and Afghan wars.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.430
The US it's ironic because it's the superpower
that did this.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.480
It wasn't small states with money who needed
an army that didn't have it, it was the United

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.060
States of America.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.709
And the reason the US did this is because
they initially, policymakers thought the Iraq

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.760
war and the Afghanistan war would be very
short, easy wars.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.090
And we remember Secretary Defense Rumsfeld
saying that these wars would take days, weeks

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.480
at most, certainly not months.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.540
Now it's nearly 20 years later, and we're
still mired in these quagmires.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.889
We're still stuck in these entrenched places
in South Asia and the Middle East.

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:45.629
One of the solutions that's being considered
is replacing all American troops in Afghanistan

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.680
by mercenaries.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.590
This is currently what President Trump is
considering doing, led by Erik Prince.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.590
Erik Prince is the founder of Blackwater.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:06.239
Blackwater was a large private military company
that, in 2007, massacred 17 civilians in Baghdad,

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.730
and it became one of the low points of the
Iraq war.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.389
He is the sister of Betsy DeVos, the Secretary
of Education, and is using political connections

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.560
for the biggest paycheck of his career.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.689
Now, this would normally be a laughable situation,
right?

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.209
Replacing, you know, American troops with
mercenaries.

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.341
What makes it even more laughable and even
dangerous is that he thinks that 6,500 mercenaries

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.219
can fix Afghanistan.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:41.939
Now, at the height of the Afghan war, there
was 140,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan, which

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.749
couldn't do anything, really, in Afghanistan.

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.849
And now, the Taliban control more of Afghanistan.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.870
So what is Erik Prince going to do with 6,500?

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.379
That's a good question.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.939
What is even more dangerous, though, is what
happens to war when you privatize it.
