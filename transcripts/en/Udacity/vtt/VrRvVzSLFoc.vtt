00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We study again our die.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You observe the following sequence: 1, 2, 3, 2.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'll ask you know for the two different estimators what is the maximum like estimator

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and what is the laplacian estimator for our estimate of the probability of the outcome 1

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
for this die, based on that data.
