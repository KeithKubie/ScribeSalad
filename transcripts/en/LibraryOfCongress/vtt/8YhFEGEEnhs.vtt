&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I'm Stephanie
Marcus from the Science, Technology,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.220
and Business division
here at the Library.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.190
I want to welcome you to
Cassini's Grand Finale.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.150
It sounds sort of like a
symphonic piece, and it probably is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.180
with a loud crash at the end.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.120
Let's see.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.050 position:56%
We are really lucky to have one of
the Cassini team members here today.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.570
So close to Cassini's demise

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.850
which will be a week
from Friday, the 15th.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.770
Conor Nixon is a space
scientist from NASA Goddard.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.800
He is originally from Belfast
and was educated in the UK.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.680
He is, he was, he earned
a BA in Natural Sciences

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.890
from the University of Cambridge.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.400
A Master of Science
in Radio Astronomy

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.570
from the University of Manchester.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.530
And finally his PhD
in Planetary Science

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.100
from the University of Oxford.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.590
He's been with the Cassini message,
mission since his graduate days,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.710
and he is a, he's had
many awards at NASA.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.340
The latest was the
Robert H Goddard Award

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.260
for Exceptional Achievement
in Science.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.250
We have 13 years of Cassini
observations, highlights,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.840 position:56%
and the grand finale to get through.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.510
So please help me welcome
Conor Nixon to the Library.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.130
[ Applause ]

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.430
&gt;&gt; Conor Nixon: Thank
you, Stephanie,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.870
for such a gracious introduction.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.670
And thank you for the
invitation to come here.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.610
I'm really excited to be here
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.280
My first time in this building.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.270
And to address you all and
convey the excitement that I have

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.540
for this mission that I've
worked on for more than 20 years.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.370
It's now coming to a dramatic end.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.080 position:56%
I'm sure some of you have heard next
week this is coming up really fast.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.690
So today I just want to talk about
some of the exciting highlights

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.320
that we've had from
the mission so far.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.960
It's been a great voyage
of discovery.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.290
And then take you right up
to the present day and talk

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.930
about what we've done in the
last few months and weeks.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.960
And what's going to happen
in the next eight days.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.690
So first thing I just
want to introduce Cassini.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.390
So Cassini is actually the Cassini,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.120
we call it the Cassini-Huygens
mission.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.310
It's actually two spacecraft and
they're - one was produced by NASA.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.930
This is the Cassini orbiter.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.240
Which is currently in
orbit around Saturn.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.610
And then there was a
probe which was built

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.280
by the European Space
Agency named Huygens.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.760
This was named after a Dutch
scientist who was the discoverer

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.240
of the giant moon of
Saturn called Titan.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.830
And this was attached to Cassini.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.900
Shortly after it arrived in the
Saturn system, the end of 2004,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.600
it was released and this
became the first probe

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.980
to land on the moon, Titan.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.760
And that gave us a
whole different insight

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.520
into what was going on on Titan.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.260
That mission was short in duration.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.880
It was just a two-and-a-half
hour descent to the surface.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.990
And then that probe, the Huygens
probe, its batteries were used up.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.040
But since then the Cassini
orbiter has continued

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.660
with its 12 instruments to give
us the science that we've had.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.750
So how did Cassini get to Saturn?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.880
This was launched back in 1997.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.910
And the Cassini spacecraft was so
big that we couldn't just push it

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.100
on a direct trajectory
all the way to Saturn.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.430
So we had to use a trick.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.120
And the trick that we used
was to get a slingshot

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.180
from some of the inner planets.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.140
So Cassini actually flew by Venus
a couple times, by the Earth.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.930
And then finally it ringed
its way out to Jupiter

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.250 position:56%
and got its final slingshot maneuver
to give it that extra boost,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.510
that extra kick to get it
all the way out to Saturn.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.670
So after a seven-year cruise,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.890
Cassini reached Saturn
in July 1st, 2004.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.920
And then it burned its rocket
engines for about 70 minutes.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.300
And it braked and slowed itself
down so it could go into orbiter

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.440
around Saturn and begin its voyage
around Saturn and the moons.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.870 position:56%
On the way of course we were able to
get glimpses of Venus and Jupiter.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.380 position:56%
And this proved to be very useful
for us because we were actually able

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.680
to test out all our systems.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.130
And we got a lot of great science
actually out of Jupiter as well.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.660
This was the launch.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.080
It was almost 20 years ago.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.950
And it was a fantastic launch.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.250
It was a night launch.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.550
I was lucky enough to be there.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.990
I was still a student at the time
but it was a really exciting time

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.220
to wish Cassini well on its way.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.030
And then as you can see, seven
years later, it burned its rockets

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.040
to go into orbit at Saturn.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.580
So the Cassini mission
was originally designed

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.430
to have a four-year
lifetime from 2004 to 2008.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.110 position:56%
But 2008 came around, the spacecraft
was still in robust good health.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.670
Every system was working.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.120
We still had half our fuel left,
so we continued the mission

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.540
for two more years to see
the equinox at Saturn.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.530
Then at that point, we were
extended for another seven years

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.020
to go all the way to 2017.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.230
And this was calculated to
be the end of the mission

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.930
when we've used up all our fuel.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.360
And there's nothing
left in the tanks.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.890
So we have to end the
mission at that point.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.840
And this has been really
great because as you can see

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.000
in this graphic here, Saturn
has very long seasons.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.820
So Saturn takes 30 years
to go around the sun.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.360
And so it's 30 times as long
as the year that we have.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.880
And that means that its seasons are

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.010
about seven-and-a-half
Earth years in length.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.400
So just to see one season,
you have to be there

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.700
for seven-and-a-half years.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.570
Well, Cassini has been
in orbit for 13 years,

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.380
so that's almost two full seasons.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.110
And that's given us the chance to
see the spring and the fall reverse

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.410
between the Northern

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.900
and the Southern hemisphereon
Saturn and also its moons.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.770
So here's where we are today.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.670
We're right at the end.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.290
And I really love this graphic.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.820
There's a lot of information
packed in here.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.140
And this really summarizes what
we've done in the entire mission.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.210
So at the top, you can see
the orbits that we've had.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.510
The shape of the orbits.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.930
As Cassini has gone from more
of an equatorial orbit of Saturn

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.230
to more of a polar orbit.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.400 position:56%
The orbits have tilted up and down
so that we can see different things.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.700
The, the large yellow
circles you see

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.020
up at the top half are
these Titan flybys.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.090
So these are flybys of
Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.820
And then below that you can
see flybys of Enceladus.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.290
A moon which I'm going
to talk about.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.680
And some of the other
[inaudible] satellites.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.770
Saturn has 62 known
satellites at last count.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.440
And Cassini has discovered
several of those new one.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.750
So a lot of, a lot of satellites
ranging from very large.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.400
Titan's the largest,
5000 kilometers in size.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.170
Down to very small ones,
just a couple of kilometers.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.470
And at the bottom here, you
can see the seasons changing

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.920
in the Northern hemispherefrom
winter to spring and now to summer.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.450
And right over on the
very right-hand, sorry.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.580
Right around the very right-hand
side, you can see these,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.190
I don't know if I can
use my pointer.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.680
But here you can see these
what we call our final orbits.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.950 position:56%
So we have 22 of three final orbits,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.160
and we're right now
approaching our very last orbit.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.460
Just some great facts
and figures here.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.170
I'm not going to talk
about all of these.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.210
But Cassini's traveled
billions of miles.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.270
And the thing that I find the
most exciting is the number

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:11.730
of scientific publications, nearly
4000 at the time this was written,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.440
scientific publications have
come out of this mission.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.900
So it's really been
a fantastic mission.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.280
So I'm going to start by showing
you a few highlights of the,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.380
of the Cassini mission during
the 13 years that we've had.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.160
I'm going to begin with one

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.000
of Saturn's smaller moons,
and this is Enceladus.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.830
This is 500 kilometers in, in size.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.150
Or three hundred miles.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.790
This is what the moon
Enceladus looks like.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:40.290
It's named after one of the
Titans from mythology as some

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.480
of its sibling moons are.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.820
And you can see that Enceladus,
it's a very bright object.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.180
It's not covered in sand or dirt.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.560
It looks like an icy material.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.410
It's one of the brightest,
most reflective objects we have

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.910
in the solar system, almost
looks like a billiard ball.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.100
And if you look towards the
bottom of the image here,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.000
you'll see these blue
cracks on the surface here.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.720
And there are four of these
long streaks or cracks.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:18.540 position:56%
And Cassini has been, Cassini caught
the very first view of these cracks.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.260 position:56%
And shortly afterwards, we were able

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.240
to discover something very
dramatic about Enceladus.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.570
So as Cassini flew by Enceladus,

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.050
we discovered that it was
disturbing Saturn's magnetic field.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.570 position:56%
And you could see here in this image
that these magnetic field lines

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.970
which should be shooting right past
Enceladus were being deflected.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.930
And this was an indication that
something was going on here.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:51.260 position:56%
And in fact, when Cassini turned its
heat-sensing cameras on Enceladus,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.630 position:56%
we could see that these cracks which
appeared to be these blue streaks

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.190
in the, to the visible cameras were
in fact glowing [inaudible] heat

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:05.760 position:56%
that were tens of, of degrees warmer
than the cold, cold background.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.570
So this was a really
exciting indication

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.450
that there was something unique

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.790
about the [inaudible]
polar area of Enceladus.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.500 position:56%
When Cassini turned its cameras back
toward the sun, we were finally able

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.360
to see what was really
going on here.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.040
In fact, these cracks
on the South pole

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.540
of Enceladus are shooting
material out into space

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.060
like fountains or geysers.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.600
Just like Old Faithful.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.170
Some people on the project like
to call these a Cold Faithful.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:43.370 position:56%
So because unlike the, the Earth, of
course this material is much colder.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.480
It's, we believe it's water
that is shooting out into space.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.760
But it's instantly
turned into ice crystals.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.950
These are shooting for
tens or hundreds of miles

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.880
out into space all the time.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.000
So you can see looking
back towards the sun,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.980
these jets which are
not easily visible.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.180
You can see them with the
sunlight reflecting through them.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:09.500 position:56%
So this is showing us that Enceladus
is one of the very few places

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.420
in the solar system
that's actually an active,

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.770
geologically active world.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.630
And we're very excited to discover
this and to find out some more

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.930
about what's going on here.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.290
So just some other
images of the plumes here.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:30.840
We can see that these four, four
predominant plumes are tracing

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.880
out the four cracks that
we have on the South pole.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.200
So what do we think
is going on here?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.810 position:56%
It appears that there's liquid water
buried somewhere inside Enceladus.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.810
And this moon is kept from
freezing solid into a block of ice

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.630
by the tidal forces that are, that
are kind of kneading it like a ball

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.130
of dough by Saturn itself.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.340
So as the moon goes around
Saturn in its elliptical orbit,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:05.280
it experiences stressed and
compression and tension which keep,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.440
keep it warm inside
and allow the water

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.910
to remain liquid under the surface.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.300
And of course the surface on
the outside is frozen solid.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.150
But there's enough water inside,
and there's enough pressure

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.020
that periodically, as the
moon goes around Saturn,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.540
it's venting water out into space.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.430
And this is turning into
these geysers that we see.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.420
So here you can see tiny little
black dot right in the middle.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.930
This is Enceladus.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:39.770
And what's going on here, it's,
it's actually creating its own ring

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.230
as it goes around Saturn.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.030
And this is what we call
the E ring, E for Enceladus.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.310
And it's, it's trailing all
this ice material behind it.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:54.150
You can see here that it's
actually making a kind of a wake,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.520
like a darker wake where it's
plowed through its own ring.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.990
So as it repeatedly
goes around Saturn,

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.510
it creates what we
call a [inaudible]

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.440
or basically a donut
or icy material.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.000
And this is spreading
out in all directions.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.520
And as it comes back around,
it's actually making like a wake

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.490
as it plows back through
its own material.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.900
And these jets are shooting
material out in all directions.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.930
And you can actually
see some of these jets

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.200 position:56%
which are shooting the material out.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.180
Some of the material
goes ahead of Enceladus.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.390
It speeds up as it
goes towards Saturn.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.360
And some of it trails
further behind.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.650
So Enceladus is really this little
500-kilometer-size moon is creating

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.940
a cloud that's bigger
than Saturn itself.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.730
So another look inside
Enceladus here.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.450
This is what we think
is going on inside.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.920
We think that it's a, a rocky core,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.000
but then it's surrounded
by this blue layer.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.680
You can see indicated here which
is where the liquid water is.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.060
And on top of this we
have the ice shell.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.670
Now this is exciting not just as
a natural geological phenomenon.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.210
This could be potentially
even more exciting than that.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.880
Because on the Earth, we know
that at the bottom of the sea bed,

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.580
right where the volcanic vents
are in the Mid-Atlantic Ridges,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.240
there's a lot of life which
actually likes to congregate there.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.420
And if the core of Enceladus is
indeed warm, and it's surrounded

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.640
by this liquid ocean, this could
actually be a similar environment.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.210
And this is really exciting
because this gives the potential

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:33.550
that there could have been life
evolved here inside Enceladus.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:40.180
This is the deep ocean,
Mid-Atlantic Ridges on the Earth.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.260
You can see here that these
are geologically active.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.390
And these create a whole ecosystem
of life surrounding these.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.290
And right now we can't see
that far down inside Enceladus.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.020
All we have to see is
these plumes of material

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.610
which are shooting out into space.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.730
But this is kind of like a free
sample and Cassini has been able

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.170
to fly repeatedly through
these plumes.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.540
First, we didn't go too close.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.370
But eventually we got down to
just going a few tens of miles

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.960
above the surface and
shooting the spacecraft

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.700
through these curtains of material.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.900
And using an instrument
onboard Cassini

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.930
to actually measure the material.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.350 position:56%
And we found some really fascinating
things about the material.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.650
That it's not just water.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.210
In fact, it contains
organic substances,

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.630
methane and ethane molecules.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.910
There's also salt containing
potassium and sodium grains.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.530
And there's even larger
organic pieces.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.670
So there's now a huge amount of
excitement that's been generated

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.730
by Cassini to say, "Let's go
back to Enceladus someday.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.150
Let's send another mission."

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.790
But with different
instruments this time.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.700
We'll have instruments that can
actually go through these plumes

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.070
and maybe look for
any evidence of life.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.790
Any traces of biological material

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.580
which Cassini was never
designed to find.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.300
Because we didn't, we
did not have any clue

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.490
that we were going
to find these jets.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.370
So this is like a, a free
sample from the interior

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.120
which is shooting out into space.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.460
And in fact, Enceladus is
not the only moon either

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.040
that has liquid water inside.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.440
Cassini has now shown evidence
that all four of these larger moons

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.640
of Saturn are warm enough
and close enough to Saturn

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.840
that they've maintained
a water layer inside.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.700
Including Titan, which I'm
going to talk about shortly.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.000
Mimas, we nicknamed this one the
Death Star for obvious reasons.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.560
It's got that, that look to
it; that mean look to it.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.550
And Dione which is one
of the other inner moons.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.440
And we believe that all these moons
have a liquid water layer inside.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.460
And, and who knows
what's going on inside.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.760
So this is really exciting

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.090
that we've discovered what
we call these ocean worlds

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.670
in the outer solar system.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.580
And these may now be our best
chance of life outside the Earth.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.840
So Titan is Saturn's largest moon.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.140
I've already alluded to this.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.170
And this was a really exciting
[inaudible] to discover.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.910
We had the Huygens
probe which descended

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.450
to the surface in January 2005.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.600
But it wasn't until later that
year that we were able to make some

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.170
of the most dramatic discoveries.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.800
And in fact, something
that was long suspected

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.920
but we never had the chance to look

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.970
at before given its
thick, hazy atmosphere.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.060
Was that there's material that's
raining down on the surface.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.470
In fact, Titan is the only
moon in the solar system

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.280
that has an atmosphere,
a substantial atmosphere.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.370
We have planets that
have atmospheres,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.360
but Titan is the only moon
that has an atmosphere.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.110 position:56%
All the other moons appear, just you
can see all the way to the surface.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:42.010
And on, and on Titan's atmosphere,
the action of sunlight acting

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.230
on its methane atmosphere,
creates complex molecules.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.350
And in the colder polar regions,
these are actually condensing

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.020
and raining down onto the surface.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.340
So this is rainfall, but
not as we have on the Earth.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.640
Not water rainfall.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.940
This is methane rainfall.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.690
And Cassini was the first
to see these lakes and seas

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.700
on the north pole of Titan.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.040
So this, these are remarkable.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.260
These lakes and seas are about
the same size as the Great Lakes

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.760
that we have in North America.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.020
So this largest lake is
comparable in size to Lake Superior

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.820
and this is containing
billions of gallons

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.720
of hydrocarbons of
methane and ethane.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.110
So these would be like
your liquid natural gas.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.770
Just seas of this material.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.550
Cassini also discovered that Titan
has dune fields near the equator.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.420 position:56%
But again, these dune fields are
not the sand dunes that we would see

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.140
on the Earth made up
of silicate material.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.150
These are dune fields
made up of little organic,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.980
dried-up organic pieces
kind of like,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.310
almost like miniature
chips, chips of plastic.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.560
This, this would be like Titan's
atmosphere creating a smog,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.470
and organic smog somewhat similar
to the, the smogs that are created

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.490
by vehicle fumes on the Earth.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.280
We have these, you know,
famous Los Angeles smogs.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.420
And Titan's doing something
similar but in a natural way.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.420
And these little particles are
coming down on the surface.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.560
And then they're getting
blown around by the winds

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.280
and creating thousands
of miles of dune fields.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.120
Again, organic material, but this,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.470
this time not liquid,
[inaudible] solid.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.670
Titan has some small mountains.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.230
Possibly some of these
are actively volcanic.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.870
It's difficult for us to tell
because of this thick atmosphere.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.200
And of course clouds.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.630
And when the Huygens probe was
able to descend to the surface,

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.330
land on the surface, it could see

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.560
that there was dried
up rivers and seas.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.870
That showed us that
maybe these organic lakes

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.350
and seas had been more
extensive in the past.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.370
And now they had retreated
towards the polar regions.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.500
But in the past, they may have
encompassed the entire planet

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.530 position:56%
or much of the, the lower latitudes.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.390
And when these first
pictures came back,

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.540
this is actually from the surface.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.320
This, this image here is
from the surface of Titan.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.710
There's a little icy boulders
that are maybe just a few inches

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.940
or tens of inches in size.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.910
And when these first pictures
came back, the first reaction

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.910
out of the jet propulsion
laboratory was,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.440
"Have we mixed this up with Mars?

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.410
Because this looks like Mars."

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.740
But this really was
the surface of Titan.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.640
And these little boulders
are not rocks

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.160
as they would be on
the surface of Mars.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.270
But these are icy, icy boulders.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.120
You can see here the
magnificent imagery

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.840
that the Huygens probe
was able to take.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.850 position:56%
As it floated down, serenely down to
the surface over a couple of hours.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.340
Actually getting, getting,
getting lower

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.600
and lower here from 150 kilometers.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.900
You can't see anything.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.200
You're still in the haze.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.370
And then as you descend 30
kilometers, 8 kilometers,

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.440
1.5 kilometers and down
to a few hundred meters.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:04.270
You can see this magnificent vista
never seen before of this moon.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.080
Back in 1980, the Voyager
spacecraft flew by

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.380
but wasn't able to see the surface.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.220
Didn't have the right
cameras onboard.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.970
But finally we're able to see the
surface and see these mountains

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.940
and carved river channels
on the surface of Titan.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.980
So Titan is the only place other
than the Earth that you could go to

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.510
and actually have rainfall.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.950
All the, like I said,
all the other moons,

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.040
none of them really have
substantial atmospheres.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.590
Some may be active.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.910
[Inaudible] for example,
has active volcanology,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.270
but it doesn't have an atmosphere.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:46.490
So Titan's the only place that has
a cycle of evaporation, rainfall,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.340
and liquids on the surface
where you really could just go,

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.860
if you had a spacesuit,
you could go and float

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.370
around on a boat on
the surface of Titan.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.690
You could take, you could take a
voyage across one of its lakes.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.850
And you know, so who knows what
the future holds for tourism.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.930
In that respect.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.870
This is one of my favorite
images of Titan here.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.950
This was looking back
towards the sun.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.670
and this shows you for real.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.460
You can see the glint here
of the sun reflecting off one

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.190
of the, one of the lakes.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:19.560
And I like to tie this
together with another world

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.830
that we're more familiar with.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.130
Which is the Earth.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.140 position:56%
You can see that these two bodies,
like I said, are the only two places

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.110
in the solar system that actually
have liquids on the surface

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.900
in the form of lakes and seas.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.740
So Titan and the Earth are in
some ways very distant cousins.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:42.200
And the exciting thing about Titan
is because its atmosphere is,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.870
has such great similarities to
the Earth but also differences.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.120
For example, there's no oxygen.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.550
There's no life that we can see.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:53.040
But it may be similar to the
Earth several billion years ago

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.460 position:56%
when the Earth had newly formed, and
its atmosphere was really different.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.580
Before the rise of plants that
were able to breathe the oxygen

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.480
into the atmosphere
that we now have.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.830
The atmosphere of the Earth
may have been much more filled

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.800
with carbon dioxide and methane.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.510
And in fact so Titan may
be like a time machine

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.870
that we can go back a couple of
billion years to the early Earth

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.780
and see what would have been
happening in those processes.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.520
Titan things have just
happened so much more slowly

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.130
because it's so much colder.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.950
And further from the sun.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.100
So now I want to come on to Saturn.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.470
Of course this is our,
this is our main guy here

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.450
in the center of the Saturn system.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.660
Such an amazing planet.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.730
Many people's personal favorite
planet in terms of just the drama

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.090
of the, of the ring system.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:47.510
And here, it's a shame we can't
have our [inaudible] lights

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.060
down a little bit.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.160
But I hope you can see that there's
actually something going on here

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.030
on Saturn's Northern Hemisphere.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:00.660
And this was in fact a huge
storm which erupted in 2010.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.760
And Cassini was there
for a ringside,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.240
literally a ringside seat
to see this going off.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.540
And this storm erupted.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.280
And these have been seen
in the past from the Earth,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.410
but of course, much further away.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.910
And this storm erupted,

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.060
and it gradually erupted all
the way around the planet.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:23.070
We called this the Dragon Storm
because of its initial appearance.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.640
And in fact eventually due to the
winds that gusted this material

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.580
so that it wrapped all
the way around the planet.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.590
It was like the dragon's
head was eating its own tail.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.750
And this was really phenomenal.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:38.010
Cassini was able to watch this
unfold over several months.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.870
Typically these storms occur
on Saturn about every 30 years.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.430 position:56%
This one came about ten years early.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:48.210 position:56%
So Cassini was very lucky to be
there for its, for its ringside seat

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.070
to see the storm going off.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:55.770
You can see here as well the,
the sun is projecting the shadow

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.500
of the rings onto the planet.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.290
So the sun would be slightly
off to the, to the North here,

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.540
projecting through the rings
and onto the planet here.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.830
So as this storm erupted,
Cassini was able

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.210
to look using its different
cameras to look

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:11.620
into longer and longer wavelengths.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.730
You can see here, as we
see longer wavelengths,

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.820
we can see deeper into
the atmosphere.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.540
And in fact the, the
instrument that I work

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.590
on is the longer wavelength
infrared camera on Cassini.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.890
And we look at heat.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.990
And we were able to see that this
storm was glowing 100 degrees

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.100
brighter than the background
of Saturn.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:38.580
So this was a huge warm spot.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.720
And this was just throwing
off energy

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.920
that was visible to Cassini here.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.520
So Saturn's North pole has even
more remarkable stories to tell.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.390
If we, if we were able to look
right down on Saturn's North pole

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.140
as Cassini can, this
is what we would see.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.590
And you see this remarkable
ship emerging here.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.620
This was just glimpsed
by Voyager as it flew by.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.500
But Cassini was able to really
show us the first picture looking

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.140
down on Saturn's North pole.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.100
And this is what we call the
Hexagon for obvious reasons.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.720 position:56%
This is a wind jet which is
circling around Saturn's North pole.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.610
You can see here in the center.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:28.310
This is actually a hurricane eye
wall, something very topical.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:33.860
This week, with all the drama
going on in the Caribbean Sea.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.300
This hurricane on Saturn's
North pole,

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.360
this eye wall is many
times bigger than the ones

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.660
that we have on the Earth.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.150
In fact, this circular
region here would take

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.810
up about the entire
Easter United States.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.840
So this is, this is much bigger.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.400
And this entire hexagon
shape is about twice,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.470
two and a half times
the size of the Earth.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.150
So this is really huge.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.450
And, and the winds that are
going around here are the fastest

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.940
that are known in the, in
the entire solar system,

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.150
300 kilometers an hour.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.000
So really fast wind jets here.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.360
In fact, people in the Cassini
mission are still working

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.010
to unravel exactly how this
six-sided shape emerges.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.620
But what we do know is this is
a jet stream which is similar

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.990
to the jet streams
we have on the Earth.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.680
And as it, as it goes around the
pole, it wavers from side to side.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.820
Creating this six-sided structure.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.970
So let, let's take a
look at Saturn's rings.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.820
Of course, these are one of the
most dramatic features of Saturn.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.600
And here's a, a, a
primer to the rings.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.640 position:56%
You can see here the, the brightest,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.710
thickest part of the ring's
what you call the B ring.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.350
And that's sandwiched on either
side by the A and the C ring.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.870
These were named a long time
ago by early astronomers.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:02.380
There's a prominent gap
here, the Cassini Division,

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:07.200
that was discovered back
in the, the 1600s from some

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.730
of the earliest telescopes.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.950
And you can see here,
there's another gap here,

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.110
an A ring called the
[inaudible] Gap.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:17.560
And we now know that there are
in fact moons that are going

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.760
around inside the rings that
are carving out these channels.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.680
And all the way down here, you
can see the innermost D ring,

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.190
a very faint ring which
stretches almost

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.740
down to the surface
of Saturn itself.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.740
We'll talk about that
a little more later.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.510
So here's a view of the moon Pan.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:43.310
This is one of the close-up
views that we just got recently.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.650
Going around inside that,

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.310
that [inaudible] Gap
which I just showed you.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:53.370 position:56%
And so as Pan goes around, it's able
to clear the material in the rings.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.410 position:56%
And you know Cassini's cameras have
for the first time been able to show

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.460
up close up what these
moons look like.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.930
Another really fabulous view here.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.400
You can see that these rings,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.420
even though these are
almost incredibly thin,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.890
just a few tens of yards thick.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.680
Even though they're hundreds of
thousands of miles in diameter.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.410
There are places where the
material gets disrupted

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.130
by the moons that are going around.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:23.450
And throws off these clouds.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:27.090
So you can see these sort
of pillars of material.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.820 position:56%
And you can actually see the shadows

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.880
that they're throwing
onto the rings here.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.820
And these are being
thrown up for tens,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.940
tens of kilometers above the rings.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.100
And then they're casting
a shadow here.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.970
You can see from the, from the sun.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.760
So this is the outermost
edge of the main rings here.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.800 position:56%
This is the [inaudible] which I just
showed you which has the small moon,

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.430
Pan, going around in here.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.990
And then right outside the
main rings, we have this ribbon

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.800
which we call the [inaudible].

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.880 position:56%
And this ribbon is maintained
actually by a pair of moons which go

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.010
around either side, and we
call those the Shepherds.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.150
So one is going around just
inside the, the [inaudible].

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.780
And the one on the
outside you can see,

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.650 position:56%
actually this little guy right here.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:21.360 position:56%
And as they go around again, they're
able to, to cause some disruption

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.700
to the, to the [inaudible]
as they circle Saturn.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.690
So when Cassini was, was
taking movies of the rings,

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.970
we were able to see even
more structure here.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.770
You can see these,
we call these spokes

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.080
or these shadows or
spokes in the rings.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.860
They look almost like the
spokes you have on a bicycle.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:51.120
And these are dynamical
phenomena again which are caused

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.880
by [inaudible] from
the gravity of the,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.030
of the various moons going around.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.790
But there's a lot of
work still to be done

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.550
to understand exactly how
these disturbances occur.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.970
Which cause these periodic thinning
and thickening of Saturn's rings.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:14.590
So Cassini's remarkable
13-year mission is now coming

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.440
to its last few days.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.640
So let's, let's go right up to
date and look at the activities

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.760
that are planned for
the end of the mission.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.430
So during the solstice part of the
mission which was began in 2010.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.820
And it's taken us up
to the present day.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.950
This shows you the orbits which
Cassini has, has made of Saturn.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:41.320
And Saturn of course
has its, has its rings.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.930
And these are tipped over
by 27 degrees compared

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.190
to Saturn's path around the sun.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.880
so Cassini has for most
of its time remained

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.630
in this same plane as the rings.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.520
But of course if we, and that's
where the moons are, in fact.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.400
So the Saturn system is
like a giant, you know,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.970
it's like a giant saucer.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.270
And many of the moons are going

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:06.070
around in the same
plane as the rings.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.610 position:56%
So to encounter those moons, Cassini
has to go around in that direction.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.680
But to see the rings then of course
we have to change our orientation.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.600
So then we tip our orbits
to go over Saturn's poles.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.410
And then we can actually
look down and see the rings.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.960
So over the last seven
years, these are the orbits

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.250 position:56%
that Cassini has made around Saturn.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.410
You can see right in the middle
here, periodically going from the,

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:31.690
the equatorial orbits
to the polar orbits

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.400 position:56%
so that we can see different things.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.060
And changing our, changing
our path each time

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.960
to encounter many of
these distant moons.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.610
A lot of these orbits
were redesigned

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.920
after we discovered
those remarkable jets

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.680
or geysers coming out of Enceladus.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.550
So that we could go
back for another look

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.850
and another look and another look.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.950
And eventually we went by 22 times.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.150
Just to, just to keep looking

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.950
and to sample the material
in different ways.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.840
And here highlighted in yellow, you
can see these are the final orbits.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:11.440
So when we first arrived at Saturn,
we stayed well away from the rings

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.390 position:56%
because these rings are chips of ice
mostly that are circulating around.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.320
But who knows the damage they could
do to the spacecraft if we flew

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:25.600
through the rings at you
know ten miles per second.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.470
This could cause a lot of
damage to the spacecraft.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.080
But as the mission is drawing
to a close, we've really decided

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.400
to go for, go for broke and
do, do more dramatic things.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.680
So the first maneuver that
we did starting in December

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.910
of last year was to take our
innermost orbit much closer

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.530
to Saturn than we'd
ever gone before.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.110
In fact, just to graze the very
outer edges of the main rings.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.040
And in fact to go right
by this F ring,

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.980
the one that I just
showed you like a ribbon.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.760
And to take a really close look up
at the F ring and the moons there.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.030
And that took us through
to April of this year.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.370 position:56%
And then beginning in April, for
the last five months of the mission,

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.680
we decided to do something
even more dramatic.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.470
Which was to take a dive right

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:12.310
between the innermost ring
and the planet itself.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:16.740
And this is a gap just a couple
thousand kilometers wide.

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.370 position:56%
And these are what we call our
proximal orbits Cassini [inaudible].

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:25.330
And it's coming up to
its 22nd orbit right now.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.870
And these are just
six-day-long orbits.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:32.190
So you can see here again,

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:36.270
we had these what we called the
ring-grazing orbits where we went

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:42.720 position:56%
around and grazed the outside of the
F ring and went around from December

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.580
of last year through to April.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.720
And then we did an
encounter again with Titan.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.960
Titan's what we frequently
use to give us a little kick,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.900
like a little change
in our trajectory.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.560
And then to come into
these really dramatic,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.200
what we call proximal orbits,
actually diving through the gap

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.680
between the planet
and the rings itself.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.220
And originally, we were planning
to do maybe a dozen of these.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.410 position:56%
But then we thought, "Well, how many
can we squeeze out of it, right?"

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.710
We don't want this to end.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.130
So we went up to 15 and then 18

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.280
and then finally the mission
chief engineer said, "Okay,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.100
you can have 22 and that's it.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.400
That, that's really the limit."

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.010
Your, our fuel tank is, is
well into the empty zone.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.570
Where our "check fuel" light is on.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:32.600
We're down to less than
three percent of our fuel.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.360 position:56%
The margin of error is five percent.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:41.280 position:56%
So. So, we're really running on
fumes right now, but we're confident

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.670
that we can just finish,
finish the mission out.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:50.880
So you can see here in close up
just how dramatic it is diving

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.210
through this gap between
this innermost,

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.980
there's a faint D ring
here which stretches down.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.290
And then just a couple of thousand
kilometers where it empties out.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.500
And in fact, it's not even
really ever completely empty.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.160
So in fact, those innermost ring
particles, as they get closer

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.050
and closer to Saturn, and then
receive the reflected sunlight off

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.740
Saturn, they actually
begin to melt and turn

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.950
into just water vapor or mist.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:19.200
So Cassini's diving through
a cloud of mist as it goes

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.100
through this gap every time.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.600
It's really like going through
a car wash every time it goes

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.000
through this gap.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.450
And at the start we were using our
main dish antennae as a protective,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.590
almost like a bulldozer
to go in front of us

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.050
as we went through the, the rings.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.730
But as we were got more confidence
that this material's not going

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.340
to damage us, we were able
to turn the spacecraft

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:46.380 position:56%
and do different pictures which I'll
show you as we, as we went through.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.430
So here you can see
this is the surface

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.780
of Saturn here at the bottom.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.410
And then as you go outwards
you go through the rings.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:58.550
So this shows you all the
way out through the rings.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.780
These were the orbits that
started in December of 2016.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.430 position:56%
You can see each one of these little
blue dots indicating how close we

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.060
went to the outer rings.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.070
And you can see, here's
the F ring here.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:16.750
And then all the way, and
then starting in April 22nd,

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.710
we did our, our kick with Titan.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.490
And we flung Cassini
right into this gap.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.810
And you can see we
jumped right down here.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.830
So we're now right down, right
above the surface of Titan,

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.500
or of Saturn just dramatically
doing these 22 orbits here.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.710
And you can see this, this last
one here doesn't look too good

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.550
because this is a, this
is inside the atmosphere.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.910
And that's coming up
really, really soon.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:47.700
So I want to show you some of
the, some of the latest images

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.450
that we have during these last
few months of the mission.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:56.280 position:56%
Here is a tiny little moon, Daphnis,

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:01.300 position:56%
shown here for the first time making
waves as it passes through one

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:06.600
of these little narrow
tracks that it's making.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.700
You know, the [inaudible] gap
in the outer edge of the A ring.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.520
Someone had a great meme online,
if you go and look it up that says,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.040
you know, "You know,
you may be small,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.590
but you can still make waves."

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.880
And it is a really,
really great meme.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.490
You can go look it up online.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:26.220
So Daphnis doesn't care that
it's tiny compared to Saturn.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.350
It's still making itself,
its presence known.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:36.130
And here you can see February 2017

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.740
as we were doing our,
our F ring orbits.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:44.170
One of the first looks-down
on the North pole of Saturn

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.520
as it emerged finally in the
sunlight for the first time.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.740
This had been in darkness
during the start of the mission.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.040
But we were finally able
to look on in full color.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.160
You can see this hexagon shape
here which I mentioned here.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.710
This is 20,000 miles
across, and in the center,

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:08.260
we have this really remarkable,
glowing-blue hurricane system here

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:12.920
which is 1000 miles across.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.310
And one of the fascinating things
is that this, this hurricane

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.510
on Saturn's North pole has
actually changed color.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:26.830
You can see here back in June of
2013, the entire region looked,

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.520
had a bluish tinge to it.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.370
While the center was more of
a, of a greeny-orange color.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.970
And then this is reversed.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.440 position:56%
So this shows us that the action of,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.270
of sunlight is actually
changing the, the,

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.730
the particles in the atmosphere.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.820
And causing them to,
ultraviolet light

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.610
from the sun is causing
them to change color.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:53.200
Here's a look at Titan
from May of this year.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.670
One of the things that
we've been looking

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.950
for as Titan's North
pole went into summer was

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:02.410
that there'd be more
evaporation, right?

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.640
So the sunlight hits
these methane lakes

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.940
and there'd be more evaporation.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.590
We'd start to see clouds
forming and, and rain.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.560
And it took a long time.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.650
Titan kept us waiting, but
finally in May of 2017,

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.410
we were able to see these
really dramatic clouds streaking

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.620
around Saturn's North pole.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:25.150
Here you can see these lakes, these
methane-rich lakes on the surface.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.340
And these clouds, these are
methane clouds which are going

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.870
to rain methane back
down on the surface.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.150
And just when we thought that
Cassini has no more surprises,

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.600
that we'd been in orbit
for 13 years,

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.900
what is there left to discover?

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.740
We've seen the plumes of Enceladus,
we got a close look up at some

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:51.400
of these tiny innermost
ring, ring moons of Saturn.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.850
And low and behold, they
look like pieces of pasta.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:41:02.340
I mean, take your pick
tortellini or flying saucer.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:07.790
And so these moons which are
just you know ten miles across,

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.180
have this remarkable shape.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.200
In fact, they look almost like
a miniature Saturn, right?

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.270
They have their, their
own, it looks like they're,

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.560
they've got their own little
flattened ring around them.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.700
But this is, is, is stuck on.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.740
This is, it's almost like
a tutu skirt you know

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.030
that you would have that's
stuck on to these moons.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.050
And it's, it's maybe a
couple of hundred yards,

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.290
couple hundred meters
in, in thickness.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.350
So it's quite, quite
strong, quite stable.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.010
And this is a coalesced material.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.870
So it's [inaudible]
or a collected ring,

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.430
ring chips [inaudible] collected

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.710
around the equator
of these small moons.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.730
They've just all coalesced
and stuck together

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.110
and you know melted and refrozen.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.900
And formed this almost like
a solid ring around it.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.230
So nobody had predicted
this at all until,

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.220
until we were able
to take these images.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.630
So really unbelievable.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:12.770
So what I have here is a,
a little, short movie clip.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:17.580
This was taken back in April
when we did our first close dive

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.680
over the North pole of Saturn
and our first dive going right

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.590
down over Saturn and down
to the, down to the rings.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.160
And the cameras were
turned towards Saturn.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.260
So Cassini was basically taking
a, taking an image strip looking

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.810
over the North pole and
coming down and down.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.280
And then right before
we got to the rings,

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.780
we had to turn our cameras away
so that we could put our antennae

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.610
in the forward direction as
we passed through the rings

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.710
for the first time for safety.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.470
So we go almost to the
equator and then stop.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:53.060
So let me show you this,
this movie clip here.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.360
So this is Cassini flying
over the north pole of Saturn.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:04.560
You can see here, here's the,
this hurricane eye wall storm.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.120
These images are all
in black and white.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:13.430
You can see these other little
storm vortices as we passed on.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:17.600
Over the hexagon, over the outer
rim of the hexagon, and then begin

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.470
to go down across the plane.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.930
You can see here we're going over
these, these streaks through the -

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:27.180 position:56%
all the way to the hexagon are going
down over the Northern Hemisphere.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.700
And these were at the
time the closest images

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.760
that had ever been taken of Saturn.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.360
So we're going from about 40,000
miles away at the North pole

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.620
down to just about 4000 miles.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.140
As we come right down, you
can see all the structure

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.560
of Saturn's storms here.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.680
And the image track gets
narrower and narrower

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.590
as it gets on towards the bottom.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:03.290
So even more, more than nine years

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:07.350
after the mission was originally
designed to finish back in 2008,

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.520
Cassini was still giving
us first of a kind science.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:15.240
It was almost like having a
new mission all over again.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.630
So you can see here.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:33.080
So here something even more
fantastic in many ways.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.380
This is looking at the rings

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.380
from the inside looking
outwards across the rings.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.080
So this was taken on August 20th.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.890
Cassini for the first time actually
kept its cameras going all the way

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:47.970 position:56%
through as a dive between the rings.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.650
And it turned its cameras outwards,

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.540
and what you see here
is looking at the rings.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.270
And then as they go
thinner and thinner,

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:55.550
you're actually just
looking at the ring's edge

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.990
on from the inside looking out.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.060
This is a place that no spacecraft
had ever ventured before Cassini

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.360
did it.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.860
And the fact that we are able

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.740
to do this seems you
know almost miraculous.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.740
That spacecraft is still surviving,

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.600
still returning these
miraculous images.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:19.820
So just some of the amazing
facts and figures here.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:24.100
You can look up online for
Cassini's Grand Finale.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.470
So I'm, I'm almost finished.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.920
I want to just show you
a couple of fun cartoons.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.680
And I'm going to finish
with a short video sequence,

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.950
and then I'll take your questions.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.810
So many people have been really
motivated by the Cassini mission.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:46.080
In fact, if you go online and
look on, on, on the web and look

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.380
on Facebook and Twitter

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.600
and all these social media
[inaudible] you'll see some

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.900
of the imagery.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.300
People have done their own artwork.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.820
They've done cartoons,
and this is one

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.390
of the fun cartoons
that came up online.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.770
So Saturn's saying, "Hey, Cassini,

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.810
I hear you're retiring
in September 2017.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:06.670

want to celebrate?

my moons or something?"

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:15.600

just go barreling straight

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.130

learning as much as I'm,

That's awesome.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:49.000
So you know, no, no
retirement for Cassini.

He's going to keep working
right up to the end.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.350

one of the branches

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.440
So Saturn really is,
is all atmosphere.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.560
It doesn't have a surface the way
what we call the inner planets

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.790
like Venus and Earth
and Mars have a surface.

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:45.800
So the atmosphere,
it's like Jupiter.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.120
It's a big ball of gas
unless you go deeper

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.620
and deeper into the atmosphere.

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.240
The gas would eventually
turn into a liquid.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.320
And then right in the
center we believe that it's,

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.880
it's got some weird state of
hydrogen where it's like a metal,

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.840
and then there's probably
some rock in the very center.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.260
But this storm, it, it,
it comes from deep within.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.470
We don't know the mechanism
right now that's creating it.

But like I said, every 30 years

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.870
or so there's enough energy
that gets stored inside.

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.190
One of the theories
is that it's energy

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:19.780
that is trapped by water clouds.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.220

energy gets stored inside

until eventually it erupts.

the energy inside.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.440
And then it erupts and
creates this giant storm.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.910
Then it all begins again.

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:35.440
The clouds, the deep
water clouds reform,

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.600 position:56%
and they trap the heat inside again.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.510
Yes?

00:52:40.510 --> 00:53:17.680
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.020
Okay, so the question
was about the [inaudible]

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:23.460
and there's two parts
to the question.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:28.060
And Cassini's a plutonium
radioactively-powered spacecraft.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:32.140
Do we have enough plutonium being
produced for future missions?

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.570
And the second part
was how do we feel

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:37.280
about the plutonium being
deposited into Saturn.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.150
So you know, for the first
part of the question,

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:42.450
traditionally NASA spacecraft

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.400
into the outer solar system
have all been nuclear powered.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.460
The Voyager spacecraft,
nuclear powered.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.430
Both Galileo mission
to Jupiter in the '90s

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.160
and Cassini were nuclear powered.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.720
So they have a few tens
of kilograms of plutonium

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.020
which are generating heat.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.320
And this generates electricity.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:07.640
As far as future missions goes,
right now there's a debate

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.630
about how much do we
need, plutonium?

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:14.710 position:56%
And one of the things is [inaudible]
improvements in solar technology.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.530
It's [inaudible] for
some of the applications

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:21.160
that we've formerly used plutonium
we're now ambitious enough to think

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.500
that we can use solar power.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.440
So in fact the next mission
that's going back to Jupiter,

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.320
the [inaudible] is actually
designed to use solar panels.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.830
Very, very large and highly
efficient new generation solar

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:35.530
panels instead of plutonium.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.230
But for other applications,
we still need plutonium.

00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:39.930
So in fact the Rover, which is

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:43.010
on Mars right now there's
this Rover Curiosity,

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.480
originally called the Mars Science
Laboratory which is about the size

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.910
of a small car that's
trucking around on the surface

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:50.570
of Gale Crater trucking
up a mountain.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:52.390
That is nuclear powered,

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.530
and you couldn't imagine
having big enough solar panels

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.210 position:56%
that would do that, do that mission.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:59.910
The previous smaller
Rovers, of course,

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.640
Spirit and Opportunity
were solar powered.

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:05.160
But for missions, for
example, some of the missions

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.180
that have been proposed have been,
"Let's actually go float a boat

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.170
on the surface of one
of these Titan lakes."

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:13.580
Now at that level, you're
so far down in the clouds

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.150
that you're not going to
get enough solar energy.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:19.960
Especially not with a small object
that can't deploy big solar panels.

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.640 position:56%
There's even been ideas, in fact
there's a mission just been proposed

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.800
to NASA for one of its
recent competitions

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.800
that would fly a helicopter on
Titan, actually a quadcopter

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.710
that would be again, about
the size of a small car

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:33.060
and this is nuclear powered.

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:37.390
So we do need the plutonium
for those missions.

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:45.840
As far as Cassini's plutonium going
into Saturn, you know, Saturn is,

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:51.610
you know, it's 80 times the,
the, the mass of the Earth.

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:54.600
The plutonium and radioactive
elements that are

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.210
on the Earth are just a
small part of the Earth.

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.980
So this is just going to be you
know a few atoms amongst trillions

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.420
and trillions of atoms.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:06.210
It's not going to make any
difference to Saturn itself.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:07.510
Yeah. Okay.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.510
Yeah, at the back of the room?

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:17.850
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:21.320
Right, so the question was
any fear that the boats

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:25.520
or other missions we propose would
contaminate with organic material?

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.690
So in fact, NASA has someone down
in NASA headquarters really close

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.180
to here on the south side

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.540
of the mall whose job is
called Planetary Protection.

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.020
And it's not just protecting
the Earth from asteroids.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:41.060
It's actually protecting
the other planets from us.

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:48.150
And missions now that go, go out
to Mars and to the other planets,

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:52.110
our whole view has changed compared
to what we were doing in the 1970s.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:55.550
Instead of just sending things
out there, we're now very rigorous

00:56:55.550 --> 00:57:00.540
about not wanting to, not send
little gift packages from the Earth

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:04.100
of microbes or bacteria which
then might colonize another

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.590
pristine environment.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:08.030
And then we wouldn't find
out what we're trying to find

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:10.920
out which is has life
evolved there itself?

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.220
Is it different from the Earth?

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.560
You know, if we go there and
find a bunch of Earth microbes,

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.540
that's not going to be helpful.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:19.440
In fact, that's the reason why
the Cassini mission is plunging

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.740
into Saturn.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.830
It's to protect some of
the moons from anything

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:25.720
that might still be
remaining on Cassini,

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.070
any microbes that might still have
somehow miraculously survived this

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:30.760
20-year mission.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:34.640
We don't want to have Cassini
crash into Enceladus or Titan

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.260
where there might be, there
might be something going on.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.170
And future missions, we're going
to take [inaudible] protections.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:43.150
So those missions that have been
proposed, there was a boat proposed

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:44.450
for Titan a few years ago.

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:46.560
The quadcopter, as I
mentioned, those will have

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.230
to undergo a very rigorous
[inaudible] protection.

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:52.310 position:56%
There's also a study underway right
now for a, a mission that might land

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.890
on Europa, which is
one of Jupiter's moons.

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:58.710
Which also almost certainly
has an ocean inside.

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:01.620
And that would land, maybe
drill, take some ice cores.

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:07.590 position:56%
And that's going to have very, very
rigorous planetary protection on it.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:09.390
Yes?

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:20.350
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:22.280
Yeah, I wish I could
- so the question was,

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.230
is the yellow color
of Titan for real?

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:27.350
And I wish I could have spent
more time talking about Titan's,

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:29.700
it's actually my favorite
object in the solar system.

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.040
It's what I do most
of my own research on.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.230
Because it's, it's, it appears
just like this orange ball.

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:40.670 position:56%
In fact, if you were to look through
a telescope from, from the Earth.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:42.800
If you had a decent
size backyard telescope,

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.370 position:56%
maybe a 12-inch telescope, you could
actually see this little orange dot

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:47.790
right beside Saturn.

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.590
And, so it is orange.

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:50.890
It's really orange.

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:55.910
In fact, this is what
really confounded scientists

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.210
for literally centuries.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.360
So when Titan was first discovered,
it was called Titan for a reason.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.950
And it's because it was
thought to be the biggest moon.

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:04.510
And it turns out it was
playing tricks on us.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.810
It's not the biggest moon.

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:08.900
It's because it's got a big,
puffed-up atmosphere which is -

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:13.380
it actually stretches about 1000
kilometers away from the surface.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.460
Because it's got a low gravity, the
atmosphere can, can stretch out.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:20.530
But the, the orange cloud
layers that we see are two

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.980
or three hundred miles
above the actual surface.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.880
So when scientists measured the
size of this dot, they got it wrong

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.330
because they weren't
seeing the surface.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.540
And it wasn't until the Voyager
spacecraft went by in 1980.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:34.120
It used its radio dish to send
back a signal to the Earth.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.200
And as we watched for when that
signal got blocked by the surface,

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.720
we were finally able to
determine the true size of Titan.

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.920
And it's just slightly smaller
than one of Jupiter's moons,

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.180
Ganymede, by about 70 kilometers.

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:48.960 position:56%
But it's really close to - you know,
and that's why it's called Titan.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:55.220
But the, the orange color is
produced by the action of sunlight

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.110
on its atmosphere which is methane.

00:59:57.110 --> 01:00:01.170
And as the sunlight strikes
the methane, it breaks up the,

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:03.540
the molecule which is
carbon and hydrogen,

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.990
and is reassembles it into chains.

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:07.580
And these chains form
these smog materials.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.220
And the smog is the orange
material that we see.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.270
There's a little bit of
nitrogen mixed in there as well.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:15.860
So actually the atmosphere
would be pretty poisonous.

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.090
It's got a lot of carbon,
nitrogen molecules

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.400
in there which we call cyanides.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.860
And those are not healthy
things to be ingesting.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:27.920
So you've got a, you've got a
waft of, of [inaudible] probably

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.160
if you were down on
the surface of Titan.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.250
So it, the orange smog is
the, is the atmosphere.

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.510
And it really is an
orange color, yeah.

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:56.290
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:57.590
That's a really great question.

01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:00.690
So the question is isn't Enceladus
the only moon that's shooting

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.580
geysers out into space?

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:05.590
Also are they only shooting
out of these four cracks?

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:11.690
So back in 1989 when
Voyager II flew by Neptune,

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:16.710
it was able to see some geysers
on one of Neptune's moons, Triton.

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:23.220
These are much smaller in size than
what's going on with Enceladus.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.430
But we were able to see
some, some vents on Triton.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.850
More recently there's been
a lot of attention focused

01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:32.280
on Europa, moon of Jupiter.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.330
And even though we had a
spacecraft there in the '90s

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.310
and early 2000s called Galileo,

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:41.290
the spacecraft had some technical
problems, and it wasn't able to get

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:44.050
as much data back as
we'd originally hoped.

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:45.980
The environment around
Jupiter's actually very,

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.950
very harsh radiation environment.

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:52.990
It really, it really just chewed
up that spacecraft really quickly.

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:56.870 position:56%
But since then in the last couple of
years, there's been some indications

01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:01.360
that there may be similar plumes
coming from, from Europa actually.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.390
Which is a similar
moon to, to Enceladus.

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:08.600
Although it's about
seven times wider.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.780
Right now those observations viewed

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:14.320
with the Hubble Telescope
really tenuous.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.780
You know, we're just seeing
maybe, just a hint of something.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.080
So we're really not sure.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.870 position:56%
There's actually a lot of telescopes
observing Europa right now to try

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:24.980
and find out if there's, if we can
get a better detection of that.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.680
But Enceladus is really unique
in the sense that it is small,

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.260
and it's got these
really dramatic jets

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.360
which we can just see every
time we fly by Enceladus.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.660
We can see these jets.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.960
They appear to be coming
predominantly

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.260
out of these four cracks.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.430
But the curious thing is
that there's other cracks

01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:44.290
around Enceladus in other parts
that are not active today.

01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.420
So what we think is
that maybe in the past,

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.020
the moon just kind of flipped over.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.970
So maybe the south pole was,
you know is now the equator,

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.700
and the equator's now
the south pole.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.570
So there were cracks
before that were active.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:58.050
But then as the moon has turned on
its side, it's created new cracks.

01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.190
And the old ones have,
have closed up.

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:01.620
So we can see cracks
all over the surface

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.320
that may have been
active in the past.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.810
But right now it's the ones on
the south pole that appear to be

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:08.110
where all the energy
is concentrated.

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:11.930
Okay, question here?

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:27.100
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.400
Another good question.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.700 position:56%
The question is what have we learned

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.910
about the formation
of Saturn's rings?

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:37.490
So Saturn you know originally we
thought Saturn was the only one

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:39.700
of the four planets that had
rings because they're so dramatic

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.160
and so obvious from Earth.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.680
Like I said, you can look
with a backyard telescope

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.310
and you can see Saturn's rings.

01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:46.600
And it's a wonderful thing to do.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.430
But as the voyager
spacecraft went out,

01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:50.780
they found that actually
Jupiter, Uranus,

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.750
and Neptune all have
very, very faint rings.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:55.050
But their rings are different.

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:56.350
Their rings are, are dark material.

01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:57.650
They're like dust rings.

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:00.430
Where Saturn's rings are
bright, icy, and they're big.

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:02.570
So there's several theories.

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:06.650
It appears that Saturn's
rings are young.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:10.350
And that's why they're still there
because they're not really stable.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:11.790
Over many hundreds
of millions of years,

01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:14.370
they would eventually
either evaporate.

01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:17.580
Or they would spiral inwards to
the planet and they would go away.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:22.130
It may be that Jupiter, the rings
that we see of Jupiter and Neptune

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:25.150
and Uranus, those faint,
dusty rings leftover.

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:28.400
Those may be kind of remnants
of rings that were more big

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.180
and bright and icy in the past.

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:35.580
That have just left kind
of a faint trace now.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.240 position:56%
There's theories that maybe Saturn's
rings were created fairly recently

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.060
by the, by the breakup
of a satellite.

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.970
So it may be that there were,

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:44.470
there were more satellites
than we see today.

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:46.950
And two of them, you know,
they banged into each other.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:51.330
Broke up, and just stretched this
debris ring which has been stable

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:54.320
for maybe tens of millions of years
or hundreds of millions of years.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.370
But probably not going all
the way back billions of years

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.670
to the start of the solar system.

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.640
So it may be a transient phenomenon

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.740
that we're just seeing
this ring now.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:07.020 position:56%
And if we were around in another,
you know, few hundred million years,

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.320
you know, they wouldn't be there.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.990
So, so that's, that's
one of the theories.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:14.900
But one of the, one of the many
scientific things Cassini's doing

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.010 position:56%
right now, this dive between the
[inaudible] rings is not just purely

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.350
to get some great pictures.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:22.290
Actually, we can measure
the deflection

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:23.770
of the spacecraft by the gravity.

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:27.390
Not only the planet's but by the
gravity of the ring material.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:30.360
So we can use that to
actually weigh the rings.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:34.090
And get a better estimate of how
much mass of material's in there.

01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:37.490 position:56%
And that's going to give us a better
estimate as to how young they are.

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:42.340 position:56%
So that, that's, that's just going
on right now, you know, as we speak.

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.640
Exciting.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.080
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Do
you have any idea what time

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.450
of day the demise is going to be?

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:51.590
&gt;&gt; Conor Nixon: Yes, thank
you for reminding me of that.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:56.740
So next Friday, it will be
just before 8 a.m. I believe

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.040
on the East Coast.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.920
It will be just before 5
a.m. out in California,

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.490
where I'll be out at the
jet propulsion laboratory.

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:07.540
The signal from Cassini takes about
83 minutes to get back at the speed

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.120
of light back to the Earth.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.960 position:56%
So the times that we're recording is
the time the signal is at the Earth.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.930
.The spacecraft, when the
signal stops on the Earth,

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:19.630
the spacecraft will have
died 83 minutes earlier.

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:22.650
So what Cassini's going to
do is it's going to keep its,

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:26.610
its main antennae pointed to the
Earth for as long as possible.

01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:28.650
And you saw like right at the
end there when it's fighting

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:31.300
with the thrusters to try and
keep its altitude control,

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.040
it's going to try to keep its
antennae pointed to the Earth.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.340
As long as possible.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.340
Eventually the atmosphere is going
to be dense enough that it's going

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.640
to cause the spacecraft to tumble.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.130
And then it will lose
altitude control.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.680 position:56%
That's when the signal will be lost.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.620
And then a few tens of seconds
after that, it's just going to be

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.730
like a meteorite or a meteor.

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.710
It's just going to - pieces
are going to start flying off.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.010
And it's going to,
it's going to burn

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:52.300
up 30,000 miles an hour
in Saturn's atmosphere.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: You'll
probably have to have a wake, right?

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.390
&gt;&gt; Conor Nixon: We have
several events planned, yeah.

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:58.800
For next, next Friday, yeah.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.510
Everybody's going to be getting
up really early in California.

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:05.450
They'll go down to - California's
[inaudible] Technology's hosting a

01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:07.790
big event for about 4000 people.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.510
Everybody's who's ever worked on
the mission's going to show up.

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:14.220
[ Inaudible ]

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.520
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Well,

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.820
I guess we should end
and get out of the room.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.120
[Applause]

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.420
&gt;&gt; Conor Nixon: Yes.

of the Library of Congress.
