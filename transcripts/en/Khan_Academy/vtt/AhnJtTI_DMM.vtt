00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.730
- [Instructor] Let's
find the limit of f of x

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.670
times h of x as x approaches zero.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.640
All right, we have graphical depictions

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.800
of the graphs y equals f
of x and y equals h of x.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.303
And we know, from our limit properties,

00:00:14.303 --> 00:00:17.917
that this is going to be
the same thing as the limit

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.960
as x approaches zero of f of x

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.880
times,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.770
times the limit

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.330
as x approaches zero of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.180
h of x.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.040
And let's think about
what each of these are.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.460
So let's first think about
f of x right over here.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.870
So on f of x, as x approaches zero,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.700
notice the function itself
isn't defined there.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.920
But we see when we approach from the left,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.770
we are approaching the,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.730
the function seems to
be approaching the value

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.740
of negative one right over here.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.480
And as we approach from the
right, the function seems

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.950
to be approaching the
value of negative one.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.210
So the limit here,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.510
this limit here is negative one.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.343
As we approach from the left,

00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:04.310
we're approaching negative one.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.160
As we approach from the right,
the value of the function

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.400
seems to be approaching negative one.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.210
Now what about h of x?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.340
Well, h of x we have down here.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.910
As x approaches zero,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.070
as x approaches zero,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.660
the function is defined at x equals zero.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.423
It looks like it is equal to one.

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:25.190
And the limit is also equal to one.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.710
We can see that, as we
approach it from the left,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.250
we are approaching one.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.570
As we approach from the
right, we're approaching one.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.990
As we approach x equals zero
from the left, we approach,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.340
the function approaches one.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.500
As we approach x equals
zero from the right,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800
the function itself is approaching one.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.830
And it makes sense that the
function is defined there,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.500
is defined at x equals zero,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.280
and the limit as x approaches zero

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130
is equal to the same as the,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.800
is equal to the value of
the function at that point

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.240
because this is a continuous function.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.960
So this is,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.980
this is one.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.890
And so negative one times one

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.370
is going to be equal to,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.770
is equal to negative one.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.460
So that is equal to negative one.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.453
Let's do one more.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.460
All right, so these are both,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.070
looks like continuous functions.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.410
So we have the limit as x
approaches zero of h of x

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.940
over g of x.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.590
So once again, using our limit properties,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.310
this is going to be the same
thing as the limit of h of x

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.890
as x approaches zero

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.290
over the limit

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.020
of g of x

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.710
as x approaches zero.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.690
Now what's the limit of h
of x as x approaches zero?

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.040
This is, let's see,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.960
as we approach zero from the left,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.830
as we approach x equals
zero from the left,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.680
our function seems to be approaching four.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.740
And as we approach x
equals zero from the right,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.300
our function seems to be approaching four.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.190
That's also what the value

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.840
of the function is at x equals zero.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.550
That makes sense because this
is a continuous function.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.270
So the limit as we approach x
equals zero should be the same

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.040
as the value of the
function at x equals zero.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.630
So this top, this is going to be four.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.220
Now let's think about the
limit of g of x as x equals,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.170
as x approaches zero.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.350
So from the left, it looks
like, as x approaches zero,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.480
the value of the function
is approaching zero.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.800
And as x approaches zero from the right,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.250
the value of the function
is also approaching zero,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.970
which happens to also be,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.560
which also happens to be g of zero.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.840
G of zero is also zero.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.800
And that makes sense that the
limit and the actual value

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.550
of the function at that point is the same

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.070
because it's continuous.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.600
So this also is zero,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.150
but now we're in a strange situation.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.560
We have to take four
and divide it by zero.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.640
So this limit will not exist

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.190
'cause we can't take four
and divide it by zero.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.400
So even though the limit
of h of x is x equals,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.670
as x approaches zero exists

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.180
and the limit of g of x as
x approaches zero exists,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.490
we can't divide four by zero,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.563
so this whole entire limit does not exist,

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:55.050
does not exist.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.790
And actually, if you were
to plot h of x over g of x,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.100
if you were to plot that graph,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.500
you would see it even clearer

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.200
that that limit does not exist.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.650
You would actually be able
to see it graphically.
