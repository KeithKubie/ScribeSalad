00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.220
Hey,

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.820
It's time for the Monday morning podcasts from Monday,
June 10,

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.460
2019 what's going on out?
Why?
Yeah,

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.983
June

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.620
<v 1>tenths.
Uh,

happy birthday to me.</v>

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.320
Happy Birthday to me.

7
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:25.321
Happy 51st birthday dear pace.

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.810
<v 2>The</v>

9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.020
<v 0>happy birthday to me.
Um,
all right.</v>

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.680
Before I get on with my,
uh,
birthday stuff,
uh,
real quick,

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.770
very relieved as I'm sure most people are.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.490
Why wouldn't you be that David Ortiz is going to be okay.
Looks like.

13
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:47.520
And they said there was no collateral damage,
meaning no damage to his organs,

14
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.810
which is also great.
Um,
thank God.

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.490
Thank God I got the,
I was fortunate enough to meet him one time I did a roast.

16
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.220
I'm with Josh Wolfe and all those guys a couple of years ago and uh,

17
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.900
he could not have been,
he was,
he was just such a nice guy and you know,

18
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
and love the more you trashed in the morning.
He loved,
it was such a fun night.

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.050
And
um,

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.870
who the hell shoots David Ortiz?
You know,
let's live it.

21
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:19.360
It's like shooting Santa Claus.

22
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.400
I don't understand why somebody would do that.

23
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.580
Um,
I saw a video,
it seems like,
uh,

24
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.950
other people in the immediate vicinity agreed and,

25
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.100
uh,
did to him.
What would have happened if you shot Santa Claus?

26
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.920
Was she got the shit kicked out of them?
Um,

27
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.520
<v 3>yeah.</v>

28
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.250
<v 0>What a world of all the fucking people.</v>

29
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:44.990
I just don't even understand it and didn't even seem like it was a robbery.

30
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.270
It was just trying to kill him.

31
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.890
Is there one of those lunatics like that guy who tried to shoot Reagan just so

32
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:56.330
you can get famous?
I don't get it,
but fortunately he's going to be okay.

33
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.980
And uh,
all of that stuff.

34
00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:01.780
So good for that.

35
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.840
And a shout outs to a Aaron and Fred at Rivington music studios.

36
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.880
Thank you guys for,
uh,
you know,
they've been hooking me up here.

37
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.310
I've been playing drums over there when I can,
while I'm in town.

38
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:13.780
Keep my chops up.
You know,

39
00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:18.781
I have to for all the gigs I don't have and a,

40
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:23.170
and what dad and with debt.
It's freckles birthday.
And,

41
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.820
uh,
I got a nice birthday gift early last night when the Bruins came out,

42
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.360
took it to the blues and won game six and an incredible atmosphere in St Louis.

43
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.710
I mean,
they pulled out all the stops as you knew they would.

44
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:43.410
They had Brett Hall who was hilarious and I don't understand people like sorta

45
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.320
teasing them with his enthusiasm and just immediately thinking that he was

46
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:50.710
absolutely shit faced.
That guy was always outspoken.

47
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:54.970
He was always hilarious and he was,
he's not introverted.

48
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:57.760
I'm not saying he didn't have a couple,
two or three,
but who cares.

49
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:01.600
He was having a great time,
like voice cracked.
I smoked a cigar last night.

50
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.840
I was having a great time.
Um,

51
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.190
and yeah,
those fans were on the edge of their seats.

52
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:14.140
They wanted the cup and the Bruins had their backs to the wall and uh,

53
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.700
figured out a way to beat him.

54
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.780
And now it is game seven on Wednesday.

55
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.830
So you know,
who's going to win?
Who the hell knows?

56
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.310
All I know is we made some adjustments to what they were doing.

57
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.450
So you learn more in a loss than you do in a victory.

58
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:35.080
So Berbee is going to make his adjustments and we'll see.

59
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.870
We'll see what happens on Wednesday.

60
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.350
I was so frigging nervous during that game where I,

61
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.030
uh,
you know,
even when we went up a couple of goals,
I always knew the blues here.

62
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.460
So we seem to have this ability to,
after you score a goal,

63
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.680
they come right back down and they score it just really just,

64
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.360
it just takes the momentum out of what you did.
And I literally said to my buddy,

65
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:00.670
I was watching the game,
it was like,
we need a garbage golf.

66
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.810
We just need a garbage goal.
And we got one fucking knuckle ball that was,

67
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.910
came in like Phil Negro through it.
Um,

68
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.240
uh,
yeah,
that was a garbage goal.
But,
um,
other than that,

69
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.880
it was a nice solid victory for us.
But,
um,

70
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.200
this series has been too back and forth to feel comfortable on either side.

71
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.660
Um,
but there's going to be a game seven Stanley Cup final in,

72
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.390
in a,
in Boston on Wednesday,

73
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:36.310
and the Stanley Cup is coming to the garden and somebody going home with it.

74
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.300
I oversee hope that it's going to be us.
Um,

75
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.720
you know,
either way,
if you're not a hockey,
you know,
if you,

76
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.820
this is a great game to tune into game seven.

77
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:48.070
Stanley Cup final doesn't get any fucking better than this.

78
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.430
The poor blues fans had been waiting for 51 52 years longer than this old

79
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:58.530
fucking former redheads.
Well,
I guess I'm still always going to be a right hand.

80
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.860
Uh,
is still alive.
Was,
has been alive,
sorry.
And,
um,

81
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.130
which,
right.
And when our second cup of the decade,
um,
so we shall see.

82
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.610
It was a,
what a game.
I S I was so fucking nervous.
I was,

83
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.090
you know,
we scored the first goal I was watching in a bar,
you know,

84
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:22.150
I'm not drinking now,
so I'm just drinking waters in a,
I bought a cigar.

85
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:25.840
So we smoked in between the first and second period,
put it out,

86
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.860
you know,
watched the second period,
re-lit it back up,

87
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.650
put it out and then went in for the third period.
And I,

88
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:36.430
but I spent most of the game outside the bar pacing.

89
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.100
Watching was never comfortable I think until we got the fourth goal was when I,

90
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.130
when I finally felt like I could relax a little bit and for whatever reason I

91
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:51.970
remember there was like seven minutes left for like 20 minutes it felt.
And um,

92
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.670
um,

93
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.390
at one point I remember looking in the bar looking at a different TV and I saw

94
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.670
Bryan Cranston and I was like,
the hell is Brian Cranston doing it?

95
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.800
The Stanley Cup final.
I didn't know he was a blues fan.

96
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.670
It looks all happy and he was wearing a bow tie,
really dressed up for the game.

97
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.410
I didn't realize they had the Tony Awards,
another TV.

98
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.460
And I got to see Bryan Cranston when to Tony.
So congratulations to him.

99
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.710
Um,
and how's the thought?
It was hilarious that they had the Tony Awards on in a,

100
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.650
in a sports bar.
You know what I mean?
Who said that?
You know,

101
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.420
a big dumb sports bar can't be progressive.
We had on the Tonys.

102
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.170
Um,
and yeah,
that was it.
And then we,
oh my God,
we somehow,

103
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.120
yeah.
Somehow went into their building and got a victory,
which we needed to.
So,

104
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.650
uh,
but they,
they're,
they're a tough team.
They are a tough team to beat.

105
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.930
So somehow we're going to try to be him two times in a row.

106
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.990
I have no idea what is going to happen on Wednesday,

107
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:59.870
but,
um,
this has been a hell of a final.
Um,

108
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.490
and I gotta tell you,
man,
like,
just hockey's the best fucking sport period.

109
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.030
That's it.
You know,
it's just,
there's nothing,

110
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.140
there's nothing like playoff hockey.
It's just,
it's the fucking best.

111
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:16.130
I would say a close second match madness.
Um,

112
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.200
just as far as like the adrenaline excitement level,
just not letting up.

113
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.920
But,
um,
somebody asked me,
said,
Oh,
you're from Boston,

114
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.500
see like all the Boston teams.
I was like,
yeah.
So he goes,
well,

115
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.990
who's your favorite growing up?
And I was thinking about,
I was going,
yeah,

116
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.560
I guess it was the Bruins.
It was always,
it was always hockey,
football.

117
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.990
Um,
and then basketball and baseball were tied,
I think,

118
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.130
not tied in a bad way.
They just,
you know,

119
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.290
I hated the Yankees and I hated the Lakers equally.
So I watched,
you know,

120
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:49.190
this is the one great thing.

121
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:54.191
I think the why Boston has such crazy sports fans is because when I was growing

122
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:58.970
up,
other than the Celtics,
we never won.
And not only did we not win,

123
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:00.830
but our biggest rivalries,

124
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.070
rivals always seem to be the most successful people,

125
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.580
you know,
franchises in the sport.

126
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:12.230
And we were always like the Washington generals,
like,
you know,

127
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.260
the Yankees had won a Zillion fucking world series and we hadn't won in forever.

128
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.310
And the,
our biggest rivalry rivalry with was with the fucking Yankees,

129
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:25.640
which was hilarious.
And it was a ridiculous rivalry to say it's a rivalry.

130
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:30.170
We've just,
whether we would have fucking punching bag for like fucking 80 years.

131
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.293
Um,

132
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.930
and then in hockey we could just knew we can never win in Montreal forum.

133
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:40.070
We would like regular season or play off.

134
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:43.580
We didn't win a game in their fucking building for like two decades.

135
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.920
It was crazy.
I'm on one time.

136
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:49.940
We had them beat and they scored in a regular season game and they like tied it

137
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:54.210
up with like two seconds to go in the game.
Back then they didn't have overtime,

138
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.530
just like ended a tie.

139
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.740
So Montreal had a zillion cops and we had like five and we hadn't won in

140
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:01.674
forever.

141
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.963
<v 4>MMM.</v>

142
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.610
<v 0>And then the Celtics,
our biggest rivals with the Lakers and a,</v>

143
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.920
we own them right up until 84.

144
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.320
But since then,
uh,
you know,
they,

145
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.980
they beat us in 85,

146
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.510
87 in 2009 and we beat him in 2008.

147
00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:25.840
So they,
they turn the tide,
they won a bunch of titles and all of that Shit.

148
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.750
So it's just that level of,
uh,

149
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.573
<v 4>you know,</v>

150
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.960
<v 0>you just hate him.
It's like if you live in Colorado,
Detroit,</v>

151
00:09:34.961 --> 00:09:37.360
how much the avalanche and the Redwings hated each other.

152
00:09:37.361 --> 00:09:41.500
We had that in all four sports and the Patriots,
it was the fucking dolphins.

153
00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:42.400
Believe it or not,

154
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.630
I don't even know if the Miami Dolphin fans even realize that those fucking

155
00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:50.200
constant went from Bob Greasy couple of years.

156
00:09:50.201 --> 00:09:52.330
They had day a David Woodley and don Strock,

157
00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:57.040
but then he went right to Dan Marino and they just beat her fucking ass from

158
00:09:57.041 --> 00:10:00.970
like the 70s,
all the seventies,
all of the 80s.

159
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.220
And,
and then all of a sudden Jim Kelly and the bills came along.

160
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.570
And,
uh,
I dunno,
I was just,
I was just looking and we just had,

161
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.203
I dunno,

162
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.780
we did get to a Superbowl in [inaudible] 86 but then got the living shit kicked

163
00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:19.180
out of us cause we finally beat the dolphins in the orange bowl.

164
00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:20.830
That was nothing.
We could never went in the orange bowl.

165
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.720
We can never been in the Montreal forum.
We could,

166
00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.000
we could never went in Yankee stadium.
Like just,

167
00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:27.790
we had these fucking places and would just tortured.

168
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.100
And I think that that's why you have this.

169
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.110
I don't know why it's just such a great,
uh,
you need the rivalries.
I think,

170
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.800
you know,
I think that's why Pittsburgh's a great town sports town.

171
00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:41.500
Like that Patrick Division,
they fucking hated each other.
I don't know.

172
00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:44.740
I'm babbling because I'm so excited that we're,

173
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.510
we still have a chance to win this fucking thing.
Um,
so anyway,

174
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.730
uh,
moving on,
moving on here.
Um,

175
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.340
I didn't get to see the Formula One,

176
00:10:57.341 --> 00:11:01.480
but I saw the highlight and Sebastian fettle had the fucking race one.

177
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.120
Lewis Hamilton was right on his ass,
of course.

178
00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:07.360
And I dunno what happened if he fucked up a what looked like he fucked up.

179
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.250
He missed this turn and he had to go into the grass,
which is fine.

180
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.530
<v 4>MMM.</v>

181
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.910
<v 0>But when he got back on the track,</v>

182
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:20.410
Lewis was trying to pass them on the right and that'll defended,

183
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.130
or he said he didn't have any grip cause he had grass on his tires,

184
00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:29.070
but they gave them a time penalty.
So even though he came,
he came in first,

185
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.290
they took the race away from him.
And,
uh,

186
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.220
which as a race fan socks,
I understand the call I guess,

187
00:11:36.221 --> 00:11:40.660
but it sucks because it would have been nice to see Ferrari when one and make

188
00:11:40.661 --> 00:11:43.960
this a little more competitive instead of given the golden boy there,

189
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.110
Louis Hamilton,
another fucking 25 points.

190
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.140
I just hope he doesn't pull away and it's like over by July.

191
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:54.790
I,
you know,
that's been a frustrating thing to see.

192
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:59.350
You want to see a nice fucking back and forth or at the very least between,

193
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.130
you know,
the two teammates there,
um,

194
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.340
both to us in Hamilton.
I don't know.
So,
uh,

195
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.150
anyway,
I'm walking around,
I'm doing this movie.

196
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:11.710
I've been having such a great time.

197
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.463
<v 5>MMM.</v>

198
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.180
<v 0>And you know,
I,</v>

199
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.650
the firemen mustache looks good when I'm being the guy that I'm being,

200
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:20.760
but I swear to God,

201
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.830
this is hilarious too because it's gay pride week when I just walk around New

202
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.380
York,
I look like I just looked like an old queen that never found love,

203
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.360
you know,
and it was,
uh,
it was pride week.
I,
you know,

204
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:43.020
I thought I'd be getting some more looks,
you know,
I'm a vain son of a bitch.

205
00:12:43.021 --> 00:12:44.070
I'm a little disappointed.

206
00:12:44.071 --> 00:12:46.540
The fellows work checking me out the way I thought they would go.

207
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.360
It's like I'm in movie shape right now.

208
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.400
I got a big red village people mustache,
like come on,
you know,

209
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.430
give me a little fucking ego boost here.
You know,
I was walking down,

210
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.500
was down going to do with spot over and Caroline's right.
And there was just,

211
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.060
you know,
it was it pride week?
Is that what it is?
I don't,
I don't know.

212
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:10.860
I'm always out of the loop with all that social shit.
But I knew it was,
it was,

213
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.060
it was gay pride week whenever the fucker was and say everybody's,
you know,

214
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.933
doing that thing.

215
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.520
And there was one guy just standing there and he wrote us,

216
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.470
he had this big fucking sign and then he wrote in small letters.

217
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.840
It was funny,
like he didn't use the whole canvas.

218
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.570
He just wrote God hates LGBT behavior

219
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.990
just standing there by himself.
Um,

220
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.690
as fucking hilarious.
That's fucking hilarious.
Just sitting there with this side,

221
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.333
like,

222
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.603
<v 5>you know,</v>

223
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.480
<v 0>I'm a fucking curmudgeon in as much this,</v>

224
00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:57.790
a lot of shit out there that really bothers me,
but to,

225
00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:00.310
to put in the fucking effort to make a sign,

226
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.470
<v 5>you know,</v>

227
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.050
<v 0>by myself.
And then you just stand there.</v>

228
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.523
<v 5>You know?</v>

229
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:09.581
<v 0>Like,</v>

230
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:14.360
I think that the behavior of beyond say's fans is,

231
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.780
you know,
when they really get on somebody,
I think it's funny that they all,

232
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.750
anytime anybody messes with Beyonce,
they come to her defense,

233
00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:23.990
but they take it to the level that you send death threats to somebody.

234
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.013
<v 5>You know?</v>

235
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.260
<v 0>It's just,
I,
I don't,
I mean,
what are you doing?</v>

236
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:31.310
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

237
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:36.290
<v 0>Do you know
what,
as much as that bothers me,</v>

238
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.880
this is really a stupid comparison.
But you who's kid,

239
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.120
until you guys don't tune into this fucking podcast for intelligence to you,

240
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.890
as much as that bothers me,

241
00:14:45.891 --> 00:14:50.510
I just can't imagine ever making a sign and just stand in there.

242
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.123
You know what I mean?

243
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.990
Or some sign about Seminis how fucking are hardcore feminists to some of the

244
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.400
most fucking sexist human beings I've ever met.
I can get political,
right,

245
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.090
I can say things.
I could make a sign,

246
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:06.470
we're going to go to war with fucking,

247
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:08.690
I ran when we already got bankrupt and Iraq.

248
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.860
Fuck are we doing and just stand there with the sign.

249
00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:12.980
I mean I feel all those things,

250
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:17.600
but to actually make the site as much as I don't agree with the sign,
you know,

251
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.520
you got to look at somebody like that and say that that is somebody that uh,

252
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.030
you know,

253
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:28.030
they have an idea and they see it through and that's what all successful people

254
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.650
do.
Um,

255
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.380
and if you go and no one should follow,

256
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.960
that sign is for your ass alone.

257
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.390
Um,
and then later on,
uh,
like the next day,
oh,

258
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.620
you think it was the same day,

259
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.340
there was one guy with the megaphone yelling at bunch of anti gay shit.

260
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.970
And unfortunately there was some gay people that took the bait.

261
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.560
So just leaving the guy screaming into a fucking black hole.

262
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.450
And it was funny because he was yelling all this shit about Jesus.

263
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.510
And is there anything funnier than when somebody's yelling at Jesus fire and

264
00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:19.990
Brimstone Shit.
And you catch them losing their train of thought,

265
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.570
let's do this guy was doing,
he was like,

266
00:16:22.571 --> 00:16:24.940
I wish I could make the fucking sound effective of a,

267
00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:26.320
of a megaphone or you've just going on,

268
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.220
<v 6>I painted,
it's got to come back a better</v>

269
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.240
[inaudible] I,
oh,
the guy.

270
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.310
Yeah.

271
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:44.150
<v 0>All these fucking
huge pauses and I want to be like,</v>

272
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:45.800
dude,
are you running out of Hay?

273
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.450
I think you said all your fucking hatred,
dude.
You're fucking,

274
00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:52.500
you're running on fumes.

275
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.220
And sounded like a car running out of gas and he was doing it and do a fucking

276
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.390
bullhorn.
I walked by and I was crying,
laughing

277
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.480
cause then there was like,
you know,
a bunch of,
there was some drunk gay guys,

278
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:09.740
shut up,
you have fun call.
And he's like,
Jesus

279
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.790
drove a bro.
You don't cry.

280
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:16.950
Put my photos.

281
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.290
I put my penis where bulldogs or whatever the fuck he was saying.

282
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.930
Um,
it really made me Miss New York,
just seeing those kinds of interactions.
And,

283
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.520
uh,
we went,

284
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.660
we went to central park or is I called it when I first got back to your grand

285
00:17:34.661 --> 00:17:36.400
central park because they haven't been here so long,

286
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.690
just combining the train station with their park.
And,
uh,

287
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.680
I had a great day yesterday.

288
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:46.681
We took my daughter to dance class and I was out there dancing around doing all

289
00:17:46.961 --> 00:17:49.260
the daddy shit with her.
And then,
uh,

290
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.360
she went to bed and then I went down to Rivington music and I played some this,

291
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.753
um,

292
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.200
and during her nap and then I came back and we went to central park and uh,

293
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.090
took a horse and carriage ride,
uh,
me,
the wife and my daughter.

294
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.740
And uh,
it was funny,
the guys go in and it's like a 45 minute ride

295
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.880
and we were like,
oh,
all right,
cool,
great.
And um,

296
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.373
<v 6>okay.</v>

297
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.850
<v 0>He ends up starting to tell us,
he goes,
you want me to tell you,</v>

298
00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.813
hang on a second.

299
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.163
<v 6>Okay.</v>

300
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.070
<v 0>How do you hit pause on this thing?
I got a new fucking recorder.</v>

301
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.640
I don't want to hit pause cause then I'm gonna have to fucking

302
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:35.650
<v 6>yeah.</v>

303
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.610
<v 0>Added to shit back together.
I don't,
I don't want to do this Mike Birthday.
Okay.</v>

304
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:41.610
People,
I'm not fucking doing that stuff.
We don't have any tissues still.
We

305
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.140
got to go with the fucking toilet paper here in God.
Oh,

306
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:49.500
I got the echo here in Jesus does lack.

307
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.543
Yeah.

308
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.500
Alright.
So,

309
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.550
so we get to the park and it's supposed to be a 45 minute tour,

310
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.330
but because really,
yeah.
Do,
we lived here for like 12 years.

311
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:13.410
You don't need to point out the carousel and all that shit.
We know it is.

312
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:17.160
So he didn't say anything and the fucking thing was done in like 18 minutes.

313
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.510
Uh,
but it was still fun because,
um,
it was funny.
My daughter,

314
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:27.810
she wanted to see the horse,
so that was her big thing cause she loves,
you know,

315
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:32.570
riding horse riding ponies.
And I kept saying to her going,
hey,
we're gonna,

316
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.960
we're going to go to,
we're going to go to central park and uh,

317
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.800
take right on the wagon.
She would call it a wagon and see the,
uh,

318
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.410
you know,
and see the horses and she goes,
she goes,
ride the ponies.

319
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.100
I go,
yeah,
we're going to go there when it comes to try and get her to say,

320
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:51.840
see the Horsey.
So she wouldn't think she was going.

321
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:54.750
She just kept going and I ride,

322
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.410
ride the ponies like dead serious.

323
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.010
Oh my God.
She's at such a frigging cute age.
Such a cute age.
Well my,

324
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.120
my wife dances around,
she goes,
go mommy,
go mommy.

325
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.420
And uh,
yesterday she,
you know,

326
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:17.140
she ate her dinner and then she wanted some more of Nias and stuff and we do

327
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.060
this like,
no,
you don't,
you hate your dinner.
You'd done.
Um,

328
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.970
and she goes,
I want to smoothly,
I want movie.

329
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.140
Like he can't have a smoothie.
Okay,
you already ate,
you know,
uh,

330
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.640
he could have some more broccoli is I want,
I want to smooth.
We were like,

331
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:38.010
you can't,
you can have some more broccoli if you want it.

332
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:42.810
And she just goes and she goes,
why not?
And we just go,

333
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:47.530
because,
you know,
she just got,
she got mad for half a second.
She goes,
mommy,

334
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:50.320
she goes,
she goes,
why not?

335
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:56.430
And then my knee at gave her that mother look and then she got all innocence.

336
00:20:56.701 --> 00:20:58.450
She just goes,
please,

337
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.140
ah,
she's killing.
She's funnier than I am.
She doesn't even know it yet.
So,
um,

338
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.870
anyhow,
what I'm gonna Start Up,
I've done here.
Is it time for the ad reads?
No,

339
00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:14.800
not quite yet.
So,
uh,

340
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:17.890
so then we went there and uh,

341
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.390
all the gay dudes were up.
There are,
a lot of them were up there,
right?

342
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.560
All the gay dudes,
every single one of them.
America was in central park.
Um,
oh,

343
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:33.560
we were actually riding on the horse and we went by sh,
uh,
was it cheap?

344
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.100
Sheep's whatever fucking field where they used to bring the sheep,

345
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:42.500
have meet the fucking grass,
I guess.
Sheep's Bay meto well,

346
00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:45.530
I don't know what the fuck it's called.
And I looked over,

347
00:21:45.531 --> 00:21:49.490
I didn't really notice anything.
And Nia started laughing.
I said,
what?

348
00:21:49.491 --> 00:21:52.340
She goes out,
she goes,
well,
I was sitting here wondering why,

349
00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:55.250
why are there so many shirtless white people over there?
And she goes,

350
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.890
I just realized it's pride week.
I looked over,

351
00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:00.200
there was like a zillion gay guys with their shirts off

352
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:06.080
all in like gay shape,
you know,
like fucking shredded and shit.

353
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.310
And we got off.

354
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.710
There was this couple that was just like intertwined,
you know,

355
00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:16.270
like when snakes try to see who is stronger,
who gets to fuck the female.

356
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.540
These just sorta like it's fucking,

357
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.900
it was wanting to fund one of the funniest fights ever because they don't have

358
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:23.560
arms or legs or anything and they just sit there trying to push each other down.

359
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.120
There was these two people,

360
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:28.840
I thought it was a man and a woman and they had the little boombox and they will

361
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:32.350
listen to all these fucking,
uh,
what was the fucking song,

362
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.300
<v 4>uh,</v>

363
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.700
<v 0>fuck.
One of those classic,</v>

364
00:22:37.701 --> 00:22:41.120
Hilarious love songs by like Christopher Cross or something.

365
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.320
And they had it so loud that I looked over when and both their heads popped up

366
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:49.120
and they both had mustaches like mine.

367
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.360
Um,
anyway,
so I had like,
I feel like yesterday was my birthday,
you know,

368
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:01.780
the Bruins one,
I saw that great people watching.

369
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.303
<v 4>MMM.</v>

370
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.070
<v 0>The guy with the megaphone running out of ideas.
I mean,
just like,
I mean,</v>

371
00:23:08.071 --> 00:23:10.980
that's like,
if you can come up with that as a comedian,

372
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:15.480
I mean that's just like a fucking brilliant character or something like that.

373
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:16.314
And uh,

374
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:18.643
<v 4>I dunno,</v>

375
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.540
<v 0>it really is.
I don't know.
It's just so much funny shit out there.
You don't,</v>

376
00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.510
some fucking guy in the New York Post

377
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.400
decided he was going to rip David Mamet.

378
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:33.420
Like he was this hacky fucking writer or something.
So ma'am,

379
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.790
it has some new play.
It's a comedy and it's,

380
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.640
it's based on like the Harvey Weinstein thing.
And he goes,
that's right.

381
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:45.390
It's a comedy based on Harvey Weinstein's behavior and proceeds to write how out

382
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:49.310
of fucking touchy is,
you know,
and it's just like,

383
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.080
like what?
You don't even understand what the fuck like so,

384
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:58.150
so many people out there who don't even understand

385
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.540
all the different levels of humor and the purpose of humor and how humor can be

386
00:24:04.541 --> 00:24:08.770
used in very stressful,
sad things.

387
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.930
You know,
they just look at humor in a one dimensional way.
You made fun of that.

388
00:24:13.931 --> 00:24:18.040
That means you don't care.
That's,
that's the only way they look at it.

389
00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:21.220
So the only thing that should be made fun of is just inanimate objects because

390
00:24:21.221 --> 00:24:25.360
we make fun of any fucking thing else.
That means that like,
you know,

391
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.520
you obviously don't give a shit about it and they have no idea that there's just

392
00:24:30.521 --> 00:24:34.930
like music.
There's all different kinds of fucking humor and some shit.

393
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.950
It's so sad you have to joke about it or rush,
you're going to go fucking crazy.

394
00:24:38.951 --> 00:24:41.560
That's why people at war,
you know,

395
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.820
cops on in murder scenes will make a joke.

396
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.760
I remember one time this person I went to high school with was,
uh,

397
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.300
worked for the state as a defense attorney.

398
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.120
And this guy had beaten like I,

399
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.350
this terrible thing had beaten is,
uh,

400
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.120
like toddler to death and they had to come up with the defense.

401
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.400
Oh,
that's right.
Because she'd seen me and these fucking assholes.

402
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.050
We're taking my shit seriously.
And I,

403
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.130
and I was telling how people don't understand humans.
She goes,
I totally get it.

404
00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:19.401
She goes,

405
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:23.390
we had to come up with defense for this guy who beat his toddler to death.

406
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.320
And she said,

407
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:30.430
we were sitting there and it was just so absurd that they started saying how the

408
00:25:30.541 --> 00:25:33.390
toddler was coming at the guy and he felt threatened.

409
00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:36.780
And it was just so fucking ridiculous that they all started crying,
laughing.

410
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.940
And it isn't because you don't care.

411
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.920
It's because the fucking thought of it is just so fucking overwhelming.

412
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:45.863
<v 5>Okay.</v>

413
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.370
<v 0>Yeah.
If you don't laugh,
you're gonna cry.
Right.</v>

414
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.800
And what is so fucking ridiculous for this guy to have this outrage?

415
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.900
First of all,
David Mamet who was a fucking genius,

416
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.990
never fucking outrage that he would choose,

417
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:02.620
<v 4>um,</v>

418
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.200
<v 0>the Harvey Weinstein story as,
as a topic for,</v>

419
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.980
for a fucking play and have that level of outrage.

420
00:26:08.981 --> 00:26:13.810
Why the fucking producers is like one of the greatest all time plays ever.

421
00:26:13.811 --> 00:26:16.270
That was based off of the fucking Holocaust.

422
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.980
I mean,
what the fuck?

423
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.260
I can't believe that person wrote that article in the editor.

424
00:26:26.261 --> 00:26:28.000
Never at any point was just like,

425
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.760
<v 4>uh,
you know,</v>

426
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.050
<v 0>how can we criticize this when the producers is out there?</v>

427
00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.413
<v 5>Okay.</v>

428
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:37.681
<v 0>I don't,</v>

429
00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:41.260
I don't fucking know what I think it really comes down to unfortunately is most

430
00:26:41.261 --> 00:26:43.180
papers are just highly politicized.

431
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.620
I'm sure David Mamet had some considered some sort of lefty or something,

432
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:51.621
so they decided to do that or he was just roadkill in their attack on Hollywood

433
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:54.450
fucking people.
I have no fucking idea,

434
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.850
but it's kind of struck me as funny as just like,
all right,

435
00:26:56.851 --> 00:27:01.620
well that's based on sexual harassment.
This one's based on the Holocaust,

436
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.650
so you don't have a problem with that.

437
00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:07.140
<v 6>Okay.</v>

438
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.920
<v 0>Well,
it's because he was Jewish and he wrote it there for you can do it.</v>

439
00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:15.060
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
All right.

440
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:20.510
Plenty of other people also died.
Um,
for some reason they don't count them.

441
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.020
I feel like in World War II,
all the people that the Germans killed that warrant,

442
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:31.980
Jewish people are,
are,
they're almost like a NFL titles.

443
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.070
Like for some reason they don't count them.
They only count fucking Superbowls.

444
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:39.260
It's really,
it's a strange thing.
All right,
we got to read here in

445
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.650
Dope Chino Indochino talk about how every man looks better.

446
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:47.250
It feels more confident when he puts on a suit.
Well,
I know that I do,

447
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:50.010
and I wish I'd put one on yesterday,
honey for gay pride.

448
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:54.660
So I would have got some more looks from my red mustachioed self,
you know?

449
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:56.150
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

450
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.370
<v 0>That's what I should've done.
Put on a nice suit.
You know,</v>

451
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.710
walk around looking like a gay,
Rusty Jones,
a bald gay,
Rusty Jones.

452
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.920

455
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.750

456
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.430

457
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.770
meds.
Some of you might be driving a little bit.

458

00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:39.680

461
00:28:39.681 --> 00:28:44.681

471
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:28.450
Once you go custom,
you don't go back.
It's funny.

472
00:29:28.451 --> 00:29:29.380
I thought that was going to rhyme.

473
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.230
<v 6>Okay.</v>

474
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.250
<v 0>Uh,
why don't you go custom.
You're going to be busted him.
Once you go custom,</v>

475
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:40.430
you're going to bust them interface or his face or these face.

476
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.230
Look at that as a progressive read right there.
All right.
Um,
all right,

477
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:47.170
let's do some fucking reads here for the week.
Can we do some reads?

478
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:51.850
How much time do I got left here?
Oh,
Jesus.
I got a whole half an hour.
Uh,

479
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.010
I got a whole half an hour there,
uh,
from Nigeria.

480
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.100
Nice.
I might,
when I first moved to New York,

481
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:03.520
I had a Nigerian roommate who was a big time hockey player.

482
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:08.050
Really good hockey player.
All right.
What's up Billy birthday,
boy,

483
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:13.080
thank you for that birthday wishes from a firm on the other side of the planet.

484
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.970
It's also my birthday to look at that.
Another June 10th person.

485
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.520
I just want to ask you from some advice on my career choices.
All right.

486
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.700
I really want to go into animation.
Uh,

487
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:32.260
but I have developed a love for acting.
I know you do both comedy and acting.

488
00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:37.030
So I just want to ask if it's reasonable to do both or a pain in the ass.

489
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.280
Uh,
thank you for your response.
My name is Gabriel and I'm 17,

490
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.410
well 18 now and from Nigeria.
Thank you again birthday mate.

491
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.890
Um,
all right.
First of all,

492
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.060
the fact that you know what you want to do or you've narrowed it down to two

493
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.910
things,
that just 18 years of age is a huge advantage.
Um,

494
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.060
<v 6>okay.</v>

495
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:07.770
<v 0>You know,
back in the day it used to be you kinda had to pick a road.
You know,</v>

496
00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:11.490
you are you,
he's a writer.
This guy's in a,
he's a television actor,

497
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:15.240
this guy's a movie star.
Now you can do whatever you want to do.
So,

498
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:17.723
um,

499
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.110
I can tell you doing stand up and doing an animated show definitely takes up a

500
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:25.810
lot of my time.
Um,

501
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.360
but I am able to do it and I have a wife and a child,

502
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.740
so I'm assuming you're not married and don't have a kid.

503
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:37.390
So I say you,
you just keep following your heart.
I mean,

504
00:31:37.391 --> 00:31:40.180
both of those are two really,
really,
really fun jobs.

505
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.370
So no matter which one you pick,
you're going to have a great time.
Um,

506
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:47.801
I will say,

507
00:31:47.801 --> 00:31:52.801
I do remember watching Louis C K s career and I was first a fan of his amazing

508
00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.100
stand up when I saw him on the half hour MTV,
half hour comedy hour.

509
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:01.503
Then I,

510
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:07.300
then I remember he wrote for Letterman for awhile,

511
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.060
a little bit.
And also,
uh,
the Dana Carvey show.

512
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.740
And I remember thinking like,
why is why,
I mean that's cool.

513
00:32:17.741 --> 00:32:20.090
He's writing for those shows,
but this guy's a star.
He should,

514
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.120
he should be the guy coming out doing the monologue.

515
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.530
And then after that he then worked for the Chris rock show and he was like

516
00:32:27.531 --> 00:32:29.450
directing and all of that stuff.

517
00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.420
And every time I would see him when he would pop into the clubs,
it was,

518
00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:39.620
she was just immediately one of the best guys I'd ever seen now second,
like,

519
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:41.030
and I was thinking of my young brain,

520
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:44.930
why is he wasting his time doing these things?
And then

521
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.310
like five years after that when he started putting out special ops,

522
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:50.360
special ops special,

523
00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:54.890
and then he got his TV shows and he was the writer,

524
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:59.540
the director,
the actor.
And the whole thing was just like,
oh,
I get,

525
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:04.541
he learned the whole business and now he's going to take his voice and apply it

526
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:07.700
to all these things that he learned how to do.

527
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.860
So using that as,
as a game plan,

528
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.510
I would think that um,
uh,

529
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.960
there's nothing wrong with doing both a year,
age,
18 years old,

530
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:23.360
who the hell knows what they want to do at 18?
So I would,

531
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.450
I would go full force into both throw yourself into them and um,

532
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.940
you know,
we listened to your heart.
It'll tell you which way to go.

533
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.150
Listen to you gun.
It gets the best,
you know,

534
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:41.180
you got your heart can sometimes be like,
you know,
your heart gets broken,
right?

535
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.450
You got is always sitting there going,
I fucking told you

536
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.990
you didn't listen to me.
Didn't listen to me.
Um,
all right,

537
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:56.000
my girl is blowing me better now.
Jesus Christ.
Hey Billy,

538
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.940
blow me wanting to say thank you.

539
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:03.560
My girlfriend and I were listening to you talking about blow jobs and while

540
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:06.590
she's always been a trooper,
since listening,

541
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.280
she's been really attacking the task with vigor now.
Jesus,

542
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.650
more effort and more frequency.

543
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:17.360
We didn't even really talk about it after listening,
but man,

544
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:21.440
the result is amazing.
Anyway,
and then he put the S.
Anyways,

545
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.540
thanks for shining a light on this topic.
You're truly doing God's work.

546
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.830
Sincerely,
my empty balls.
All right sir.
Well,

547
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:32.300
I'm glad you're having a good time,

548
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:37.301
but what was lacking in that email was you thank and your girlfriend for the you

549
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.940
.
You heard noticeably better effort and you
reciprocate.

550
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.700
And by taking the downtown train there,

551
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.610
just make sure you know it's gotta be even Steven,
that buddy.
All right,

552
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.130
I'm just going to fucking lay there like an emperor.

553
00:34:55.190 --> 00:35:00.050
I don't know how long she's going to be into that.
Um,
all right.

554
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.300
What else?
You know,
Jesus,
Venice,
California.

555
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.160
All right,
dear Billy garbage can,
um,

556
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.710
send me jaded as a teen,

557
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:17.711
I volunteered at shelters and focused education on civil engineer and city

558
00:35:18.261 --> 00:35:21.290
planning.
Look at me qualifying myself.

559
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.210
I'm almost 40 now and I've been around the problem long enough to see some

560
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:27.380
things won't change.

561
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:32.000
It take hours to me to break down all the things that have proven to work or not

562
00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:35.330
work and combating homelessness instead.
A little humor.

563
00:35:35.331 --> 00:35:40.331
Maybe I read this article a almost spit out my coffee.

564
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:45.441
The idea is a product of people who want the vanity of progressive forms of

565
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:49.290
community charity with none of the logic.

566
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.870
The funny part is the guy who wrote,

567
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.380
I think you meant wrote it.

568
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.310
The author opens with an anecdote about a young man who was sleeping on a couch

569
00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:03.960
that was being moved around the alley outside his apartment and how he and a

570
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:07.230
neighbor made sure to get rid of that couch.

571
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:12.650
I imagine to send a message,
I imagine,

572
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.470
to send a message,
do not sleep here.

573
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:19.710
He goes on to say that to blame the heartless federal government for polling foe

574
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.760
.
He then goes on to say that to,
Oh dude,

575
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.620
this is so interesting and you didn't fucking proofread it.

576
00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.420
He then goes on to blame the heartless federal government for pulling funding.

577
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:33.940
Then the local suit,
dope,

578
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.320
want to support new housing while discussing proposed high rise that would take

579
00:36:39.351 --> 00:36:41.750
the place of a parking lot on Venice beach.

580
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.950
They want to put up to 140 unit transitional living building,

581
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.880
which the authors seems to be in favor,
favor of.
You don't need my background.

582
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.790
This issues to understand the problem with that.

583
00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.910
You can just watch American gangster,

584
00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:01.210
the white man's plan to stack people up who have very little on top of each

585
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:04.640
other really backfired.

586
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.620
The author who had no desire to have someone sleeping on a couch next to a

587
00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:12.080
dumpster behind his apartments finishes off with,

588
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.430
I would so much rather that young man who dragged the blue couch next to my

589
00:37:16.431 --> 00:37:20.600
house for a good night's sleep,
have a bed in a shelter instead.

590
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.740
You see the irony,
right?
Yeah.
He wants to get that guy to fuck out of his world.

591
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.050
He doesn't give a fuck.
No,
he doesn't.
He just pretends to give a fuck.
If he did,

592
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.890
he would have asked the young man if he needed anything or at least left the

593
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.400
goddamn couch.
Shalom.
Thank you.
Thank you.

594
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.560
I have to read this fucking article now.

595
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.470
This is just a classic thing that's like,
you know,

596
00:37:42.471 --> 00:37:45.680
I've been teasing all these feminists here in New York who have outraged for

597
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:47.390
what's going on in Alabama.
It's like,

598
00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:50.870
since when have you given a fuck about Alabama?

599
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.810
Okay.
The school systems,
they're funding.

600
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:59.610
Everything has been fucked up since the civil war.
Meaning your entire life,

601
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.020
you haven't given a shit.

602
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.710
Now you give a shit because there's something going on down there that could

603
00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.510
potentially affect you.
All right.
Okay.
Let's,

604
00:38:09.511 --> 00:38:13.030
let's read this little thing here.
Um,

605
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.460
the blue couch appeared one evening at the dumpster across the alley behind my

606
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:20.820
couch.
Over the course of the next two days,
the couch was moved around a bit.

607
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.330
By the third day,
someone had dragged the couch to the side of my house,

608
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.910
a not particularly private space.
The next morning as I took my niece to school,

609
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:34.200
we noticed that a young man,
presumably homeless,
was asleep on the couch.

610
00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:35.910
Well,

611
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:39.910
I don't think he's a hydride couch builder who was taking a nap between fabrics.

612
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:46.770
I just heard a report on KPCC about how homeless can exacerbate or even cause

613
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:50.860
mental illness,
not the other way around.

614
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:56.020
One factor the report said is the lack of sleep suffered by people with no place

615
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:59.920
to lay their heads.
I left the kid alone.
I was going to give him some food,

616
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:02.470
but when I checked an hour later,
he was gone.

617
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.500
My neighbor and I dragged the couch back into the alley.

618
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.090
I called the city within a day.

619
00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:11.710
The sanest sanitation department picked it up in some residential neighborhoods,

620
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.850
have this sprawling city.

621
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:17.260
I suppose it's possible to look away from homeless crisis the way you did.

622
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.750
I was going to give him some food.
You had food in your apartment.

623
00:39:21.751 --> 00:39:25.410
You didn't do it.
I was going to give him some food.

624
00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:30.330
Basically covered his ass for when he calls the city to have the fucking,

625
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:34.170
the sanitation department pick the fucking thing up so he can get rid of this

626
00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:38.680
guy.
But to play devil's advocate,
he does have a kid.

627
00:39:38.681 --> 00:39:41.530
He doesn't know if this guy's dangerous or whatever.
Who the fuck knows?
Right.

628
00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.910
Anyway,
uh,
in some residential enables of this pharmacy,

629
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:50.230
I suppose it's possible to look away from the homeless crisis here in Venice.

630
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.050
It is not at home price.

631
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:56.980
As home prices continue their exorbitant March upward as rent skyrocket and

632
00:39:56.981 --> 00:40:01.570
short term rentals like airbnb displaced longtime Venice tenants from their rent

633
00:40:01.571 --> 00:40:05.140
stabilized units.
More and more people are facing a homeless crisis,

634
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:08.240
none of their own making.
Um,
all right.

635
00:40:08.241 --> 00:40:10.990
I want to read the rest of this shit is getting too long.
Yeah,

636
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:15.780
it is fucking terrible.
I don't fucking know,
you know,
but I cow watch.

637
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.520
Can I make fun of him when I'm not doing anything about the homeless problem?

638
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.100
I mean,
I give people money occasionally.
Sometimes I do.

639
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:26.310
I always try to like figure out is this person under the influence because I

640
00:40:26.741 --> 00:40:28.210
don't want like a,

641
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.573
<v 5>you know,</v>

642
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:32.910
<v 0>I don't want to help get,</v>

643
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.340
give you money that took to go buy something that you're going to just use to

644
00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:39.790
kill yourself.
But,
um,
I dunno.

645
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.750
I guess I'm better than this guy because I don't pretend to care.

646
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.440
Who knows?
I don't know.

647
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.350
I just started reading that article and I realized as much as I want to make fun

648
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:54.570
of him,
that I'm kind of full of shit too.
Um,
I actually,
it goes down,

649
00:40:54.571 --> 00:40:55.720
it goes up to the,
you know,

650
00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.940
it doesn't make any fucking sense how expensive everything is getting.

651
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.780
It's just a,

652
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.670
it just doesn't make any sense.

653
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:11.671
And what is causing everybody else the problem with capitalism,

654
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.840
not even capitalism,
all forms of government.

655
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.600
Cause there's always no matter what you can have socialism,

656
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:19.450
there's still people on the top taking more than they should.

657
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:25.530
And there's always going to be hookups and fucking angles and racism and sexism

658
00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:28.210
and all of that fucking shit.
Right.
Um,

659
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.500
and what it always ends up creating is a fuck or be fucked pyramid.

660
00:41:34.831 --> 00:41:37.020
And if you can somehow figure out a way,

661
00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.653
<v 5>mmm.</v>

662
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:43.400
<v 0>Like here's something for you,
why isn't helping people profitable?</v>

663
00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:46.893
<v 5>You know,</v>

664
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.470
<v 0>everybody's just running on the fucking wheel so they don't face plant and get</v>

665
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:55.340
trampled by the people behind them.
So to try and stop and help somebody,

666
00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:01.070
you feel like you're going to get run over.
I Dunno.
I also think that,

667
00:42:01.071 --> 00:42:01.371
you know,

668
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:05.450
I could probably look into it more and there has to be a way Jesus spelled,

669
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:07.310
I mean,
you don't work every day.

670
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.220
You could take a couple of those hours and go help some people out.
Right.

671
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:15.050
All right.
US economy.
Um,
speaking of which,

672
00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:17.750
I still am fond of fucking public school and having talked to anybody about it

673
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:20.150
and I said I was going to do a show,
so I have to make that happen to us.

674
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:23.210
I'm full of Shit,
US economy.
Hey Bill.

675
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.690
<v 7>Hey Baby.</v>

676
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.890
<v 0>Uh,
I just like to give you some friendly insight on the current state of our</v>

677
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:31.520
economy.

678
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.930
You often say that our country is bankrupt and your last podcast got pretty

679
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:38.690
passionate about the w about being worried about it.

680
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.130
I'm a financial adviser and just studied economics in school.

681
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.510
I know what it means.
I know everything.
Right.
Uh,

682
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.090
I'm going to assume when you say we are bankrupt,

683
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.780
you are referencing the amount of debt we currently hold as a country.
Yes.

684
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:57.950
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
We do indeed hold quite a bit of debt

685
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.810
buddy.
Every fucking August for like nine years in a row.

686
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:07.490
The government shutdown.

687
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:09.920
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

688
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.660
<v 0>And our only solution was to legally raise the amount of debt that this country</v>

689
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:18.740
could take.
All right,
now I know.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,

690
00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:23.450
but let's,
let's not fucking put Zino.
Let's not put on the kid gloves.

691
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:26.790
Just give it to me straight.
All right.

692
00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:28.740
We do hold quite a bit of debt.

693
00:43:28.741 --> 00:43:32.700
$22 trillion is quite a bit.

694
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.450
Uh,
this is broken up into different types of debt,

695
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.460
public debt and government debt.

696
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:43.490
Public debt is the type of debt that other countries hold like China and Japan.

697
00:43:43.561 --> 00:43:46.680
Well,
I didn't know that.
That's good.
So people actually oldest always money.

698
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.640
They each hold a little over a trillion each.
Oh,
good.

699
00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:54.470
So now we're down to 20 trillion.
Uh,

700
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.580
you've probably heard the rhetoric of,
well,

701
00:43:56.581 --> 00:44:00.000
what if China gets mad and dumps our debt into the mark,

702
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.960
dumps our debt to the market that would fuck up bond prices in yields?

703
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.500
I've probably heard that.
Who the fuck do you think I'm hanging out with?

704
00:44:10.501 --> 00:44:14.670
I don't know what any of that means.
How can you dump our debt to the market?

705
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.673
<v 5>What market?</v>

706
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.910
<v 0>Well,
the little piggies cove,
this little piggy went to market.</v>

707
00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:24.750
This little piece stayed home and China dumped fucking dollar their debt to us

708
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:28.410
and I don't know what the fuck that means.
Sure.
Very temporarily.

709
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:29.520
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

710
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.520
<v 0>and then we would either back that 1 trillion or find another alley to buy it</v>

711
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:40.110
up.
It's not enough to crash our market,
not even close.

712
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:45.500
Then there is our government debt where it's mainly our agency's holdings,

713
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:49.830
like social security,
medicare,
disability,
et cetera.

714
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.830
This is about 30% of our overall debt.
Well,

715
00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:57.820
how much is paying $1 billion a fucking week or whatever and these goddamn never

716
00:44:57.821 --> 00:45:02.110
ending fucking wars
that we just keep starting.

717
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:03.770
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

718
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:04.850
<v 0>With no real</v>

719
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:07.733
<v 5>like</v>

720
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.190
<v 0>the war against terror is is it's just,</v>

721
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:13.730
<v 5>okay,</v>

722
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:14.570
<v 0>it's wide open.</v>

723
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:18.100
US being over there creates more terrorism so it becomes never ending.

724
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:24.600
I just,
I feel like if we just my,
this is my stupid barroom logic.

725
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:29.190
If we just got the fuck out of the Middle East and I know everybody well,

726
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.170
we just can't just up and leave all of those people like it.

727
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.470
We'll look what the fuck we done to him in the process of trying to get the bad

728
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:39.570
guys,
how many fucking innocent people were killed over there.

729
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:44.130
If we get the fuck out of there,
we commit to electric and solar power,

730
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:45.660
which I'm not even saying is cleaner.

731
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.570
It's just not what they're selling over there.

732
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.790
That fucking really affects their goddamn economy.
It would affect ours too,

733
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:55.200
I guess because of all the oil companies.

734
00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:57.990
So I just say you give all the solar shit,
you give the son,

735
00:45:57.991 --> 00:46:02.190
you give the son to the oil companies here.
Okay.

736
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.110
And you invest in them switching over to that form of fucking energy

737
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:12.380
and Middle East.
That's the number one export.
Then they go bankrupt.

738
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:14.240
They don't have enough fucking money to fuck with us.

739
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:17.240
And after we're gone for a while,
they'll just go back to fighting each other.

740
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.640
The same way.
When Russia left fucking eastern Europe,

741
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.630
Bosnians and Serbs picked right the fuck up where they were before those guys

742
00:46:23.631 --> 00:46:26.240
were there and they were there for like fucking 70 years or something,

743
00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.230
something like that.
Eight years.
I have no fucking idea.
That's my solution.

744
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.260
All right.
And you know,

745
00:46:33.261 --> 00:46:35.390
considering I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.

746
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:39.140
I should probably shut up.
All right.
Okay.

747
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:44.180
Now let's talk about why that much debt isn't a big problem for the u s instead

748
00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:48.930
of boring you with a bunch of dumb numbers.
No.
Bore me.
Educate me.
He goes,

749
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:52.260
I'll give you an example.
Oh,
they,
oh,
I love this.

750
00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:53.790
He's going to dumb it down to my level.

751
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.920
Let's say you're sitting there in the second period and he got half a beer and

752
00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:02.130
you got to take a pen.
All right?
Uh,

753
00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:04.200
but you don't want to miss the Empty Netta.

754
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:10.050
Who pulls the goalie in the second period?
Patrick,
why does,
all right,

755
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.400
uh,
now let's talk about why that did out of,
okay,
I'll give you an example.

756
00:47:14.401 --> 00:47:19.401
It's like a guy with $50,000 in credit and a credit card debt,

757
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.850
but only $5,000 in the bank.
Yeah,
that's terribly okay.

758
00:47:23.851 --> 00:47:26.220
He goes awful position to be in obviously.

759
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:31.490
But that same guy owns $1 million house free and clear with no mortgage.

760
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:37.660
The equity has in that house alone could cover the debt easily.

761
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:43.090
Yeah,
but at some point you're gonna have to sell the fucking house.
Right.

762
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.980
Is the house our country?
I'm lost.

763
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.910
Now you asked the question as to why when he just pay off those debts.

764
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:54.990
Then I didn't ask that question,
but thank you for asking.

765
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.070
For me and the U s scenario,

766
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:01.630
debt is a way of leverage and collateral with other countries.

767
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.010
It's bargaining chips that can bring other ideas to the table.
Also,

768
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:11.011
the u s has never missed an interest payment on this debt.

769
00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:16.980
Okay.
But a bunch of other shit has been slashed and cut.

770
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.430
Am I crazy?
I mean,
look at,
look at our public school systems.

771
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.740
Look at mental health institutions.
Look at health care.

772
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.253
<v 6>Okay.</v>

773
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.620
<v 0>Social Security's not going to be there by the time I fucking need it.</v>

774
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.830
<v 6>Okay.</v>

775
00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.870
<v 0>What are you talking to him?
Yeah,
so then they they,
this is like the thing.
Yeah,</v>

776
00:48:36.871 --> 00:48:39.390
they have all this debt so now they can't take their,

777
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.720
they're not taking care of their citizens as well as they used to.

778
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.720
Right.
God,
I wish this was,

779
00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:50.260
I could talk to you about this and you could make me feel better cause it's you.

780
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:55.200
You don't seem worried about this at all.
He said,

781
00:48:55.201 --> 00:48:56.100
now I'll give you the,

782
00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.510
the Hoo Rah American stats and if we do miss an interest payment,

783
00:49:00.511 --> 00:49:04.310
who's going to foreclose on us?
I don't know.

784
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:09.330
The United States has assets that blow its debt numbers out of the water.

785
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:10.940
Last time I checked,

786
00:49:10.941 --> 00:49:15.110
we owned around 34% of the global wealth.

787
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:19.220
Our earning power is Riddick.
W w what do you mean we own it?

788
00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:20.940
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

789
00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.550
<v 0>Our government owns it or corporations own it.</v>

790
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:27.540
I don't understand this.

791
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.930
Our earning power is ridiculous and our growth is unprecedented.

792
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.280
Everyone has been expecting our GDP

793
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:41.840
too slow because markets are cynical and we have been in the longest bull run in

794
00:49:41.841 --> 00:49:42.674
history.

795
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.330
Then this last quarter we dropped 3.2% I don't even know what the GED,

796
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:52.310
I know gross natural products.
Is it gross domestic product?
What does that mean?

797
00:49:52.311 --> 00:49:55.520
I gotta look that up.
I'm want to look this up like if I know what this means,

798
00:49:55.521 --> 00:49:59.090
I'm going to understand what the fuck you talking about.
ECON.

799
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.830
Nomi g d p meaning

800
00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:09.380
weighing in at gross domestic product.
Oh,
I got it right.
Look at that.

801
00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:12.530
I and you have to phone a friend.
Oh I did.
Cause I had to confirm it.

802
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:14.910
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

803
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.700
<v 0>Everyone who's been expecting our gross domestic product to slow because he's</v>

804
00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.460
marked markets is cynical who've been in the longest bull run in the history.

805
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.280
Then this last quarter we dropped

806
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:27.060
83.2% gross domestic product,
which is honestly incredible,

807
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.310
is reflective of our resilience of our country is at making money.

808
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.950
We aren't bankrupt bill far from it.

809
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:39.590
Should we go into war with Iran?
No,
but we aren't bankrupt.

810
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.170
When you say we,
what do you mean by we?

811
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:47.840
What about the 2008 banking crisis and the amount of people in America who are

812
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:49.760
upside down in their houses.

813
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:55.100
So basically what you're saying to me is that your heads above water and my

814
00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:56.000
head's above water.

815
00:50:56.001 --> 00:51:00.440
So then we shouldn't care about all the Americans who are drowning in debt.

816
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.750
Is that what you're telling me?
All of these social uh,

817
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.460
programs that have been cut,
all of this,

818
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:13.730
this is what you're telling me.
I mean,
I don't know.

819
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.030
I try not to do that shit where,
hey,
I'm doing okay.
So everything's great.

820
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:23.180
I Dunno.
But I also know that you know more about this shit than I do.

821
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.260
He said if you want sources on any of these stats I loosely through at you,

822
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.400
I'll give it to you.

823
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:32.480
I just figured you didn't want to take 30 minutes on the subject.

824
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:36.890
I've been listening to the podcast since 2010 and senior live twice.

825
00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:41.660
Big Fan and hope your family's well.
Well,
you know something.
If I did,
I,

826
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:46.690
I imagine Joe Rogan has had a person like this on as a guest.

827
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.640
Rather than listen to me fucking swim in this shit and not even know what he's

828
00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:54.530
talking about.
By the way,
did you see Joe Rogan,
the Joe Rogan podcast,

829
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:58.610
the Joe Rogan experience?
He has advertising on a fucking stock car.

830
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.400
How incredible is that?

831
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:06.800
These stupid little things that we started and how far some people have.
I mean,

832
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:08.870
I'm still the fucking guy just sitting there talking to myself,

833
00:52:08.871 --> 00:52:12.620
but some of these guys,
Mark Marin had the president as a guest.

834
00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:18.020
It's unbelievable.
Um,
a veteran's perspective,
by the way,

835
00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:22.520
all you young comics out there,
you young,
standup comics,
you young performers,

836
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:27.080
all right,
starting out,
manager and agent comes towards you.

837
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:29.990
Do not give them a cut of your podcast money.

838
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:33.380
You're going to grow all of that by yourself.

839
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.260
They're trying to insert themselves into this.

840
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.340
All this fucking phone here is God damn phone.

841
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.830
You don't have to do it.

842
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.280
You can grow these things on your own and you can fucking,

843
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:49.700
you can fucking have all of the money to yourself.
All right,

844
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.550
let them stay with a fucking belong,
okay.

845
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:56.000
And Film and TV and the way that they have fucking over writers and the way

846
00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:59.630
they've packaged all of these shows together and they were actually making more

847
00:52:59.631 --> 00:53:03.500
money than,
than the performers on the show.

848
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.820
And a lot of cases shows you where their hearts are at.
So fuck them.

849
00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:11.840
So they can't get old guys like us cause they didn't know what podcasts are

850
00:53:11.841 --> 00:53:12.500
going to be.

851
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.650
But what now they're going to try to do is sign you to across the deal boards,

852
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:20.450
do not give up your podcast money.
Fuck them.

853
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.940
Just say that's,
that's,
that's a deal breaker.

854
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:28.380
And all you young people should together and say that that is a fucking for once

855
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:29.821
for fucking ones.

856
00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:34.020
Cause those fucking pieces of shit are gonna figure out a fucking way that

857
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:36.840
somehow they're going to end up owning your podcast and they're going to end up

858
00:53:36.841 --> 00:53:37.980
getting more fucking money.

859
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:40.740
The fucking check is going to come with their fucking name on it.

860
00:53:40.741 --> 00:53:43.080
I'm gonna tell you right now,
that is how business works.

861
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.980
You get in business with somebody bigger than you.
They all,
you know,

862
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.290
we're in business together to make money off these guys.

863
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.040
How it works is then the fucking money that has made always goes to the other

864
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:56.160
comment that you get into business with.
Okay.

865
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.890
And then they send you a fucking check with their name on it.

866
00:53:58.891 --> 00:54:02.820
And that is the quintessential behind the music.
How did it get stolen from?

867
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
And then you go to them to get a raise and then they can somehow fudge the

868
00:54:06.001 --> 00:54:09.840
fucking numbers and say that you're not in fucking profit.
And they,

869
00:54:09.841 --> 00:54:12.900
and then you fucking audit them and then you find out that this stealing from

870
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:13.081
you.

871
00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:15.540
And they'll come back the next day with a smile on the face and just be like,

872
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:16.950
this is how business is done.

873
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.033
<v 5>All right.</v>

874
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.160
<v 0>And that is the purpose of all things comedy.</v>

875
00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:27.270
We try to create a place where fucking comedians could keep their podcasts and

876
00:54:27.271 --> 00:54:31.920
these fucking Goddamn fucking leaches couldn't come in and try and steal your,

877
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:35.650
they can't even just accept a portion of it.
They fucking want all of it.
I,

878
00:54:35.651 --> 00:54:37.620
I swear to God,
dude,
this is why,

879
00:54:37.621 --> 00:54:40.170
this is why I do this business the way I fucking do it.

880
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.540
Sit here talking to my fucking self.

881
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:46.470
I try to do everything by myself because every time I get in fucking business

882
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:50.040
with somebody,
all they do is these the fucking steal from you.

883
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:56.940
There is not one aspect in this fucking business that I have ever been involved

884
00:54:56.941 --> 00:55:01.500
in where somebody is doing a standup date doing fucking podcasting.
I've been,

885
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.110
I've been good.
Okay.
Cause I was able to fucking circle the wagons,
right?

886
00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.700
Acting,
creating a show,
working on a show.
I,

887
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:14.830
there's never,
I've never not gotten stolen from every fucking,

888
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:18.590
every fucking time you think this is.
They've run out of ways to do it.

889
00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.460
And this is what kills me.
Cause if fucking sociopathic fucking pieces of shit,

890
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:26.570
they go to sleep at night,
they sleep like a fucking baby.

891
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.390
Absolute fucking scumbags.

892
00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.440
So if I can tell you that all you fucking young people coming up in this fucking

893
00:55:33.441 --> 00:55:37.130
business,
all right?
All of those fucking cops out there,
okay?

894
00:55:37.131 --> 00:55:42.110
Do not give away your podcasts.
Money.
Fucking greedy,
dirty bastards.

895
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:47.600
All right.
A veteran's perspective.
Hey Bill,
how's it going?

896
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.180
I was thinking about what you and your wife were talking about,

897
00:55:50.181 --> 00:55:55.181
the cognitive dissonance between Americans and in their politics and the field

898
00:55:55.761 --> 00:55:58.270
of psychology,
cognitive,
cognitive.
What,

899
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.370
who at what point did somebody that I say something smart last week,

900
00:56:01.371 --> 00:56:03.110
I've never had emails like this and my life,

901
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.950
cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort,

902
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:12.430
psychological stress experienced by a person who holds two or more contradictory

903
00:56:12.561 --> 00:56:17.030
beliefs or values.
Is this a fancy way of saying I'm out of my mind?

904
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:17.850
Uh,

905
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:22.160
this discomfort is triggered by a situation in which a person's belief clashes

906
00:56:22.161 --> 00:56:26.680
with new evidence perceived by the person when confronted with facts that

907
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:28.990
contradict beliefs,
ideals and values.

908
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.960
People will try to find a way to resolve the contradictions,

909
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:36.560
to reduce their discomfort.
Oh,
God knows I do that.
Uh,

910
00:56:36.561 --> 00:56:40.970
I think the book media politics by
Shanto.

911
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:42.340
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

912
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:47.290
<v 0>I younger.
That looks like an l l y linger or is that a l or an I?</v>

913
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:51.190
I guess that's an eye.
I Y e.
N.
G.
A.

914
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.500
R a professor of political science from Stanford.

915
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:58.090
Would ease your frustration and understanding how they brand sees the big six

916
00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:02.680
media conglomerates use information and psychology to benefit the bottom line of

917
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:07.300
financially motivated networks.
Aren't they all financially motivated?

918
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.510
Um,
except for PBS man.

919
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.560
They have a fucking fundraiser telethon.

920
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.660
When I wasn't dropping acid and ecstasy in the hills of the eight oh five I was

921
00:57:19.661 --> 00:57:22.710
in a classroom full of exchange students from Sweden,
China,

922
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.340
and Mexico and a bunch of other places.

923
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:29.610
They knew far more than I ever learned in my k 12 experience about our politics

924
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:33.430
and the intertwined relationship between lobbyists,
brand representative,

925
00:57:33.431 --> 00:57:37.960
politicians,
advocates for legislator and bureaucracy,
government agency.

926
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:39.180
Essentially,
Mr

927
00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:44.590
Iyengar says you have to buy your blue,
red,
green,

928
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:49.591
rainbow POW and American flags from the same company who funds the campaigns of

929
00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:55.270
politician who then push funds for agencies and committees for example,

930
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:59.550
because banks costs,
wait for example,

931
00:57:59.551 --> 00:58:01.890
because banks costs all sides money.

932
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:07.190
Why have overdraft fees gone from 1520 in the early two thousands to 34 to $36

933
00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:14.040
in 2019 they have made record profits and didn't have to accept the feet.

934
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:15.030
In 2008.

935
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:19.410
How did that happen as the late and great Patrice Neha would sit,

936
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.730
O'Neill would say gas is high because you know,

937
00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.890
what are you going to do?
Hope this helps.

938
00:58:26.891 --> 00:58:29.790
I love the podcast and your comedy is good therapy.

939
00:58:29.791 --> 00:58:33.930
Best a veteran who enjoys your stand up.
Um,

940
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:39.000
Jesus Christ.
I might actually,
am I going to read a book?

941
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.970
The one that isn't like Mike.
The next book on my,

942
00:58:44.971 --> 00:58:49.830
on my list is the Ken Stabler autobiography.

943
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.360
That's the next one on my hit list.

944
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:54.480
But maybe I should actually throw something like this.
And you know,
it's funny,

945
00:58:54.481 --> 00:58:54.961
as you all know,

946
00:58:54.961 --> 00:58:59.050
I'm reading a fucking smart book like this because all of a sudden I'll start,

947
00:58:59.051 --> 00:59:02.760
I'll try to start sounding smart in this podcast and the whole thing will go off

948
00:59:02.761 --> 00:59:05.880
the rails.
Um,
vindictive woman.

949
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.750
I'm a lady.
Oh,
I love when the ladies right in.

950
00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.510
I've been saying for years it doesn't happen enough.
Uh,

951
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.690
when I went in my twenties,

952
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:19.050
a boyfriend put a brick through my windshield,

953
00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:23.540
first night in my new place
without him.

954
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:29.150
What?
When in my twenties at boyfriend,

955
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:32.810
put a brick through my windshield first night in my new place without him.

956
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.730
Meaning you guys had broken up or you just had the audacity to have a night just

957
00:59:37.731 --> 00:59:38.564
for you?

958
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:45.020
I responded by getting a temporary restraining order on him and went to his

959
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:48.260
favorite watering hole.
He went to nightly.

960
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:50.870
Well that's kind of dangerous.

961
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.920
Advised him I would be there every night until he paid for my replacement

962
00:59:54.921 --> 00:59:57.410
windshield.
Okay.
That's a gangster fucking move.

963
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.500
Basically taken his home away from home from him.

964
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.810
He did pay,

965
01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:07.811
but even though I had heard he got a new apartment and checked his account at

966
01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:12.970
the bank.
Wait,
he did pay.

967
01:00:12.971 --> 01:00:17.971
But even though I had heard he got a new apartment and checked his account at

968
01:00:18.371 --> 01:00:22.780
the bank,
what the fuck does that mean?
Place stop pay on his rent.

969
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:27.610
Check in the new apartment to get even love everything you do.

970
01:00:27.611 --> 01:00:31.360
Go Fuck Yourself.
Wait,
wait.
Why?
What'd,
what'd you do?
I missed what happened.

971
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.490
I,
I feel like when people,
this is like the last episode of lost.
What happened?

972
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.810
I don't get what just happened there.

973
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.580
You got a restraining order and then went to his,

974
01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:44.130
to his favorite bar every night.

975
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:48.830
You advise them that you'd be there every night until he paid for the

976
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:49.850
replacement windshield.

977
01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:54.851
Gangster fucking move and allow any person in law enforcement of security would

978
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:59.540
say dangerous fucking move.
So don't do that ladies.
All right.

979
01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:02.300
Cause you're going to get the guy who doesn't give a fuck and it will be like,

980
01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.090
oh,
so now I know where you're going to be so I can go down and do something

981
01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:08.180
horrible to you.
All right.
Basically taking his home away from home,

982
01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:10.370
away from him.
He did pay,

983
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.130
I think she was trying to say,
even though he did pay though,

984
01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:20.730
I heard he got a new apartment and I checked his account at the bank,

985
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.530
placed a stop payment on his rent check and his new apartment to get even.

986
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:32.960
Oh,
I love everything you do and go fuck yourself.
Well,

987
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:37.460
I mean,
okay.
That is fucking amazing.

988
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.990
All right.
It's not smart and it's not mature.

989
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.710
Um,
and you got away with it.
So good on you.

990
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:48.620
But I would not do that because one of these days you're gonna run into the

991
01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:53.621
fucking person that doesn't give a fuck watch casino and watched that Joe Pesci

992
01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:56.960
monologue when he talks to that guy,

993
01:01:56.961 --> 01:02:00.380
what the fuck he's going to do them and they're going to send me to jail and

994
01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:03.830
Yada Yada Yada.
In seven years,
you know,

995
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.160
later I'm going to come out and I'm going to fucking do it again because I'm a

996
01:02:07.161 --> 01:02:11.390
fucking lunatic.
Like when somebody doesn't give you date somebody,

997
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.390
um,
I dunno,

998
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.600
it's my belief when you break up with somebody that say you get the fuck away

999
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:19.920
from where you do not try to make their life miserable or whatever,

1000
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:23.340
he did throw a brick through your windshield,
you did the proper thing,

1001
01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.280
you got a restraining order.
Um,

1002
01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.290
but I will say going down to his favorite bar,

1003
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.260
yeah.
Every night.
So we can't go there is funny as that is,

1004
01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.710
is for your own personal safety is a really reckless thing to do.

1005
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.480
Um,

1006
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.900
and also letting him know that you're doing that and just deliberately rubbing

1007
01:02:44.901 --> 01:02:47.810
it in the face of somebody who did something pretty fucking violent.

1008
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:52.130
I would be worried where the next brick was going to go.
So,
uh,
in the future,

1009
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:56.000
you know,
it looks like he got away with it.
I would not.
Uh,

1010
01:02:56.001 --> 01:02:59.930
and also what you're doing is making him more of an angry human being and he's

1011
01:02:59.931 --> 01:03:02.850
probably gonna treat.
Yeah,
I dunno.

1012
01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:07.490
People even worse on his next one.
So you're,

1013
01:03:07.491 --> 01:03:12.180
you're combating negative energy with more negative energy.
So I would be,

1014
01:03:12.181 --> 01:03:14.400
I would be careful with that.
It made for a good read.

1015
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:18.840
It was a funny fucking story.
But,
uh,

1016
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.170
yeah,
being of addictive person is,

1017
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:27.200
it's not a good character trait and eventually you do it to the wrong person and

1018
01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.540
that can be grave consequences.
All right.

1019
01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:32.100
And that's all I'm going to say on that.

1020
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.600
And evidently I have some books to read here.
Uh,
gold Bruins.

1021
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:41.280
Go Bruins gold.
Grow ends.
Go Brolin's,
go Bruins,

1022
01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:43.500
go Bruins,
go Bruins.
That's all I can say.

1023
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.980
And I am so psyched for this game.
Seven.

1024
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.200
Um,

1025
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.200
hopefully I won't be working on the movie and I will be standing outside a

1026
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:59.640
sports bar for most of it.
Looking into the fucking window.
Um,

1027
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.800
what is series?
What a sport.
Okay.
All right.
Go fuck yourselves.

1028
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.500
I'll check in audio on Thursday.
When I do,

1029
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.930
there'll be a new Stanley Cup champion.
All right.
