- Oh my god go to Hell's
Kitchen, you'll find plenty

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:03.503
of colorful underwear.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.371 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But how I get to
Hell's Kitchen from here?

(techno music)

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.642

My name is Chris
Kelly and this is?

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.446 line:0%
- I'm Sarah Schneider.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.381 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And we're here to
talk about episode three

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.650 align:start size:81% position:19%
which is "Chase
Gets a Girlfriend."

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:18.785
- Yes

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.787 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We have Drew,
Helene and Ken Marino.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.522 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Hello.
- [Sarah And Chris] Hi Ken.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.257 line:0%
- Hi Ken.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.258
- Hi!
- Hey!

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.292
- Hi!
- Hey!

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.461
- Ew.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:29.262 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is already
the most annoying...

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.263
- What do you mean?

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.265
(crosstalk)

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.133
- Somebody just clicked away.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.736
- Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
Brook, gay brother.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.405
- We have an important PR
opportunity to discuss.

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:40.807 align:start size:81% position:19%
- It was my idea.
- Yeah,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.376
and it's for tonight so
we have no time to waste.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.344
- I thought of it.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.279
- Right out the gate,
this is very cheesy

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.513
to say to your face.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.816
But we were big fans
of yours for a while,

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.551
I mean since we were
like three or four.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.153
(group laughs)

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:57.423
Some of the first words
I said were Ken Marino.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.559 align:start size:88% position:13%
No, but we have just
loved you and everything

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we were so excited
when you were...

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.564
willing to take a coffee
to talk about this show.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.699 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We did have a coffee
talk about the show

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:09.435
- We're on mute now so
everybody keep smiling

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
and don't move your
lips (laughs nervously)

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:12.839
cause this is very bad.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.174
- Am I doing it?
Are my lips moving?

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:16.709
- Oh I gotta get those pictures

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.311
who do I gotta suck,
who do I gotta (bleep)

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.314
- When we met with you, you
already kind of had like,

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.815 align:start size:81% position:19%
a lot of ideas for
this character.

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.117
- I did?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.451 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You pitched us
immediately that he had

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.320
two empty jacuzzis at his home

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.188 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a lazy river that
ram between them.

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.590
But he had to run out
of money to fill them,

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.724
so they were just empty.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.393
- So the whole season, he's
dealing with the permits

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:35.695
and he never gets it.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.730
Ultimately he wasted
a lot of money on it,

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:40.266 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he's never gonna be
able to fill it with water.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.335
- So watching the
show just know that

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start size:84% position:16%
the character Streeter,
we never mention it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.738
but he is dealing with a
lot of permitting issues.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.173
- Lot of permitting issues

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.808
- I can't talk right
now, his neck is bound.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.209
- What?

00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:51.477
- Yeah I'm just trying
to keep his Adam's apple

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.680
under control, gotta keep that
neck looking young and slick.

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:57.884
- The character does a lot of
things that are a little...

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:01.554
rough to a child, like
in the previous episode.

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:05.424 align:start size:97% position:3%
His binding his neck, keeping
his Adam's apple down.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:08.294
- Bleaches his tongue.
- He's making it pinker.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.196 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And so, but we were trying
to find the balance of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.497
someone who could...

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.299
sell that comedy without being

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:16.502 align:start size:94% position:6%
"holy shit what is
happening to this child."

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.304
- Well I hope that works out.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:19.639 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I guess we'll see.
- I don't know we'll see.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.374
See what the critics say.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.775
- See if America turns on you.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:24.777
- His face is kind enough
to hurt a child. (laughs)

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.646
- Yeah, that's what
we were looking for.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.447
- Oh, kiss my butt.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.486 align:start size:84% position:16%
What? I'm a New Yorker
now, hey! (laughs)

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.321 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think when we were
talking in the room

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:36.889
we thought it was funny cause,

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:37.990 align:start size:94% position:6%
the day that Chase Dreams
lands into your key

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:41.227 align:start size:97% position:3%
immediately moves into
Justin Theroux's penthouse.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.763
And how ridiculous that
is, in comparison to like

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.798 align:start size:97% position:3%
how we probably all lived when
we moved there when we were

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.466
19?

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.602
I moved to New York when I
was 22, right after college

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:50.770
and I saved up.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.538 align:start size:84% position:16%
And within 10 minutes
of being there,

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.674
two people walked up
to me, at gun point

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.275
and stole all of my things.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:58.477 align:start size:94% position:6%
Completely robbed me,
stole all of my suitcases.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.280
And so then, I called
my dad and he was like

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:02.915 align:start size:88% position:13%
"We will never tell
your mother about this."

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:04.917 align:start size:97% position:3%
Cause she was so terrified
that I was moving to New York.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.553 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we just never
told my mom about it.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.755
- I've been mugged, I was mugged

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:12.525 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You have been mugged?
- I was too, yeah

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.926
- Is everybody getting mugged?

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.528
- I've been mugged,
when I was in college

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.230 align:start size:94% position:6%
I went away for
Thanksgiving and came back

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.664
and my house had been emptied.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.800 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like literally the washer
and dryer was gone,

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:21.968 align:start size:88% position:13%
it was like the Grinch.
- What?

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.703 align:start size:97% position:3%
(laughs)
- [Sarah] It was very intense

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.706
But they did leave one
DVD which had a message

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.708
and the DVD was "You got served"

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wow, that's good.
- That's good

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.645
- Is that funny, cause
I liked laughed at that.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:33.512
- That's pretty good.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.947 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well maybe I
should've been robbed.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.649
I was trying to buy Dave
Matthews' band tickets

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.317
(laughs)

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.253 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I was, I have the
tickets and I was like

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:44.457
"Okay, I want em'" because
I have bad taste in music.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.692 align:start size:91% position:9%
So I put them in my pocket
and I turned around

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.294
and was walking away.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.963
And I looked down and it was
for like, two days before.

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:51.664
(grasp)

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.399
It was like the wrong ticket.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.869
I ran after him and he
hopped the turnstile

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:59.338 align:start size:84% position:16%
so I stood at the
turnstile and was like

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:01.040
(yells) "He's robbed me"

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:03.943
And everyone just looked at
him a got out of his way.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:06.279
- Did he even look back?
- No! No no no nothing.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.681
What he left and I got
"you got served DVD"

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:10.283
(laughs)

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.484
- Can you believe it?

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.886
- Wait is this Justin
Theroux's apartment?

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.454
- Yes! How did you know?

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:18.424
- Uh, because I'm looking
at a huge photo of him,

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:19.625
so I hope it is.

00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:22.995 align:start position:0%
- I'm curious about how you
picked the Justin Theroux photo.

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:24.363
Which is like there's something

00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:25.698
- There's like pubes in it

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:26.899 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Actually
- There were pubes,

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:29.035
but then we had to
take the pubes out.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Take the pubes down
(crosstalk)

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:32.038 align:start size:81% position:19%
- So we had to tamp
down the pubes

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.639 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Tamp down pubes, classic.
(laughs)

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:35.775
- But I'm hoping like, when
it airs in Comedy Central

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:36.976
there's no pubes.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.177 align:start size:84% position:16%
But then if you
watch it on iTunes,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.046 align:start size:91% position:9%
we have so many f***ing pubes
popping out there.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.781
(crosstalk)

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
We have pubes for everyone.
- Yeah!

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:45.051
- Oh no! Ow!

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:46.286
- Oh no! Ow!

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.289
Ow!

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:51.590
Ow ow ow

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:52.525
Ow ow ow

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.060
- Yo bro, you alright?

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.928 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Oh yeah, no
- Jeez

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.864
- I didn't mean to
hit my face, ow ow!

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.667
- When I was in college,
was flirting with a guy

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.537
and weirdly it was like a
thing for girls to like,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.672
let guys know they
were like flexible.

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.674 align:start size:84% position:16%
I went to theaters school
when I was a dancer,

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:10.810 align:start size:88% position:13%
I did splits at so
many parties being like

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.512
"This is crazy! I can
just fall into this"

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:14.480
I was a virgin.

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:16.749
- I was talking to a
guy and to that point

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:19.051 align:start size:81% position:19%
tried to do a high
kick, as you do

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:21.420
In no long conversation
and I kicked so hard,

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:23.356
that I kicked my other
foot out from under me

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.091
and landed on my back in
the middle of the quad.

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:26.959 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What?
- It impressed him.

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:30.096
- I've definitely learned
too many John Mayer songs

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.430
on the guitar.

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.099 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Oof
- Oh my god.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:33.966
- Cut!

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.101
- Cut!

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:36.102
- Let's finish it.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.703
- Well thank you for watching,

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:39.572 align:start size:94% position:6%
this has been another
episode of The Other Show.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.574
And we'll see you next week.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.576
- Do a kick
(laughs)

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:44.543 align:start size:94% position:6%
- What? Are you impressed?
- She is flexible

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:45.711
- Woah! Marry me.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:46.912
- Woah! Marry me.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:49.415
