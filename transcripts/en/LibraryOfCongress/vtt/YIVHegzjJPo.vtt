00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.740
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Good evening,
afternoon, thank you all so much

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220
for coming to this
wonderful session.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.470
It's been a long time in the
making for a number of us here.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.220
Great to see old and familiar
faces, some new ones as well,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.270
and it promises to be a really
exciting afternoon...as exciting

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.630
as online presentations can be.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.210
One housekeeping note
- if you wouldn't mind,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.140
turning off your cell phones?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.400
Turn off your cell phones
because we care and,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.140
they also interfere with the
wireless equipment in the room.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.680
And I'm going to keep my remarks
[short], basically by saying

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.930
that I'm here to
essentially hurry people on

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.330
and off the stage
- or not hurry -

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.620
gently move people along
and introduce people.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.820
And in doing so, let me
introduce my boss, the director

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.020
of the American Folklife Center,
my boss, Dr. Betsy Peterson.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.670
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Thank you, Guha.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.660
As he said, I am Betsy Peterson
- I think I am anyway And I want

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.310
to welcome everyone today.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.980
This has been an exciting and
a long time coming to get,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.680
get all of us in the same room
so we can begin to reflect

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.200
and talk about what this
whole process has been

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.420
in the last couple of years.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.490
But, let me step back
a minute and sort

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.000
of go back a little further and
tell you a little bit about AFC

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.780
and what AFC has done
in terms of working

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.380
with Native American
collections and communities.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.280
The American Folklife Center
has long been involved

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.720
in initiatives to jointly
engage federal repositories

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.340
and Native American community
members in curating, preserving,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.820
and providing access to
their own cultural heritage,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.630
whether the focus was on analog
materials, on wax cylinders,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.450
or whether it is on
emerging digital formats.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.440
Notably, the Library was the
very first federal institution

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.560
to actively engage
in the repatriation

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.400
of recorded cultural heritage
to indigenous communities

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.770
to actively -- Whoops.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.720
I just missed a line
there...In the repatriation

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.160
of recorded cultural heritage to
indigenous communities by means

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.790
of the Federal Cylinder Project,
which was initiated in 1979.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.130
And Judith Gray is one of
the individuals who was

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.980
on that illustrious
team at the time.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.360
Through this program,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.060
the Library coordinated a tape
preservation program focused

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.660
on fragile wax cylinders
housed in several public

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.590
and university repositories,
bringing them together.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.440
Subsequently, through
careful collaborative work

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.260
with community experts and
elders, we returned recordings

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.290
to over 100 communities
to assist

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.430
in community based
programs, for cultural

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.460
and linguistic preservation
and dissemination.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.890
So, now let's jump ahead to
2018 and to the 2.0 version

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.170
of the Federal Cylinder Project.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.410
This time around, we are working

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.240
on digitizing these fragile wax
cylinders, but so much more -

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.030
thanks to all this
wonderful new technology

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.130
that is making certain things
possible and really making,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.790
I think, the dream of
collaborative curation,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.170
much more possible, to
promote the ethical exchange

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.550
of information.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.110
And it's also in part due
to the indefatigable -

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.930
and I want to underline
that - team of Jane Anderson

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.080
and Kim Christen, who
are piloting and -

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.170
and championing the Mukurtu
content management system

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.780
and the Local [Contexts] and the
Traditional Knowledge labels,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.820
which they'll be able to tell
you a little bit more about.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.600
I also want to thank our
esteemed guests and experts.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.630
Donald Soctomah from
the Passamaquoddy tribe

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.300
and Dwayne Tomah.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.590
Welcome! And what
you're going to hear

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.850
from us today is just
everyone talking a little bit

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.280
about what this process

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.290
of collaborative curation
is all about, what it means

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.140
to the different parties
involved, how they're doing,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.030
what they're doing and where
we see things going - further.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.960
I also want to just give a
brief shout out to Gene DeAnna,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.120
who is the former
head of Recorded Sound

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.930
at Motion Picture, Broadcasting,
and Recorded Sound [division].

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.660
Gene was very instrumental
in working with us

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.500
to move the wax cylinders
out to the Culpepper facility

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.900
and really kind of jump starting
and pushing this project

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.200
and getting it started.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.500
So it's wonderful to see you.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.430
Glad you're here.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.050
And with that said, I think
you'll be hearing a little bit

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.030
more about the history and bits
and pieces of these projects

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.030
as we begin our conversation.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.740
And so I would just like
to welcome Donald Soctomah

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.430
to the podium, or you
may actually just sit

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.600
and probably talk from there.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.100
Is that all right?

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.550
Ok... So thank you.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.900
Donald.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.640
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah: Thank you.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.410
I'm happy to be here and
be part of the process

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.070
on the, wax cylinders.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:54.920
This truly is - ancestral voices
returning back to the tribe.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.380
It's so powerful to hear a voice
128 years ago of a grandfather,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.890
a great grandfather that
could be lost in time.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.820
But what's really powerful
is they're singing songs

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:19.570
and telling stories that haven't
been told, haven't been sung.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.940
We've spent two years?

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.290
almost three [laughter] and
every time I take the recordings

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.770
to elderly in our
community to hear,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.750
I get different types
of reactions.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.210
The first type of
reaction is emotional.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.050
And I thought about that.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.070
What, you know, to me, this
is powerful, but I was trying

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.650
to think of different reasons
for the strong emotion.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:57.780
And it - it came to me that the
language that's being spoken is

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.580
the same accent that the elders'
grandparents probably talked

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.000
to them, the same
accent, the same words.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.300
It's so powerful.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:12.070
So, it takes them back a couple
generations and then the memory

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.500
from the voices goes back
another couple of generations.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:26.320
And, and the - the songs, the
war songs, the trading songs,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.970
the stories that are on
these cylinders, they're...

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.440
they're just- just amazing,
because they're parts

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.040
of our history at
certain time periods.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:44.100
The war song - you know,
if we think back into time,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.530
the last big war
that the tribe was

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.810
in was the American
Revolution in 1776.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.860
The chief at our
time, at that time,

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.500
was Chief Francis
Joseph Neptune.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.360
So we were able to piece this
together, because, remember,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.220
wax cylinders are only
two to three minutes

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.400
and native songs can go for
15 to 20 minutes, you know.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.950
So we're getting just a
piece of the pie on that.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.940
So we have a little view back
into the American Revolution -

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.480
a view from the eyes and
the voice of the ancestors.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.070
It - that's so powerful,
you know.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.890
And one of the stories
talks about -

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.780
talks about different
legends of the tribe

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.510
that have been passed on,

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.180
that some of the stories
I've heard growing up,

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.030
but I haven't heard
them complete

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.880
like they are in
the wax cylinder.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.630
It's... pretty powerful.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.130
We took the wax cylinders and
we sat with a group of elders -

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.960
I think the average age
was probably seventy-five

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.870
and Dwayne - Dwayne's the
youngest fluent speaker

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.480
in our tribe.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.810
And, that's - that's
quite a comment,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.810
because the youngest
fluent speaker

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:21.320
in our tribe...I can't remember
how old you are, but it's -

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.520
it's about fifty and
he's right there,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.770
and everybody [else
is] above that age.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.100
It just - the fluency
rate keeps increasing.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.570
And so right now I think it's
over the age of sixty-five,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.590
almost all the people in our
community over sixty-five,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.680
I'd say ninety percent
are fluent speakers.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.150
They were raised speaking
the language and they had

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.590
that memory going
back into time.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.700
And then it just goes down-

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.500
percentage wise -to
our children today

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.640
that they hear words
here and there.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.430
This- last three years
we were pretty lucky.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.130
We started a language immersion
school for children three

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:09.760
to five, and this is the
first batch of kids growing

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.500
up hearing the language,
so it's bringing that back.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.200
So, we -we took the
cylinders to the teachers,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.120
to the master speakers and the
elders, and they sat in a circle

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.860
and we kept trying to make
the words out because some

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.550
of the songs are pretty -
pretty hard to understand -

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.540
because of the scratches,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.810
but some of the songs are
[audible and] you can hear them

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:44.430
and you can feel the
emotion from the singer.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:50.640
And we had some debate on some
of the words and the meaning,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.220
because languages
over time changes.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.840
And - the English language
I know has changed,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.430
because I've tried to read
some old English books

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.210
and it's almost impossible
[laughter].

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.740
But even with Passamaquoddy, our
language has changed over time

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.140
in the last hundred years.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.610
It's changed.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.250
The words have gotten
a little bit shorter -

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.630
and some of the words
are out of use because -

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:26.270
we don't have these stories
of legendary creatures

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.640
like the Apotmakin You don't
hear that word very much.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.250
It's a sea serpent, so
you don't hear the legend

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.670
of the sea serpent very much,
so it sort of gets out of use,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.990
but these wax cylinders
are bringing them back,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.690
bringing them back into
use, bringing the songs

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.760
that the singers
haven't heard before.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.910
[There are] a couple of
the songs we still use

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:57.340
in our Indian Day ceremonies,
but I - I can say that some

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.270
of them I've never heard
before [and] I don't think any

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.980
of the master speakers in our
community have heard before.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.320
So it's bringing a
gift back to the tribe.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.570
And we're - we're at a
critical moment in our tribe

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.260
where language fluency
is - every year it goes

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.200
down a whole percentage point.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.990
So last time I was here, it
was - we were at ten per cent

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.000
of our population
were fluent speakers.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.660
Now it's probably down to eight
percent because the elders,

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.560
every elder - that's a
fluent speaker right there.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.380
So this comes at
an important time.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:43.640
It's giving some of us, a sort
of a shot in the arm of energy,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.280
[and we're] saying, "Okay,
this is what we're going to do.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.750
We're going to bring
this forward."

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.630
And - and it energizes
other people,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:56.080
it energizes the
singers in our community.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.000
I've had so many requests
from tribal - tribal singers

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.390
in our community - because they
want to hear the wax cylinders

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.920
and they want to sing the songs.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.930
So to me, this is a
great project and it's

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:21.230
so much work ahead and so
much work has been done and -

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:26.150
the Mukurtu site is one way.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.330
We put this all together onto
a Mukurtu site and Jane's going

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.040
to talk about [that], then Kim's
going to talk about that later,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.600
but for us it gives us
a little bit of control

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.550
on our cultural films,
music books,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.860
and the tribe's able to...have
a little bit of control

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.310
on our stuff that
we've never had before.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.130
And that's, that's pretty
powerful on its own.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:14:00.360
Everybody else has had
control over our songs,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:07.410
over our stories [but]
this puts it back on to us.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.110
And to me that's the
way it should be,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.310
because our ancestors
shared the stories.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.220
They didn't give the stories to
anybody, but they shared them.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.840
And then for the tribe -
there's a tribe in Canada,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.930
it's one of our neighbors,
they- they shared the stories

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.830
with a writer in the
mid-eighteen hundreds

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.080
and this writer said, "I'm
just going to document this

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.630
and I'm going to return
this back to the tribe."

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.280
Well, before he completed
[it], he passed on,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.030
and his family got a
hold of the stories

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.870
and the family told
the tribe that -

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.580
that they have the copyright,
those are their stories,

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.090
and they [the tribe] were
being threatened to go to court

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:02.300
because those were the
writer's stories - copyrighted.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.230
So the tribe was in
a turmoil, you know,

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.380
these are ours ...how can
anyone claim these stories?!

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:15.770
So - we're learning a lot
through this whole process,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:22.220
especially with expertise that
helps us understand [the law].

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:28.130
Personally, I know what rights,
you know, my ancestors story,

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.940
my ancestors song belongs
to the Passamaquoddy tribe.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.960
But the way laws
are today, you know,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.330
it just makes everything
a little bit harder.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.580
So - I'm grateful for being
here for the opportunity to work

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:52.700
with all these wonderful people,
for the Library of Congress and,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.540
and for ones in the
back there that -

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.610
that have been working
just as hard.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:07.880
It's - it, it takes a
team to make things work.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.060
And that's what I see
here - a good team.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.310
I want to thank you.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:21.310
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar:
Thank you very much.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.610
Donald.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.380
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah:
We're going to play the-

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.650
what was called a
trading song - when,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.660
when Fewkes put the
titles together,

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.680
he just put a basic title on it.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:47.100
I don't think he wanted to go
into detail, because his job was

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:56.570
to record and so things were
just labeled as "trading song"

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:02.870
or "war song one," "war song
two" or "war song three,"

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.080
but there's different
- categories of trade,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.390
different types of trading.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:17.420
In our- our history that's been
written, the tribes are known

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.600
for their trading skills.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.190
When the explorers came over
[from Europe] in their journals,

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:27.300
they said, "Well, these guys
know how to deal in a trade.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:33.750
I wanted to trade this - cook
pan for one beaver skin -

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:41.130
but I ended up giving two
pots for the one beaver skin!"

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.670
[laughter] So the tribe was well
known for its trading skills

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.860
and that's a part of survival.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.340
So our tribe has - what I've
seen - three trading songs

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.310
over time, and one's
interesting -

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.680
its called a "clown
trading song.".

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.040
And the clown trading
song is ...wintertime -

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.910
everybody's in the
wigwam and you're sitting

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:07.750
around the fire staying
warm, and you sort of,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.650
you're preparing the
kids for the big trade.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.970
So you're making fun of
the trader, you know,

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.560
the one that's going to come
in: "Oh, he's coming in,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.460
he's coming in with baggy
clothes, he's coming in."

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:24.040
And then there's the
other type of trade, the -

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:30.390
the trade where you're going
- trading the good for a good

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.290
at equal, equal par
and everything.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:38.780
So - what we're going to
play here is the Trading Song

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.130
and this is the one that
the children - picked up.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:51.650
We played it at a - at a - well,
one of the - we had the group

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:56.400
of immersion children that
were learning the language

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.800
and they sat at the table and
the teacher sat at the table -

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.230
the teachers are
master speakers.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.030
So when...

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.580
one teacher heard that,
it started coming back

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.580
to her she remembers hearing
that when she was a young girl.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:47.760
[Song from Passamaquoddy
Collection: The Trading Song"

00:19:47.760 --> 00:20:20.000
by Newell Josephs, 1890]

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.290
&gt;&gt; So we worked on this
song for a couple months.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:28.130
It's a short song, but I
worked with Wayne Newell

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:32.590
on this song and he...

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:37.210
we went over word by word, just
stopping the music and going

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:44.270
through and he's in his
late eighties maybe,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.460
and he's never heard
that song before.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.290
So it, it took us a while for
him to put the words together.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:21:02.890
And - he was amazed,
he was really amazed.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:09.360
So this song was done by
Peter...Peter Selmore.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.190
So I, I tried to do a little bio
on Peter Selmore, but one thing

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:20.480
about our tribe - we have
sort of like a name game.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.850
The traditional names
today - aren't really -

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:34.490
it's not our custom, but when
- when, a father has a son,

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.950
they'll call him Little
Joseph, so he'll be - Josap,

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.790
they'll say Little Joseph,
you know, in English,

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.500
they'll call him that
and then - then his,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:54.420
his father's last name
becomes the son's first name,

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.200
so you're trying to
follow this on a census.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.650
And then his son takes
his father's last name

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.590
as his first name, so it's
switching back and forth.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.660
And then somewhere in
the mix there'll be,

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.250
maybe a nickname
becomes a first name.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.440
So I've come across
..three Peter Selmore,

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.830
and his nickname was
kci-kakak, which,

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.590
which means the Crow, the Raven.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:36.240
So, his father -- I found
last night in a document,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.940
and his father couldn't
speak English,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.210
he refused to speak French.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.690
So he only spoke Passamaquoddy,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.380
because French was
a second language

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.320
in the eighteen hundreds
of the tribe.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:55.470
And then English sort of took
over in the nineteen hundreds.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.770
So he had a brother named
Peter Selmore, well,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.500
a cousin that also took the
name, so finding the birth date

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.660
in the census material is
usually - it's never right on -

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.800
from the 1860 census
to the 1880 census.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.310
And then in the middle we
have the church census,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.060
the baptismals and marriages.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.790
So everything, the years
might be off one or two.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:28.390
And, then Noel Joseph, the
other singer, his name I found

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:36.140
on the 1880 census, three Noel
Josephs and tracking them back

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.070
into time is sort of
like a detective story.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:44.130
I'm trying to find out a
little bit about each singer.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.830
And Peter Lacoot.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:52.340
He sang one song and originally
he wasn't listed in the -

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.410
in the document as
being a singer,

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:00.460
but somebody did some
careful listening..

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.870
. I think it was Kelly?

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.460
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Kelly Revak

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.760
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah: Yep...

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.540
Kelly did some real
good listening

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.220
and she heard the
word "Peter Lacoot."

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.200
So, I got a phone
call and it said

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.770
"There's another singer
on the wax cylinder!"

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.960
[laughs] So we started
researching Peter Lacoot and -

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.380
he spent a lot of
his time in Canada

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.230
because we're a border tribe.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.410
Half of our aboriginal
land is in Canada

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.170
and the other half is in Maine.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:36.710
So Peter Lacoot happened to
be a guide for this family

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.420
that owned a big lodge
on the St. Croix and -

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.740
they took a picture of him.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.870
So it was one of
the rare pictures ,

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.440
t was the only picture
of Lacoot.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.200
We were lucky with Noel Joseph.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.310
There's a nice picture
of Noel Joseph -

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.400
and we're still searching
for Peter Selmore.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.950
I know he'll show up sometime...

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:02.490
so I don't know if you wanted
to show the video of...?

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.150
Okay, so that' s my part.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:12.860
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Thank you
so much for that, Donald.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.250
Let me introduce, please, Nicki
Saylor, Head of the Archives

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.080
at the American Folklife
Center, and she's going to talk

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.800
to us a little bit
about the terms

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.990
of the tech infrastructure,
web access

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.970
and other matters as are needed.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.270
&gt;&gt; Nicki Saylor: Hi.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:36.450
First of all - I 'd just like
to say that I'm really proud

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.070
of our institution for
committing real resources

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.910
and real energy into
making this thing happen.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.910
I think, you know, when you
work in a federal agency,

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.050
you have a real appreciation

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.680
for how hard something
like this is to do.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.550
And so I just want to spend a
minute shouting out to a few

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.080
of my colleagues who really,
really deserve the praise.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.920
I want to mention the folks

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.480
at the National Audiovisual
Conservation Center -

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.300
Rob Christarella, Rob Friedrich,
Gene Deanna and a host

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.400
of other engineers who-
and Mr. [David] Giovanonni,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.860
who was a help as well...

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.290
just got this thing off
the ground as mentioned.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.780
What you'll see in this record
are three different versions

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.340
of the recording.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.280
You'll see something that is the
flat transfer from the cylinder.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.130
And correct me anytime I
don't say anything right.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.450
There's a flat transfer from
the cylinder to digital.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.670
Then there is a flat
transfer from the tape

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.330
that was made during the
Federal Cylinder Project.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.600
And then there was something
that was snazzed up -

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.070
with a machine called
Cedar, Cedar Systems.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:50.330
Yes. So it was - enhanced
for your listening pleasure.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.980
And so we've decided to show all
three of, or provide all three

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.840
of those so that you can get
the full effect and understand

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.710
if you're an engineering
audio geek,

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.040
you can really compare
them and stuff.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.630
So enjoy that.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:09.470
I also want to thank the folks
from - the user experience team,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.980
the R &amp;D web services team,
in particular Jamie Bresner,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.070
Barrack Stussman, Krista
Maher, Bill Kellum.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.730
I pulled out a report,
actually it was a proposal

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.340
to the Web Governance Board Way
back in 2015 when we first said,

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.520
"hey, will you let us put
the stuff on the Internet,"

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.250
which you think would
be no problem.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:29.600
You just push a button, right?

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.360
But that is not how it is here.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.860
And especially to be - to be
able to associate these labels

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.510
with their audio
recording is a big deal.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.190
It requires custom,
I think, as Hope said

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.170
in the meeting this
morning, amazingly..

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.460
artisanal approach...in
this environment.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.960
So, I'm very grateful
for, for them.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.040
And...finally I want
to mention the folks

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.550
in the American Folklife Center.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:01.530
So of course Judith Gray, Maggie
Kruesi, Kelly Revak, Julia Kim,

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:07.440
Guha Shankar, Ann Hoog, John
Fenn and the list goes on.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.760
Everyone had a hand in moving
the bits, doing the metadata,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.980
you know, all, all
manner of things.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.420
So I'm very happy about that.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.810
So, I think what we're doing is
we're stopping at the endpoint

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.930
and then working backward
into sort of how we got here.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.000
So we'll just get right to it.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.880
What you're looking at as
a single cylinder record

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.540
and three different
versions of it.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.840
Can I scroll down?

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.900
No. Okay. Well you're
missing the money

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.970
because [laughter] anyway,
look it on your own.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:42.830
But it has wonderfully robust
metadata that has been provided

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:47.920
by the tribe and it is
translated, it's contextualized,

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.480
it's finally, we're able
to do this co-curation

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.950
that we've long talked about.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.710
And so - and it's, it's sort
of antithetical to notions

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.350
of open access and scale
and all these things

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.650
that libraries prize.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.200
And so - we aren't done.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.440
We may not be done,
whatever done is -

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.280
with this for a while,
but that's okay.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.410
We're in it- we're
in it to win it.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.370
And so - it will take ..

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.950
the time that it takes,
but enjoy that record

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.790
and there'll be more
where, where that came from.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.090
Okay. Thanks.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.530
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar:
Thank you, Nicki.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.750
So let me call up
our indefatigable

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.940
and intrepid a partners in
crime here, Kim Christian

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.040
from Washington State
University and Jane Anderson

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.310
from New York University
and respectively Mukurtu

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:39.170
and Local Contexts....and I
see Jane's going to be first.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.360
So, that's looking out
the corner of my eye.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.180
Thank you.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.480
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson:
Thank you all so much

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.240
for coming to this presentation.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.630
I know some of you have seen
different kinds of incarnations

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.640
of this project over
the last several years

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.640
as we've presented
little pieces of it.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.110
As has already been
said, it's not over yet.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.410
This is kind of..

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.460
we got to an important
stage where we really wanted

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.760
to share what we've
been able to do

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.700
and actually also
share the process,

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.300
some of the work behind
it...what the invisible labor is

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.850
that leads to this
kind of thing happening

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.150
in the Library of Congress.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.160
And also what is, as
a parallel journey,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.360
happening with the
Passamaquoddy as well.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.630
I really want to thank everybody
at the Library of Congress

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.210
who has been involved
in this project.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.190
It's been incredible
to be part of.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.360
I want to also think Kim, but
I also want to thank Donald

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.660
and Dwayne for all the work

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.010
that we've been doing
together on this project.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.540
And in my presentation,
I want to bring some

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.330
of the other voices
from Passamaquoddy

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.100
into the room today who
weren't able to make it.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:47.610
So, Kim and I...dually - co-ly-
represent Local Contexts.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.330
I'm going to talk a little
bit about Local Contexts

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:53.530
which was developed in
2012 as a digital platform

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.430
to create different
kinds of pathways

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.200
for indigenous communities to
deal with intellectual property

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.960
around the collections that they
don't necessarily hold legal

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.190
title over and yet are
the cultural authorities

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.620
and are not recognized as such
in the archives, libraries

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.750
and museums in this country
and around the world.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:15.290
This project really
began because we knew

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.590
that there was a
really big problem

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.230
that indigenous communities
were, have been [facing],

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.630
particularly as this
material is being digitized

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.010
and re-circulated ...

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:26.320
problems in the original records
- that those names of the people

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.310
who were integral
to the production

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.430
of those materials
were not recorded

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.730
at that particular time.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.280
And so as this material became
digitized, those names continued

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.490
to not circulate
with that material.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.490
So the Local Contexts platform
has two major components.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.970
The first part is an
educational component.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.300
It does a lot of
work educating tribes

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.760
around Intellectual
Property law.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.410
It provides template documents.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.820
It provides a whole
range of training modules

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.650
around intellectual property.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.950
And the other part

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.710
of the platform are these
Traditional Knowledge labels.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:05.670
These really might be understood
as digital tags or protocols,

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.080
community protocols
that have been,

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.720
that have taken a digital form
which allow for a protocol

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.310
to travel with material, to
travel with a digital item.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.670
We have seventeen labels that
we've developed in collaboration

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.970
with about the twenty
communities

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.660
that we have been working
with over the last four years.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.520
And they range on a
spectrum, I'm not really going

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.630
to show them to you, but
they range on a spectrum

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.150
from multiple communities
or a label that indicates

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.450
that there are multiple
communities

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.490
that have responsibility
over certain kind of piece

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.400
of heritage to secret,

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.490
sacred material to...culturally
sensitive material

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:45.290
to attribution to outreach.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.670
There's seventeen there

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.680
and they're all...what they
do is they provide nuance

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.120
in how indigenous communities
would like that material

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.690
to be circulated
into the future.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.840
And that kind of nuance,
once you get into the project

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.140
and you look at the ways

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.300
in which communities are
defining what attribution is

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.130
for them, what outreach
means for that community,

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:08.170
you really see not only
the different contours

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.700
of how we want to think
about sharing information,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.420
but that every community has
their own way of doing that.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.970
So, one of the labels, and I'll
just give you this quick example

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.250
of the attribution label,
because it is the label

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.090
that every community
chooses to use

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.820
because the attribution
is what has been missing

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.120
from the record.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.390
And in this sense, what
we did with this project,

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.340
the particular kind
of a pivot point,

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.770
is that the icon
itself remains the same.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.200
That's why you've been able
to see the icon in the Library

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.650
of Congress record, but the
text and the description

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.940
of what attribution means is
where every community is able

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.880
to assert their own sovereignty
around what that means for them,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.770
including translating it
into their own language,

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.830
which is what the
Passamaquoddy have done.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.830
The Passamaquoddy have
three labels that they chose

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.150
for these particular
sound recordings.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.630
We have the non-commercial
label,

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.540
we have the outreach label,
and we have, of course,

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.440
we have the attribution label.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.100
So when we - in 2016,

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.140
we repatriated the
thirty-one digital files

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.290
to the Passamaquoddy nation...to
the elders and to the children

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.740
from the communities,
and we left them there

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.040
with no strings attached.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.770
And then since 2016,
I've been doing a lot

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.070
of travel up to Passamaquoddy.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.430
Donald's been creating enormous
amounts of listening circles,

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:27.240
just trying to hear
what's on these recordings.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.210
And so we're dealing
with two minutes of sound

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.280
for one recording and for
a while were just working

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.750
on one recording.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.370
It took nearly a year...

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.290
and we were playing
it again and again,

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.230
stopping it every twenty seconds
to see what could be heard

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.530
or what couldn't be heard.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.620
And it was enormous
amounts of work!

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.000
And the concentration
that was needed to do

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.990
that over several days.

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:56.370
And that kind of process,
which has been, you know,

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:59.420
since we began it, we've
kind of streamlined it

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.720
in a different kind of way.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.680
And now we have, you know, we
now have three records that are

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.050
in the Library of Congress.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.620
They happened really quickly.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.470
We have another four that we're
working on with Passamaquoddy

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.890
that are going to be
incorporated into the Library

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.190
of Congress [records].

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.900
So the kind of...we've worked
out a process that has sped

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.180
up a little bit, this work
of sharing the information

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.820
that Passamaquoddy have
been determining is

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.580
on these cylinders.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.300
So I want to show you a...

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.230
just an example, of what
this process looks like.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:31.410
This is Molly Neptune
Parker, and she's listening

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:33.510
to a one of these cylinders.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:36:34.280
[Molly Neptune Parker
speaking in Passamaquoddy

00:36:34.280 --> 00:37:35.040
and English while
listening to recording]

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.460
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: So you can
kind of get a sense of like,

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.170
the difficulty of, like
this constant listening,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:43.210
trying to pick out words, make
sense of them and then trying

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.000
to kind of work out what
that is as a sentence or...

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.550
and then what it is as
a song and, you know,

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:52.310
we have these very, very limited
descriptions from Fewkes.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.830
I think this one is Peter Lacoot

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.170
who actually Molly is a
direct [descendant] of,

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.290
who actually is singing
what - well, first of all,

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.070
he wasn't in the
record to start with.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.840
Kelly found that [out] and
we went through the notebooks

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.030
of Fewkes and we found that
there was a tiny reference

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.420
to him in there in
relationship to this song

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.620
and then it's subsequently
titled "War Song".

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.690
And so then we're kind of
going, "What is a war song?

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:15.990
It doesn't sound
like a war song.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.300
What does a war song
sound like?"

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.610
...kind of thinking through
what does a war song sound like.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.730
And then, as Molly was
starting to [listen]...

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:25.550
so this also a two part process.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.030
First, there's listening to
the tiny little pieces of words

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:33.490
and stitching them together
and then there's this part...

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.640
&gt;&gt; Molly Neptune Parker:
So that's more than one.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.020
Him and whoever...he didn't say.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.370
He said he was going to go
hunting and they were going

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:47.610
to go hunting, not just him -
they were going to go hunting,

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:52.380
and when they get to wherever
their hunting place is,

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.710
they said that they're going
to...they built a place

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.240
to stay - they must have
built some kind of a shelter.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.940
And then he started ...

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.700
now, I don't know when
he started the story,

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:09.170
whether it was during, maybe
like dinner or something

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.650
or on the way when
they were gathering,

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.520
depending on how many
people they were,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.980
because they usually
tell stories when there's

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:21.230
at least a handful of people
and they always went hunting

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:26.800
by groups, not just
by themselves.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.500
So that's all I can tell.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.450
But there, what bothers
me is one word

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.720
that he used [Passamaquoddy
word]

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.370
and I think that's what he said.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.670
Yeah.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.720
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson:
So you can see ...

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.160
then there's adding the
larger cultural context

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.140
of what kind of, what
would they be speaking,

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.920
when would they be saying
this, what does this mean

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.470
within the larger context of
the Passamaquoddy tribe itself

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.580
and so what we have as a
tiny record called "War Song"

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.390
that Fewkes wrote down
is immeasurably increased

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:04.210
when communities are part of
listening and adding this rich,

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.720
rich data to kind
of what we have.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.620
And this is happening,
you know, in 2018

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.740
and these recordings
are from 1890.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.090
So that kind of work
takes a really long time,

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.990
but it's incredibly valuable.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.700
The one key part I want to
tell you about this project

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.240
which I think is very important,
and just before handing

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.540
over to Kim, is that as we've
been doing this work together,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.410
we've been creating
a parallel site

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:30.120
which is the Passamaquoddy
Mukurtu site, which is where all

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.420
of this material that
we've been gathering lives

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.580
and it's full of Passamaquoddy.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.430
It's all the different kinds
of rich textual analysis,

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.260
understanding, interpretation

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.620
that each community
that will add ...

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.500
[that] the Passamaquoddy
community has been adding

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.990
as we go through each song.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.170
And that just becomes enormous.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.650
And so we've been building

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.380
that into Passamaquoddy's own
Mukurtu site for it to live

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.780
as another kind of record,
another kind of document,

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.780
another kind of place
that is really

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.180
for Passamaquoddy
interpretation.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.480
And so we have these kind

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.650
of two different sites
now for this material.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.660
We have the AFC record

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.880
which tells a very
particular kind of story.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.820
We also have the AFC record
pointing back to the authority

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.580
of the Passamaquoddy community,
which is where authority

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.040
over this material
really does lie.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:23.160
And with that, I'm going
to hand it over to Kim.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.920
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen:
Thank you, everybody.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.870
First, I have to thank all of
you for coming and acknowledge

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:35.720
that 2008 was a banner year for
me because I met Guha and Jane

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.820
and here we are a decade later.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:44.990
And that was because Guha saw me
give a presentation on what was

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.570
yet to be Mukurtu CMS, the free

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.590
and open source content
management system

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.770
and community access
platform that it is today.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.180
And he said, "I think
this is something!

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.660
I have to introduce
you to some people."

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.070
And he introduced me to
Rachel Frick, who was then

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.200
at the Institute of Museum
and Library Services,

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.060
where we got our first
grant, our second grant

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.130
for Mukurtu, to build Mukurtu.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.500
I met Rachel Frick, Mary
Alice Ball from the IMLS.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.290
Before that, in 2008

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:20.630
after meeting Jane....and
talking this through...and one

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.350
of my collaborators in
Australia where Mukurtu started,

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:27.700
where it comes from...had
been stymied by trying

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.040
to put a copyright on something.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.730
She said," I know
this is our material,

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.580
can't we just put
a copyright on it?"

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.220
And I'm no lawyer, but
I know people who are.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.260
But I knew we couldn't
just put a copyright on it.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.650
And so this wonderful
relationship with Jane started

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.770
where we started thinking,
what can we do in that?

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:47.770
And I dug out my
very first NEH Office

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:52.650
of Digital Humanities startup
grant in 2008 and it had that -

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:57.430
we said we were going to,
with $50,000, you know,

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:00.400
not only build the software
platform, but also the licenses

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.650
and also do all this
stuff and, you know...

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:03.950
thank God, you know.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:07.870
But anyway, they were there, the
idea was there, this is all part

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.000
of - I think what all
of us are saying today,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.710
is this is all a process.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:15.570
It's a slow process and it's
a slow process for a reason.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:19.810
So, and I also want to thank
the NEH who has funded Mukurtu

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.520
and specifically Jen
Serventi and Jason Rohde.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.790
Yes, NEH, yes, IMLS, but
there are people there

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.090
who champion these things

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.840
and we should honor
those people as well.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.600
So Mukurtu CMS, like
I said, it's a free

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.300
and open source content
management system,

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.960
but there's four things
that set Mukurtu apart.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.420
And like I said, it grew out of
my work in central Australia.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.430
Mukurtu literally
means "dilly bag"

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:46.080
and a dilly bag is a
safe keeping place.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.350
So for the Warumungu people who
I started working with in 1995

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.320
to build this, this
was the idea:

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.280
to create a digital safe
keeping place - that same sort

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.330
of keeping place
that that dilly bag

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.100
that held those sacred items.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.500
So what Mukurtu, the
content management system -

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.250
there are four things that
sort of set it apart -

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.980
we have this cultural
protocol based access.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.940
So what Donald was
saying, how do we ensure

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.960
that the protocols we
already have offline are

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.300
respected online.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.950
So Mukurtu allows that
for any community.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.800
We also have multiple
records and extended metadata.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.100
So you'll see in a minute

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.370
that any one item can
have multiple records

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:27.330
because as we've seen, this
trading song isn't just

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:31.410
that one record with one
authoritative voice telling us

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.710
about that.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.720
. And we have a suite
of functions,

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.590
that we call round trip, that
allows you to get things easily

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.770
in and out and share them
with other institutions -

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.410
specifically though,
using selective sync.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.890
So if the Passamaquoddy don't
want to share everything,

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:47.240
then they don't have to.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.540
So that's built in.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.430
And then, of course,
finally, the TK labels.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.680
So all of these come around
in the Passamaquoddy site,

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.070
which you can see here,
"Passamaquoddy people:

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.720
At home on the Ocean and Lakes",

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.750
and it's a beautiful
reminder -this site -that all

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:06.230
of these materials are
grounded in a place.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.530
I mean, this..

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.840
this is why it's just, it's so
amazing to see this, that Donald

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.190
and all the people that work
with him have put this together.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.350
So, of course, I want
to acknowledge Donald

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.610
and Ashley who's worked
with Donald, and at WSU -

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:23.100
Michael Wynne, Alex Merrill, and
Steve Taylor, who've done a lot

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.120
of the technical
heavy lifting here.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.690
But, we start and we're grounded
in place and then we sort

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.510
of continue...and it
grounds us a bit further.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:44.110
[playing Passamaquoddy
greeting from website]

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.910
&gt;&gt; So we're grounded in the
place and the language right

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.780
to begin when we come to
this site, and Mukurtu allows

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.390
for the sort of, you know,
the high level navigation

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:56.720
at the top can be
customized by each community.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.840
And so Donald and the
Passamaquoddy have

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.140
customized this.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.700
So on their "About" page you
can see the contextualization

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.400
continues and we
have Passamaquoddy

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.060
and English going back and
forth throughout the site

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.190
and it starts in the
"About" page and you learn

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:16.400
about the Passamaquoddy people
and why this is important.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.510
And then we have a prayer.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:45.060
[audio playing Passamaquoddy
prayer from website]

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.770
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: And you can
also see at the bottom there,

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.500
the footer that runs throughout
the site that was very important

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.610
to -- there's three communities
that make up the Passamaquoddy.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.010
So they're all listed there.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:57.050
So each of these elements is
starting to build a people,

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.960
a place, why these
are important.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.190
And we come to the
Passamaquoddy history.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:05.620
And this tells a history of
the tribe in the northeast

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.310
and the emphasis is on place

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:09.890
and the multiple types
of relationships.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.910
And there's a section on
contemporary events that sort

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:16.700
of brings us up to the
present and, of course,

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.730
this can always be
added to and Donald

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.710
and his group have
been adding to this

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.890
over the last few months
and will continue to.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.830
It's one of those other things
that's sort of never done.

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:30.260
There's also a full
informational page that's

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.160
dedicated to the TK labels.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:36.120
So this was a choice that the
Passamaquoddy made to...really

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.400
let people know why are there
these labels, when you get

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.160
to a record, what -why are there
these labels and what are they?

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.120
So you can see on this page,
there's an explanation,

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.200
not only the translation
into Passamaquoddy and then

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.820
into English of what that means,
but also a section on, well,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.190
why did we want to use these?

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:58.250
And as Donald said at the
beginning, the contextualization

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:01.370
at the top is that we're
the rightful owners

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:04.150
of these materials, we're
the cultural authorities,

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.450
no matter who the sort

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.860
of western legal
copyright holder is.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.690
So it's really bringing
us back to that

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:12.770
and that was very purposeful
and I'm sure if I'm Donald wants

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.630
to talk about that
later, he can.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:18.090
[With] each of the labels
also - there's an audio file

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:19.960
so people can hear this
[audio from website].

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:26.230
So we have the attribution
"Elihtasik" -" how it is done".

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.760
I think that's a
wonderful, you know,

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.500
sort of translation
for attribution.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.300
And so we get this sort
of richness behind it.

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.580
As we're starting off with
these 31 wax cylinders

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.360
that were taken back to
the tribe that we took back

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.880
in April 2016, then as
we started putting those

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.360
into the Mukurtu site,
all these other ideas

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.110
for other collections
came about, well,

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:50.560
what else can we
put into the site?

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.820
And they've used the
new collection feature

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.190
in Mukurtu quite extensively
to curate these materials.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:57.490
So we can see at the top -

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:01.330
we have the 1890 wax cylinder
collection from the AFC

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.800
and then we have several
other collections.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.520
One that's shared on the site,
for instance, is the Daughters

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.320
of the American Revolution
collection.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.170
So this was important for
many historical reasons.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:15.290
And also because it holds
one of the only photos

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:20.590
of Mrs. Wallace Brown and she's
central to this 1890 story,

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:23.090
because she introduced
Jesse Walter Fewkes

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.160
to the Passamaquoddy community.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.310
That's how we get the 1890
wax cylinder recordings.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:30.290
So again, it's stitching
this together

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:31.770
in a very purposeful way.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.660
We saw these collections,
you know,

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.170
it isn't this just
what can we digitize,

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:37.730
let's digitize it and put it up.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.710
It's very purposeful
at every step

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.210
to tell this sort
of community story.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:46.820
And each of these collections
on the site highlights how

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.060
that knowledge is built
through these relationships.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.900
And right now I know that
Donald - they're working

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.710
on a contemporary
collection of basket makers

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:57.110
to feature on the site.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.280
So again, it's sort
of spurring this.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:03.580
And finally we get to the
1890 recordings...along

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:07.250
with other content by
browsing the main site.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.540
So we have "browse
digital heritage" here.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:14.570
We - in Mukurtu, each discrete
element is called a digital

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:17.410
heritage item to kind
of really break away

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.320
from that notion
of a single record.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.660
And so we can finally
get to the trading song

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.090
where we sort of began.

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:30.160
The important thing about
the trading song here is

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.470
that there are two tabs
across the top that you see.

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:37.820
These are the individual
records for this same material.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.600
So here you can see..

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.790
is the first AFC records.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:46.520
So this is what we had on the
first export that Maggie Kruesi

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.670
and others exported
from the AFC to Mukurtu.

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:52.970
We had this very sort
of sparse record.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:57.300
You can just see a brief summary
and a description and that's all

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.100
that there was But
if we tab over then

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.140
over the next two
years, what we see

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.880
at the top right is now there
are seven related items.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.280
So again, we start with
that one wax cylinder.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.500
Now the Passamaquoddy have
added seven related items

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.210
to this one song.

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:16.370
And as we scroll down, we get
to the Mukurtu metadata fields,

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:19.200
which are those expanded
fields I told you about before.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.350
And now we see the TK
labels on the right.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:25.280
We see the cultural narrative
and the traditional knowledge

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.880
on the left by community
members.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:32.790
And then we get to, because in
Mukurtu over time -every feature

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:34.530
and function is Mukurtu
is driven

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:38.370
by indigenous communities needs
and communities came back to us

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.840
and said, "we need
audio, we need video,"

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.550
because traditional knowledge
and cultural narratives aren't,

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.310
you know, don't necessarily
lend themselves to text.

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:50.060
So we made these
fields open to video

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.300
and Donald mentioned before,
Gracie Davis - not by name-

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.060
but he was speaking about Gracie
Davis, who when she first heard

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.360
that the trading song.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:03.680
So in 2016 when we took
back those wax cylinders

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.580
that morning, Guha, Jane
and I were there along

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:10.340
with a room full of
Passamaquoddy children

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.900
in the immersion
preschool and the elders

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.200
who were the speakers.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.500
And we started playing the song.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.330
And the first time
everybody listened.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:21.510
And then the second time
through something else happened.

00:52:21.510 --> 00:53:50.080
[video excerpt of Gracie Davis
singing in Passamaquoddy]

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.520
&gt;&gt; Donald and others joined in,

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.230
as they were singing
along there.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.870
And then as this circulated,
and as Donald mentioned

00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:59.390
over a year later,
when Gracie was working

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:03.810
with the immersion preschool
children, now that song is taken

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:06.510
to the children as well

00:54:06.510 --> 00:55:00.250
[video excerpt of children
singing in Passamaquoddy]

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:06.270
&gt;&gt; So it's sort of a wonderful
example of starting with this,

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:07.670
you know, that Donald
was talking about -

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:09.960
starting with this
one, two minute clip

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.270
and what it's generated
in the community

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.400
and how they're using
Mukurtu in..the community,

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.890
and what's given
back to the Library

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.590
of Congress as, as
Nicki mentioned.

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:20.970
So that cultural narrative
and traditional knowledge

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:24.100
that text was round, tripped
back to Library of Congress

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.090
and it's there, but these
videos remained for the past it

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.940
on their site and they can
choose to make those public

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.660
or as open or as
not as they want.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.570
And another thing that happened
is that original Library

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:41.220
of Congress record has the
Traders song on it as well

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.310
as the "Song of Remembrance"
and over consultation

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:45.750
with this community we find

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.660
out that those two
should actually be split.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.540
So in their Mukurtu site,
they have a second record.

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.790
So this isn't mirrored in
the Library of Congress,

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:55.630
because this is what the
tribe decided to do themselves

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:59.860
with that record- is now
create...a second record.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.640
Similar to the "Trading song"
the community also have cultural

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.880
narrative and traditional
knowledge there.

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:10.160
And you can see the Traditional
Knowledge labels on every song.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.560
And again, so the site,
once it goes live -

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.280
we're still on a staging
site - but once it goes live,

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.830
the community can decide on
the protocols for access.

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:22.410
And so already in the site we
see community-only protocols,

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.560
we see public, and it's again,

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.390
kind of what Donald was
going back to - that process

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:30.800
of curation and this sort
of community curation

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.900
that we've been doing -
collaborative curation -

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:37.420
over the last two years that
started with those 31 cylinders

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.210
and deciding - sort of
ethically and responsibly

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:43.760
who should manage those and
how they should be shared

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.790
and how they should be accessed.

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.750
And so that's all
I have [applause]

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:57.270
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Thank
you, Kim and all.

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:59.380
I think we're going to,
before we take questions,

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.460
we're going to conclude
this portion

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:06.740
of our...afternoon together
with a song and some remarks

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:14.920
from Donald and from Dwayne.

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:26.420
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah:
Wow, it looks real good!

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:34.590
I'm really impressed with
the way it was put together.

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:38.080
And this says it all.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.510
It's really powerful.

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:43.690
This is Dwayne Tomah.

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:48.860
I said he's the youngest
fluent speaker of the tribe

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:55.020
and I've known him since he
was - this high [gestures

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.320
to the ground; laughter].

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.650
He's always been involved...

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:04.380
I remember when we had
our ceremonial days

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.530
and then out would come.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:11.650
Dwayne dancing, really good
dancer, powerful dancer

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:18.150
and a very strong singer,
fluent in the language

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:22.380
and he's got so much passion.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:29.350
When you mention tribal
language, a really powerful...

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:37.130
I think he wants to ..maybe
you want to sing for us or ...

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:42.310
you want to say something?

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:43.610
Okay.

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:45.770
&gt;&gt; Dwayne Tomah [begins greeting

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:49.840
in Passamaquoddy language]
This is a real emotional time

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.740
for me right now.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:12.030
And I'm sorry that I'm actually
doing this, but it's really hard

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:17.320
for me because I'm
saying this because ...

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.860
we're still here.

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:25.080
Our language is strong
and it's still here.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:42.610
And with the help of you
people...I don't know you,

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:47.910
but I feel your spirits in this
room, and I want to thank each

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:51.520
and every one of you for
making this possible.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:58.160
For without you people and our
people this would not happen,

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.460
it would not go forward.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:08.320
And for me to stand
here before you in 2018,

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.930
to be able to sing our songs,

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:16.710
to bring them back
home...is very powerful.

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:21.590
And to be able to
stand before you...

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:23.250
to know that our
language is still alive.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:27.070
I want to thank each
and every one of you

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.830
for everything that you've done.

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:35.100
And this song I'm going to
sing is the "Trading song."

01:00:36.510 --> 01:02:30.410
[drumming and song in the
Passamaquoddy language]

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:38.020
&gt;&gt; Okay. This next song is a war
song, which was very difficult

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:45.890
to be able to decipher, but with
the quality devices that we use

01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:51.820
and all the sophisticated
instruments that we use,

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.690
we were able to break it down.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:58.190
So for those that are involved
in that particular process,

01:02:58.190 --> 01:03:02.350
you made my job a little easier.

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:05.210
[laughter] So I want to
thank you so much for doing

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:07.320
that because it was
really difficult.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.400
I'm just going to
briefly...read it for you

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.450
so you can hear the
language and then I'll kind

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.170
of hum it a little
bit so you kind

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:24.010
of get an understanding
and see how it goes.

01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:25.310
[reads text in Passamaquooddy,
then sings;

01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:26.610

01:04:35.510 --> 01:06:12.320
[Singing]

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah: Well,
you might not believe this,

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:19.530
but that's the first time that's
been sung in public in a hundred

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:21.140
and twenty-eight years.

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:30.630
It's the War Song by
Peter Lacoot [applause].

01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.330
Thank you.

01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:35.350
Thank you, Dwayne

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:42.730
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar So...thank you
Donald and Dwayne for that.

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:44.920
That was extraordinary.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:48.870
So we've covered a lot of
topics, a bewildering array

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:53.400
from control to intellectual
property to digital repatriation

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.970
to restoration, to
cultural curation,

01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:59.980
ethical treatment
of...and I could go on

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.020
and we could make a meal of it
if we wanted to, but I'm going

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.160
to keep it short
because I know that ..

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.880
there's some refreshments
and we do need to move along

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.140
and folks need to
get fed and so on.

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.320
But we are going to
take some questions.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:18.240
Please... you've had a lot to
think about, a lot to hear.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:27.270
So yes sir, in the
back...the floor is yours

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:30.260
&gt;&gt; Audience Member : How
many cylinders have you found

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:35.020
so far related to our language?

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:38.300
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah 31 cylinders.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:42.750
I think a few of
them were broken

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:48.520
and there's technology now that
going to piece them together.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.160
I don't know if it's
at that point yet.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.250
Is it close?

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.910
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Stay tuned.

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:58.910
We can neither confirm
nor deny ...we are

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:00.850
in Washington, after all.

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:02.660
&gt;&gt; Nicki Saylor We
are working on it ...

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.960
our best people.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.950
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Somebody
else had a hand over here.

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.250
Sorry, yes.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.520
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Thank you
for showing us what this looks -

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.360
collaborative and
technical convergence

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:22.850
and respect can actually bring.

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:35.700
I had a question about
two words at the top.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.000
Who logs in?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.050
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: You want
me to talk about that?

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:46.580
So, because Mukurtu has these
cultural protocols as I talked

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.630
about in the beginning,
community members log in

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:53.830
and so each item that
you see on the site...

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.940
that's sort of on the browse
site ..community members are

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:59.110
added to cultural protocols.

01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:02.680
So in Mukurtu, you always
have the, "who" and the "how"

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.260
because nothing ever
circulates, right?

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.040
I mean in a Western
sense, we think of objects

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.510
that circulate out of that.

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:12.960
So Mukurtu puts that into a
context, so every single item

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.720
in any Mukurtu system has
to be enabled to actually

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.180
to upload it, you have to have
a who and a how - a community

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.810
and how do you want it
accessed - and so the who

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.100
and the how is decided
by the Passmaquoddy.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.750
So you were seeing the
public site without a log in,

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:30.250
so that's already
been vetted and,

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:33.240
enabled to see- the login
will be the community members

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.990
and that's determined
by the community.

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:41.350
So we are training...Ashley,
right?

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:44.330
Yes...who's working with
Donald in the community.

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:46.280
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Yes.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.580
Jeanine..

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.010
&gt;&gt; Jeanine Nault
Oh gosh, hi guys.

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:50.310
Nice to see you all again.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.820
Nicki said something
interesting about how this type

01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.450
of work is sort of in
opposition to a lot

01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:59.100
of the push towards open
access and you know,

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.400
freely available material,
but it sounds like all

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.250
of you have had good
institutional support

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.550
with this type of work.

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.630
Do you anticipate that type of
institutional support continuing

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.520
as there's more interest
and more open access

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.820
to this type of material?

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.670
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Nicki,
I think that's you

01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:19.410
&gt;&gt; Nicki Saylor I thought Betsy
was supposed to sit down [here].

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:22.240
It is, it is my great
wish that it continues--

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.660
she says unofficially.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:29.310
Yeah. I mean I think that
we are very interested

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:32.520
in this particular project,
we're very interested

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.890
in applying this kind of
co-curation and labeling

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:40.080
with other materials and we
were actually working on that

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.770
with Kim and Jane right now

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.550
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen I think
though, to your point, Janine,

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:46.380
it's up to everybody in the
room and all the institutions

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.580
that we work in because
it doesn't happen

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.950
from an institution, it
happens from people like Betsy,

01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:53.870
like Nicki, like Guha, you know,

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:55.520
to push it through
because you know,

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.480
institutions are
...institutions.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:03.760
&gt;&gt; Mary Alice Ball We can see,

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.900
we can see how labor intensive
this work is -the tremendous

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.660
amount of effort
that went into it.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.070
So as the visibility, I mean,

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.100
it's so beautiful
what you've done.

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:20.460
So as more and more people
see what you've done,

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.900
more tribes will want
to replicate this.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:29.380
How does Mukurtu plan
for sustainability,

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:34.410
for making this available to
other nations, other tribes

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:38.840
and you know, are you
considering selling, you know,

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.110
selling the software
or is it always going

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:43.150
to be federal or
private funders?

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:46.190
&gt;&gt; Kim Christen: Come on,
Mary Alice, you know me better

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:48.070
than that what're
you talking about?!

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:52.700
No, well thanks to our
generous funders...the Institute

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:57.090
of Museum and Library Services,
NEH and the Mellon Foundation

01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:59.620
who is now funding us, but we...

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.350
we, for sustainability,
it's been something that,

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:05.410
exactly because of this
issue, we don't want

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:08.430
to create something that
then is going to go away.

01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:11.430
And so.. my university,
Washington State University,

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:12.770
and the center that I direct -

01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:15.440
the Center for Digital
Scholarship and Curation,

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.950
we've now moved it from
a project to just part

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:20.150
of our general library services.

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:21.580
So we don't rely on grants.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.450
If the grants go away tomorrow,
which I hope they don't!

01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:24.750
Mellon Foundation - .

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:26.650
If you're listening, we
still need your money.

01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:30.930
But the library- we have, I
mentioned before, Alex Merrill

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:33.420
and Steve Taylor and
there are our developers

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:38.070
and we have Michael Wynne, who's
our Mukurtu support specialist

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.370
and we're hiring another one.

01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:41.190
So we also, for sustainability,

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:45.090
provide support...that's
ongoing- to communities,

01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:47.460
online support as well
as face to face training,

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.060
which we've done
with the communities.

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.380
So it's not a "build
it and they will come

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.910
and figure it out themselves."

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.330
The whole model works
on this collaboration

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:58.370
between indigenous communities
and those of us who are allies

01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:02.380
in institutions - institutions
that should be doing this work

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.230
because the materials in
our libraries, museums

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:09.410
and archives got there in
very dubious circumstances.

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:10.990
So we should be doing this work.

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:12.630
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson: And
I, I would add to it

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:16.460
that they're really ...it's
complex what needs to happen

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.620
at a community level, at
an institutional level

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.970
and at a technical level
and those three parts,

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:24.700
how we brought them together
and this project is partly

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.870
because we were piloting
how they come together

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:29.440
and we know much more about
kind of what that looks like.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.670
But at the same time
we're constantly thinking

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:33.970
about what can this look
like for other communities

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.310
and the sustainability of that.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:39.230
So we also have grants out to
support the training for tribes

01:13:39.230 --> 01:13:41.640
around intellectual property
that is directly for tribes

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.970
so that they get a whole heap
of other kinds of information

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:46.480
in order to make different
kinds of decisions about how

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.480
to negotiate with
the institutions.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.150
And we also have worked
out to start doing training

01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:53.550
with institutions themselves
so that when tribes come

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:56.410
to institutions, institutions
are not saying, what is that?

01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:57.710
What are we doing?

01:13:57.710 --> 01:13:59.010
so that they already know
what their work flow would be,

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:01.790
they know what is needed
at an institutional level.

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:04.950
So that kind of helps smooth the
pathways and we've learned a lot

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:06.810
of that from this
project itself.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:10.570
So that's kind of what the
next, the future looks like.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:12.550
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Actually
following up on that question,

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.650
and this may be early days
for Donald and our colleagues

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:17.430
from Passamaquoddy, but
maybe you all could talk

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:20.730
about the fact that maybe
sustainability might best be

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:22.790
suited for tribal
communities to talk

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.330
to other tribal communities
about that.

01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:25.630
Is that, is that a potential?

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:26.930
&gt;&gt; Jane Anderson:
That is the grant

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.590
that I'm talking about...around
training around these issue.

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:30.050
Actually, Donald
is involved in it.

01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:32.370
Penobscot will be running
it and 12 other tribes

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.170
over the next two years.

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.220
It's something that is
like horizontal training

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:39.440
that is coming from tribes
themselves in terms of talking

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.870
about what this looks like.

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:44.080
&gt;&gt; Kim Anderson: And we,
we're in our fourth year

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.460
of our tribal stewardship cohort
program funded by the IMLS.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.420
We've had two cohorts through
that are twelve tribal nations

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.170
that received full scholarships
to come to WSU for a year

01:14:57.170 --> 01:15:02.040
and are trained in digital
stewardship that allows them

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.310
to create their own policies
and procedures for managing

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:07.470
and stewarding their
collections.

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:10.120
And we did that for three years
and we've just been funded

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.780
for another three years and our
next cohort starts in August.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:17.520
And that was Mary Alice
Ball, who heart -started up,

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.350
who was very integral
to that happening.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:26.940
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Questions?

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:33.020
Comments? All right, well ...

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:37.430
I wanted to make sure that
all of our panelists here

01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:40.950
and especially our guests
from Maine, had a chance

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:42.260
to reflect on what this means.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.600
I mean, I know Donald, you were
very eloquent and thank you

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.900
so much for that song, Dwayne.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.700
That was brilliant.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:57.870
What...would you have us
go away with, if you will?

01:15:57.870 --> 01:16:00.170
&gt;&gt; Donald Soctomah: Well,

01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:06.490
I think this material
was developed

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:11.370
because our tribe is a
sharing type of tribe.

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:15.780
Members of our tribe would
give the shirt off their back

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.180
for anybody, and I think

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:22.680
when the ancestors were sharing
the song, sharing the stories,

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.980
that's what they
were doing was...

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:30.290
sharing. When Fewkes came back
a couple months later [in 1890]

01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:34.870
to play the wax cylinders
back to the tribe, you know,

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.970
nobody's ever heard this before.

01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:41.510
I just can imagine what
they were thinking -

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:44.660
hearing their own
voices, you know,

01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:47.460
nobody's ever heard
their voices before!

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.010
And then they were
the first ones

01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:53.910
to hear their voices playing
back, singing back, you know,

01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:55.220
what were they thinking?

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.570
what was going through
their mind...

01:16:57.570 --> 01:17:00.610
this, the world changing.

01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:04.100
You know, it was right at that
moment the world was changing

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.540
for them and I think
they realized we have

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.010
to continue to share.

01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:13.890
Because if you look at the
timeline for the tribe right

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:18.460
after that, Charles Leland
wrote the Algonquian legends

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.910
and the tribe shared
most of those stories

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:24.990
on the Algonquian legends,
they're the stories of the,

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:28.920
mainly the Passamaquoddy,
and a few other tribes.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.950
The tribe started
sharing, sharing stories -

01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:36.540
continued on some of the older
..well, younger recordings

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:41.210
from 1947 ended up at
the Library of Congress

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:43.410
and the tribe kept sharing.

01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:47.930
So that good will
of our tribe is sort

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:52.140
of saving the songs
for the future.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.730
And just that good will..

01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:59.110
I'd like to also
acknowledge David Francis.

01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:02.620
He's, he was 99 years old
[when he passed away].

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:09.860
He started working on the first
round of the wax cylinders back

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:16.330
in the eighties ...when it
was really the wax cylinder --

01:18:16.330 --> 01:18:19.300
rough, the rough cut.

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:23.720
So, he was a World
War Two veteran -

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.960
one of the singers [on the
1890 recordings] he knew

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.720
and he was able to
interpret as much as he could

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.610
from the rough recordings.

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.070
But, now it's like
night and day.

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:43.350
If David heard them now
he'd be writing up a storm.

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:46.810
So, you know, I wanted
to acknowledge his work

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:51.320
because that was the very
beginning on the wax cylinders

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.550
and today, you know,
we have Dwayne

01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:00.210
and we have other...master
speakers

01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:05.950
that are really getting
enthused with the work.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.840
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar Thank
you very much.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.420
And, for a lot of us it's been
a pleasure and a privilege to be

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.720
on this journey with you.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.020
So thank you.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.320
Thank you all.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.620
Let's eat.

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:16.920
[applause]

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.520
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.100
of Congress, visit
