00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460
after that became a new security
 

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.940
after that became a new security
apparatus a new state a new leadership

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:22.950
apparatus a new state a new leadership
 

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:26.300
apparatus a new state a new leadership
that that became uncontrolled the state

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:26.310
that that became uncontrolled the state
 

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.430
that that became uncontrolled the state
and became a war against enemies either

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440
and became a war against enemies either
 

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.650
and became a war against enemies either
you are with me or against me see the

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660
you are with me or against me see the
 

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.900
you are with me or against me see the
zero-sum game yeah so love you I guess

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:32.910
zero-sum game yeah so love you I guess
 

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.910
zero-sum game yeah so love you I guess
yeah but I think your question is really

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920
yeah but I think your question is really
 

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.650
yeah but I think your question is really
can do and I mean a very very insightful

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660
can do and I mean a very very insightful
 

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.300
can do and I mean a very very insightful
in the sense we have to relook at the

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:38.310
in the sense we have to relook at the
 

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.590
in the sense we have to relook at the
contest and what period and what change

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:41.600
contest and what period and what change
 

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.960
contest and what period and what change
that would help us understand what goes

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:44.970
that would help us understand what goes
 

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:48.770
that would help us understand what goes
on and then in the 1970s and the 80s and

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:48.780
on and then in the 1970s and the 80s and
 

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.710
on and then in the 1970s and the 80s and
after the Lockerbie crisis can I just

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720
after the Lockerbie crisis can I just
 

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.580
after the Lockerbie crisis can I just
say one or two things about this very

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:55.590
say one or two things about this very
 

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.950
say one or two things about this very
good question very large question first

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960
good question very large question first
 

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.580
good question very large question first
of all keep in mind that at the time

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:01.590
of all keep in mind that at the time
 

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:05.090
of all keep in mind that at the time
when the when Gaddafi came to power

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:05.100
when the when Gaddafi came to power
 

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.550
when the when Gaddafi came to power
there were half a dozen coos in the

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560
there were half a dozen coos in the
 

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.470
there were half a dozen coos in the
making some of which were supported by

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480
making some of which were supported by
 

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.970
making some of which were supported by
the Egyptians and some of which were

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980
the Egyptians and some of which were
 

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.530
the Egyptians and some of which were
supported by the Americans and so forth

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540
supported by the Americans and so forth
 

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.230
supported by the Americans and so forth
these guys just got there first so it

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240
these guys just got there first so it
 

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.450
these guys just got there first so it
wasn't as if that was a very stable

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460
wasn't as if that was a very stable
 

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.780
wasn't as if that was a very stable
well-regarded regime under the monarchy

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:20.790
well-regarded regime under the monarchy
 

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.450
well-regarded regime under the monarchy
was obviously going to fall over and it

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:23.460
was obviously going to fall over and it
 

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.790
was obviously going to fall over and it
just was a question of who got there so

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800
just was a question of who got there so
 

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.100
just was a question of who got there so
when we talk about institutions we

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:28.110
when we talk about institutions we
 

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.380
when we talk about institutions we
should not romanticize the monarchy

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:30.390
should not romanticize the monarchy
 

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.090
should not romanticize the monarchy
there were no institutions there either

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:32.100
there were no institutions there either
 

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.850
there were no institutions there either
so and this is part of the 20th century

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:34.860
so and this is part of the 20th century
 

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.470
so and this is part of the 20th century
they were in my view institutions in

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480
they were in my view institutions in
 

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.570
they were in my view institutions in
1910 and that was about the last time

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:41.580
1910 and that was about the last time
 

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.790
1910 and that was about the last time
because the Italians did everything they

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800
because the Italians did everything they
 

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.800
because the Italians did everything they
could to destroy the institutional

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:45.810
could to destroy the institutional
 

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.890
could to destroy the institutional
design and makeup of the country the

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900
design and makeup of the country the
 

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.630
design and makeup of the country the
British and French did nothing to

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640
British and French did nothing to
 

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.210
British and French did nothing to
rebuild it when they were the occupiers

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220
rebuild it when they were the occupiers
 

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:56.810
rebuild it when they were the occupiers
during the war the monarchy was unable

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:56.820
during the war the monarchy was unable
 

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.170
during the war the monarchy was unable
to do that and the oil money swamped

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180
to do that and the oil money swamped
 

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.150
to do that and the oil money swamped
whatever efforts they may have been able

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160
whatever efforts they may have been able
 

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.250
whatever efforts they may have been able
to make and so this is the 20th century

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260
to make and so this is the 20th century
 

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.650
to make and so this is the 20th century
we're finished now but that's part of

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660
we're finished now but that's part of
 

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.550
we're finished now but that's part of
the problem and I so that's one point

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:10.560
the problem and I so that's one point
 

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.080
the problem and I so that's one point
about that the other thing is that I

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:12.090
about that the other thing is that I
 

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.390
about that the other thing is that I
think what's interesting is we have

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400
think what's interesting is we have
 

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.070
think what's interesting is we have
several times all of us in different

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:16.080
several times all of us in different
 

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.380
several times all of us in different
ways said the fact that Gaddafi has been

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:18.390
ways said the fact that Gaddafi has been
 

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.510
ways said the fact that Gaddafi has been
in power for 40 years doesn't mean that

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520
in power for 40 years doesn't mean that
 

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.850
in power for 40 years doesn't mean that
it's been 40 at same years there's been

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:22.860
it's been 40 at same years there's been
 

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.620
it's been 40 at same years there's been
different quite distinct

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:24.630
different quite distinct
 

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:28.510
different quite distinct
periods within that 40 years and it's

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:28.520
periods within that 40 years and it's
 

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.610
periods within that 40 years and it's
important to acknowledge in a sense that

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:31.620
important to acknowledge in a sense that
 

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.800
important to acknowledge in a sense that
one of the ways he stayed in power is to

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:33.810
one of the ways he stayed in power is to
 

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.620
one of the ways he stayed in power is to
do is to recognize that I mean he

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:36.630
do is to recognize that I mean he
 

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:39.050
do is to recognize that I mean he
himself was the engineer of some of

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060
himself was the engineer of some of
 

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.470
himself was the engineer of some of
those changes so a regime that came in

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480
those changes so a regime that came in
 

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.950
those changes so a regime that came in
in the 1970s very very opposed to

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960
in the 1970s very very opposed to
 

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.410
in the 1970s very very opposed to
tribalism ends up in the 1990s

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420
tribalism ends up in the 1990s
 

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.350
tribalism ends up in the 1990s
completely turning around on so it's a

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:51.360
completely turning around on so it's a
 

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.510
completely turning around on so it's a
very different regimes so in a sense it

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520
very different regimes so in a sense it
 

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.610
very different regimes so in a sense it
is true that internationally it was a

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:55.620
is true that internationally it was a
 

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.830
is true that internationally it was a
pariah and now it's you know everybody's

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:57.840
pariah and now it's you know everybody's
 

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.470
pariah and now it's you know everybody's
welcomed it back into but domestically

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480
welcomed it back into but domestically
 

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.050
welcomed it back into but domestically
there was that kind of change over the

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060
there was that kind of change over the
 

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.030
there was that kind of change over the
course of time that was of you know in

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040
course of time that was of you know in
 

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.040
course of time that was of you know in
fact we have to credit that regime for

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:07.050
fact we have to credit that regime for
 

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.370
fact we have to credit that regime for
having been as flexible and objective to

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380
having been as flexible and objective to
 

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.260
having been as flexible and objective to
stay in power under those circumstances

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:12.270
stay in power under those circumstances
 

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.390
stay in power under those circumstances
the one other thing that I want to say

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400
the one other thing that I want to say
 

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.760
the one other thing that I want to say
is if you want a really elegant examine

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:18.770
is if you want a really elegant examine
 

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:22.880
is if you want a really elegant examine
of how the radicalization of a regime

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:22.890
of how the radicalization of a regime
 

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:25.720
of how the radicalization of a regime
can kind of sneak up on you read this

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:25.730
can kind of sneak up on you read this
 

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.300
can kind of sneak up on you read this
read in the country of men you watch it

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:29.310
read in the country of men you watch it
 

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.880
read in the country of men you watch it
was sneaking up on people in the end of

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:31.890
was sneaking up on people in the end of
 

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:35.210
was sneaking up on people in the end of
the 1970s people who had been young

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:35.220
the 1970s people who had been young
 

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.280
the 1970s people who had been young
people particularly very excited about

people particularly very excited about
 

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.590
people particularly very excited about
this new young group of you know

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:39.600
this new young group of you know
 

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.390
this new young group of you know
nationalists and they'd overthrown this

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400
nationalists and they'd overthrown this
 

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.390
nationalists and they'd overthrown this
embarrassing monarchy and now Libya was

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400
embarrassing monarchy and now Libya was
 

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.800
embarrassing monarchy and now Libya was

so on it snuck up on everybody how
 

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.980
so on it snuck up on everybody how
bizarre and off the rails this system

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:51.990
bizarre and off the rails this system
 

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:55.370
bizarre and off the rails this system
was getting and it's just it's entering

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380
was getting and it's just it's entering
 

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.840
was getting and it's just it's entering
that period is particularly interesting

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:56.850
that period is particularly interesting
 

00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:03.290
that period is particularly interesting
in my view for that if I may in 1978 I

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300
in my view for that if I may in 1978 I
 

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.340
in my view for that if I may in 1978 I
