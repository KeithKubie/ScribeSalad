1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
[inaudible] joining me today is a leader,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,160
a follower, a reader, or
a writer, a speaker or a
listener. A student, a teacher,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,940
Jocko Willink. Welcome to the
Rubin report. How was that?

4
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,130
I took that right out of the bio.
That's good.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,840
Right out of the Twitter bio
as much viral. Yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,600
You're a little bit of everything.

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:24,630
That actually is a pretty good
explanation of you. It actually,

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,610
it actually is a pretty
good explanation to me.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,650
I think garden cover those multiple
dichotomies fairly well. Yeah,

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,760
that would probably explain why
you've written roughly 37,000 books.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,130
How many books have you written?
I mean,

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,200
I normally only put one book on the table.
We put four here.

13
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,340
I've written so far I've written three
adult books and three kids books.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,150
I've got another kid's book coming out
in the Spring and I've got another adult

15
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:48,990
book coming out,

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,180
going head to head with Jordan
Peterson in January of 2020 Oh,

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,620
oh yeah. I probably will be on
tour with him for that book.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,790
That means that we're going
to be in competition. Okay,
well bring it all right.

19
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,960
We'll see. We'll see. Okay, so nice to,
uh, to not actually have to compete with,

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,700
with y'all. Yeah. What do you,

21
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,570
do you feel like you're in
competition with anyone that's,

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,020
that's an interesting place to start off.
Well that's,

23
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,300
I guess there's a dichotomy there
too because I don't feel like I'm in

24
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,030
competition with anyone and
I feel like I'm competent.

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,620
I'm trying to touch just sort
of in my nature to just compete.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,790
But no, I mean in this
world that I'm in right now,

27
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,350
I don't really feel like
I'm competing with anyone.

28
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,750
I feel like I'm just
kind of doing what I do,

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,730
talking about what I like to talk about,

30
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:37,200
writing about what I like to write about
and hanging out with cool people most

31
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:39,360
of the time. Yeah. Pretty
good. Pretty good. All right.

32
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:43,380
Well I think 99% of my audience knows
who you are and knows a lot about you.

33
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,540
But for the people that don't,
and by the way, I should say,

34
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,201
right before we started,

35
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:50,250
I was saying we have been trying to
coordinate this for about 27 years.

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,120
Right? I mean a long time,
which is kind of funny. I mean,
it really says, it's like,

37
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,000
well, we're two people that are, that
are busy. Yeah. And it was hard to,

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,030
hard to really make this happen, but for
the people that know nothing about you,

39
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:04,170
tell me a little bit about your history.
I was born and raised in a small,

40
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:08,310
New England town. I was
a rebellious kid. My

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,530
best way to rebel as a kid coming from
a small new England town was to join the

42
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,350
military. So I joined the
military after high school.

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,480
I spent 20 years in the military and
when I retired from the military,

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,630
I started taking the things that I learned
from the military and teaching them

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,660
to civilian companies
and civilian leaders.

46
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,890
And eventually that turned into a book
and a podcast and all this other stuff.

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,490
Yeah.

48
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,190
So tell me a little bit more about what
you were like that made you want to go

49
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,810
into the military. What was that
rebellious kid or whatever that was? Yeah.

50
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:43,081
You know,

51
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:48,081
I just grew up in a little new England
town and there was a lot of hippies and

52
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,550
just kind of kids like that running
around and smoking pot and whatever.

53
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,540
And I really wasn't into
that. And so, you know,

54
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,490
I got to think a lot of kids when they
rebel as kids because all kids rebel,

55
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,300
a lot of kids repelled by drinking or they
do drugs or whatever they're gonna do.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,420
And I went in the other direction was
like into hardcore music and eventually

57
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,860
said,
Oh yeah,

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,030
I'm just going to join the military
because that's what I'm going to do. Yeah,

59
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,320
it's funny when you talk about it and
it almost sounds like you're slightly

60
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:24,400
dismissing it, but you had a pretty
good storied career as a navy seal.

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,840
Yeah, no, I grew up in the seal
teams. I went right in the navy,

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,560
right in the seal teams and that's
where I spent my whole adult life.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,290
And it was an incredible experience.

64
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,730
Worked with a bunch of awesome people
and got to do things that I had dreamed

65
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,380
about doing since I was a little kid.
Well,

66
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:45,040
what should we know about like the life
of a navy seal that you don't get in the

67
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,880
movies or, or however else we just
sort of imagined these lives to be.

68
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,560
I would say the biggest thing to remember
is that that people in the seal teams

69
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,800
and people in the military
in general, they're people,
they're just normal people.

70
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,960
They go home, they got
wives, they got kids,

71
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:02,680
they're trying to live a normal life
and then their job requires them to do

72
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:06,310
things that are very normal.
And so they, you know, for me,

73
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,630
I kind of learned to compartmentalize
what I was doing in the military and when

74
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,020
I'd come home,
and I always,

75
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,970
I tell this to police
officers and firefighters and
military guys today don't,

76
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:19,090
when you get home, don't
bring your uniform home.
Don't wear your uniform home.

77
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,020
Like physically change your,
take your uniform off, leave
it at work, put on your,

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,390
your civilian clothes when you
go home and be a civilian. The,

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,160
how hard is that though, once you're
sort of in that locked mindset,

80
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,280
which obviously has so much to do with
the things that you write about and why

81
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,690
your message actually is working
and helping people. You say,

82
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,890
how hard is it l it can be hard,
it can be hard. Uh, you know,

83
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,990
cause you've got one life that you're
living where decisions are really

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,360
consequential and then you've got your
regular life that you're living and

85
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,270
things aren't that they aren't
as consequential. You know,

86
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,830
I had a situation where I was at work
and there was a lot of stuff going on at

87
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,460
work. They were, they were
redeploying people to Afghanistan.

88
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,440
There was big decisions that
were being made at work.

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,460
And I remember I came home from
work one day and like I said,

90
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,770
tried to try to leave my work at work.

91
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,000
But I'm sitting there thinking about how
all this stuff is going to unfold and

92
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,020
my wife, you know, I got home and
my wife cause I can't believe this.

93
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:24,850
And I was like, what happened is, is
everything okay? And she says, you know,

94
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:29,050
the, no, it's not okay. The
Disney on ice is the same night.

95
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,790
Some other events for the kids. And
I'm just thinking, Hey, if that's,

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,570
if that's the biggest worries my wife has,
then that's a positive thing,

97
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,330
then life's pretty good. Yeah.
Life's pretty good. Yeah.

98
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:44,260
So how quickly did you realize that
you wanted to sort of bring these ideas

99
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,470
about personal responsibility and sort
of owning your life and all that into

100
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,090
sort of that world, the world where
Disney on ice matters? Yeah, it's,

101
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,430
I was about six months from retiring.

102
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,030
I had a friend that was the CEO
of a big company and he said,

103
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,930
I want you to come and talk
to my executives about combat
leadership. And I said,

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,860
hey, sure. You know, sounds, sounds cool.
So I went and did it and when I got,

105
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:12,470
and I don't think he really
knew what to expect, you know,

106
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,950
because I'm looking like a knuckle
dragger and I'm at least a good portion.

107
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,840
I actually am a knuckle dragger and so
we bring me in to talk and I thought,

108
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,260
I think he was maybe thinking, I tell
some cold war stories and that'd be,

109
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,410
that'd be great. But I actually
started talking about how you lead.

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,570
And when I got done,
he came up to me and said,

111
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:33,590
I want you to do this for every division
that I have in my company. And I said,

112
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,430
well, you know, I'm retiring. And
he said, well, I'll give you money.

113
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,860
And I said,
okay.

114
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,110
So I started working with all the
different divisionals and at one of those

115
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,310
division meetings, the CEO of the parent
company was there. And when I got done,

116
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,001
he came up to me and said,

117
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,800
I want you to come and talk to all my
CEOs for all these companies that I own.

118
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,480
And he owned like 45 or 50 companies.
So I went and did that.

119
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,060
And when I went and talked to
those companies, of course,

120
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:00,620
then a bunch of those CEOs
came up to me and said, hey,

121
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,680
I want you to come and talk to my company.
So that's kind of the,

122
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,580
the way that it started and it didn't
take me very long at all. I mean,

123
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,010
it actually was the very first company,

124
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,930
that first guy that I
talked to when they started,

125
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,630
when that group started telling me
about the problems they were having,

126
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,520
I was sitting there thinking myself,
well,

127
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:16,120
I solve these problems in seal platoons
when I was training seal platoons.

128
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,930
This is the same thing.
It's leadership. Yeah.

129
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,920
Were you surprised that the big
successful businesses were having such a

130
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:22,970
leadership crisis?

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,060
I was surprised for about five minutes
and then I realized that these are all

132
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,660
human beings. These are the same human
beings that are in a seal platoon,

133
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,590
in an RV company and in a
business and they're all,

134
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,200
they all have the same idiosyncrasies.
They have the same egos,

135
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,530
the same personalities.

136
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,560
You can see it all and when you've
seen it all over and over again,

137
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,280
it becomes pretty evident,
pretty clear when you're looking at it.

138
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,290
And the last job that I had in
the seal teams, I was training,

139
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,870
I was running the seal training
for the west coast seal teams.

140
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,360
And this isn't a training where you
see like the guys carrying the boats on

141
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,880
their heads and carrying logs around
and doing a bunch of pushups and stuff.

142
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,170
The training that I ran was the training
where seals actually learned to go into

143
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:05,171
combat and fight the enemy and this is
where we really start focusing on combat

144
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:08,360
leadership.
And so in this training that I ran,

145
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,310
we got to take seal platoons and put
them through really tough training

146
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,610
scenarios, very realistic training
scenarios over and over and over again.

147
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,350
So every night I basically would be
putting a new seal platoon through another

148
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,184
training scenario,

149
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,490
which the next night it will be another
scope and going through this same

150
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,330
training scenario.

151
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,490
And then the next thing would be another
seal between going through the same

152
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:28,991
training snow.

153
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:32,390
So you take these different seasons and
what's different about a seal platoon?

154
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,330
What's different about a seal platoon
is really just boils down to the

155
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:39,440
leadership because we've got 16 seals in
a scope that the guys are basically the

156
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:42,910
same show. There's some, there's a bell
curve, there's some top end performers,

157
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:44,990
there's some low on performers
as a bunch of guys in the middle.

158
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,920
So the real variation on their performance
was based almost a hundred percent on

159
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:52,520
their, on their leadership. In fact,
it was 100% on their leadership.

160
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,210
And so I got to see this and I got to
watch these leadership scenarios on fold

161
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,450
over and over again and
see what leadership things
worked and what didn't work.

162
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,920
And, and so by the time I, I left that
job and entered the civilian sector,

163
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,980
I've watched some random team of leaders
inside of an organization and I said to

164
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:10,851
myself,
well,

165
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,170
they're strategic messages and
getting down to the front line troops,

166
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,150
they need to communicate this better.
Or Oh,

167
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,710
they're departments
aren't working together.

168
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:17,940
They need to cover and
move forward together.

169
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,480
Or their mission is way too complex and
that no one has any idea what they're

170
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,950
actually supposed to be doing.
So they need to simplify this or that.

171
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,350
This senior leader is
making all the decisions and
therefore everything's moving

172
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:31,020
really slow and nothing's
happening at a good rate of speed.

173
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,770
So they need to use decentralized sematic.

174
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,040
And it was just so obvious when I started.

175
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,090
How much of leadership in general do
you think is innate versus learned?

176
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,280
Obviously you're teaching
people to learn part,

177
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,880
but there has to be some element that's an
eight, right? Yeah, there absolutely is.

178
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,980
And there's the,

179
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,470
the analogy that I give, and I don't
play video games, but I've seen it,

180
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,240
but on video games,
there's,

181
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,880
you have a character in a video game
and you'll have a certain level of

182
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,910
intelligence is on a certain level of
strength and a certain level of agility

183
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,170
and those levels are what you get
and then you work with them. Well,

184
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,030
it's the same thing for a
leader and there's different,

185
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,870
there's different characteristics that
you get that are good for leadership,

186
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,150
right? If you're someone
that's really articulate,

187
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:15,750
that's a great thing to have to be a
good leader because you want the human

188
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,090
beings that you're talking to to
understand what you're actually saying.

189
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,230
So and different people are naturally
more articulate than other people.

190
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,960
It's good to be able to look at complex
problems and be able to simplify them.

191
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,770
Right?
That's a,

192
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,570
that's a very powerful tool to have a
really complex thing to solve and be able

193
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:34,950
to look at it and say,
okay,

194
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,280
simplify it and then simplify it not only
for yourself so you can decide what to

195
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:41,400
do, but simplify it for your team so
they understand what to do. That's,

196
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,740
that's a characteristic
that some people have.

197
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,760
The the one that I bring up a
lot because it's very obvious is,

198
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,320
is being loud because if you're
in a leadership position,

199
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,630
you need to be able to
make people hear you.

200
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,120
And some people are born
with a very loud voice.

201
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,990
I was luckily born with a very loud
voice and it's inherited from my genes,

202
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,400
right? And my kids inherited there.
My kids are all can be very loud,

203
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,530
which is sometimes problematic in house,

204
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,240
but if you can't bark a command so that
people can hear you and a machine gun

205
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,190
fight, no one's been able to
do what you ask them to do.

206
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,200
So there's these different characteristics
and you can improve upon them.

207
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:21,030
So if you're not very articulate,

208
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,330
you can read and you can write and
you can speak and you can become more

209
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:28,110
articulate. If you are not very
good at simplifying problems,

210
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,610
you can start looking at complex
problems and thinking about how you can

211
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,560
simplify them.
And you can get better at that.

212
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,750
The being loud part is that, there's
definitely a genetic aspect of that.

213
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,390
So sure you can learn to
project your voice more,

214
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,640
but some people aren't very loud,
they're just born that way.

215
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,770
And so what does a person
do in that situation? Well,

216
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,590
what a person does not situation
is when they have to give an order,

217
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,070
they tell one of the loud mouse in their
platoon to tell everyone to get over

218
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,880
this other building now.
And that loud mouth will pass the word.

219
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,300
And so what you do as a leader,

220
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,170
as you find members for your team
that can compliment your weaknesses.

221
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,590
So there are parts that you could
improve and there are parts that you can

222
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,010
improve.
And if you,

223
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,670
the only real impediment to improving is
someone that doesn't have the humility

224
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,510
to say,
you know what,

225
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,510
I think I could work on being
more articulate or you know what?

226
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,780
I think I could work on solving
problems and making them more simple.

227
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:26,740
Or you know what? I'm not that loud.
And instead of saying, you know what,

228
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,530
that's not a good way to lead and said,
I said, you know what? I'm not that loud,

229
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,360
but Billy over here is loud,

230
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,210
so I'm going to let him put the word
out when it needs to get put out.

231
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,360
But if you're giving out the humility to
do that, you won't improve as a leader.

232
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,730
Have you found those people that even
if you lay out what the right, you know,

233
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,070
skills are that they have to work on or
where their blind spots are, etc. Etc.

234
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,640
That they just can't, whether it's ego
or whatever else that they just can't,

235
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:51,340
they just, certain people you just
can't get through to. Absolutely.

236
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,700
It's a horrible situation to be in.
And in the seal teams,

237
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,780
those guys will get fired in
the civilian sector. Generally.

238
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,400
Those guys get fired because I mean you,
you,

239
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:06,850
you go into a company and you've got a
CEO that is not listening to anyone up or

240
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:09,520
down the chain and not listening to the
board, not listening to subordinates.

241
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,730
How is he going to improve? He's
not going to, and by the way,

242
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:13,720
why does he need to improve?

243
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,600
He needs to improve because his
company isn't doing well. So,

244
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,590
but this person might think, hey,
you know, I'm great. I don't,

245
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,810
I'm not gonna learn anything from anybody.
I'm just gonna keep doing it my way.

246
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,580
And that guy's not going to stay in
that job because they don't have the

247
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,370
humility to say, you know what, I'm
probably doing some things wrong.

248
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,200
That's why we're not making money.

249
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,640
And so I need to change some of the
things that I'm doing so that we can make

250
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:40,180
money. But if you don't have that
attitude and you're not humble, yeah,

251
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,800
you'll end up getting fired.
So conversely,

252
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:45,730
have you seen people that basically had
none of the skills that have been able

253
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,391
to overcome it?

254
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:50,590
Just through perseverance that just
innately don't have the leadership traits

255
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:53,200
that don't have, you know, they
don't speak loud, they aren't clear,

256
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:56,520
they can't make decisions, but just out
of sheer sort of force of will, there's,

257
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,820
there's all these little aspects that
you have you can improve upon right now

258
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,930
you you're not going to take,

259
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:06,931
I'm not going to lie to you and say you
can take somebody that has no aptitude

260
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,250
for leadership and they're going
to turn into a great leader.

261
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,020
That's probably not going to happen,

262
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,150
but you can't take someone
that has minimal aptitude
for leadership and they can

263
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:18,220
improve the areas where
they need to improve.

264
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,390
They can compliment themselves with a
team that can cover for the areas where

265
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:25,120
they're weak and they can end up doing
a great job in a leadership position for

266
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,760
sure. Yeah. So handing
some of this stuff off,

267
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,340
people don't think of that in certain
ways when it comes to leaders,

268
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,560
like they have to do everything
or know everything or something.

269
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,410
But actually hand in some of
this stuff off is, is good.

270
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:40,060
Delegating actually is good.
Oh yeah, absolutely. Like
for instance, big shocker,

271
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:42,810
I don't really like doing paperwork a lot,
you know what I mean?

272
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,000
Really it's [inaudible].
I know it might seem odd,

273
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,950
but I always had guys that worked for me.

274
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:51,590
I'd figured out that guy that was really
good at administrative stuff and there

275
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,161
you go.
Guess what?

276
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:54,620
He's going to do a bunch of
administrative stuff and that's great.

277
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,250
And so whatever areas of weakness
you have, have some, you know,

278
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,470
get a member of your team,
recruit someone,

279
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,590
bring someone on board that can actually
make these things happen and it'll work

280
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,490
out great.
Yeah.

281
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:09,491
Are you kind of surprised how much we
need a leadership sort of in society right

282
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,910
now that we seem to have like a
complete dearth of leadership? I mean,

283
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,170
you mentioned Jordan Peterson before.

284
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,750
When I see the message that
he's bringing to these people,

285
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,390
it's really about getting yourself
together, which is the most,

286
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,180
I mean it's very consistent with
your message, but, but there's,

287
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,090
but the people that are coming are sort
of looking for a leader to say that,

288
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,430
that we just don't have, had seemingly
don't have good leaders right now. Do,

289
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,430
do you think that's a fair estimation?
Well, we do have good leaders.

290
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,430
There's plenty of good leaders out
there and I see him all the time in the

291
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:38,150
business world.

292
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,550
I still work with the military and
there's great leaders inside the military.

293
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,350
There's great leaders inside
of the business world for sure.

294
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,580
There's also always a lack of
leadership. And I mean, I, you know,

295
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,930
on my podcast I'd cover,

296
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,770
I cover books about war
generally first person accounts,

297
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,640
and there's a lack of leadership back
then and there's going to be theirs.

298
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,620
So I don't know if it's
gotten any better or worse,

299
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,270
but the fact of the matter
is that leadership is,

300
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,980
is the hardest thing in the world as far
as I know. It's, it's the hardest thing.

301
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,410
You know, people used to ask me when I,
when I first got out of the military,

302
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,650
what was the most complex, you know,
operation that you would plan on.

303
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,340
Planning operations isn't that big
of a deal. Like here's a bad guy,

304
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,530
here's the assets that we have,

305
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:19,910
here's what we're going to do
to go take them out. I mean,

306
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:24,320
this is stuff that generally
it's not that hard to do,

307
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,150
but the hard part is,
is leading human beings.

308
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,900
And so why does it seem like there's that
we need better leadership because you

309
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,650
always need better leadership and because
leadership is so hard to actually do

310
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:34,610
properly.
Yeah.

311
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,180
Do you think we need some
sort of mandatory military
service to get some of this

312
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,890
through to young people?

313
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,350
I think military service is
great for people. I know it was,

314
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,990
it was great for me and it,
it worked out really well for me,

315
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,520
but I really don't believe in,

316
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,550
in mandatory service because I really
don't believe that it's good for

317
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,960
government to tell people what you need
to do. Yeah, I don't really support that,

318
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:04,610
but I definitely support and encourage
everyone to go in the reserves, you know,

319
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,500
go join that,
join the army or the Marine Corps,

320
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,720
the Navy Air Force reserves
where you go away for, you know,

321
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,190
six weeks or eight weeks and you kind
of learn what the military is about and

322
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:17,480
then you do one weekend a month and two
weeks in the summertime for you know,

323
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,800
indefinitely. So I think I have a pretty
good handle on your politics, but do you,

324
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,700
do you even have a label that kind of
works for you politically? Uh, I dunno.

325
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,820
I Dunno. I don't know what the
label, I don't know how they,

326
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,040
I think it'd be pretty hard to label.

327
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,430
If you were just sort of summing
up sort of your political beliefs,

328
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,390
what would you say?
I think that,

329
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,240
I guess a broad statement would be,

330
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:45,750
I don't think that the government is
the solution to our problems. Yeah.

331
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,280
I think that generally
unleashing individuals to
try and make things happen is

332
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:54,240
the best way for things to
work. It's, it's consistent
with decentralized command.

333
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,790
Go to talk, talk about in the, in
the first book that I wrote with my,

334
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,010
my brother life is you can't
control everything. You know,

335
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:06,480
centralized decision making does not work.
It doesn't work on the battlefield,

336
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,240
it doesn't work in business.
It doesn't work with governments.

337
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,550
So that's broadly speaking,
Guy,

338
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,360
I don't think that the government should
control what individuals are doing as

339
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,230
little as possible. Do there have to
be some rules and regulations in place?

340
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,380
Absolutely. But the framework
should be as loose as possible.

341
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:26,400
Just like if I'm running a seal platoon,
it's not every man for himself.

342
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,950
It's here's our standard
operating procedures,

343
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,550
here's the areas where we
commit to disciplined process.

344
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,000
But then once you understand
those and you know those,

345
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,290
you're allowed to operate freely within
those guidelines to execute the mission.

346
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,150
And that's what works.
That's what makes not just the seal teams.

347
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:45,630
That's what makes any
good military unit good.

348
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,030
And that's what makes
good businesses good.

349
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,300
Good businesses are good because someone
is micromanaging every single decision.

350
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,050
Good businesses are good because people
broadly understand the direction they're

351
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:55,710
heading.

352
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,190
They understand that and they're
allowed to move forward as they see fit.

353
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,140
Are you shocked when you
say something like that?

354
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,060
Which obviously I agree with 100% I mean,

355
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:07,290
all I talk about here is
personal responsibility over
and over that that doesn't

356
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:11,490
seem to sort of be the kind of flavor
of the day at the moment that this,

357
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,280
if you listen to mainstream media,
it's who are the more, well,

358
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,160
the government should give you this and
we should take from some of them give to

359
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,640
others that there's a more feeling of you.

360
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,400
You are owed something rather
than you got to get something.

361
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,810
You're asking if I'm surprised
by that. Yeah, because it,

362
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,290
because the way you're laying it out,
it's obvious. You know what I mean?

363
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,980
Like I mean that in the best sense, it's
obvious like, yeah, it's your life. Go,

364
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:38,760
go do something that has value in
and creates real easy answers. No,

365
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:43,761
I'm not surprised by it at all because
if I come here and offer you something

366
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:47,910
for free, why would you not want it? Why
would you not want to take it? If I say,

367
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:51,630
Hey, you can have this house
for free, and you'd say, okay,

368
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:55,230
that seems like a good deal to
me. Right. And so yeah, sure.

369
00:19:55,231 --> 00:20:00,120
I understand why people think that
sounds like a good idea because it's

370
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,870
something for free and they want to in
their own individual oral, they think,

371
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,540
okay, I do want to take advantage of
this, right. Get something for free.

372
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,560
So it doesn't surprise me at all that
what is unfortunate is if you can't draw

373
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,210
the line between,
hey,

374
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,900
everyone gets everything for free and
there's a price to that that somebody's

375
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:16,734
going to have to pay.

376
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,150
That's where it becomes a part in some
costs in there somewhere, somewhere. Yeah.

377
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,340
So tell me what it was like
when you started writing,

378
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,150
because that must've been a whole
other ball of wax. You know, it was,

379
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:29,370
I was actually an English
major in college and I went,

380
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,220
I went to college halfway through my navy
career, started off as an enlisted guy,

381
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,660
went to college and then became an officer
and then went to college eventually.

382
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,500
So, and the reason I was an English
major was because, believe it or not,

383
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,010
when you're an officer in the military
and actually almost any job in the

384
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:48,250
military, you have to write. Why not
just have to write, you have to read,

385
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:52,720
you have to understand because you have
to write concept of operations documents

386
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:56,260
that are going to be pushed up the
chain of command and they're gonna read

387
00:20:56,261 --> 00:21:01,261
through them and ask questions and
and look at the document and try and

388
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,190
comprehend what it is
that you're trying to do.

389
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,620
You've got to write evaluations
for your troops and your,

390
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,950
your troops are getting promoted based
on the evaluations that you, right.

391
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:10,630
Same with awards.
You've got to write awards.

392
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,790
Same thing was after actions reports.

393
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,700
So if you do an operation
and things don't go well,

394
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:19,480
you have to be able to articulate and
explain that what happened and then pass

395
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,970
that word on.
So everyone understands now that you're,

396
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,960
you're being given direction.
Verbal direction. Yes, of course.

397
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,250
But you're given written
direction as well.

398
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:32,080
You're given missions in a written format
or you're given rules of engagement in

399
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,940
a written format written by lawyers.

400
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,130
And I realized while I was
a young enlisted guy, and
then as a junior officer,

401
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,760
what I really need to be able to do is
understand and communicate well up and

402
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,730
down the chain of command. So when
I went to college I said, yeah,

403
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:52,900
I want to learn English, I want to get
good at it. And so that's what I did.

404
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:56,220
And so obviously I did a bunch of writing
and a ton of reading when I was in,

405
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,820
when I was an English major in college.

406
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,840
And then when I was in the military is
writing, you're writing all the time.

407
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,610
And then when,

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,440
when when I got out and I was working
with these companies and grew really

409
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:09,820
quickly,
and that's why my,

410
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,910
my buddy who was one of
the platoon commanders that
worked for me in the battle

411
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:17,440
of Ramadi, Leif Babin, he, he
was getting out of the navy too.

412
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,350
And I, you know, as we started I started
need some cover and I said, hey man,

413
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,970
you want to want to jump
in and get some of this?

414
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:25,120
And he was all on board and
then as we started doing this,

415
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:27,550
people would always say, Hey, do you
have this stuff written down anywhere?

416
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,930
Do you have a document you can give us?

417
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,700
And so we eventually wrote it
down and then that's how the,

418
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,200
that's how the first book came.
Yeah.

419
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,050
Can you lay out a little bit about
the battle of Ramadi? You basically,

420
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,760
you sort of wrote the plans.

421
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,910
The person that led the battle of Amati
that I was in was a guy named Shawn

422
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,280
Mcfarland who was a colonel at the time.
He retired as a general,

423
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,050
just a super smart,

424
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,540
incredibly competent and,
and great leaders,

425
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,900
have great leader and key came in
with, so I had 40 seals with me, right?

426
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,390
I had 40 sales with me
and 60 support people.

427
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Colonel Mcfarlane had 5,600 man armored
brigade that we supported and we helped

428
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,170
them. We work together in the
battle of Ramadi, vicious fighting.

429
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
Very tough battle.

430
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,640
And really took a city that was completely
controlled by the insurgence in 2005

431
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:21,031
2006 and by early 2007 it was
almost completely pacified.

432
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,580
So it was a, it was
incredible. It was incredible,

433
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:29,581
incredible turnaround and an incredible
testament to the capability of the US

434
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:33,454
armed forces.

435
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,140
Do you guys pay any attention to what's
going on politically back home when

436
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:42,580
you're halfway across the
world? Yes, absolutely.

437
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,470
You have to pay attention to
what's going on politically.

438
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,830
Back [inaudible] especially like at
this time when we deployed to Ramadi,

439
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:53,831
so it's 2005 2006 this is smack dab in
the middle of the rising negative public

440
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,790
opinion about the war in Iraq.

441
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,110
It's also where we had our own government
officials here in America that we're

442
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:07,070
saying this is unwinnable, this is
another Vietnam. This is a quagmire.

443
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,340
We shouldn't be there to
bring everyone home. So yeah,

444
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,780
you absolutely hear those things
and that's not good. That's not,

445
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:15,830
it's not a positive thing.

446
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,550
It's not a positive thing to have your
own government officials in America

447
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,930
saying that you cannot win.

448
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,840
And meanwhile you're going
out on an operation does that,

449
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:26,240
that must drive you guys crazy more
than anything else that's sort of the

450
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:29,870
political elite that often have no idea
what's happening on the ground that are

451
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:33,530
just spouting off stuff.
For sure, for sure,

452
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,120
but as I said,

453
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:38,810
it's you listened to it but you can
only pay so much attention to it.

454
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,650
There's so much other things to focus on.
I mean

455
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,710
you think about it a little bit,

456
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,750
but you're not caught up in the 24 hour
news cycle like you know like people

457
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,610
contend to do here in America because
you're working and you're getting back

458
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:57,500
from one operation,
you're preparing for another operation.

459
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,440
I've got guys in the field,
I got another element in the field.

460
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,410
I'm going in the field. It's, you don't
have time to be sitting around, hey,

461
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:06,530
I wonder what this politician is
saying about what we're doing,

462
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,990
how much you have of
leadership that you brought to,

463
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:11,840
it was just about managing
stress for your guys.

464
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,500
Just making sure that they were
actually okay in the midst of the chaos.

465
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,120
You absolutely you have to do.
Some of that. I mean it's, it's a,

466
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,490
it's a balancing act between all kinds.

467
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,130
There's all kinds of things that you're
trying to juggle at the same time.

468
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,410
And managing stress on the
guys is definitely one of them.

469
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,370
And in a situation where you're getting
guys wounded and your guys are getting

470
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:35,180
killed, that stress meter can
get pegged out pretty quick.

471
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,930
So you have to manage it.
You have to do it to the best ability.

472
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,590
That's it's, it's hard.
It's hard to, because

473
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,990
the war is going to keep going
and you are going to keep you,

474
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,850
you have work that needs to continue.

475
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,050
So the stress is going to build up on,
on the troops.

476
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:56,290
And it's different for
every guy. You know, the,

477
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,750
the front line seal or soldier or marine,

478
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,760
they're worried about getting blown up.

479
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,170
They're worried about
getting shot and killed.

480
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,910
They're worried about their
friends getting shot and killed.

481
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,530
They're worried about their
friends getting blown up.

482
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,390
And when you're in charge of
a bunch of guys you're in,

483
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,820
you're worried about all those
guys and that happening to them.

484
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,500
You're worried about if we make a mistake,
if we do something wrong,

485
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:19,160
if we cause some massive collateral damage
that has a negative strategic impact,

486
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,330
like not you have all those stresses
and you know, to control stress,

487
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,510
what do you do that it's like you look
at the things you can control and the

488
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,020
things you can't control.
Yeah.

489
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,640
You focus on the things you can control
and the things that you can't control.

490
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,970
You do your best to mitigate and then you
don't worry about them because they'll

491
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:38,960
drive you crazy. Yeah. What do you
make of sort of where we're at now,

492
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:43,250
having lived through the Iraq war,
like was it the right thing to do?

493
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,270
Should we have done things differently?
You should.

494
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,810
We have not just announced we were
leaving one day, the the whole,

495
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,770
the whole thing.

496
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,770
The whole thing is that hindsight is
2020 and any normal human being can look

497
00:26:55,291 --> 00:27:00,291
back at the American history as a whole
and find out all the mistakes that we've

498
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:04,050
made, which are, you
know, infinite, right?

499
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,010
We make an infinite number of mistakes
and we do the best to try and repair

500
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:09,330
those once they've taken place.

501
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,100
So for me to look at it from that
angle, it's like, okay, yeah,

502
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,050
there's all kinds of mistakes
we make as a country.

503
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,030
We have make as a country and
we will make as a country.

504
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,980
But the best way for me to
kind of rationalize or not
even rationalize because I

505
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:25,730
don't think it needs rationalization,
but I,

506
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,710
when I look at it from a granular level,
which is,

507
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,140
which is very straightforward,
we went into a city,

508
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,510
the city of Ramadi that
was being controlled by

509
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,800
sick in surgeons do most sadistic,

510
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,750
evil,
subhuman people that you can imagine.

511
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,370
They were raping, torturing,
skinning people alive,

512
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,320
murdering whole families, beheading
people. And when we went in there,

513
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:04,230
and again I'm not talking about
we as this small group of seals,

514
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:09,231
I'm talking about when this massive force
of us coalition and Iraqi forces went

515
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:15,711
into that city and liberated those
people from the torturous and sadistic

516
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,330
control of those insurgents,

517
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,780
the people of Ramadi were overjoyed
and they would cheer when we killed in

518
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:30,750
surgeons. And they would tell
us where insurgents were.

519
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,960
And it was a beautiful
transition to watch.

520
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,720
And it didn't really take place until
after we left. But after we left,

521
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:40,710
we saw this. It was peaceful.
It was literally peaceful.

522
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,070
It went from a complete war zone to a,
to a peaceful city.

523
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,580
And where they were,
they had markets opened the street again,

524
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,240
they had kids going to school,
they had girls schools. Now,

525
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,560
there wasn't an in the city of
Ramadi was schools for girls.

526
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,280
And this was just unheard of while the
insurgence where they're trying to,

527
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,440
you know,
uh,

528
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:06,230
punish the populous with
their psychotic brand of,

529
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,960
of Al Qaeda Islam. Right. And, and the,

530
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,110
the people of Adi did
not want that at all.

531
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,480
And so from that perspective, it's
like, I go to sleep every night.
