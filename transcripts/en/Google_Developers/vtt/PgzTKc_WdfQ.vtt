ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS:
Thanks, everyone.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.560
It's really good to
see this turnout.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.540
And I'm very excited
to talk to you today

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360
and I'm going to talk
to you about the team

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.140
that I work on, which is
called Google Crisis Response.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.930
And so sometimes
they say oh, so you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.630
work on when there's a
big crisis in data center,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.460
there's a network issue,
the computers are crashing.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.960
No.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.420
Actually, we deal with
humanitarian crisis.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.410
Like a crisis-- for example,
recently the Typhoon

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.480
Yolanda-- how to
bring information

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.710
in that type of situation.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.180
So the goal of this team is to
make critical information more

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.820
accessible in time of disaster.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000
What is very important
in this situation

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.210
is to have accurate information
and information that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.980
is relevant and credible.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.180
In particular, having
wrong information

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.130
can be even more hurtful
than having no information.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.130
So it's important to have
the right information,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.360
to deliver it to people
as fast as possible.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.630
When you're in a
crisis situation,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.740
timing is very important.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.680
And finally,
delivering to people

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.530
however you're connected.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.760
However you're
finding information

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.640
could be through a different
product, through your phone,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.250
through your desktop, and using
different type of standards.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.140
So since the team has
been created in 2010,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.170
we've been responding
to more than 45 crisis

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.400
around the world, and
different types of crisis.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.510
A big crisis, for example,
is this Typhoon Yolanda

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.950
in the Philippines that
happened a few months ago

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.440
that your city all heard of.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.430
But we also get involved
in smaller crises

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.830
in terms of localization.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.540
For example, after the Boston
explosion we got involved.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.660
Or more recently,
this morning there

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.370
was an airplane that
got lost and that

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.540
was from Malaysia Airlines.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.760
So right away we
got our team to be

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.900
able to put critical
information in front of people

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.570
as soon as we can.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.834
Phone numbers for people
to call if they're

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:09.500
looking for information
about the family

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.270
or even for the public
and for the media.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.770
But before I talk a little bit
more about what we developed,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.760
I want to go back
to how this team got

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.630
started because I
think it reflects

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.600
a lot of this period of Google.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.540
It actually all started
in January 12, 2010

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.450
when there was a 6.9
magnitude earthquake that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.530
had struck Haiti, near by
Port Au Prince, the capital,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.510
leading to the devastation
that most of you heard of.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.580
There was,
unfortunately, a quarter

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.910
of a million people got dead.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.150
The devastation in
terms of infrastructure

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.579
and for the country was huge.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.120
The first thing that
we did at Google

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.180
was update satellite imagery.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.760
So we had started
to do that even

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.450
before the earthquake
in Haiti, for example,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.690
for their Hurricane Katrina.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.990
So this is an example
of satellite imagery

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.130
that we get from our satellite
provider [? JOI ?] that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.200
is the picture of the golf
course in Petionville, which

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.970
is not far from Port Au Prince.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.900
That was before the earthquake.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.347
This is the same picture
after the earthquake,

00:03:11.347 --> 00:03:12.930
and only one day
after the earthquake.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.250
So we could update
the satellite imagery

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.170
in Google Earth in less than
24 hours after the earthquake.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.680
You can see in this
picture that people

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.792
started to leave their
house that was not

00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:27.250
sure anymore-- there was a lot
of aftershock at that time--

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.620
and start to go on this golf
course, which was a safe place

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.620
to be.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.920
And then 13 days
after the earthquake,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.620
that was one of the biggest
camps where people went.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.260
And actually, it was there
for one or two years.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.661
So this golf course
was not the only place

00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:47.410
where people went to
after the earthquake.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.810
So there was a lot of
small groups like this.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.040
So then you can imagine, when
you think about technology,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.850
that just having the
satellite imagery you

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.750
can do lots of analyses and
trying to find automatically

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.780
where are the groups
and where people went.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.040
But at that time we thought
the devastation was so, so big

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.030
that there's something
else that we could do.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.550
We couldn't just stay
here and do nothing.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.595
So we started first to
put some maps together.

00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:14.220
So there was a
different organization--

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.779
like the Red Cross, for example,
put some medical facilities

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.320
together.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.290
There was some damage
assessment done.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.400
So a lot of data around.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.150
People were sending emails.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.210
There's some that
were just linked

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.016
in some website in
different formats.

00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:31.140
But it was really hard for
anyone to find the data.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.720
So we manually put
together these maps,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.250
trying to put them in some
specific standards that

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.500
could be able to share with
each other, putting it in a way

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.060
that a lot of
people could access

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.610
the data without
bringing down the server.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.080
So we created some
of these maps.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.480
And then another big issue
that happened at that time,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.980
and you might have
remembered, where

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.460
it was really hard to
have news from people.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.840
I personally had family
and relatives in Haiti.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.270
Impossible to call them for
days and even weeks after.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.926
It was really hard
to get in touch.

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:05.800
And I was not the only
one in this situation.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.924
There were a lot of people.

00:05:06.924 --> 00:05:09.280
So some people started
to bring up some sites

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.580
with a list of missing people.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.240
So it was replicated everywhere.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.120
Some site just went down
because too many people

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.154
went on this site.

00:05:16.154 --> 00:05:18.070
So we started to brainstorm
with some Googlers

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.170
and say how can we do something?

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.390
Scaling is something
we're good at Google.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.420
So we started a hackathon
trying to bring together

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.920
all these databases,
trying to build an app that

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.370
will bring all of these things
together so that if you search

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.820
for someone, you can find
in one single place that

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.770
will aggregate all the
data from everywhere

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.650
and open so that
we could share it

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.130
with also other applications.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.030
So we did a 72 hour hackathon
with engineers from Google

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.030
from all over the world.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.060
We had people from
Sydney in Australia.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.810
We had people from London,
people from Tel Aviv in Israel,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.240
from the east coast of the
US, from the west coast.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.040
It was like coding for 24 hours.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.130
And 72 hours later, we
launched the first version

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.920
of Google Person
Finder to upload

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.010
this aggregation of data.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.100
So after this
experience, many done

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.704
by Googlers that
just volunteered--

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:10.370
they dropped their
main projects, saying

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.810
that this is important to do.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.280
We thought there's
so much that can

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.420
be done with technology to
help in situation of crisis.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.390
So we went to our
funder, Sergey and Larry,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.980
and told them, hey, there's
something we can do here.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.920
Technology can help.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.720
Why don't we create a team
of people, of engineers,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.200
to focus on this
specific problem?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.100
And we created the Google
Crisis Response Team

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.120
in the spring of 2010.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.360
So I want to present here
what we learned so far

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.340
and what we've been developing.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.730
So the first thing we did was--
the first question we had was,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.580
but internet, does it even
work during a disaster?

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.000
Because that's Google, that's
what we know how to do,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.150
is how to use best
the power of internet.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.740
So we started to study that.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.470
We are data driven, so we
started to look at data.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.510
This is a graph of the
number of user query going

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.220
to Google from Haiti.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.640
So you can see that
it's high and then it

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.280
drops on January 12, 2010.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.060
What is interesting
here, it drops,

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.660
but the blue line doesn't
completely drop to the bottom.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.780
There was still a
little bit of internet.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.150
I remember 24 hours
after the earthquake,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.577
chatting with someone who
was in an internet cafe.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:25.660
So there was a little bit.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.310
And then it took four
months to go back

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.940
to the internet traffic it
was before the earthquake.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.790
If you take another
example of a country that

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.520
is very prepared for
earthquakes, this is Japan.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.160
So on March 11, 2011, there's
this big magnitude nine

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.130
earthquake that I'm
sure you'll remember.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.070
This is the graph.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.690
So this was an earthquake that
happened in Japan, in Tohoku.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.880
This is the graph of the daily
traffic to Google from Japan.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.722
And what you can see
is that on March 11,

00:07:59.722 --> 00:08:01.720
the traffic stopped
a little bit.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.130
But it didn't stop
for that long.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.910
A few hours later, it was up.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.000
And so if people
couldn't use their phone,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.470
they actually could
use the internet.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.790
And so we know that from data.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.900
We also know that from users.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.970
And so this is Ruth, the
user, a Google user, in Tokyo

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.060
that sent us a thank you email.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.830
And in the email she explains
that their desktop email system

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.320
would not go
through on March 11.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.850
Their phone SMS
didn't go through.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.140
Their voice didn't go through.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.810
But Gmail connected them.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.330
They connected them
in the company,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.780
but also with other people in
Japan and people outside Japan.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.299
And it was not just Gmail.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.110
It was Facebook.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.860
It was Twitter.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.159
That was the entire internet
that was up and running.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:48.360
We can thank TCP/IP,
which is highly resilient.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.500
So there are some internet
that's still here.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.660
So the next question
we wonder was,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.750
but do people turn to the
internet to find information?

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.300
So we did some studies.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.690
So this is the traffic of
people using Google from Hawaii.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.030
And this is the number of
requests about tsunami-- people

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.770
searching information
about tsunami.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.810
So you can see the spikes
after big earthquake.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.170
The earthquake in
February 2010 in Chile

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.720
and then the earthquake
in March 2011 in Japan.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.480
So if we zoom in on
Japan on March 11,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.950
you can see here that
there's no one searches

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.710
information, very
little, about a tsunami.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.280
And then, at 7:56
p.m., a tsunami warning

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.310
was issued by the
Pacific Tsunami Center.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.780
And you can see the spike.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.150
What is interesting here
is the top of the spike

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.380
here-- so these
are for people that

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.500
are located in Hawaii that
are impacted by the tsunami.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.570
The top of the
spike represents 23%

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.260
of the search queries in Google.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.530
23% of people using
Google at that time

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.680
were searching information
about the tsunami.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.380
So people turn to
the internet and turn

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.160
to Google to find information.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.270
So our role is to
build some tools

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.280
and to make all this
information that

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.970
is critical for these
users available.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.192
And what is this information?

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:11.400
What are the needs of people?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.775
Because say, OK,
we're just going

00:10:12.775 --> 00:10:14.840
to go and provide
this information,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.220
but what do people need for?

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.350
And that's a big
challenge to understand.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.220
What people search for are
often, how bad is the event?

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.390
Do I need to evacuate?

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.390
Do I need something?

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.140
Am I impacted?

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.690
Am I impacted now, or am I going
to be impacted in two days?

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.820
Where is my family?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.620
Where are my friends?

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.480
My kids?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.740
Where are the people that
I was supposed to meet?

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.480
Or what resources do I need?

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.080
Do I need to go to a shelter?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.940
Do I need to pack up any water?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.830
Are we going to have a
risk of power outages?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.130
So all of this information.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.240
So for that we actually
have people on our team

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.190
go on the ground
in different places

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.780
and discuss with people
to try to understand what

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.680
are the needs to better define
what tools we should build.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.870
And what we learned from them
is that anything for any tool

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.160
that we want to build, we
have to follow these three

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.510
principals-- simple,
standard, and open.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.880
Simple-- during a crisis,
this is not the right time

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.450
to learn a new UI, to
sign up for a new account,

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.050
to type some
recaptcha, all of that.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.090
And we might be laughing,
but it's very important.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.570
And all of you who did some
UI design or-- designing

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.150
a simple UI is very complex.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.920
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.159
And best is even if you can
reuse a tool that people

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:35.700
use every day, and
then they're going

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.050
to know how to use it
during a crisis situation.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.280
Finally, standard.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.120
Using standard to
share your data.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.170
Collaboration is key
during a disaster.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.940
People exchange information
and work together.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.380
If everyone used a different
standard for their data,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.090
it's impossible to put all
of these data together.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.310
So use standard as much as you
can and then open your system.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.040
Open your data.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.690
Make sure that everyone
can access your data

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.590
in terms of license, but
also having an open API

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.800
so you can exchange
data between systems.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.110
Using open source
is even better,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.240
so that people can actually
reuse what you're doing

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.920
and understand
what you're doing.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.810
So I'm going to give you an
example of some tools that we

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.650
built and why having something
that's simple, standard,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.820
and open makes them very useful.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.760
So I talked before about
this Person Finder tool.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.020
So Person Finder is a very
simple web application

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.030
developed in Python
on App Engine.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.850
It's open source, where
you have two buttons.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.950
You have-- I'm
looking for someone.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.840
You want to have
information about a person.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.800
Or, I have information
about someone--

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.160
like you want to tell your
friends that you're safe.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.610
So you click on
a button and then

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.840
you have if you're looking
for someone, you type the name

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.130
and then you can have the
list of the people that

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.840
have been listed already in the
database with different status.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.410
If you click on one of
these links on John Doe,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.980
you have here details
page with the name

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.080
of the person, descriptions
that someone entered.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.410
So for example, here I
was looking for John Doe.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.610
And then there's Phil--
I have no idea who

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.770
is Phil, who is also
searching for the same person.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.520
When I finally have
some news from John,

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.875
then I'm going to update
this page and then Phil,

00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:14.090
who I have no idea who he
is and he doesn't know me,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.856
then he'll have that
information too.

00:13:15.856 --> 00:13:17.230
So without knowing
each other, we

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.970
did exchange some information.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.100
So after the earthquake--
oops, I forgot.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.820
So here we have a data API.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.500
So why Person Finder
was successful

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.530
in different
examples was that we

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.930
have a data API that will allow
us to search, read, and write.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.230
So we can have
different groups that

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.010
have different lists of missing
people, put them in the system,

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.340
read them, and write.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.430
It implements a standard--
PFIF, Person Finder Interchange

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.930
Format.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.290
So if other application
talks these standards then

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.800
we can exchange data.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.320
And then it's open source and
you can check out the code.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.230
When we launched Person Finder
after the earthquake in Japan,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:01.850
two hours after the
earthquake, initially it

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.580
was people who started to
enter information directly

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.160
on the tool.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.540
But we did a great
use of the API.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.030
And here's an example.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.150
When the Tsunami Warning was
issued, people pretty much

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.390
just ran out on their homes.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.170
You don't have time to
grab your bag or whatever.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.970
You just run and they
went into shelters.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.670
And then people
went into shelters

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.215
and they were looking for
ways to tell their family

00:14:23.215 --> 00:14:25.340
that they're in this shelter
and that they're fine.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.602
So they started writing
on piece of papers

00:14:27.602 --> 00:14:29.310
and put that on the
wall of the shelters.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.600
So they wrote their name and
the name also of the shelter,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.540
and et cetera.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.320
Then, the few people
that had a phone

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.480
that accessed the
internet, they took

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.690
a picture of these particular
places and put them

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:46.330
in a Picasa album on the
web for everyone to see.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.220
And then for every
single picture,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.040
some volunteers from all over
the world look at the picture

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.450
and then transcribed.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.632
You had to speak Japanese.

00:14:56.632 --> 00:14:58.340
And then they put the
name of the shelter

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.560
and below a list
of names of people.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.960
And then what you
can do, you can

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.830
write a simple program
that's like a for loop.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.950
You just look and say,
if I see this name,

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.660
check if it's in Person Finder.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.540
If it's in Person
Finder, update that entry

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.760
in Person Finder
saying I saw that name

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.780
in this particular
shelter and link it

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.710
to that particular photo.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.650
This way you can scale
and do that a lot.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.380
An output of that was that there
was more than 9,000 pictures

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.300
of data uploaded in this
particular Picasa album.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.840
More than 1,000 people helped
doing the transcriptions

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:38.490
and 130,000 records
in Person Finder

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.300
were updated through that.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.180
And all of that is
possible because we

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.510
used a standard, an API.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.000
And it was open and we
could exchange data.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.910
You don't have to be part
of Google Crisis Response

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.530
to write this small tool
that will do this upload

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.500
[INAUDIBLE] data
of Person Finder.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.990
So having something
simple, standard, open

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.980
allow you this collaboration.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.600
Another tool that we work on
is called Google Crisis Map.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.580
Some data that are crucial
during a disaster are geodata.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.020
But they are all over the place.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.320
And they're in different
format and different sites,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.080
and how do you put
all of them together?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.920
So we did create something
called a crisis map.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.570
So maybe some people saw that
in 2012 during Hurricane Sandy.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.420
We put a map together
where you could

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.260
see the forecast cone of the
hurricane, what are the areas

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.780
to evacuate, and all of that.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.450
You could overlap them and
have a better understanding

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.200
of how it looks like.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.110
And then it scales.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.640
You can have thousands
of people watching

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.910
the map at the same
time and it still works.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.990
Again we used some
standard here.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.110
So you can have
geodata in format

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:57.280
of KML, GRASS, all type of
geodata that people know of.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.760
So that will allow you
to put some data on a map

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.530
and visualize it.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.710
And here's an example
of how that's useful.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.940
Just after Sandy, I'm sure
lots of you were in the city.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.670
It was a big mess and we
didn't know what was open.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.940
Are there gas stations?

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.839
What are the pharmacies
and the hotels

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.990
if you have no place to be?

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.630
So the New Jersey-- the
Office of Emergency Management

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.220
in New Jersey put together
a list of all the businesses

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.150
that were open.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.930
And they put that as a
PDF on their website.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.940
And you're like, that's useful.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.780
So if you know
your own latitude,

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.450
longitude and parse that file
you might know what's near you.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.420
So how much do you do of that?

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.650
But this information is key.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.630
It was a very rich
piece of information.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.942
So we took it and
we put it on a map.

00:17:45.942 --> 00:17:47.400
You just put lat,
long and here you

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.040
can visualize what are
the gas station near you.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.620
But then quickly you
say, OK, the gas station

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.550
was open twelve hours ago,
but now does it have gas?

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.030
Because again, bad information
is worse than no information.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.280
If we tell you there's a gas
station that is open here

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.760
and you go there and there
is nothing available,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.860
then it's worse than not knowing
that there was something.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.400
So, we thought who
would know better

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.170
if there's gas or no than
people in the station.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.370
So we alert people here
to update directly the map

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.450
and add a comment if they
thought there was gas or not.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.130
And so getting-- crowd
sourcing that information.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.970
And while we were
doing that, we heard

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.860
about another map
that was created

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.270
by some students in New Jersey
that created this Mappler map.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.740
They actually-- so
these are the students.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.470
They were in a
room and they were

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.160
with their laptops and their
phone, calling all gas station,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.290
and updating some maps.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.300
But their maps had
less visibility

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.290
because they didn't have the
visibility that Google had.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.540
But because we use
the same standards,

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.400
then we told them,
hey, if you want,

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.710
we can just put your data that
is much better than our data

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:59.180
right now on the map so
that more people can see it.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.040
So we put their Mappler
gas station on our map.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.770
It was like two clicks, done.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.110
But then, in there,
people still could

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.890
comment on that information.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.010
So then, people commented
sometimes, say, oh, actually

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:12.880
this is closed.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.650
And then we would send
that information back

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.630
to the students in New
Jersey to the Mappler.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.710
So we take their
data, we display them,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.610
we collect more data,
we send back to them.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.850
All of that because we
speak the same language,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.080
the same standards, and
our systems are open.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.600
The final product I
want to talk about

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.500
is-- the main two, Person
Finder and Crisis Map,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.160
are usually used after
a crisis situation.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.810
How to deal, how to
help people recover.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.100
But what if you could
tell people ahead of time

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.240
to help them prepare?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.626
Having an alerting
system-- you have on TV,

00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:52.250
you have the little
banner when there's

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.620
something happening that
is here, or on radio.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.854
But what about the internet?

00:19:55.854 --> 00:19:58.270
What would be great if the
internet could tell you there's

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.170
something going on
right now, where

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.480
you are or based on what
you're planning to do?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.652
And what if there would
be some standard that

00:20:07.652 --> 00:20:08.610
expressed these alerts?

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.200
It happens that there
is such a standard,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.190
something called the Common
Alerting Protocol, CAP.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.020
It's been developed by
thousands of emergency managers

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.380
as a way to publish their data.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.960
It's a simple XML
standard where you

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.040
can specify what is happening,
when it will happen,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.210
who we should alert,
what is the region.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.050
Like there's a
hurricane in New York,

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.240
so we should warn this
particular set of people.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240
And what should they do?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.180
Should they evacuate?

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.970
What to do?

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.520
So you say, oh, cool
there's some data that

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.310
is here in a specific standards.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.720
We can do a lot with that.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.810
So we decided to take
some of this CAP feed,

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.870
ingest, and then build these
what are called Google Public

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.830
Alerts as a way to be
this alerting system

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.900
of the internet.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.520
So right now, we have these
data for a certain number

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.990
of countries and if you go to
google.org/publicalerts you can

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.750
see them and see what alerts
are happening right now.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.830
So we try to make them
easier to understand.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.372
So reading an XML file
is not that-- it's

00:21:12.372 --> 00:21:13.580
hard to get a message across.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.580
But then we put the
information like that.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.060
If there's a tsunami, we're
going to put the arrival time

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:23.570
and put the map-- what are
the places that are at risk?

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.820
And then we can also
try to help people

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.970
discover that information.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.386
Like for example,
on a web search,

00:21:28.386 --> 00:21:31.640
if you search evacuation, and
we know there's a fire near you,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.730
we're going to show
the evacuation warning

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.270
for that particular fire.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.290
Or you could say if
you're on your phone,

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.330
then we could alert
you through Google Now.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.220
How many people have
an Android phone?

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.780
OK.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.890
And do people have Google Now?

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:48.610
A few.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.580
So did you get some of
this winter storm warning?

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.350
Yeah, so that's our team.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:59.036
So the goal here is, we
have some information.

00:21:59.036 --> 00:22:02.350
We know where you are, so
we can push that to you.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.780
So a lot of things are silent,
like winter storm warning.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.940
We're just going to do
a little notification.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.669
But if this is a tsunami
warning or tornado warning,

00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:11.210
we might make a
noise and wake you up

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.626
because this is
something that you

00:22:12.626 --> 00:22:14.800
have to do something
specific about

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.990
and you should know about it.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.350
So having these-- the
hardest part of this

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.900
is actually getting the data.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.400
So we worked on building some
tools to help these agencies.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.460
Usually government agency
created these data.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.450
So we wrote a few
open source tools

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.850
and you can check
some of this URL out

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.850
to see how it looks like.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.410
So what are we doing next?

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.310
What are our big challenges?

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.850
We want to be able
to automate more

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.230
of what we're doing so that we
can respond to more disaster.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.090
Talking about a
Google Crisis Map,

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.780
we have to manually create
and put some data in.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.110
We're working hard to
try to make it easier

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.230
so that we could
automatically find some data.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.090
Empower more citizens,
so more crowd sourcing.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.735
Better engage the community
that is on the ground, that

00:23:06.735 --> 00:23:10.420
has the best understanding of
what's going on around them.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.784
These are people that
have the information there

00:23:12.784 --> 00:23:14.200
that know the best
what they need.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.910
And how to work with them and
provide some tools to actually

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.299
better understand that.

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:21.340
And one last thing that
we're not doing right now

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.000
is how do we do with offline?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.620
How do we do with
people, how do we

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.950
help people that are not
connected to the internet?

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.320
How do we help people that might
not have a phone, that might--

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.010
country that have low
internet penetration?

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.490
So that's what we're working on.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.650
And I want to finish
on this slide,

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.540
that if you're
interested, there's

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.190
a lot of communities
around crisis.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.000
And Crisis Mapper
is one that works

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.530
on how to best create
geographical data.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.550
This hackathon, Random
Hacks of Kindness,

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.950
is a good example where
you can go for a weekend.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.710
Or the Grace Hopper
Conference, the conference

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.709
for women in computing.

00:23:57.709 --> 00:23:59.750
The Google Crisis Response
participate every year

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.300
in the Open Source Day where we
work on one of our open source

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.090
tools to try to add features.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:06.890
So, thank you.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.540
So if you have any questions,
because I rushed a little bit.

00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:28.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.740
I was wondering about
the Person Finder.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.950
So I understand that privacy
is not at the top of your head

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.540
when you're in a crisis
and trying to find somebody

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.260
or letting somebody know-- but
what about when you search,

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.860
it comes up a list
of all the people--

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.800
how do you approach privacy?

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.950
Is it a concern?

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.780
Or have you thought about
sort of doing a matching thing

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.899
without having to be
able to see everybody's--

00:24:53.899 --> 00:24:55.440
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS:
Yeah, so that's

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.620
a very important question.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.900
Because as you said,
during a crisis situation,

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.130
people don't necessarily
have privacy in their head.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.960
So they're ready
to just give all--

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.670
you're looking for someone, so
some people might not realize

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.810
that they put a lot of
information there that

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.310
it's-- yeah, it can hurt them.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.135
So, for example, when you
enter some information,

00:25:15.135 --> 00:25:16.920
there's some information
we don't display.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.360
We don't display the date
of birth, for example.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.550
So we don't display it here.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.430
There's privacy in terms of
we-- between the first version

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.060
and now, there's been a lot
of things, mainly related

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.680
to privacy.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.510
And actually, we
work with, there's

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.800
a consortium working
on missing people

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.710
where there's different
NGOs in there.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.480
There's the Red Cross, and
we work all together on PFIF

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.080
in particular.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.190
And privacy is a big one.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:47.310
So we added for the
records to be expired.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:52.690
We also added a way for people
to lock a record in Person

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.470
Finder so other people
cannot add information.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.040
If you create it, you
can also delete it.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.290
Because unfortunately
we got some people

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.660
that did spam Person Finder
after the earthquake in Japan.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.540
Some people just
put wrong comments.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.430
You always have people that
will try to abuse the system.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.750
But my faith in
humanity just got

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.440
hurt when I saw that, when I
saw people putting bad comments

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.410
and for whatever reason.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.970
So we are working
on allowing people

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.810
to better control their
data, so you can actually

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:23.850
delete some data.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.480
You cannot download the
entire data, for example.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.420
So we try to do
things like this.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.900
But that's a big concern, yes.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.754
AUDIENCE: So, also
on the Person Finder.

00:26:39.754 --> 00:26:41.420
I thought it was
really interesting when

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.640
you were speaking, because
I was thinking, well,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.870
a lot of people-- my name's
very common, for one,

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.620
and I know a lot of
people have my name.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.460
And so I was thinking,
gosh, how would you

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.490
do conflict resolution
on something like that?

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.510
Because I imagine
if a family thought

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.370
that they had found
their loved one,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.286
and then it turned out
they hadn't, that there

00:26:58.286 --> 00:26:59.369
would be so much blowback.

00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:02.180
And it would be just more
hairy than it normally--

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.580
because you make a mistake
normally, it's not a big deal.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.077
But in a crisis
it kind of affects

00:27:06.077 --> 00:27:07.160
people in a different way.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.020
And I was wondering if
you could speak to that.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.280
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS:
Yeah, so that's

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.655
in discussions that we had
internally where we could say,

00:27:12.655 --> 00:27:16.320
oh, we can have some cool
clustering algorithm to cluster

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.290
people together.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:22.670
But as you said, the risk if you
miscluster people is very big.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.230
And we think it's
better for people

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.250
to go over several records.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.920
And so you have
more description.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.610
You just only have the names.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.700
A lot of people would say
that person is about that age,

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.220
and you have black hair or
blonde hair and et cetera.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.640
And so this way you can know
if that's the same or not,

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.290
and this is something that
is hard to do automatically.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.000
And unless we have
something that is 100%,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.720
we don't want to take
the risk to do that.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.580
But otherwise you
can actually use

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.310
people that will
do that manually.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.990
So that's in crisis situation,
a lot of people volunteer

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.720
to help.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.800
So we actually
have a UI where you

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.500
can mark two things
as duplicates

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.320
manually and say these
two are the same.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.880
But it's done by a human
being and not an algorithm.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.460
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.550
So speaking personally from our
experience in Sandy, my friends

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.050
and I are really
technically capable

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:16.920
and you're looking
for ways to help.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.040
Have you seen-- do you see this
evolving into a coordination

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.890
point for one ways
that developers

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.450
can help either during
a crisis or beyond it

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.830
by building tools, or
acquiring information,

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:33.330
or on the other side,
people who need help?

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:37.260
Like being a place to
find instead of people,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.207
but people who need help.

00:28:39.207 --> 00:28:40.290
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS: Yes.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.605
So I think in the past
three, four years,

00:28:43.605 --> 00:28:45.340
the ecosystem is changing a lot.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.510
So before it was a lot
like, oh, the government

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.700
is on top of things
and this organization.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.140
And they realize that
it's harder and harder

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.050
to just be everywhere.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.320
And people locally, they
have a lot of knowledge,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.110
and everyone is ready to help.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:05.370
And during Sandy, you had Occupy
Sandy was like a great example.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.660
Things just got
organized and they

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.960
use different technology
and all of that.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.830
Just people volunteering
and getting together.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.790
And so I think more
and more, so New York

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.960
has-- New York City
in particular--

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.980
they have a sort of a
task force, I think,

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.000
and they do regularly
some hackathon

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.730
to try to build some tools
and involve the community.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.970
So it's starting.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.190
It's still very hard
to put all of that

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.860
together because each
crisis is different.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.870
There's also the
notion of, there's

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.220
a group here I
put-- Crisis Common.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.680
And they do some crisis camp.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.390
Something happens, and
everyone gathers in a place

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.337
and, depending on your skill,
you can help and et cetera.

00:29:44.337 --> 00:29:45.920
So in that situation
there's a lot of,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.420
sometimes you end
up doing something

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.520
that someone else did.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.010
It's not the most efficient
part, but the point at the end

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.880
is just to be able to
do a task and if it

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.230
was done like two times, then
it's not the end of the world.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.800
So there's some community
that are growing and growing.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.460
So this Crisis
Mapper, for example,

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.570
has a conference every
year, bringing together

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.310
people that are doing
mapping in crisis.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.510
So little by little, when
you're talking about the--

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.560
it's almost, what
is needed where

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.510
and the coordination
between organizations.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.140
It's something that is
still a very big struggle.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.470
How do we know that there's
some water that is needed here,

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:20.880
and the Red Cross
is going there,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.080
but another organization
is also going there,

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.050
and how do you
coordinate all of that,

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.125
is something that
is still very hard.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.011
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:31.011 --> 00:30:32.010
Thank you for your talk.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.700
It was really good.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.390
My question is
about the offline.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.660
You mentioned one of the things
you're tackling now is offline.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.970
I come from Kenya and we
had post-election violence

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.320
in 2007 and 2008,
around that time,

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.010
and Ushahidi did a lot
of work during that time.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.460
And because a lot of
people didn't have access

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.400
to smartphones at the time and
were just using feature phones,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.890
they used SMS as a tool
to be able to do that.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.150
And I think they worked with
frontlineSMS, they're called.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.219
Have you explored that and what
has your experience been if so?

00:31:04.219 --> 00:31:05.760
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS:
Yeah, so that's

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.110
some discussion we have
regularly about how much

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.620
to add SMS.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.580
So Person Finder, we actually
added during Yolanda.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.050
We added an SMS feature.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.540
So we do a lot of
sometimes coding

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.000
on the fly when
something happens,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.030
when there's a specific need.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:25.450
And Typhoon Yolanda was an
example where the internet

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.250
penetration was not so high,
but with the devastation

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.960
it was much harder for people
to have access to the internet.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.700
And so we launched Person Finder
and we added a feature for SMS

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.690
to Person Finder.

00:31:42.492 --> 00:31:44.700
So this is definitely a use
case that we have in mind

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.700
and how to best use.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.920
We also, I personally think,
that for us, having some APIs

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.530
and having some local
groups know better

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.110
how to interface the
data coming from this API

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.590
to the local community
were almost be the best.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:02.870
You can imagine also radio
is big in these places.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.430
So having some local
groups that will

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.540
do this bridge in
between the two.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.630
But I know Ushahidi has
been doing amazing work,

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.880
and it started with the
riots in Kenya in 2008.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.500
So we don't have necessarily
SMS capabilities for everything,

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.242
but we try to piggyback as much
as we can on existing projects.

00:32:25.242 --> 00:32:26.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
know frontlineSMS

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.640
is a good API for that.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.900
So, thank you.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.609
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS: Thanks.

00:32:31.609 --> 00:32:32.650
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.020
I'm Victoria.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.270
Thank you for your talk.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.900
I was wondering
how do you manage

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.380
the teams that work on this?

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.310
And how is it different
to manage a team

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.660
when there's a crisis situation?

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.275
When the stress
levels are high, what

00:32:46.275 --> 00:32:49.750
do you do differently to manage
so things are still efficient?

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.960
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS: So
that's a good question.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.390
Because there's stress, but
when something happens-- so,

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.350
in four years it changed a lot.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.890
From when we initially
created the team,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.393
it was something
happened, everyone

00:33:03.393 --> 00:33:05.226
was running like crazy,
we're not organized,

00:33:05.226 --> 00:33:09.270
we were just coding all over.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.070
And now we're much
more organized.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.872
So for example, we have
people on pager rotation.

00:33:14.872 --> 00:33:16.330
So when something
happens, it's not

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.900
the entire team
that does something.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.620
So you can keep
working on writing

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.240
tools that will help you
automate most of the things

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:23.804
that you do.

00:33:23.804 --> 00:33:25.470
Eventually, it would
be great if we just

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.240
have tools and people
use directly the tools

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.220
and we don't need to do
something special when

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.370
something happens.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.150
So we also have people
in the team that are here

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.090
because they want to
work on crisis response,

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.350
so they're very dedicated.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.500
I am actually not
managing the team.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.790
I'm an engineer on the team.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.520
And the team grew,
so at the beginning,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.830
I think that plays
well to the team,

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:55.350
is people-- you do whatever
it takes to bring tools

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.460
or to launch something
that will help people.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:02.210
If that means that you have
to spend some time manually

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:05.190
populating a spreadsheet because
that's the only thing that

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.800
will be possible,
then you do it.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.489
I think we learned how to
manage the stress of working

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.050
on a topic that is hard.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.110
So for me personally, for
example, sometimes I just

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.909
work on-- we need to
launch Person Finder,

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.070
we need to enable some SMS.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.770
I don't necessarily
pay a lot of attention

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.230
to the situation on the ground.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.830
Otherwise, that's just going
to disturb me too much.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:32.150
So my husband sometimes tells
me, so you know, what happened?

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:32.985
And I cannot say.

00:34:32.985 --> 00:34:34.360
I say, we launched
Person Finder.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.068
We're doing that.

00:34:35.068 --> 00:34:38.770
I cannot tell you exactly
what's going on the ground.

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:42.070
That's some other people on the
team that are working on that.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.389
But it's a way, I think
also, to protect myself,

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:49.420
otherwise it's some really
hard situation to work with.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.070
And it's a lot of chat, lot
of everything goes very fast.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.570
So we have a common chat
room and everyone jumps in.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.520
And I should have mentioned--
so we are a small team,

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:03.300
but we work a lot with Google
offices all over the world.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.800
So for example, for
the Philippines,

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.383
we worked with people
from the region.

00:35:06.383 --> 00:35:07.930
Some people in India helped.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.999
So each time we work
with the local expertise.

00:35:09.999 --> 00:35:11.540
They know what's
going on the ground.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.060
We bring the technological
side and we discuss together.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.800
Even if we never met
in person, there's

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.424
some people I always spent a lot
of time talking to each other.

00:35:19.424 --> 00:35:20.960
I never met the person.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.959
Does that answer your question?

00:35:23.959 --> 00:35:24.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.292
Thank you for talk.

00:35:26.292 --> 00:35:27.750
This was a really
interesting talk,

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.610
and I think it brings
a lot of questions

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:32.555
to the surface about
public versus private.

00:35:32.555 --> 00:35:34.680
It's different in the case
of international crisis.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.914
But particularly for the
domestic crises like Sandy,

00:35:37.914 --> 00:35:39.330
it seems like your
team and Google

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:44.840
are filling a void where the
public sector has fallen short.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.680
Because they don't seem to
be up to date on technology

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.720
and using it for good purposes.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.680
That's great for now.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.350
There are some conflict
of interests in the way.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.550
Do we want government
to do this?

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.150
Do we want Google to do this?

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.820
I'm sure your team
and the company

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.612
has the best interests
in mind, but I

00:36:05.612 --> 00:36:07.570
feel like I sort of want
government to do this,

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.044
but I'm also aware
that they are not

00:36:10.044 --> 00:36:11.960
even close to being able
to do that right now.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.950
And I was wondering what
your feelings were on that?

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.790
If you think about
that, and if Google

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:21.550
is working with any public
sector organizations?

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:24.500
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS: So that
that's a very good question.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.100
And yes, we're working a
lot with the public sector.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.160
So we're working
a lot with FEMA.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.500
For public alerts, we get alerts
feed from government agencies.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.200
So we work with NOAH.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.560
So we work with, in Japan,
the local government

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.710
agency that provide
this warning.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.810
And so each time we
deliver either a new tool

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.990
or had new type of
data it's with them.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.210
And so it's really
like a partnerships.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.730
And when we talk about Crisis
Map, this is more a tool

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.590
that they could use
to put their data.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:00.520
So for example, the
state of Florida

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.660
has a preparedness crisis
map that is always here,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.990
and that they put data on
it when something happens.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.680
And that's why we're also
more sort of open source.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.190
So this is something that if
you want to run your own Crisis

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.770
Map, you can run
your own Crisis Map.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.450
If you want to run your
own Person Finder, you can.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.910
And I think that's very
important, to keep that open.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.430
But yeah, it's these
discussions about how much you

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:28.820
rely on a private company for
some information like that,

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.400
that is-- could be done
by government agencies.

00:37:37.809 --> 00:37:38.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.500
My name's Coreen Kircher.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.290
I was actually born in Haiti.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.050
I've been here most of my life.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.910
And the Google response
to the earthquake

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.550
was very, very
heartwarming because I

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:51.700
know a lot of the few people
we were able to reach initially

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.440
felt that maybe the
world forgot them.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.410
And I would say, no, you have no
idea how much people are trying

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.630
to do whatever
they can to assist.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:04.230
In any case, my question
has to do with how can you

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.790
enable people to sort of help
put on the map crises that

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.250
are not yet in the news?

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.030
So for example, if there
are some low level things

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.020
brewing in a country
where there is unrest

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.770
and things are happening, how
do you kind of enable that?

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:24.520
And I know part of your
work is collaborative

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.180
with various governments
to give you information.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.419
So if you're dealing with a
regime like North Korea, where

00:38:30.419 --> 00:38:32.960
there are a lot of things now
that are coming to the surface,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.210
but if there's a way to enable
those people who know what's

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.820
going on and there's just
not a lot of visibility

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.240
to the problem, how do you
enable them to connect?

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.410
And is there a
plan to help people

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.450
like that surface it to those of
you who make the final decision

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.920
to bring it to the Crisis Map?

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.247
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS: So
that's a good question.

00:38:54.247 --> 00:38:55.705
And in particular,
see if I can say

00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:58.110
that it's more like
political crisis.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:02.750
How can we help in terms
of political crisis?

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:07.240
That's something that we talked
a lot during the Arab Spring.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.700
After in Egypt and then
in Libya and-- this

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.520
is something that
is-- I know personally

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.990
it was hard because we
should be able to help.

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:19.037
But something like Person
Finder, you could say.

00:39:19.037 --> 00:39:20.870
We discussed with the
Red Cross at the time,

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.580
could we launch
Person Finder in Egypt

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.690
just when the riot started
and some people disappeared.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.520
You have to keep in mind
about how much it helps.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.180
So launching Person
Finder will just

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:36.200
have a list of all the people
that went to the demonstrations

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.534
and people are looking for them.

00:39:37.534 --> 00:39:39.116
They might put their
different number,

00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:41.100
or when you said
before, they might just

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.030
put all their private
information out there.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.720
But this is public
information, so you

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.760
don't know who is going
to be able to use it.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.860
So it's really hard to, in
terms of political crisis,

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.030
to do something and not
necessarily pick a side.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:56.270
So in that case, we
can support people

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.080
that want to use the tool
because they open source.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.070
So we can help them
rig up some tools,

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.710
but usually we don't get
involved in this situation,

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.327
even if it's frustrating.

00:40:05.327 --> 00:40:06.660
And I think that's going to be--

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:07.240
Sorry, guys.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.310
ALICE BONHOMME-BIAIS:
Last question.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.640
Sorry.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.290
But I'm going to
come to the reception

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.140
afterwards, so feel
free to just grab me

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.220
and just-- it's alright.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:13.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:13.690
No, no, no.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:14.450
That was great.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.300
Thank you so much.
