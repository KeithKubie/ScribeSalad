00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.350
In flow monitoring, a monitor which might actually be running on the router

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.580
itself, records statistics per-flow. A flow

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.770
consists of packets that share a common

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.500
source and destination IP address, source

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.140
and destination port, protocol type, TOS byte

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.600
and interface, on which the packets arrive.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.580
A flow monitor can then record statistics

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.950
for a flow, that's defined by the group

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.820
of packets that share these features. The flow

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.790
records may also contain additional information, such as

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.140
the next hop IP address, and other information related

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.400
to routing. Such as the source and destination

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.790
AS on which those packets appear to be coming

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.910
from and going to, based on the routing

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.740
tables, as well as the prefix that those packets

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.970
matched in the routing table. Flow monitoring is

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.630
much less overhead than packet monitoring, but it's

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.090
also much more coarse than packet monitoring because

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.650
the monitor does not see individual packets or payloads.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.450
Therefore, it's impossible to get certain information from

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.220
flow monitoring. Such as packet timing information. In

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.650
addition to grouping packets into flows based on

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.820
the fact that they share common elements in their

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.930
headers, typically packets are grouped into flows if they occur close

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.290
together in time. So for example, if packets that share

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.150
common sets of header fields do not appear for a particular

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.010
time interval, such as 15 or 30 seconds,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.030
the router simply declares the flow to be

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.210
over, and sends a flow record to the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.820
monitor based on the group of packets that it's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.840
seen up to that point. Sometimes, to reduce monitoring

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.650
overhead, flow level monitoring may also be accompanied with

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.080
samples. Sampling builds flow statistics based only on samples

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.022
of the packets. So, for examples, flows may be created based on

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:07.000
one out of every ten or 100 packets. Or a packet

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.020
might be sampled with a particular probability

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.120
and flow statistics might only be tabulated based

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.000
on the packets that end up being sampled randomly from the total set of packets.
