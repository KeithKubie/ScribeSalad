00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.270
Right before I do any kind of public speaking
my hands start shaking uncontrollably and

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.819
i feel like my heart is exploding.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.839
Thanks adrenaline.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:16.219
How do I STOP this?

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.150
Adrenaline is one of the most famous hormones
in the animal kingdom and it's our response

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.630
to a "stressor."

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.580
Stressors can be anything; a sudden scare,
playing sports, skydiving, or even performing

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.850
in a play, or talking to a crush.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.220
After it's secreted by the adrenal glands,
adrenaline kicks your body into high gear,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.870
increasing blood circulation, breathing and
metabolism rates; and gets the muscles ready

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.870
for action.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.820
All this activity can have some strange side-effects
on your body, especially if you don't end

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.290
up running for your life or fighting a rival
for your next meal.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.630
Adrenaline is why your hands shake when you're
nervous (your muscles are all aquiver with

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.820
excess energy), and the blood pumping in your
ears?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.550
That's adrenaline’s fault too.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.120
Adrenaline is also called epinephrine and
it can make us do some amazing things.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.690
For example, when epinephrine dumps into the
body, it causes us to turn carbs into glucose,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.750
the body's fuel source, and our skeletal muscles
actually get stronger.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.140
It's almost like we're naturally overclocking
our muscles; letting them run hotter with

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050
this boost of energy for a short time.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.070
They think this is how hysterical strength
works -- that's when people lift cars to save

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.070
their kids and stuff.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.680
It's not recognized by science, but we can
see the level of potential strength in our

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.600
muscles when we're hit by a massive electric
shock.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.760
Because it's not the shock that throws us
across the room, but our own muscle contractions.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.630
We can throw ourselves across a room in an
instant, we're that strong, and adrenaline

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.640
can hack into that power.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.050
Epinephrine is synthesized and released under
orders of the hypothalamus.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.909
The hypothalamus is a control region of the
brain responsible for homeostasis -- or the

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.640
general equilibrium of our body.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.170
It regulates circadian rhythms, body temperature,
hunger and thirst as well as the balance between

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.300
stress and relaxation, among other things.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.400
When humans feel stressors and thus are flooded
with epinephrine, we have an instinct to run,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.930
cry or yell, and all are valid.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.320
Tears contain stress hormones and crying releases
them from the body.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.950
Yelling fills the lungs and activates the
amygdala, the part of our brain that manages

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.050
fear responses, and ultimately releases feel-good
brain chemicals, and rigorous activity works

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.560
the adrenaline out of our system.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.630
But there is another way!

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.530
New York City police are trained to combat
the effects of adrenaline on the job, as are

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.030
members of the military, and other high-risk
professionals; they all use a fairly simple

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.390
body hack -- breathing.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.910
Most of the time breathing is controlled by
the sympathetic nervous system, the same system

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.819
that controls the fight-or-flight response,
heartbeat, digestion and so on...

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.340
It's automatic, and not consciously controlled.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.050
Breathing, however, can be consciously controlled,
as you are probably doing right now because

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.450
you're thinking about it.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.910
This a bridge between the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.990
Think of your body as an engine, the sympathetic
system is the gas.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.990
GO GO GO FIGHT OR FLIGHT.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.750
The PARAsympathetic system is the brake.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.750
Calm.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.750
Calm.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.750
Caaaalllmmmm…

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.360
During times of high-stress (and high adrenaline)
the body shuts down digestion, and muscle

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.550
shaking can affect fine muscle movements,
or mess up your big speech or monologue during

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.720
the school play.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.210
So when this happens, you can forcibly engage
the calming parasympathetic system by forcing

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.690
yourself to breathe.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.330
Tactical or "combat" breathing (according
to the military) involves breathing in for

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.989
a four count, holding for four, breathing
out for four.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.989
That's it.

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.379
If you do that a few times, the Vagus nerve,
the 10th cranial nerve that connects your

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.620
brain to your torso, will activate, slowing
your heartbeat, stimulating digestion, and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.390
throttling down blood pressure and so on.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.910
With training, professionals can use this
to force their bodies to stay calm and only

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.810
feel the effects of adrenaline when needed,
rather than becoming a victim of those effects.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.280
So next time you’re super nervous try breathing,
and let me know what you think over on twitter.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.070
It might seem kinda new-agey, but it's practiced
by people like the Airmen of the U.S. Air

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.070
Force.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.090
Who we'd like to thank for sponsoring this
episode of DNews.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.819
Every day American Airmen go above and beyond
to break barriers both professionally and

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.819
personally.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:11.290
The United States Air Force is powered by
Airmen, fueled by innovation.
