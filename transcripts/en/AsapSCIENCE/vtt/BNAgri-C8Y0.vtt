00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.820
2.5 million years ago we first began to eat
meat.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.540
Prior to that our ancestors ate a vegan diet of berries and flowers and only when early

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.680
hominins began to eat more seeds and nuts, therefore taking in higher levels of fat

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.699
and less fiber did our bodies begin to adapt to handle meat.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.329
But what would happen if now you ONLY ate
meat?

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.070
Without fiber rich foods like lentils, beans,
and broccoli you are going to feel constipated

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.519
and uncomfortable.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.900
Not to mention, the simplest way for the body
to make energy is to convert carbohydrates

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.120
into glucose.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.460
In the absence of carbs your body will have
to burn fat and break down important proteins.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.120
Creating glucose from protein is known as
gluconeogenesis, and it occurs in the liver,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.160
creating a nitrogen waste that is converted
into urea.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.079
Too much can lead to protein poisoning - which
includes symptoms like nausea, diarrhea, and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.079
potentially death.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.150
It’s even been documented if you ate only
a lean meat like rabbit, which has hardly any

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.590
fat, you could eat and eat and eat and still
end up wasting away.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.439
Another potential killer could be the lack
of Vitamin C. Humans are one of the few animals

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.869
that are not able to synthesize the Vitamin
on their own.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.609
Without easy access to Vitamin C from fruits
and veggies your body will be unable to effectively

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.679
create collagen, a structural protein found
in your tendons, ligaments and skin.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.100
This will put you at high risk of scurvy and
cause you to have poor wound healing, rotting

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.479
gums and personality changes.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.679
If not treated you would die from infection
or bleeding.

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.459
But eating raw meat could be the way around
this.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.579
The cooking of meat degrades most of the Vitamin C, but raw, thick, chewy collagen rich skin

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.329
and blubber of whales can take in 36mg of
Vitamin C per 100g serving.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.259
Way more than the 10mg needed to fight off
scurvy.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.990
This brings us to an interesting case: shaped
by low temperatures and a stark environment,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.909
a traditional Inuit diet consisted of what
was hunted and fished with little, if any,

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.509
plant food, dairy products, or carbohydrates.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.469
Despite this, cardiac death rates were half
that of other Americans and Canadians.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.400
How can you be healthy on a fatty diet without
any fruits and vegetables?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.680
You can snack on organ meat like liver to
get your recommended Vitamin A, which is vital for

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.770
eyes and bones and Vitamin D (for your bones
too). And Oily fish rich in omega-3 fatty

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.770
acids will benefit your heart and vascular
system.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.260
Inuit bodies have adapted to manage gluconeogenesis
by having larger livers and increased volumes

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.610
of urine to get rid of the extra urea.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.080
A recent genetic study investigated the genome
of Greenland Inuit and found a selection for

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.310
variants that create a protective effect against
cholesterol and triglycerides.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.710
So, it is possible to thrive on only meat
but it’s important to remember that Northern

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.800
communities have relied on animal food out
of circumstance and necessity.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.120
Their high fat diet was intended to keep weight
on for days of hunting, and when food was

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.920
insecure, not lose weight like modern low
carb diets.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.780
Unless you are planning on eating raw whale
blubber, organ meat, and have genetics on

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.540
your side consider sticking to a balanced
diet of all the major food groups.
