00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.560
Using Rice's theorem,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.570
we now have a quick way of detecting
whether certain questions are decidable.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.320
Use your knowledge of
the theorem to indicate

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.580
which of the following
properties is decidable.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.250
For clarity's sake, let's say that
a virus is a computer program that

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.400
modifies the data on the hard
disc in some unwanted way.
