00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
On Compromise

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.360
"Jerry!"
"Yeah?"

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.360
"First week in our new flat, babe."

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.820
"Oooohh! Where's my poster gone?"

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.100
"Oh, I thought this was better for the kitchen."

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.280
"But you said you liked it!"

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.200
"I did like... I love it... I love having something I love to look at when I'm getting the vacuum cleaner."

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.400
"You put it in the cupboard?"
"Yes."

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.660
"God, I'm hungry!"

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.300
"Jerry! You need to close the package after you've eaten the crackers. Otherwise they'll go stale. They're all stale now."

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.780
"That is the point."
"What?"

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
"I like stale crackers. You know that. I hate crunchy food. It makes me feel sick."

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.600
"Well, it's the same with cereal. That's why I always leave the boxes open."

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.000
"What happened in here?"
"What do you mean?"

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.440
"Where's everything?"

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280
"Babe... this is who I am. I'm a creative. I can't help it."

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.300
"You think you could try to help it?"

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.220
"That's a bit unreasonable!"

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.040
"Well... don't do that! Now I feel bad."

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.020
"What are you doing?"

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.600
"I always tidy to loud music."

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.280
"But I can't hear anything! What am I supposed to do?"

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.860
"Sorry, Tess... that's who I am!"

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.200
"Tess! What are you doing?"

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.920
"It's how I low esteem, Babe. It's who I am!"

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.440
