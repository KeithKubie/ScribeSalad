00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.375
Now, let's look at
the Image Acquisition Pipeline.

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:06.106
This is something again, we've discussed
differently, when we talked about

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:09.292
cameras, but now, let's talk about it,
in detail in this context.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.583
Of course, we start off with a 3D scene.

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:15.976
And of course this scene is being
captured, and the, basically,

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:21.043
the capturing in, information is called
the Scene Radiance refered to as L.

00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:22.402
And basically,

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:28.042
what the units here describe is
watts per steradian meters squared.

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:33.275
Steradian is a measure of the solid
angle, and because these are 3D scenes,

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:38.346
and the light is coming out, in form
of a cone from everywhere the basic

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:42.958
idea we want to do is use the cone
information, to capture the light.

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.672
So in essence what that basically
means is if I have a scene,

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:49.584
what I will be doing
basically is using a cone.

00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:52.717
And the steradian is basically,
kind of, counting for

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:57.057
all of the [INAUDIBLE] information
that's in this cone, from any point.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.237
And that's basically,
allows us to kind of have an area,

00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:01.708
from that point onwards.

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:06.433
To just reiterate scene radiance,
and referred to as L, is basically,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.001
watts, which is energy per
steradian meters square.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.203
Steradian is the measure
of the solid angle.

00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:16.282
Primarily because again,
this is a 3D scene, and

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:19.875
the light is coming out in form
of a cone, from everywhere.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:23.395
Of course, when we have a 3D scene,
to capture an image from it,

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:24.292
what do we need?

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.667
Of course, Optics.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.125
So here, basically now,
we use the out Lens, and Optics, and

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.875
that converts all of this
3D light information.

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:35.833
That's why, we have the solid angle,
and the cone basically, coming in.

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:38.042
And now, of course, we have a 2D sensor.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:41.580
So we, of course, do not have
the information from steradians, but

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.292
we do have watt per meter square.

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:47.145
And we know, that was something we
referred to as Sensor Irradiance, and

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:49.458
it's something we ip, in, labeling as E.

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:50.669
This is a Linear mapping.

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:54.493
Once I know this, and if have this
information, when it hits the screen,

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:58.084
I can actually now, or a sensor,
I know, what this measure will be.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.829
Next stage in the pipeline of course,
is the Shutter,

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.543
because shutter is the amount of time,
a light is allowed into my sensor.

00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:06.625
And we know that basically,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:12.542
E times delta t gives us the information
towards getting, the sensor exposure.

00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:17.167
And you may recall of course, that we
refer to the exposure as H, which was

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:21.958
equal to the sensor irradiance, and
amount of time, the shutter was open.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.550
And this is something again,
we've looked at before,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.085
so in essence we'll be going
from 3D scene, and now,

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:29.917
we're getting sensor information
of the exposure values.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:34.244
Continuing on, we basically now, will
have a sensor, which would be a CCD,

00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:37.586
again, we've covered
the details of how a CCD works.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:41.395
Light comes into a CCD, and what we
basically, get is electrons collecting,

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.543
and depletion layer kind of,
collects it.

00:02:43.543 --> 00:02:46.707
In essence, what we're doing
is computing the voltages,

00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:49.376
at different types of capacitors,
within a CCD.

00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:53.425
Next step of course, is an analog to
digital converter, basically, takes

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:57.876
these voltages, and converts them into a
digital values, to give you a raw image.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.949
And of course, then we want to do some
sort of remapping, from the raw image,

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.084
again, if you were doing camera roll,
you would just use this information.

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:07.219
But sometimes you basically,
get compressed pixel information

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.583
of intensities, and that's where
we get the intensities artifact.

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:12.810
We have covered each, and
every aspect of this earlier, and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.875
you can refer back to the previous
lectures on this one.

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:18.826
But the bottom line is, from 3D scene,
once we have the scene radiance,

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:21.843
there's a linear mapping,
to get sensor irradiance.

00:03:21.843 --> 00:03:24.564
There's another linear
mapping based on again,

00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:26.708
the time opening to get the exposures.

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:29.966
And then, there is a bunch of
different operations that happen,

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:31.042
at the sensor level.

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:33.529
So, here is one thing we
want to note here is,

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.169
this whole process of
the pipeline is linear.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.084
There are lots of linear
mappings going on.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.083
This part could all be non-linear,
right?

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:43.503
I mean, there are no dir, direct
linear equations that would actually,

00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:45.168
let us predict this analysis here.

00:03:45.168 --> 00:03:48.376
And they're also sometimes depends
on the kinds of sensors, and stuff.

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:52.183
But this is linear, and now, we need
to kind of understand, how we can

00:03:52.183 --> 00:03:56.386
use this to understand, and gain
information, from what's in the scene,

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:59.422
to what we want on the sensor,
in terms of an exposure.

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:02.205
So far, we've studied the image
acquisition pipeline, now,

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:04.793
let's look at some of
the mathematics associated with it.

00:04:04.793 --> 00:04:09.370
So, of course, this whole pipeline
starts off with L which is the scene

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.518
radiance, a linear mapping to E,
a linear mapping to exposure, and

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:17.833
then, of course, all the way down here,
to give me intensity values.

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:22.802
Of course, we're interested in this
pipeline, but we are also interested in

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:27.042
the inverse of this pipeline,
which let's me compute the inverse.

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:30.560
Now, we are basically, what I am
interested in, is I have an image,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.445
can I actually now, predict the model
of the whole scene intensities here,

00:04:34.445 --> 00:04:35.921
in terms of scene radiance?

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.501
So, I'm interested in both of those.

00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:40.850
And that's the kind of stuff now let's
think about, to be able to model.
