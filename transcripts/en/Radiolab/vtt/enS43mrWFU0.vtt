00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.680
Great. You're listening to radiolab,

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.790
the podcast from who you are, public radio and public radio.

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.820
[inaudible],

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.410
<v 1>C o. N n P. R. Three two one. Hello,</v>

5
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:21.080
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast and a,

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.330
we're working busily on season five. We thought, wow, we do that.

7
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.630
We would bring you a little extra, extra extra.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.780
So we very recently went to the cashland science museum run by the National

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.010
Academy of Sciences in Washington d c Yes. To talk to an audience. Not, oh,

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.840
there were a bunch of scientists there but they weren't all science? No,

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.490
they were mostly just just people.

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.550
And we asked those just people to consider three very puzzling radio questions

13
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.910
that we have every time we put our show together. So yeah,

14
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.620
<v 0>here is that conversation.</v>

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.280
<v 2>So we figured since this is a science place,</v>

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.680
you guys are probably science inclined folk.

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.580
We would talk about some of the troubles that we run into when we talk about

18
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:05.060
science or try to problems like density,

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.050
like unfriendly genus of ideas.

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.460
But they're great ideas.

21
00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:14.690
But how do you somehow make them friendly to people who maybe don't like or

22
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.940
don't know that they like science?

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.790
So we're gonna kind of go through some of our, uh, favorite problem solving.

24
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.010
<v 3>Yeah, we have hurdles. Uh, the, uh, the,</v>

25
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.800
the most obvious hurdle is when you step into a room to have a conversation with

26
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:33.210
someone who is smart, knowledgeable, very knowledgeable,

27
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:35.340
actually and articulate,

28
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.370
and they start talking and you think in the back of your mind,

29
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.070
<v 2>oh. And they read papers like a,</v>

30
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.940
which is going to be the subject of our first clip,

31
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.870
selective silencing of cell communication and how it influences anterior or

32
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.180
posterior pattern formation and see elegance,

33
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.400
which is a heavy collection of words. Yes. Like heavy,

34
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:57.580
like a, like a hippo, which is a,

35
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.890
which is a wonderful animal but heavy. And so I think one of our,

36
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.170
our goals is to take the hippo and strap on some ballet shoes and make it a,

37
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.313
do a pure wet.

38
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.710
<v 3>So here is an example of what you're going to hear is a woman named Cynthia</v>

39
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.100
Kenyon, brilliant scientist. She's talking about a little worm that she has. Um,

40
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.210
she has figured out she's done something to the worm that allows the worm to

41
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:24.750
live longer than the wormwood, ordinarily live. Not just a little longer,

42
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.570
but like twice as long. Um,

43
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.190
so just imagine that you're the one holding the mic and this is what you hear.

44
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.090
<v 0>The daft 16 gene makes a protein called the Daf 16 protein and that protein</v>

45
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.390
binds to the DNA where other genes are and it,

46
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.030
it activates a whole bunch of other genes.

47
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.110
So the way it works is that the hormone binds to the Daf two receptor.

48
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.680
And when that happens, daft two receptor, um,

49
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.240
kind of squashes the activity of daft 16. It turns it down. Okay.

50
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.850
So Dev 16 can't bind to its, its, uh,

51
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.550
genes in the DNA and make them more active. Okay?

52
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.120
So when you come along with a mutation or some other way,

53
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.560
and you inhibit the activity of the receptor, now you liberate daft 16.

54
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.320
It's free.

55
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.960
It springs into action and it activates about a hundred genes in the DNA,

56
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.670
in these hundred genes. Each do a little tiny good thing for the cell.

57
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.700
<v 3>Okay. So yeah, you're sitting there going, oh yeah.</v>

58
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.750
If you know what she's saying. No, I do. I do know what she's saying.

59
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.020
But I'd say just using like you're scanning somebody talking like that and you

60
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.910
know you're hearing the right, you're hearing squish. I think she said squish.

61
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:38.150
I think she said spring liberate. She said, liberate. Liberate. Yes sir.

62
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:42.340
Her verbs or her verbs are very, very useful to me. It's these nouns,

63
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.680
a deaf deaf to that. She's the, I said,

64
00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:50.310
what do you do with a thing like that? What we've done here is we've, uh,

65
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.390
we've used the verbs where we're happy with the rose,

66
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:56.410
but we've amplified and accessorize the nouns. I think. No, I think it's a,

67
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:59.320
I think it's the other way round. Actually. We, we stole the nouns,

68
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.590
replaced them with our own and we amped up the verbs. No, no.

69
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.870
We took the nouns and we made them much more colorful.

70
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:11.160
Anthropomorphize them. Gave them a character rich, rich story.

71
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.970
Totally on the same page. Yeah. Okay. Here, here's what we did go.

72
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.600
<v 0>When we are making mutation in the def two gene, we damage it.</v>

73
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.390
That actually causes it not to work as well.

74
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.220
So that actually is kind of profound.

75
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:25.820
That tells you right away that the worm has a gene in it that shortening the

76
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.220
warms lifespan, which is why she calls it

77
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.220
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

78
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.630
<v 0>Murray butchy grim. We purchase,</v>

79
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.170
it's the gene that makes you die if you're aware,

80
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.810
right? So by damaging this gene,

81
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.780
Cynthia and her team essentially are taking the grim reaper

82
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.940
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.150
<v 0>out. Stop that. Okay,</v>

84
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:54.470
so the question is what exactly is the daft to doing to make the cell age more

85
00:04:54.471 --> 00:04:58.310
quickly? Here is where the story gets a little weird.

86
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.420
Well, we found another gene whose name is also daft, but it's a different app.

87
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:09.190
It's called deaf 16 and this is a gene whose normal function is to keep you

88
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:10.024
young.

89
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.370
It's like a fountain of Youth Change Too. There was a grim virgin before, right?

90
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.040
And now there's a fountain of youth genes. That's what she discovered.

91
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.910
And inside the worms, these jeans are struggling with each other.

92
00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:26.010
Here's how it works. When it, when a worm ages,

93
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:31.011
normally the def two receptor GAF to kind of squashes the activity of deaf 60 it

94
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:32.274
turns it down.

95
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.293
<v 5>Sorry.</v>

96
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.283
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

97
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.450
<v 0>and so the where majors, okay.</v>

98
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.920
So when you come along and you inhibit the activity of the Daf two receptor,

99
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.270
now you liberate daft 16 right? It's free.

100
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.050
It springs into action and it activates about a hundred genes

101
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.280
and the DNA, these hundred genes

102
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.710
<v 3>each do a little tiny good thing for the cell.</v>

103
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.810
And altogether it makes the cell live twice as long. Okay, there you go. Yeah.

104
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.390
Now the question is, and you know, we come,

105
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:10.070
I come out of a national public radio,

106
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.970
he comes out of sort of Wny C so we come out of a sort of strong journalism

107
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:14.804
tradition.

108
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.840
You can't do any of these things in a newsroom for one of the issues here is

109
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.340
<v 2>how much should you embroider. Yeah. It's also, I mean,</v>

110
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.370
the question I think also is how stupid do you want to be?

111
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.050
Yeah. You know, I mean,

112
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.070
this is something that we always argue about because there are,

113
00:06:38.071 --> 00:06:41.490
I mean there's a thousand things we left out and if pure scientists would be

114
00:06:41.491 --> 00:06:46.200
very upset perhaps sometimes at all of the things that we didn't say here

115
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.970
<v 3>on the other hand is not an in,</v>

116
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.510
and I speak from the television tradition where stupid is our middle name.

117
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.120
We w we g I mean I,

118
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.060
I have been in network television for so long that if anything gets a little too

119
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:01.990
complicated, I instantly turn him and said, no, just cut it. Just get rid of it.

120
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.930
Just get rid of it because we don't have to go there.

121
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:07.270
And then we just save ourselves all the sweat and all the bother.

122
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.830
So what you do is you sort of, um, you watch each,

123
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.190
we watch each other's eyeballs to see like when have we come to the very, very,

124
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:17.980
very edge of acceptable stupidity,

125
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.390
just and weird and repetition. Yeah. And then that's where we rest.

126
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.580
<v 2>Well those are the, the second technique we want to get. Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.300
We want to talk about music.

128
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.990
One wanted to sort of talk a bit about how we use the music and what are the

129
00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:34.050
principles that guide those choices and to do that.

130
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.830
Wanting to play a clip again, this is raw tape of a,

131
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.720
of a very interesting guy and mathematician that we really like.

132
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:45.270
We talked to a lights named Steve Strogatz who we were talking to him about,

133
00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:49.200
I forget what, and he just told us this thing about fireflies.

134
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.270
So this is the raw raw tape here.

135
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.070
<v 6>It not here, but in, in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia or Thailand,</v>

136
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.020
there are enormous, uh, congregations of fireflies along river banks. I mean,

137
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.740
picture it, there's a river bank in Thailand in the remote part of the jungle.

138
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.540
You're in a canoe slipping down the river. There's no sound of anything.

139
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:10.010
Maybe the occasional, you know,

140
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:13.970
exotic jungle bird or something and you're looking and you just see, I mean,

141
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:15.170
I can't do it. It's radio,

142
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:20.171
but you see boop boop with thousands of lights on and then off,

143
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:22.064
all in sync.

144
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.050
<v 2>So that's a little clip of tape that, uh,</v>

145
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.520
I remember when he said that we bought, we will kind of look at each other like,

146
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.730
Ooh, that's kind of interesting. Okay. We can work with that.

147
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.790
<v 3>It's also very Patriot league. You get the whole idea, you know,</v>

148
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:36.750
you're on a river, you know, you're seeing thing.

149
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.320
So there's no particular reason to add anything.

150
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.560
<v 2>Hmm. But however, um, here's,</v>

151
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.150
here's that same clip of tape all gussied up. Um, here's what we did with it.

152
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.010
<v 6>Trip. There's a river bank in Thailand in the remote part of the jungle.</v>

153
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.250
You're in a canoe slipping down the river. There's no sound

154
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.290
<v 5>of anything. Maybe the occasional, you know,</v>

155
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.450
exotic jungle bird or something and you're looking and you just see woo

156
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.700
woo woo with thousands of my time.

157
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.050
And then off, all in sync.

158
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.240
[inaudible] imagine all the trees as far as you can see are all brilliantly lit

159
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:30.260
and then totally dark, brilliantly lit, total darkness,

160
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.310
all of them in sync. Yeah. And no Westerner has ever seen this site.

161
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:36.500
There was folklore, there was the stories about it,

162
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.940
but nobody had gone in and photographed. And capital's samples. Well,

163
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.850
not until 1965 this was done by John Buck,

164
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.670
John C, k, one of the great researchers on his other records.

165
00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:53.560
I'm 92 buck and his wife Elizabeth, Mash.

166
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.630
Buck went to Thailand and a captured bags full of male fireflies could catch

167
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.990
them, shake them for anxious at firefly,

168
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.160
rain down and brought them back to their hotel room and we turned off the

169
00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:07.994
lights.

170
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.220
We turned over Louis and saw that the fireflies flittered around on the walls

171
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:15.170
and ceiling flew back and forth,

172
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:19.340
flashing randomly Lisbon layer on the floor of the room.

173
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.660
I was just tired.

174
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.260
John stayed awake and he would still want who saw within a few minutes,

175
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.460
little groups duos and trios formed and after a while,

176
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.450
fourth one would join in a closer, closer together.

177
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.030
And then finally they were secret eyes.

178
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.610
The whole room was blinking in perfect harmony. He was excited. The next day,

179
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.080
Morgan told me outlet. 20 years later,

180
00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.360
John Buck is still asking this question, well,

181
00:10:49.361 --> 00:10:52.510
what is going on today on radio lab?

182
00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:57.511
We will do as Steve Urges and step away from the individual to find mystery

183
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.540
beauty and order in the group.

184
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.600
<v 2>So there's a real question that I'm, did I want to ask,</v>

185
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:13.020
do all the noises and the bleeps enhance what Steve Strogatz the story he told

186
00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:19.630
us? Or does it rob it in some sort of way? I don't know.

187
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.380
I don't know.

188
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.060
<v 3>I have a prejudice just cause a of the, my, my sheer off of some of the,</v>

189
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.480
of the deep musicality of things like that. This is jams territory,

190
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.220
so he's not allowed to say, but there is something a mile, um,

191
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.420
just the bucks. For example, you hear first of all, a string of voices.

192
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.670
So you're a Robert's voice. You hear jazz voice,

193
00:11:39.671 --> 00:11:42.700
those are sort of radio eve voices. And then you hear Steve Strogatz, his voice,

194
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:47.620
which is a rich voice. And then these two fabulously strange people,

195
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.790
one of whom sounds like he's just basically made of sawdust.

196
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.820
Yeah. I don't know what's with Mrs. Buck.

197
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:56.950
She seems to be hanging upside down or whatever.

198
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.090
But then when you pick those things where you get all, uh, and,

199
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.490
and, and you get this strange, crazy quilt of, Oh, just, um, uh,

200
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.840
of raw ingredients just in the sound. And you know,

201
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:13.390
a lot of people would listen to the buckles. They will be, can't use it.

202
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.220
And a little hard to hear, little hard to understand.

203
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.640
But this isn't that this is a guy who just jumps in with both feet and gets

204
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:25.470
happy that we're going to get gradations and variety in mass.

205
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.740
Just the sound of voices. Let's talk about, uh, something else. Uh,

206
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.690
how about the, the, the, the problem.

207
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.840
<v 2>Okay. And then tech. So, uh, so what are we done? We've done a,</v>

208
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:37.090
what was their first one? We did a analogies.

209
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:40.330
Metaphor number two is music and stuff. Music and stuff.

210
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.920
A number three, be personal. Be Third Grade.

211
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.860
Let me explain what I mean. Yeah. So, so the, uh,

212
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:51.010
the National Science Foundation and other people have done a lot of surveys to

213
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.060
see how people feel about science. And when they ask people,

214
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:59.050
how do you feel about science, they will say, uh, yeah, you know,

215
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:02.830
I sort of like science. It's okay. Um, but then if you ask the question,

216
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.170
have you ever liked science? Will they say, yeah, you know,

217
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:09.940
when I was in third grade I loved it cause we would do these experiments that

218
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:10.601
involved, you know,

219
00:13:10.601 --> 00:13:15.340
the absorbency of paper towels and boiling eggs and it was amazing.

220
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:18.160
It was so much fun. It was like something right in front of me and it was me.

221
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:22.270
I can do it. And then came the Krebs Cycle. Yes. Yes.

222
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.840
Somewhere along the way that joy gets drained away

223
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.770
<v 3>probably by the Krebs, right? Yeah. So,</v>

224
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.240
so all over in a plot that was probably hatched in some dark cave somewhere,

225
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.140
not too far from Osama bin Laden.

226
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.220
There was a meeting of science teachers from the ninth grade who decided that

227
00:13:38.221 --> 00:13:41.910
they would take the simply interesting business of swallowing something and

228
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.560
having the banana finally get down so we can actually feed each individual cell

229
00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:49.490
each cycle. Thank you very much. And I'll get up now and you know that this,

230
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:49.680
this,

231
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.910
how this turned into a championship memorization contest in which you had to

232
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:57.510
learn cycles within cycles, within cycles, within cycles,

233
00:13:57.511 --> 00:14:00.690
within cycles and why, why, why, here's why.

234
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.690
Because the ninth grade teacher wanted to say, actually,

235
00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:07.770
thank you very much Danny, Sheila and Freddy. You are the scientists.

236
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.700
The other 37 of you can go home now. Okay.

237
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.590
<v 2>Yes. And in an an interest to invite those other 37 back in, um,</v>

238
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.550
we, uh, we, we take a decidedly yes, anti crib,

239
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.040
Anti Krebs even approach and we, we,

240
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.450
we live in a state of permanent third greatness in the sense that we want this

241
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:30.320
to be something that feels like a, like, like it did, it's yours again.

242
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.820
And so the ways that we do that just sort of subtly are when Robert and I go and

243
00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:38.180
talk to somebody, we always use the sound of us walking in the door,

244
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.530
knocking on the door.

245
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.700
It's like the most important sound in all of radio lab is that sound of

246
00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:45.860
knocking. Oh, why exactly. Why is that? Well,

247
00:14:45.861 --> 00:14:48.080
it's because it's the sound of discovery. It's like a,

248
00:14:48.081 --> 00:14:50.780
it's a way of inviting people. And I come along to your room,

249
00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:52.190
that's a discovery. Well,

250
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:55.010
it's the sound of saying rather than a scientist at a podium,

251
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:58.940
it's a scientist who is in a space that we can go visit and have an adventure

252
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:00.080
with. Okay.

253
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.300
So then we have one other objection that regularly gets thrown at us all the

254
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:09.800
time. Mostly by, there's a guy at NPR named Robert Smith. Excellent,

255
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:13.370
excellent reporter who will lean over what I'm doing all the time and say,

256
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.070
so what's it with you and what's in with you? I said, why, why, why, what?

257
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.990
He goes, what everybody else here goes out into the world. And you know,

258
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.100
if you're going to interview a cat, go find a cat. You make up a cat,

259
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.450
why can't you just go sign the world as it lays?

260
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:32.240
Why is everything has to be built from the bottom up? I said,

261
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:36.470
it doesn't have to be that. That's not a, well now that you mentioned it,

262
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.980
there is a tendency we have because we enjoy, um, frankly the,

263
00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:45.290
the craftsmanship and the artistry of doing this. But I mean,

264
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:49.010
his criticism of us is that we always sort of make it up and he was like,

265
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:51.980
why do you always have to make it up? Why don't you just go have an adventure?

266
00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:55.870
Don't make up an adventure. Just have one. So we thought, well yeah,

267
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.870
that's kind of a good idea. Not like it hadn't occurred to us before.

268
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.670
It's a show about science,

269
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:05.840
but why not just be the science in a pseudo sciencey kind of way?

270
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.210
Be The experiment in other words. So try this at home. Yes,

271
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.760
they again, terrible the thing.

272
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.370
We've bumped into a really interesting opportunity in our latest season in the

273
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:23.660
laughter show, we were talking to a laugh scientist and uh,

274
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:26.630
he told a, told Robert something that Robert didn't quite buy,

275
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.470
which led us to have certain ideas. Well, here's the raw tape.

276
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.700
Laughter causes laughter. You can throw the joke away.

277
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:38.690
Laughter causes laughter. Well,

278
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.210
it's a really prove that you'd have to give a record.

279
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.290
It was somebody laughs and then somebody else laughs and then you laugh and then

280
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:48.590
someone else laughs and nothing's going on except the laugh. Yeah.

281
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.940
So you can't get a laugh going from nothing actually you can't.

282
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.690
So he claims, yeah, no, I just thought that was ridiculous.

283
00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.190
I mean I think you have to start with something.

284
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:01.730
Someone has to fall down on a banana peel or something. But he pointed out,

285
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:05.210
and this is true, that a lot of laughter is, hey, you want to go get a sandwich?

286
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.130
Okay. It's a lot of social laughter. It isn't having to do with funny. I said,

287
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.290
no, but I, but I mean I'm talking about laughter. Laughter.

288
00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:15.170
Do you think you can get laughter, laughter going from just laughter.

289
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.260
And he said he his,

290
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.330
it's his idea that there are certain laughs that have kind of biologically

291
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:23.960
contagious property and that if you laugh in a certain way,

292
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.730
other people in the room can't help but laugh. So we thought, well,

293
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.200
why don't we try this way? If he's right,

294
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.750
theoretically Robert and I should be able to go up to union square,

295
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:37.751
get into a crowded subway train and just start laughing and through the sheer

296
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:41.870
verve of our laughter that laughter should spread.

297
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.110
This was our experimental design was that I would walk in, we,

298
00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:49.100
four of us prepared, two of us had tape recorders and recording equipment.

299
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.040
They surreptitiously would enter the otherwise crowded Manhattan subway.

300
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.880
This is Russia.

301
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.410
Then Jad and I would enter from a different door and put ourselves within the

302
00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.550
reach of the microphones,

303
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.820
which would be Annville invisible to most people on the subway. Yes.

304
00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:06.330
Here's how it sounded. Okay, here we are, union square experiment.

305
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.333
It's about to begin

306
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.350
<v 5>[inaudible]. I show them a book.</v>

307
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.340
They're getting very hot,

308
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.400
<v 2>no nothing, nothing. And we tried it.</v>

309
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.460
We tried it over and over and over and over. I, this is take seven.

310
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.510
<v 5>We're on a downtown six train</v>

311
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.080
<v 2>and we were starting to be like,</v>

312
00:18:57.081 --> 00:19:01.980
we were the crazy people in the subway and it wasn't simply that we weren't not

313
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:05.450
amusing to them. They began to hate us and look at us like we were lepers.

314
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.780
And it just was not working at all.

315
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.760
And we did this pretty much all day cause we were like,

316
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.040
we are going to crack this one and maybe, you know, we could have,

317
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.350
we could have discovered that we have just proven professor provene wrong,

318
00:19:18.351 --> 00:19:19.850
you know, and laughter does not. But no,

319
00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:23.990
for some reason we felt that we ought to do what he thought we could have done

320
00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:27.080
had we only done it quote, write unquote whatever that was.

321
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.850
So here's what happened. Um, final, uh, trip of the day.

322
00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:35.480
We get this notion that, okay, well it hasn't worked the first 11 times,

323
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:38.300
so maybe it'll work the spinal time. If, uh,

324
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.870
maybe the problem is that we have these two people with us, Lulu Miller, Orion,

325
00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:45.710
McManus who are the recorders and they kind of enter the train with us

326
00:19:45.711 --> 00:19:47.660
surreptitiously and sit and try and be invisible.

327
00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:49.210
But they've got these big machines with them.

328
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.580
The machines are throwing the whole experiment off. I don't know.

329
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.440
So we sent them ahead. Yes. And I figured they would ride the train uptown.

330
00:19:57.441 --> 00:19:59.360
We would get on as if we don't know them.

331
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.150
So we were like several steps ahead of them so they'd,

332
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.810
we would enter and no one would make the connection between the,

333
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.880
the microphone bearing twosome and us. You have no relation to them at all?

334
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.790
Not at this was going to make the entire place scream with laughter.

335
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:18.790
We felt yes, exactly. Unbeknownst to us, however, uh, Lulu and Orion, uh,

336
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.840
hatched a devilish plan.

337
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.170
<v 5>Good afternoon. New York is, I have a quick question.</v>

338
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:27.660
I'm hoping everyone here can help me out a little bit this afternoon.

339
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:29.850
I have a bet with my bosses.

340
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.790
We're going to get on it the next train and they don't think that it's possible

341
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:36.870
to get an entire subway car full of people to laugh. They think people are too.

342
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.880
You know, times. I don't want to have fun, something like that.

343
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.410
So do you think you guys can help me out with this? The next,

344
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.230
the next stop. They're going to get on to guys. All right,

345
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.560
they're going to start laughing. All right.

346
00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.940
We're just going to kind of like chocolate and then we're going to see if we get

347
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:55.500
the whole train. Justin. Rory.

348
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.530
Can you do that? Yeah.

349
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.640
All right guys, can you guys hang on

350
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.050
<v 2>there? My kids on this train, they were nuns on this trade area.</v>

351
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.320
It was like a whole schmear of people on this chain.

352
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.420
We had no idea that this was happening.

353
00:21:11.421 --> 00:21:15.920
We were standing on the platform expecting yech yet another failure. And uh,

354
00:21:15.921 --> 00:21:18.620
and uh, here's what happens is the train arriving.

355
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.880
<v 5>Okay, here comes the six train. Take 12</v>

356
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.783
train,

357
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:31.260
take out a book with the book canceled or excuse for the humorous interaction

358
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.193
here.

359
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.960
They start to get laugh in a moment.

360
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.470
<v 4>[inaudible] the place went crazy. I was so blessed.</v>

361
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:59.683
I tell you,

362
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.470
it was the most terrifying thing we've ever experienced.

363
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.840
<v 2>Bar None, because to go from nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.</v>

364
00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:13.980
And then to go to everything it was, we ran out of the trade.

365
00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:16.890
We were frightened. This is actually our reaction afterwards.

366
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.731
<v 5>Oh my God.</v>

367
00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:21.150
It's like being with too many clowns coming out of the little Volkswagen,

368
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.620
you know, 50 of them [inaudible] my day.

369
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.910
Oh No, not me. I just thought, Oh my God, I've just gone to hell.

370
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.930
I don't know. Cause it was too big to be so incident two, yes.

371
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:43.030
<v 2>So I don't know what the lesson to draw from that really make it up.</v>

372
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.903
That's what the lesson is.

373
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:48.370
They get up and leave the science to the professionals really besides that. Um,

374
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.910
so I guess the,

375
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.350
<v 3>the other thing that we've then we'll finish and you can ask questions if you</v>

376
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:57.950
want, uh, is that we try to hope that maybe that the, the um, the,

377
00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.460
the surprise and the kind of, uh,

378
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.120
frankly just delight of having a conversation together is somehow,

379
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.690
um, an ingredient that other people would, if you turn on the radio,

380
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.270
you turn on your iPod, whatever, and you hear this, that you kind of,

381
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.800
there's an image I have, uh, from the New Yorker I think, or from someone who,

382
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.670
uh, a kid learned how to read and uh, got very,

383
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:24.670
very excited by books. She was maybe four or five years old and she,

384
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.460
she just loved books. Maybe three, four years old.

385
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.470
And one day her mother walked in and found the little girl standing on the

386
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:34.660
picture book with your toes,

387
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.090
kind of trying to curl and months of what are you trying to do?

388
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:42.010
And the kid said, I'm trying to get the book. Um,

389
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.940
and I, I was kind of hoping that, you know,

390
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.230
among the other that that this program would create a sense of just a happy

391
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.230
exploration that people when they hear it would just want to take off their

392
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:57.800
socks and their toes. Try to get in the book. Yeah.

393
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.303
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

394
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.870
<v 2>So in any case, I mean, do you guys have any questions?</v>

395
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.470
<v 3>Yeah, that's our presentation more or less so we can go to questions. Yeah,</v>

396
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:07.581
we're, oh, we get,

397
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:09.400
why don't you go to this person here in the green and then we'll,

398
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.370
I just wanted you to speak a little bit about the introduction, which, you know,

399
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.220
obviously has the layers and time shifting.

400
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.300
And I'm getting old enough. I'll find that a little annoying

401
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.730
<v 2>and why? See? Yeah. Oh, that, yeah, it's weird.</v>

402
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:27.430
There's been a lot of emails about is did you send us an email?

403
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:30.640
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

404
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.030
<v 2>you know, I, I'm a bit annoyed by it too, frankly. I want to change it,</v>

405
00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:39.031
but I made all of those in one feverish night about four years ago and I'm,

406
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:40.900
and it's time for another one.

407
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.210
<v 3>I mean, what is the one in mind? Yeah, what did you have in mind?</v>

408
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.440
Who knows what he had in mind and has strange people go? Uh, it has,

409
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.720
it seems to be some combination of vomit

410
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.070
<v 4>and uh, and uh,</v>

411
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.380
<v 2>it's the, I really know. I mean it was a,</v>

412
00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.970
I had everybody read the same little block of text on a metronome,

413
00:25:00.971 --> 00:25:03.310
so they're all reading it in the same tempo and then you just kind of like,

414
00:25:03.311 --> 00:25:06.430
you take the syllables and I'll mash it up and it seemed like the right thing to

415
00:25:06.431 --> 00:25:08.740
do at the time. I don't know. And it's, I mean it,

416
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.100
it does make a certain statement that okay,

417
00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:16.590
you just heard all things considered and right now the rules don't apply. So it,

418
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.270
it's, it's like a, it's like a pellet cleanser in a way.

419
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.530
It's like the cracker before the next one. So, so it has that effect,

420
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.393
which is useful.

421
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.670
What time is this supposed to end at eight or we have a clock that's counting.

422
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:34.000
Yeah. Yeah. My favorite episode was the one with the voyager and,

423
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.920
and you know, any joint and Carl Sagan, nothing.

424
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.210
And I listened to the things that you guys put on the web with, you know,

425
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.940
Phillip Glass and Alice Waters, all those things.

426
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.860
So I feel like you guys have this really interesting amount of insight from

427
00:25:44.861 --> 00:25:47.050
doing this show. What would you guys put on the voyager?

428
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.230
The voyager is a injured Inter 1977.

429
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.700
Carl Sagan and his wife and a few others were charged with making sort of a

430
00:25:57.701 --> 00:26:00.490
mixed tape of the human experience, putting it on a gold record,

431
00:26:00.491 --> 00:26:03.100
sending it out the space so that billions of years from now,

432
00:26:03.101 --> 00:26:07.540
an alien would find it somehow play the record and maybe know about us on some

433
00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:08.330
level

434
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.470
<v 4>and attack planet. Um,</v>

435
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.080
<v 2>well that's a really good question. Yeah, I would put,</v>

436
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.773
<v 4>okay,</v>

437
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.860
<v 3>see, I'm not so sure that I want to say hello. So that's why I didn't,</v>

438
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.230
you know, maybe you, are you really scared of it? Well,

439
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:32.330
here's a guy who wrote guns steal and uh, yes, Jared Dyer. So Jared, don't,

440
00:26:32.331 --> 00:26:34.030
I haven't talked to him about something else. And he said, you know,

441
00:26:34.031 --> 00:26:38.860
that voyager thing was the most dangerous act that humanity has ever made.

442
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.980
It's just silly though. Yeah, I know. But he's interested. Collapses of it.

443
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.170
<v 2>This is a, this is a man who is not what we'd call an up.</v>

444
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:50.160
No one's going to find the record. It's not for the aliens. It's for us.

445
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:51.660
It's a gesture. You know, it's like a,

446
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:54.490
it's as much about what we want to say about ourselves as India.

447
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.310
The alien can't play the record.

448
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.820
<v 4>It's just not gonna. It's not gonna work.</v>

449
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.510
<v 2>What do you mean the alien can't play the record?</v>

450
00:27:02.511 --> 00:27:06.350
The alien presumably is a very sophisticated being.

451
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.830
There is one particular buck cello piece I would put on.

452
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.640
That's the only one I can think of definitively at this moment.

453
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:15.510
<v 3>I might say one,</v>

454
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.540
I, I might, uh, a Broadway show. Do you know? No.

455
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.123
<v 4>Okay.</v>

456
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.520
<v 2>Food, glorious food from Oliver? No.</v>

457
00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.520
<v 4>Hi,</v>

458
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.910
<v 3>I would put it, I think I would put a, uh,</v>

459
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.900
I would put baby's laughing in of of multiple species.

460
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.250
I mean if they do laugh, I mean I I would put,

461
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.100
I would just put the cries of babies. Okay.

462
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.610
<v 4>Okay.</v>

463
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:51.310
<v 2>No, no, no, not, not the selling that happy cries a baby. Oh,</v>

464
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.040
Beethoven. You got Beethoven so easy. It's like a lazy answer.

465
00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.070
<v 3>Uh, but good question. Yes. Yeah. Uh,</v>

466
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.480
<v 2>well that's a good place. Yeah, that's a good place to end. I just,</v>

467
