00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:02.495
- [Instructor] In this video
we're going to go through

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:05.341
a few examples of setting up some problems

00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:07.591
with constant acceleration.

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.977
We're not going to solve them,

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:11.838
we're just going to look at what we know

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:14.181
and what the question is asking for

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:18.673
and then identify which one
of these equations over here

00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:21.259
will be the most useful
for helping us solve it.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.484
So before we jump into the examples,

00:00:23.484 --> 00:00:27.212
I wanna say that it is very important to

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:30.008
understand where these equations come from

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.185
to really develop a
strong understanding of

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:36.095
position and velocity
and acceleration and time

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.115
and how they're all
related to one another.

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:40.719
And Sal has a lot of
videos that go through that

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.763
and can help you build that understanding.

00:00:42.763 --> 00:00:44.670
But once you have that understanding,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.648
these equations are kind of
like using a calculator where

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:48.849
they help you save time.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.632
It's important to

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:53.514
know how to add, subtract,
to multiply and divide,

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:55.838
so you know what a calculator
is doing when you use it.

00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:56.900
But once you understand that,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.579
the calculator is a really valuable tool.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.042
And that's what these equations are like,

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:05.750
they're tools that we can
use when we understand

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.169
where they come from.

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:11.343
With that out of the way, let's
dive into our example here.

00:01:11.343 --> 00:01:12.697
So the question says,

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.018
"A light rail commuter train

00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:19.185
"accelerates at a rate of 1.35
meters per second squared.

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:24.012
"How long does it take
to reach its top speed

00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:26.519
"of 80 kilometers per
hour starting from rest?"

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:30.278
All right, so let's unpack
this and see what it's saying.

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:33.320
So let's just start at the beginning.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.248
A light rail commuter train accelerates

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:38.595
at a rate of 1.35 meters
per second squared.

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:39.704
So that's pretty direct,

00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:42.175
it's just telling us
what the acceleration is.

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:44.615
So let's write that down.

00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:46.615
The acceleration is 1.35

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:51.805
meters per second squared.

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:54.575
All right, there's one thing.

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:55.974
Okay, so let's keep going.

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:59.105
How long does it take
to reach its top speed

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:01.428
of 80 kilometers per
hour starting from rest?

00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:02.912
So that one's a little
bit more complicated,

00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:04.917
there's more going on in here.

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:06.230
But if we just start at
the beginning and say,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.977
"How long does it take?"

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:10.097
That by itself is a question.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.454
There's some more stuff afterward,

00:02:11.454 --> 00:02:14.314
but that by itself is just
asking about the time,

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:16.114
how long does it take?

00:02:16.114 --> 00:02:20.281
All right, so let's note that
by circling this time here.

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:24.811
We don't know what it is yet,
but this is our question,

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.443
we're being asked about the time.

00:02:27.443 --> 00:02:30.877
All right, so if we keep going here,

00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:32.738
we get, all right,

00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:36.193
how long does it take
to reach its top speed

00:02:36.193 --> 00:02:38.157
of 80 kilometers per hour?

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.798
That's saying its top speed
is 80 kilometers per hour.

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:42.704
When it's done speeding up,

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:45.964
it'll be going at 80 kilometers per hour.

00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:48.845
So that's the final velocity

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:52.505
or just our velocity at the time here.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.631
So that's 80 kilometers per hour.

00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:57.714
80.0 kilometers per hour.

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:03.254
And sometimes you'll see this
right here written as V sub f

00:03:03.254 --> 00:03:06.935
to really explicitly say
it's the final velocity.

00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:11.321
So the notation might vary
in your physics class.

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.852
Whatever notation you use, that's fine,

00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:18.060
but make sure to ask
yourself what is this symbol

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.471
really talking about.

00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:22.304
So anyway, 80 kilometers per hour,

00:03:23.654 --> 00:03:24.487
per hour.

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.000
Okay.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.734
And so we have that.

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:31.432
And then if we keep going,

00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:32.828
it says, "Starting from rest."

00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:35.743
So that's saying that at the
beginning when it starts,

00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:38.493
it's at rest, which means it has

00:03:40.184 --> 00:03:41.576
zero for it's initial velocity,

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.455
it's just sitting there.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:44.840
So let's fill that in,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.340
that's zero meters per second.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.873
Okay.

00:03:49.873 --> 00:03:52.540
So we had analyzed this question

00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:56.101
and we see that, actually,

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.351
the change in distance didn't appear

00:03:58.351 --> 00:03:59.881
anywhere in this question,

00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:03.776
it's just these four values right here.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.844
So let's see if we can
look at these equations

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:09.464
and identify one that
has all of these things

00:04:09.464 --> 00:04:11.645
and doesn't have delta x,

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.362
since we don't know delta x

00:04:13.362 --> 00:04:14.881
and we're not looking for it either.

00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:18.855
So we see these two have delta x here

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:20.938
so we can rule those out.

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:24.889
And this one also has a delta
x so we can rule that out.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.221
So that leaves this one.

00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.844
Let's see, it has velocity,
the final velocity here,

00:04:30.844 --> 00:04:33.790
it has the initial velocity here,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.425
it has acceleration here,

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:38.338
and then it also has time which
is what we're looking for.

00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:39.754
So we can use this.

00:04:39.754 --> 00:04:43.638
We've figured out that for
this question right here,

00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:46.524
we can just use that top equation.

00:04:46.524 --> 00:04:48.410
All right, and then to continue this

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.631
we would plug in numbers
and then solve for t

00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:54.365
and see what that time indeed is.

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:55.697
So for this video,

00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:57.239
we're not going to have
to go through that,

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:59.029
we're just going to go through another

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.328
example of setting things up.

00:05:01.328 --> 00:05:04.961
So let's go down to this
question right here.

00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:08.982
While entering a freeway,
a car accelerates from rest

00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:12.531
at a rate of 2.40 meters
per second squared

00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:13.948
for 12.0 seconds.

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:18.014
How far does the car travel
during those 12 seconds

00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:20.841
and what is the car's final velocity?

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:23.699
So this one actually asks two questions.

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.040
Let's just focus on the
first one to begin with,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.622
and also let's see what we know.

00:05:29.622 --> 00:05:33.789
So while entering a freeway,
a car accelerates from rest

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.382
at a rate of 2.40 meter
per second for 12 seconds.

00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:41.271
So there's a lot of information
here in this first sentence.

00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:43.800
So let's see, it says,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.712
"Accelerates from rest," right
here, accelerates from rest.

00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:49.835
That tells us that the initial
velocity is zero, right?

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:53.002
From rest, it wasn't moving initially,

00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:56.232
it was at rest.

00:05:56.232 --> 00:05:57.163
So let's write that down.

00:05:57.163 --> 00:05:59.915
This also, just like the previous example,

00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:02.556
had an initial velocity
of zero meters per second.

00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:04.096
That's not always the case,

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:07.389
but it happens that in
these two examples it was.

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.564
So let's keep going.

00:06:09.564 --> 00:06:11.142
So it accelerates from rest

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:14.669
at a rate of 2.40 meters
per second squared.

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.098
So that's telling us
what the acceleration is,

00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:21.314
2.40 meters per second squared.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:25.481
So let's write that down, 2.40
meters per second squared,

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:28.393
meters per second squared.

00:06:28.393 --> 00:06:31.157
And in all of these problems,
it's important to think about

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:33.745
whether something is moving

00:06:33.745 --> 00:06:35.888
in the positive direction
or in the negative direction

00:06:35.888 --> 00:06:38.121
or if it's accelerating
in the positive direction

00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:39.772
or the negative direction.

00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:41.198
It actually looks like for these examples

00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:43.733
we've chosen everything is

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:45.245
moving in the positive direction

00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:47.200
and accelerating in that same direction.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.528
So we won't have any
negative signs pop up,

00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:51.674
but it is important to think about that

00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:52.862
when you're doing these kinds of things,

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:54.351
just in case something is negative

00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.493
and that does affect your
answer and what's going on.

00:06:58.493 --> 00:07:02.185
But anyway, so it's accelerating forward,

00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:03.948
everything is going in the same direction.

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:07.205
So we're thinking of the forward
as the positive direction

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:10.246
and they're accelerating, this car,

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:14.413
is accelerating at 2.40
meters per second squared.

00:07:15.416 --> 00:07:18.042
All right, and it says also

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:21.263
that it's doing that for 12.0 seconds.

00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:24.148
So we can write that down as well,

00:07:24.148 --> 00:07:25.231
12.0 seconds.

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:34.057
All right, so we know three things here.

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:37.011
And you'll find that
in problems like this,

00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:38.061
that's the magic number.

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.789
Once you have three of these,

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:44.289
you can find out the other
pieces using these equations.

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:45.625
Anyway, so the first question says,

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:49.792
"How far does the car travel
during those 12.0 seconds?"

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.898
Well, it's asking how far,

00:07:53.898 --> 00:07:56.119
so that's going to be the delta x here,

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:57.893
this change in position.

00:07:57.893 --> 00:07:59.741
How far does it travel
during those 12 seconds?

00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:02.541
It's going to be this value right here.

00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:04.541
So this is our question,

00:08:06.422 --> 00:08:07.922
circle it here.

00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:10.221
So now notice we don't have this,

00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:12.805
so we can look for an
equation that doesn't have

00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:15.388
this final velocity value in it

00:08:16.318 --> 00:08:19.139
and then that will be an equation that

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:20.814
will hopefully have these other four,

00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:22.696
but we'll have to check that.

00:08:22.696 --> 00:08:26.772
This one has that final velocity in it,

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.804
so we can rule that out.

00:08:28.804 --> 00:08:31.527
I see this one also
has the final velocity.

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:34.481
This one doesn't have the final velocity.

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.320
So let's look at that.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.755
So it has the position,
the change in position,

00:08:38.755 --> 00:08:42.757
that's what we're looking
for, it has it right there.

00:08:42.757 --> 00:08:45.039
The initial velocity is right here,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:47.068
so we have that as well.

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:49.219
Let's see, it has time
in it and we have time,

00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:51.365
so we will be able to plug that in.

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:53.323
And then finally, it
also has acceleration.

00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:55.906
So it has everything we need,

00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:58.064
it has the thing we're looking for,

00:08:58.064 --> 00:09:02.444
and it doesn't include anything
that we just don't know,

00:09:02.444 --> 00:09:04.215
that we're not even looking for.

00:09:04.215 --> 00:09:07.965
So we found that for
this problem right here.

00:09:09.335 --> 00:09:13.298
This second equation here is going to be

00:09:13.298 --> 00:09:18.013
the one that is most useful
for answering the question,

00:09:18.013 --> 00:09:22.173
"How far does the car travel
during those 12 seconds?"

00:09:22.173 --> 00:09:25.738
So that's for that question,
but this block here

00:09:25.738 --> 00:09:26.711
actually has a second question.

00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:28.302
Maybe I'll switch to green.

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:30.147
Let's look at this question.

00:09:30.147 --> 00:09:32.897
What is the car's final velocity?

00:09:33.963 --> 00:09:37.014
All right, so that means
we're looking for this now.

00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:38.998
Right here, what's this?

00:09:38.998 --> 00:09:41.207
Well, we've already identified

00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:44.207
these different pieces that we know,

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.719
and if we did the first
part of the problem,

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:50.360
we would actually have a
value for delta x here.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.639
But assuming we didn't find that yet,

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:54.678
we could look at this and say,

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.047
"What's the car's final velocity?

00:09:56.047 --> 00:10:00.372
"I want to look for
something that has V in it

00:10:00.372 --> 00:10:03.983
"and has these other
three things that I know."

00:10:03.983 --> 00:10:06.481
And if you look and
you check through here,

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.314
let's see, what is it?

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:13.549
So, yeah, it would actually
end up being this one again.

00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:16.861
This is that equation that doesn't have

00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:18.925
the change in position in it.

00:10:18.925 --> 00:10:20.216
And so just using the green color,

00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:22.751
I'll underline this here to say that

00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:26.836
this equation is useful for this question.

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:30.390
And actually, now that we have this value,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.557
we could've used really any
of them that had our V in it.

00:10:36.306 --> 00:10:37.443
So our options open up

00:10:37.443 --> 00:10:40.580
once we know more than
three different things.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.953
But anyway, hopefully going through

00:10:42.953 --> 00:10:44.663
a couple of these examples

00:10:44.663 --> 00:10:47.570
will be helpful for you when
you run into your own questions

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.853
and have to think through,
"Okay, what do I have,

00:10:49.853 --> 00:10:51.365
"What am I looking for,

00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:53.835
"and which equation will help me

00:10:53.835 --> 00:10:57.085
"move forward and solve this question?"
