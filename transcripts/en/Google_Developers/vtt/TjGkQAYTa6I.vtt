KOH KIM: I'm part of the Google
Play business development team

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.820
here in Mountain View.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.520
I focus on game start-ups
in international markets.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.030
So it's a big world out there.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.810
With Play, you can distribute
in 190-plus countries,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.470
sell in 130-plus markets,
and actually price

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.470
in 65 currencies, which
is a pretty big world.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.800
But even with one billion
active Android devices,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.650
only one in four people in the
world own a smartphone today.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.980
Imagine if we connect the
next five billion people.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.660
And that's what
we're planning to do.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.010
So where should I start first?

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.430
Localization is hard work.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490
So it's critical to
choose the right markets

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.890
that best fit your game.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.540
So developers are making
money all over the world,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.550
here and abroad, especially
in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180
But we're growing fast in other
countries around the world,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.010
too, markets like Brazil,
Southeast Asia, Turkey

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.660
and Russia provide interesting
opportunities for developers

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.120
to expand their
active user base.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.440
Asia is a big market for us, and
users here are very different.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.859
Subway commutes can be an
hour or longer each way.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.650
However, they're able
to constantly connect

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.420
to high speed mobile internet
networks during their commutes.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120
So you can imagine
the type of gaming

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.777
that can occur with such
pretty fast connection.

00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:29.360
So now that you have an idea of
what the different markets are

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.700
like, how can you take advantage
of this growth and the reach?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.890
Make sure you have the
right game for your market.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.848
I'm sure you recognize
some of these games that

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:40.560
are popular in the US, different
visual styles, different types

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.060
of genres.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.320
You have puzzles, you have
strategy games, and et cetera.

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:50.830
But we can take
a look at markets

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.580
like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.060
It looks quite different.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.830
Role playing and
strategy games focusing

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.680
on multi-player and
collection mechanics

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.764
are actually very popular.

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:00.680
And it looks a little
bit different, too, just

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.630
from the icons alone.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.860
And it gets more interesting in
emerging markets like Brazil,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.440
Russia and Southeast Asia.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.860
For example, cricket is
a popular sport in India.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.770
So of course, a cricket game
would actually be popular.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.340
However, you'll
still recognize some

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.020
of these games, which actually
presents immense opportunities

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.880
for developers like you.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.150
But not all dragons are
created equal, right?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.280
First impressions count.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.870
And it starts with the icon.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.930
You can choose to
use one icon globally

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.250
to reinforce your brand.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.420
Or if you have a character
featured in your icons,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.570
adapt your visual
style to the audience.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.180
Be mindful of your text.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.850
You should actually remember
to make your game title

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.860
pronounceable in
that target language.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.970
If not, change it
or simplify it,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.664
like you can see with Ace
Fishing and Candy Crush Saga.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.960
But you can also
localize your screenshots

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.074
to your target market.

00:02:56.074 --> 00:02:57.490
Seeing something
in their language

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.850
tells the players that you
care and that they can actually

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.180
understand what's
going on in the game.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.860
And the Asian screenshots are
probably a little bit different

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.630
from what you see.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.110
But creating videos is
actually a great idea, too.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.490
It helps users imagine their
game in their own environments.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.800
This Korean commercial
portrays high school students

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.100
challenging each other while
on break in between classes.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.920
And make sure you
have the right price.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.800
In US and Europe, players are
used to seeing prices end in 9.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.226
That's not the case in
Asia, where they end in 0.

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:27.850
Luckily, you can customize your
prices right in the Google Play

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.390
Developer Console.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.849
But your job isn't over yet.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.390
Now that players
installed your game,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.780
you have to keep them playing.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.116
Asian players consume
a lot more content

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.490
than the average
Western players,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.790
sometimes up to
4x the US player.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.370
So push new content and events
to keep your new players

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.400
on your toes.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.040
And you can also connect with
players on their channels.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.150
Respond to user feedback
on the Play Store,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.090
enable social features
like Chat and Forums

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.110
to allow players to
communicate within your game.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.794
And that's it.

00:03:58.794 --> 00:04:00.528
Thanks, all.
