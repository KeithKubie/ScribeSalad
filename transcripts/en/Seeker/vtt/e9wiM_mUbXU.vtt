00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.540
Oil seems to pop up everywhere, in shale,
under deserts and plains, and of course, underwater.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.090
But if oil is a "fossil" fuel, how did those
fossils get under the ocean?

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.470
Hey slick, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.750
Oil is a mystery.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.310
Scientists don't really 100 percent know where
it came from or how it got underground, but

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.500
because we know about plate tectonics we at
least have some ideas of how it got under

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
the ocean.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.750
Oil is what we call a fossil fuel.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.070
It comes from dead things, especially when
there are a lot of them gathered in one place.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.120
It's true that oil famously comes from deserts
like on the Arabian peninsula, but that location

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.030
is, well, more-or-less random.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.170
Roger N. Anderson of Columbia University told
Scientific American, "Plate tectonics determines

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.600
the location of oil… reservoirs."

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.350
Because the Earth's surface is constantly
changing and shifting, oil can end up in all

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.070
sorts of weird places…

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.110
It helps to understand how oil is made first
though.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.040
Hundreds of millions of years ago, organic
material (prehistoric plants and animals)

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.640
accumulated at the bottom of oceans, rivers,
swamps.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.790
Think of it this way, the ocean is deep, and
when things die at the top, they can sink

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.200
all the way to the bottom.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.390
When that happens a lot, they'll pile up!

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.140
Living things are made of proteins, carbohydrates,
lipids (or fats) and lignin (woody polymers).

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.320
When these decomposing organics become compressed
under more and more material, in an anoxic

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.450
environment, they break down strangely.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.840
Essentially, the organic matter had to die
and quickly find it's way to a place without

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.080
oxygen to avoid decomposition.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.549
Oceans are great for this because the seafloor
is not very oxygenated.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.340
At that point it breaks down SUPER slowly,
so more and more dead stuff can build up and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.640
adds more and more pressure.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.479
Eventually, the pressure of all that material
forces the water out; the proteins, lignin

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.160
and carbs break down; and all that is left
is a lipid, sugar, and amino acid ooze.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.460
Occasionally, this happens near enough to
a crack in the crust that it can become trapped.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.049
Then, by adding heat and pressure (something
geology and plate tectonics is great at),

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.409
this mix of decomposed organisms become subject
to chemical reactions, forming what's called

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.759
kerogens.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.779
Over millions of years and with more heat
and pressure it goes through catagenesis where

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.750
the kerogen cooks into hydrocarbon chains.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.340
Humans then look for telltale signs of the
these deposits.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.460
When that happens though, it doesn't form
a giant lake or pool under the ground; it's

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.719
actually stuck in the pores of surrounding
rocks, like water clinging to a windowpane.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.909
The immense pressure of the Earth's crust
can keep the oil trapped under solid rock,

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.549
but if an oil well pushes through it at the
right place -- the oil can gush out in a tower

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.010
of black liquid.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.269
Companies can then take this and make petroleum!

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.269
(WHEW)!

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.000
The more we understand about where ancient
seas and forests were, the better scientists

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.120
can predict where oil is trapped in Earth's
crust today.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.159
So, because oceans are great at providing
the perfect conditions of low oxygen and high

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.129
pressure, AND it’s where a lot of this decomposing
organic animal and plant matter accumulates…

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.019
oil could be anywhere there used to be an
ocean.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.780
As the Earth's crust is constantly shifting,
the locations of these ancient oceans have

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.610
moved too -- scattering oil across the planet;
70-percent of which is covered by water -- so

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.569
there's likely a lot of oil trapped under
there!

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.170
Getting at that oil isn't easy though.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.870
Deepwater Horizon -- could reach 10,000 feet
to the ocean's floor, and then drill over

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.900
30,000 more feet into the rock to extract
the oil.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.529
The tallest building in the world, the Burj
Khalifa, is only 2717 feet.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:42.010
In the end, we think oil got down there because
the Earth is constantly changing.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.120
What was once under the ocean is now on top
of Mt Everest -- they have undersea fossils

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.450
that they found there.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.180
And what was once on top of the world, is
now at the bottom of the sea.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.329
How poetic.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.180
We'd like to thank our sponsor for this episode
for helping support DNews today: Deepwater

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.439
Horizon, the movie.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.950
Check out Deepwater Horizon, based on a true
story.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.469
In theaters September 30th.

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.719
After learning all about oil, maybe you're
curious about how we take uranium and we turn

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.590
that into nuclear fuel as well?

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:21.200
Luckily, we have a great video on that

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.940
right here.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.030
Are there other processes you want to know
about?

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.100
Should we look into how oil is refined?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.320
What do you want to know about the world around
you?
