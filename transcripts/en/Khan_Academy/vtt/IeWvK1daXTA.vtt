00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] We've got some apples here

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.027
and we've got some oranges.

00:00:03.027 --> 00:00:07.410
And what I wanna think
about is what is the ratio?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.740
What is the ratio of apples,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.030
of apples,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.563
to oranges, to oranges?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.870
And to clarify what
we're even talking about,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.350
a ratio is giving us the relationship

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.380
between quantities of
two different things.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.040
So there's a couple of ways
that we can specify this.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.100
We can literally count
the number of apples,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.720
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.260
So we have six apples.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.430
And we could say the ratio
is going to be six to,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.070
six to, and then how
many oranges do we have?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.050
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.060
It is six to nine.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.700
Ratio of apples to oranges is six to nine.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.540
And you could use different notation.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.260
You could also write it this way.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.150
Six to, you would still read it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.970
as the ratio as being six to nine.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.010
But we don't have to just
satisfy us with this,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.089
because one way to think about ratios,

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:13.130
especially if we're thinking
about apples to oranges,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.910
is how many apples do we have

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.800
for a certain number of oranges?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.130
And when you think about it that way,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.240
both six and nine are divisible by three.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.570
So if you divide six
and nine both by three,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.200
six divided by three is two,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.630
six divided by three is two,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.720
and nine divided by three is three.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.040
So we could also say that the
ratio of apples to oranges

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.070
is two to three.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.260
Or if we want to use this notation,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.400
two to three.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.480
Two to three.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.400
Now does that make sense?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.700
Well, look, we divided each
of these groups into three.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.280
So one way to think about it,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.700
so if you divide,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.480
if you divide this whole
total into three groups,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.633
so one group,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.190
one group,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.053
two groups, two groups,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.490
and three equal groups,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.230
we see that in each of those groups,

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.870
for every two apples,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.650
for every two apples
we have three oranges.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.000
For two apples, we have three oranges.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.380
For two apples, we have three oranges.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.440
So once again,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.080
the ratio of apples to oranges,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.180
for every two apples,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.000
we have three oranges.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.090
But we could think about things

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.670
the other way around as well.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.563
We could also think
about what is the ratio,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.300
ratio of oranges to apples,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.980
orange to apples.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.210
And here we would essentially
switch the numbers.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.690
The ratio of oranges to apples.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.910
Notice up here we said apples to oranges,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.310
which is six to nine or two to three,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.660
which is an equivalent ratio,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.820
and here we're going to say
the ratio of oranges to apples.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.320
So we swapped these two,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.260
and so we're going to swap the numbers.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.820
Here we have nine oranges
for every six apples,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.820
so we could say the ratio
is going to be nine to six.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.180
The ratio is nine to six,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.430
or an equivalent ratio,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.120
for every three oranges,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.660
so we're gonna divide this by three,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.700
so for every three oranges,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.320
we are going to have two apples.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.680
We are going to have two apples.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.740
So notice this is just
exactly what we had up here,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.660
but where we had apples to oranges,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.840
it was six to nine,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.070
six apples for every nine oranges,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.150
and now when it's oranges to apples,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.930
we say it's nine to six.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.590
Nine oranges for every six apples.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.870
Or we could say for every three oranges,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.163
we have exactly two apples.
