00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.460
OK, we are in problem
number 9.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.490
If 2 times x minus 3 is equal to
7, what is the value of x?

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.550
Well, this is straightforward.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.660
Just solve for x problem,
divide both sides by 2.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.100
Or actually, yeah, we could
do it either way.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.550
We could say this is 2x
minus 6 is equal to 7.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.420
Add 6 to both sides, you
get 2x is equal to 13.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.740
Divide both sides by 2. x is
equal to 13/2, which is the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.710
same thing as 6 and 1/2,
which is the same

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.510
thing as 6.5, right?

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.210
That's 12, yep.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.820
Problem 10.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.470
Point P lies on the line with
the equation y minus 4 is

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.060
equal to 3 times x minus 2.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.910
If the x-coordinate of P is 4--
OK, so P is the 0.4, what

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.510
is the y-coordinate?

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.820
So we don't know what the
y-coordinate is, so we

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.525
literally just have to solve--
we have to just input 4 for x

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:19.290
and then solve for y.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.690
So you get y minus 4 is equal
to 3 times 4 minus 2.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.980
y minus 4 is equal to 3
times 4 minus 2 is 2.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.740
y minus 4 is equal to 6.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.805
y is equal to 10.

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:36.930
And that's our answer.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.840
The point is 4, 10, but they
just wanted to know the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.490
y-coordinate, and that's 10.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.970
Problem 11.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.620
Car A traveled 60 miles and
averaged 20 miles per gallon

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.380
of gasoline.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:03.910
So car A traveled 60 miles and
got 20 miles per gallon, mpg,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.660
miles per gallon.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:13.450
Car B traveled 15 miles
for each gallon.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.810
OK, so it got 15 miles
per gallon, right?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.310
It traveled 15 miles for each
gallon of gasoline it used.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.040
How many miles had car B
traveled when it had used the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.490
same amount of gasoline that car
A used to travel 60 miles?

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.340
So they're saying we need to
figure out how many gallons A

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.890
used, and then how far
can B get with that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.990
same number of gallons?

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.790
That's essentially what
they're asking.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.240
So how many gallons did
A use to go 60 miles?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.860
Well, we've got 20 miles per
gallon and went 60 miles.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.750
So car A could do this
on 3 gallons, right?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:03.120
The way you can view this,
gallons times miles per gallon

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.490
is equal to miles, right?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.920
And so gallons, we'll say g
times 20 miles per gallon is

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.170
equal to 60 miles.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.540
So gallons, divide both sides
by 20, is equal to 30.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.330
That's times right there.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.790
I'm sorry, it's equal to 3.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.460
60 divided by 20 is 3.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.000
So car A used 3 gallons
to go 60 miles.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:39.800
And so car B can go 15 miles
per gallon times 3 gallons

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.090
equals 15 times 3
is 45 gallons.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.340
Next problem.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.500
OK, see if I can draw that.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.680
It's a straight line here.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.025
Straight line, point A comes
up to this point to B.

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:07.850
It comes down a little bit.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.660
And then point C comes
down here.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.190
OK, and they're telling us
that this is 65 degrees.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.180
This is 100 degrees.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.940
This is 120.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.430
And this, right here,
is x degrees.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.700
In the figure above, points A,
D, and E lie on the same line.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.190
This is A.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.050
This is D.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.220
This is E.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.330
They lie on the same line.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.690
What is the value of x?

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.700
So we really just need to figure
out the value of this,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.160
and then we can say x is
supplementary to that.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.410
So let's think about how we can
think about what the value

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.240
of this angle is.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.150
So the way I think about it is
draw a line here, and you

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.500
could automatically know what
all the angles in a

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.770
quadrilateral are.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.710
But I'll prove it to you that
all the angles in a

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.110
quadrilateral are going
to add up to 360.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.590
How do I know that?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.010
Because think of it this way:
this angle plus this angle

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.630
plus this angle is
going to be 180.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.280
And then this angle plus this
angle plus this angle

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.200
is going to be 180.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.730
And if you add all of those
together, you're essentially

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.570
adding all of the angles of
the quadrilateral-- it's

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.190
late-- because this and this is
equal to the angle of the

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.900
whole quadrilateral.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.390
So the angles in the entire
quadrilateral are 360 degrees.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.570
And you can memorize
that if you want.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.190
So if we know that all of these
angles add up to 360

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.060
degrees, what is this big
angle right here?

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.150
Well, we know that 65 plus 100
plus 120 plus-- let's call

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.010
this angle y, and y is this
whole thing-- plus y is equal

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.980
to 360 degrees.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.660
And this is what?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:05.220
This is 220 plus 65, 285
plus y is equal to 360.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:13.300
So y is equal to 360 minus
285, and that is what?

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.620
That is 75 degrees, right?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.890
Because 70 would
be 350, right?

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.100
So y is 75 degrees.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.220
So this whole angle
right there is 75.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.860
And we know that x plus this
big angle here, 75-- and

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.840
ignore this green line.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.660
I'm looking about
this big angle.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.470
x plus 75 is equal to 180.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.280
So x has to be equal
to 105 degrees.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.820
Subtract 75 from both sides.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:50.700
Next question, problem 13.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.770
The first term of a sequence
is 20 and the

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.830
second term is 8.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.450
So it goes from 20,
then it goes to 8.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.090
The third term and each term
thereafter is the average of

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.380
the two terms immediately
preceding it.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.990
What is the value of the first
term in the sequence that is

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.490
not an integer?

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.790
OK.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.700
So we just have to average
these two.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.540
So this is going to be what?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.500
It's going to be 28
divided by 2.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.940
28/2, which equals 14, right?

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.950
I just took 20 plus 8
divided by 2 is 14.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.910
And now, what's the average
of 8 and 14?

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.202
Well, 8 plus 14 is 22.

00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:31.840
So 22 divided by 2, which
is equal to 11.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.260
Delete my work.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.750
Now, what's the average
of 14 and 11?

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.900
You add them, you get
25 divided by

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.480
2, that equals 12.5.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.180
So here we go.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.150
This is the first number in
the series that is not an

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.500
integer, 12.5.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.310
And you could fill that in.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.970
Problem 14.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.050
If x is 1/5 of y-- so
x is equal to 1/5y.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.970
y is 3/10 of z.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:07.870
y is equal to 3/10z and z is
greater than 0, then x is what

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.200
fraction of z?

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.160
So you could literally just
substitute here, right?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.720
You can just substitute
this y.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.330
You could substitute
3/10z for y, right?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.510
Because we say y is equal to
3 times z, so x is equal

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.600
to 1/5 times y.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.220
We're going to substitute
for y, 3/10z.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.670
So x is equal to--
what is this?

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.475
3/50z.

00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:35.830
So x is 3/50 of z.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.370
So you would fill in 3/50
in your answer box.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.580
OK, Next problem.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.895
Well, I don't know if I have
time to do it in this video.

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:46.145
Well, let me see.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.380
No, I don't want to rush it.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.930
I'll do it in the next video.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.180
See you soon.
