it's never going to get rid I said let's

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:14.540
it's never going to get rid I said let's
 

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.570
it's never going to get rid I said let's
just go ahead and do it and then it gets

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:16.580
just go ahead and do it and then it gets
 

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.280
just go ahead and do it and then it gets
back to the bureaucracy it's like well I

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:18.290
back to the bureaucracy it's like well I
 

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.830
back to the bureaucracy it's like well I
can't get started until I have the IRB

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:20.840
can't get started until I have the IRB
 

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.350
can't get started until I have the IRB
approval and for the funding and it's

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:23.360
approval and for the funding and it's
 

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.380
approval and for the funding and it's
just like well we'll be here and we'll

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:26.390
just like well we'll be here and we'll
 

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.820
just like well we'll be here and we'll
start doing this but that's exactly

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:27.830
start doing this but that's exactly
 

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.690
start doing this but that's exactly
right and it really then gets into the

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:31.700
right and it really then gets into the
 

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.480
right and it really then gets into the
whole correctional environment or

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:34.490
whole correctional environment or
 

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.520

and then that's the only way to get it
 

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.800
and then that's the only way to get it
