00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:03.371
- [Voiceover] We have three
times X to the power of A

00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:05.855
times BX to the fourth power,

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:09.337
and we have that equalling
negative 24 X to the sixth.

00:00:09.337 --> 00:00:11.126
And so what I'd like you
to do is pause this video

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:15.282
and see if you can figure
out what A and B need to be.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.349
Well to figure this out
we can just multiply out

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.787
this left-hand side, so let's do that.

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:21.249
So what we have right over here,

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.249
we can just rewrite that as
three times X to the power of A

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:31.280
times B times X to the fourth.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.264
And we can rewrite this as,
we can just change the order,

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.448
we're just multiplying
four different things.

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:40.455
This is the same thing as three times B

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:44.522
times X to the A,

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:46.497
times X to the fourth.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:48.261
And if you were doing this on your own,

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:49.445
you wouldn't have to
do all of these steps,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.325
but hopefully this makes it
clear what's actually going on.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:53.997
And what's this going to be?

00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:56.017
Well, we have our,

00:00:56.017 --> 00:00:57.433
let me do this in a new color,

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.661
we have our three B here.

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.193
So that is three B,

00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:05.428
and what's X to the A
times X to the fourth?

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:07.930
X to the A times X to the fourth.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.160
Have the same base raised
to different exponents

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.870
and I'm multiplying the two.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.237
Well we know from our exponent properties,

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:19.162
this is going to be the same
thing as X to the A plus four.

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:23.265
X to the A times X to the
fourth is X to the A plus four,

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.077
we're just adding the
exponents because we have

00:01:25.077 --> 00:01:27.864
the same base and we're
multiplying these two.

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:31.067
So we now have that three B is equal to X

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:34.342
to the A plus fourth power.

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:36.803
And this is going to be
equal to what we have

00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:38.683
on the right-hand side.

00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:41.447
So this is going to be equal to,

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:42.910
put in that same color,

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.452
negative 24 X to the sixth.

00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:48.778
So what could we do now?

00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:52.216
Well we can recognize that three B

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:56.883
is going to have to be
equal to negative 24 and

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:00.504
the A plus four right over
here is going to need to be

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:03.036
equal to the six.

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:04.521
So let's write that down.

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.589
Three B is equal to negative 24.

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:08.725
Three B is equal to negative 24,

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:10.210
you might be able to do that in your head,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.300
or if you want to do it a
little bit more systematically

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.016
you could divide both sides
by three to solve for your B.

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:19.382
And you get B is equal to negative eight.

00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:24.382
And we can also say that A
plus four is equal to six.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.952
Subtract four from both sides,

00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:29.226
you get A is equal to two.

00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:30.712
And we are done.

00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:32.153
And you can check it if you want.

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:33.987
We can rewrite it as,

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.450
if we say A is equal to two,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.543
we can say three X squared times,

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.475
instead of B we know
that's negative eight,

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:45.378
negative eight X to the fourth.

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:46.678
What is that going to be equal to?

00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:48.488
Three times negative eight is negative 24,

00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:52.181
X squared times X to the
fourth is X to the sixth.

00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:54.364
And once again as I said,
you wouldn't necessarily

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:56.941
have to do all of these steps
if you're doing it on paper,

00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:58.938
but this is what you're doing
even if you look at this,

00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:00.307
if you looked at the
original problem you'd say

00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:03.326
okay, the coefficients
I can multiply those,

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:06.345
three times B to get this
coefficient over here.

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:08.619
So three times B is negative 24,

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:10.803
B would have to be negative eight.

00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:13.891
So B would have to be negative eight here.

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.654
And you can say X to the
A times X to the fourth

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.094
is X to the sixth.

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:20.091
So, well let's see, we're gonna exponents,

00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:22.087
A plus four is gonna B equal to six,

00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:25.059
A must be equal to two.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.383
So you might be able to do it that simply,

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:27.660
but this is what you're doing,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.953
even if you're doing it
in your head like that.
