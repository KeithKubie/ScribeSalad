00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.670
In the relation x is
equal to y squared plus 3,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.640
can y be represented as a
mathematical function of x?

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.440
So the way they've
written it, x is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.680
being represented as a
mathematical function of y.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.780
We could even say that
x as a function of y

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.697
is equal to y squared plus 3.

00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:23.530
Now, let's see if we
can do it the other way

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.351
around, if we can represent
y as a function of x.

00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:28.100
So one way you could
think about it is you

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.490
could essentially try
to solve for y here.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.060
So let's do that.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.720
So I have x is equal
to y squared plus 3.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.810
Subtract 3 from both
sides, you get x minus 3

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.710
is equal to y squared.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.260
Now, the next step is going
to be tricky, x minus 3

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.000
is equal to y squared.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.110
So y could be equal to-- and I'm
just going to swap the sides.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.270
y could be equal to-- if we take
the square root of both sides,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.850
it could be the positive
square root of x minus 3,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.700
or it could be the
negative square root.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.760
Or y could be the negative
square root of x minus 3.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.270
If you don't believe me,
square both sides of this.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.890
You'll get y squared
is equal to x minus 3.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.470
Square both sides
of this, you're

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.750
going to get y squared
is equal to-- well,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.270
the negative squared is just
going to be a positive 1.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.750
And you're going to get y
squared is equal to x minus 3.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.750
So this is a situation
here where for a given x,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.520
you could actually
have 2 y-values.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.960
Let me show you.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.700
Let me attempt to
sketch this graph.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.520
So let's say this is our y-axis.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850
I guess I could call
it this relation.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.660
This is our x-axis.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.480
And this right over here,
y is a positive square root

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.849
of x minus 3.

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.140
That's going to look like this.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.040
So if this is x is equal to 3,
it's going to look like this.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.100
That's y is equal to the
positive square root of x

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.530
minus 3.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.220
And this over here, y is equal
to the negative square root

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.390
of x minus 3, is going to
look something like this.

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:07.170
I should make it a little
bit more symmetric looking,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.128
because it's going to
essentially be the mirror

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.090
image if you flip
over the x-axis.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.390
So it's going to look
something like this-- y is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.330
equal to the negative
square root of x minus 3.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.220
And this right over here,
this relationship cannot be--

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.070
this right over here
is not a function of x.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.850
In order to be a function
of x, for a given x

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.840
it has to map to exactly
one value for the function.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.410
But here you see it's mapping
to two values of the function.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.810
So, for example, let's say
we take x is equal to 4.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.230
So x equals 4 could get
us to y is equal to 1.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.250
4 minus 3 is 1.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.010
Take the positive square
root, it could be 1.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.270
Or you could have x equals 4,
and y is equal to negative 1.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.410
So you can't have
this situation.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.900
If you were making a table
x and y as a function of x,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.180
you can't have x is equal to 4.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.240
And at one point it equals 1.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.050
And then in another
interpretation of it,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.830
when x is equal to 4,
you get to negative 1.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.980
You can't have one input
mapping to two outputs

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.120
and still be a function.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.130
So in this case, the relation
cannot-- for this relation,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.730
y cannot be represented as a
mathematical function of x.
