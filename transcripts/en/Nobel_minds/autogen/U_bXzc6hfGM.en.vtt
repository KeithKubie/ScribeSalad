thank you very much for your kind
introduction I'll be talking about

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869
introduction I'll be talking about
 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.800
introduction I'll be talking about
climate change science and policy

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810
climate change science and policy
 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.380
climate change science and policy
aspects of it but I will spend a few

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
aspects of it but I will spend a few
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.369
aspects of it but I will spend a few
minutes first just talking about

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379
minutes first just talking about
 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.520
minutes first just talking about
stratospheric ozone what led to the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
stratospheric ozone what led to the
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.340
stratospheric ozone what led to the
Nobel Prize that I was rewarded with it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
Nobel Prize that I was rewarded with it
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.220
Nobel Prize that I was rewarded with it
was of course a huge honour to to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
was of course a huge honour to to
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.460
was of course a huge honour to to
receive it I I should just say I gave a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470
receive it I I should just say I gave a
 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.969
receive it I I should just say I gave a
similar lecture yesterday I know there

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979
similar lecture yesterday I know there
 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.009
similar lecture yesterday I know there
are just a couple of you that heard me

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019
are just a couple of you that heard me
 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.170
are just a couple of you that heard me
already I thought I could give a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
already I thought I could give a
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.410
already I thought I could give a
different lecture today but the only way

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
different lecture today but the only way
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780
different lecture today but the only way
I could do that is if I give it in

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
I could do that is if I give it in
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.930
I could do that is if I give it in
Spanish so I apologize but I'm actually

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940
Spanish so I apologize but I'm actually
 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.750
Spanish so I apologize but I'm actually
going to use the same or similar view

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760
going to use the same or similar view
 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.679
going to use the same or similar view
graphs so if what I want to do is to put

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
graphs so if what I want to do is to put
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.230
graphs so if what I want to do is to put
in context the the research that I

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240
in context the the research that I
 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.510
in context the the research that I
carried out with my colleague sherry

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
carried out with my colleague sherry
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160
carried out with my colleague sherry
Rowland we were at the University of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
Rowland we were at the University of
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.980
Rowland we were at the University of
California at Irvine this was in early

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
California at Irvine this was in early
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.190
California at Irvine this was in early
1970s and at that time I had just

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
1970s and at that time I had just
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.029
1970s and at that time I had just
finished my PhD at the University of

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039
finished my PhD at the University of
 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.169
finished my PhD at the University of
California Berkeley but I have met shell

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179
California Berkeley but I have met shell
 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.599
California Berkeley but I have met shell
Roland already because we were both

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609
Roland already because we were both
 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.240
Roland already because we were both
doing very fundamental research on

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
doing very fundamental research on
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190
doing very fundamental research on
chemical reactions trying to understand

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
chemical reactions trying to understand
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.889
chemical reactions trying to understand
chemical reactions at the very

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
chemical reactions at the very
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.719
chemical reactions at the very
fundamental level using quantum

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
fundamental level using quantum
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.550
fundamental level using quantum
mechanics and so on and so forth but we

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
mechanics and so on and so forth but we
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.300
mechanics and so on and so forth but we
both decided when I came to work with

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
both decided when I came to work with
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.359
both decided when I came to work with
him to work on something that was a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
him to work on something that was a
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.760
him to work on something that was a
little bit closer to some societal

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
little bit closer to some societal
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.570
little bit closer to some societal
problem to something that which we could

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580
problem to something that which we could
 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.730
problem to something that which we could
apply these fundamental science

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
apply these fundamental science
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.400
apply these fundamental science
understanding that we have developed and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410
understanding that we have developed and
 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.530
understanding that we have developed and
so we decided to learn about the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
so we decided to learn about the
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.320
so we decided to learn about the
atmosphere to the atmospheric chemistry

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
atmosphere to the atmospheric chemistry
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.920
atmosphere to the atmospheric chemistry
which at that time it was not a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
which at that time it was not a
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.210
which at that time it was not a
very well-developed discipline we had a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
very well-developed discipline we had a
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.670
very well-developed discipline we had a
few colleagues that we had made that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
few colleagues that we had made that
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.220
few colleagues that we had made that
we're working on that but what we

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
we're working on that but what we
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.520
we're working on that but what we
decided let's work on how do we do that

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
decided let's work on how do we do that
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.569
decided let's work on how do we do that
let's work on a problem that we think

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579
let's work on a problem that we think
 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.140
let's work on a problem that we think
it's interesting out of sheer curiosity

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
it's interesting out of sheer curiosity
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.490
it's interesting out of sheer curiosity
see whether we can solve it and in that

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
see whether we can solve it and in that
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.949
see whether we can solve it and in that
way learn about how the atmosphere

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
way learn about how the atmosphere
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.020
way learn about how the atmosphere
functions particularly some of its

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
functions particularly some of its
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.229
functions particularly some of its
chemical properties so that's how we

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
chemical properties so that's how we
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.809
chemical properties so that's how we
started let me give you sort of a little

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
started let me give you sort of a little
 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.539
started let me give you sort of a little
bit of the background and this is going

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549
bit of the background and this is going
 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.699
bit of the background and this is going
a little over the century ago how

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709
a little over the century ago how
 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.410
a little over the century ago how
electric refrigeration became became to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
electric refrigeration became became to
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.349
electric refrigeration became became to
be of course very common very useful

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359
be of course very common very useful
 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.910
be of course very common very useful
first in developed countries but then

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920
first in developed countries but then
 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.330
first in developed countries but then
eventually everywhere and that's using

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340
eventually everywhere and that's using
 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.369
eventually everywhere and that's using
electrical refrigerators now some of you

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379
electrical refrigerators now some of you
 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.189
electrical refrigerators now some of you
might know before that how did people

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199
might know before that how did people
 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.140
might know before that how did people
deal with refrigeration because that was

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150
deal with refrigeration because that was
 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.170
deal with refrigeration because that was
already in use in the nineteenth century

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
already in use in the nineteenth century
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.770
already in use in the nineteenth century
but it was typically only more wealthy

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
but it was typically only more wealthy
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.619
but it was typically only more wealthy
people but there was a big industry that

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629
people but there was a big industry that
 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.050
people but there was a big industry that
had been developed the way it worked is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
had been developed the way it worked is
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.990
had been developed the way it worked is
by importing large chunks of ice from

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
by importing large chunks of ice from
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.140
by importing large chunks of ice from
frozen lakes at northern latitudes

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150
frozen lakes at northern latitudes
 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.000
frozen lakes at northern latitudes
that's a way refrigeration work before

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
that's a way refrigeration work before
 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.119
that's a way refrigeration work before
the electric refrigerators came on board

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129
the electric refrigerators came on board
 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.839
the electric refrigerators came on board
and so it was maybe easier to have

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849
and so it was maybe easier to have
 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.780
and so it was maybe easier to have
refrigerators here at these latitudes

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790
refrigerators here at these latitudes
 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.909
refrigerators here at these latitudes
and it was in Southern California or in

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919
and it was in Southern California or in
 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.270
and it was in Southern California or in
Mexico okay but that's what nevertheless

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
Mexico okay but that's what nevertheless
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.930
Mexico okay but that's what nevertheless
this worked very well how does a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
this worked very well how does a
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.870
this worked very well how does a
refrigerator work what you need a

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880
refrigerator work what you need a
 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.240
refrigerator work what you need a
refrigerant which is a fluid that with

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250
refrigerant which is a fluid that with
 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.120
refrigerant which is a fluid that with
medicinal electricity with an electric

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130
medicinal electricity with an electric
 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.210
medicinal electricity with an electric
motor you can compress it as a liquid

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220
motor you can compress it as a liquid
 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.689
motor you can compress it as a liquid
and then you make this liquid move

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699
and then you make this liquid move
 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.300
and then you make this liquid move
through the freezer and evaporate as it

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310
through the freezer and evaporate as it
 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.219
through the freezer and evaporate as it
evaporated cools

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229
evaporated cools
 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.950
evaporated cools
and then the gas at is formed you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960
and then the gas at is formed you
 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.929
and then the gas at is formed you
compress again to form a liquid and so

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939
compress again to form a liquid and so
 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.450
compress again to form a liquid and so
on so it's a very simple idea there are

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
on so it's a very simple idea there are
 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.659
on so it's a very simple idea there are
other ways to do that but this was a

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669
other ways to do that but this was a
 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.950
other ways to do that but this was a
very effective way what it had a problem

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960
very effective way what it had a problem
 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.499
very effective way what it had a problem
namely that the refrigerants that were

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509
namely that the refrigerants that were
 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.790
namely that the refrigerants that were
in use originally were sort of nasty

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800
in use originally were sort of nasty
 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.540
in use originally were sort of nasty
chemicals sold for dioxide and ammonia

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550
chemicals sold for dioxide and ammonia
 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.600
chemicals sold for dioxide and ammonia
and so there were the number of

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610
and so there were the number of
 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.959
and so there were the number of
accidents went home refrigerators broke

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969
accidents went home refrigerators broke
 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.689
accidents went home refrigerators broke
down and leaked and people had to breed

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699
down and leaked and people had to breed
 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.329
down and leaked and people had to breed
these gases that was of course it led to

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339
these gases that was of course it led to
 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:22.850
these gases that was of course it led to
some accidents and so chemists developed

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860
some accidents and so chemists developed
 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.579
some accidents and so chemists developed
new chemicals they were called at a time

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:25.589
new chemicals they were called at a time
 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:29.209
new chemicals they were called at a time
miracle chemicals that could be used as

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:29.219
miracle chemicals that could be used as
 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:37.369
miracle chemicals that could be used as
refrigerants but in some way not

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379
refrigerants but in some way not
 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.119
refrigerants but in some way not
poisonous and so the chemical industry

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129
poisonous and so the chemical industry
 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.589
poisonous and so the chemical industry
developed is so called

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599
developed is so called
 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.559
developed is so called
chlorofluorocarbons you can see here the

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569
chlorofluorocarbons you can see here the
 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.059
chlorofluorocarbons you can see here the
formulas but the important thing about

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069
formulas but the important thing about
 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.129
formulas but the important thing about
this chemicals is that they are very

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139
this chemicals is that they are very
 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.639
this chemicals is that they are very
inert very stable they also evaporate

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:52.649
inert very stable they also evaporate
 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:54.920
inert very stable they also evaporate
and so they can be used as refrigerants

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930
and so they can be used as refrigerants
 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.649
and so they can be used as refrigerants
but you can breathe them they're so

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659
but you can breathe them they're so
 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.089
but you can breathe them they're so
inert that they don't change you can

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099
inert that they don't change you can
 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.409
inert that they don't change you can
breathe them and nothing happens as

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419
breathe them and nothing happens as
 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.309
breathe them and nothing happens as
early as opposed to ammonia and because

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319
early as opposed to ammonia and because
 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.959
early as opposed to ammonia and because
of that they could be used also as

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969
of that they could be used also as
 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.269
of that they could be used also as
propellants in spray cans which you

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279
propellants in spray cans which you
 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.189
propellants in spray cans which you
certainly cannot have something like

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199
certainly cannot have something like
 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.029
certainly cannot have something like
sulphur dioxide yeah because it would be

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039
sulphur dioxide yeah because it would be
 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.820
sulphur dioxide yeah because it would be
a little stinky ok but also very harmful

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830
a little stinky ok but also very harmful
 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.510
a little stinky ok but also very harmful
and spray cans became very popular

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520
and spray cans became very popular
 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.399
and spray cans became very popular
particularly in the United States

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409
particularly in the United States
 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.769
particularly in the United States
because the Inglis many things were

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779
because the Inglis many things were
 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.170
because the Inglis many things were
sprayed from toothpaste cleaners and so

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180
sprayed from toothpaste cleaners and so
 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.269
sprayed from toothpaste cleaners and so
on and so that's how this problem arose

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:35.279
on and so that's how this problem arose
 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.269
on and so that's how this problem arose
because we had them a coalition Lovelock

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279
because we had them a coalition Lovelock
 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.730
because we had them a coalition Lovelock
who had developed a very special

then decided to investigate what's the

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110
then decided to investigate what's the
 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.290
then decided to investigate what's the
fate of these compounds in the

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300
fate of these compounds in the
 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.650
fate of these compounds in the
environment and we realized they were

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660
environment and we realized they were
 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.660
environment and we realized they were
very stable and they were going to

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670
very stable and they were going to
 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.000
very stable and they were going to
eventually to diffuse into the

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.010
eventually to diffuse into the
 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.010
eventually to diffuse into the

and making oxygen atoms so the CFCs at
 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.630
and making oxygen atoms so the CFCs at
sufficiently high altitudes would also

break down and release chlorine atoms

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.390
break down and release chlorine atoms
 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.700
break down and release chlorine atoms
and what we then sort of postulated

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710
and what we then sort of postulated
 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.800
and what we then sort of postulated
because we knew that from the elemental

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:00.810
because we knew that from the elemental
 

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.170

chemistry is that chlorine atoms react

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180
chemistry is that chlorine atoms react
 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.780
chemistry is that chlorine atoms react
very fast with ozone and the product

chlorine oxide reacts again so you

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:10.890
chlorine oxide reacts again so you
 

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.060
chlorine oxide reacts again so you
recover the chlorine atom so the bottom

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.070
recover the chlorine atom so the bottom
 

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.340
recover the chlorine atom so the bottom
line is that we have a catalytic cycle

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.350
line is that we have a catalytic cycle
 

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.230

you affect the ozone layer and
so that was our theory but we based it

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300
so that was our theory but we based it

sort of discovered or or suggested how

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600
sort of discovered or or suggested how
 

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.930
sort of discovered or or suggested how
the natural ozone layer is controlled

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940
the natural ozone layer is controlled
 

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.420
the natural ozone layer is controlled
and that's with natural amounts of

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:29.430
and that's with natural amounts of
 

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.600
and that's with natural amounts of
nitric oxide with a similar catalytic

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:32.610
nitric oxide with a similar catalytic
 

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.400
nitric oxide with a similar catalytic
mechanism and so we were able to also

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.410
mechanism and so we were able to also
 

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.259
mechanism and so we were able to also
work with him and with the other members

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:39.269
work with him and with the other members
 

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:41.480
work with him and with the other members
of the scientific community that knew

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:41.490

of the scientific community that knew
others were working on the stratosphere

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:43.769
others were working on the stratosphere
 

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:46.579
others were working on the stratosphere
and essentially it appeared that the

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:46.589
and essentially it appeared that the
 

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:51.500
and essentially it appeared that the
science was well understood and that's

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:51.510
science was well understood and that's
 

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.139
science was well understood and that's
why we then published a paper in Nature

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:54.149
why we then published a paper in Nature
 

00:09:54.149 --> 00:09:56.960
why we then published a paper in Nature

on but over Antarctica something very
 

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.710
on but over Antarctica something very
special was happening so something very

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720
special was happening so something very
 

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.810
special was happening so something very
spectacular namely only over Antarctica

years which was in the 1970s when we

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:39.149
years which was in the 1970s when we
 

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:41.780
years which was in the 1970s when we
first came up with these theories but in

first came up with these theories but in
 

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.650
first came up with these theories but in
the 1990s now we understand why because

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660
the 1990s now we understand why because
 

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.990
the 1990s now we understand why because
it's a very nonlinear effect I won't

bother you with the details of the
 

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.650
bother you with the details of the
chemistry but it it's two chlorine

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660
chemistry but it it's two chlorine
 

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.900
chemistry but it it's two chlorine
monoxide molecules reacting with each

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:53.910
monoxide molecules reacting with each
 

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.900
monoxide molecules reacting with each
other so the effect is proportional to

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:56.910
other so the effect is proportional to
 

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.630
other so the effect is proportional to
the square of the chlorine concentration

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640
the square of the chlorine concentration
 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.059

a flat ocean which is normally ice
 

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.510
a flat ocean which is normally ice
surrounded by continent so the vortex is

not a natural effect but what was
 

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:40.190
not a natural effect but what was
particularly encouraging is that we

there we started to work with not just
 

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.180
there we started to work with not just
with the scientific community but trying

with the scientific community but trying
 

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.280
with the scientific community but trying
to communicate this problem to society

if not now then when
so we went all out and communicated that

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:09.900
so we went all out and communicated that
 

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.640
so we went all out and communicated that

eventually also to diplomats and
fortunately we were able to convince

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:22.670
fortunately we were able to convince
 

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.910
fortunately we were able to convince
heads of state and through the United

refrigerants you don't have to use CFCs
anymore and because of the Montreal

anymore and because of the Montreal
 

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.960
anymore and because of the Montreal
Protocol we now know that the ozone

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.240
layer is recovering it's a slow process
because the CFCs are still damaging this

the ozone layer is already recovering so
 

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.530
the ozone layer is already recovering so
we have a very big success story with

we have a very big success story with
 

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.890
we have a very big success story with
this issue so let me now switch to

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:24.900
this issue so let me now switch to
 

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.820
this issue so let me now switch to
climate change and I'm going to start

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:29.830
climate change and I'm going to start
 

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.510
climate change and I'm going to start

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.240
time and what I would just correct now
is that sustainable development nowadays

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.250
is that sustainable development nowadays
 

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.720
is that sustainable development nowadays

what is interesting is that if you look

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:47.430
what is interesting is that if you look
 

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.910
what is interesting is that if you look
at Industrial Development you look at

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920
at Industrial Development you look at
 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.170
at Industrial Development you look at
the how particularly because technology

of the 20th century that industry really
 

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.380
of the 20th century that industry really
suddenly began to develop very fast and

suddenly began to develop very fast and
 

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.560
suddenly began to develop very fast and
one of these issues is the release of

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:06.570
one of these issues is the release of
 

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.350
one of these issues is the release of
carbon dioxide which results from

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360

and these are the changes that worry us

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:42.930
and these are the changes that worry us
 

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.560
and these are the changes that worry us
why are we go into the environment where

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:45.570
why are we go into the environment where
 

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.860

suddenly we were affecting the ozone

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:48.870
suddenly we were affecting the ozone

dealt with climate change being perhaps

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920

the main one but because of these

00:16:59.840 --> 00:16:59.850
the main one but because of these

this issue that we are in a new

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:09.630
this issue that we are in a new
 

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.740
this issue that we are in a new
geological era which is called the

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:12.750
geological era which is called the
 

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.520
geological era which is called the
Anthropocene

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:13.530
Anthropocene
 

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:19.030
Anthropocene
ok we're no longer live in a geological

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.040
 
 

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.490
 
earrin like the past where the changes

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:22.500
earrin like the past where the changes
 

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.890
earrin like the past where the changes
had to do with periodic changes perhaps

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900
had to do with periodic changes perhaps
 

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.890
had to do with periodic changes perhaps
in the Earth's orbit that causes ice

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900
in the Earth's orbit that causes ice
 

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.580
in the Earth's orbit that causes ice
ages or large volcanoes erupting or what

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:31.590
ages or large volcanoes erupting or what
 

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.000
ages or large volcanoes erupting or what
have you

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.010
have you
 

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.330
have you
the the big changes nowadays clearly

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340
the the big changes nowadays clearly
 

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.790
the the big changes nowadays clearly
come from human activities hence the

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:37.800
come from human activities hence the
 

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.580
come from human activities hence the
name Anthropocene okay yeah and one

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:40.590
name Anthropocene okay yeah and one
 

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.100
name Anthropocene okay yeah and one
suggestion is that this new era really

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.110
suggestion is that this new era really
 

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.850
suggestion is that this new era really
starts around 1950 because of this

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860
starts around 1950 because of this
 

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.390
starts around 1950 because of this
acceleration that I just pointed out

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400
acceleration that I just pointed out
 

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.440
acceleration that I just pointed out
anyhow there are that issues besides

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:53.450
anyhow there are that issues besides
 

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.930
anyhow there are that issues besides
climate change such as the nitrogen and

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940
climate change such as the nitrogen and
 

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.390
climate change such as the nitrogen and
current and forceful recycles

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400
current and forceful recycles
 

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.630
current and forceful recycles
one very worrisome one has to do with

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640
one very worrisome one has to do with
 

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.300
one very worrisome one has to do with
with with species disappearing okay from

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:09.310
with with species disappearing okay from
 

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.830
with with species disappearing okay from
so we have a historically something like

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840
so we have a historically something like
 

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.010
so we have a historically something like
five big extinctions for many biological

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:17.020
five big extinctions for many biological
 

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.400
five big extinctions for many biological
species disappeared because of some

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:20.410
species disappeared because of some
 

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.590
species disappeared because of some
something big happening like a large

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600
something big happening like a large
 

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.910
something big happening like a large
meteor landing somewhere close to none

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:26.920
meteor landing somewhere close to none
 

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.510
meteor landing somewhere close to none
to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520
to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and
 

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.700
to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and
that's what killed the dinosaurs

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:32.710
that's what killed the dinosaurs
 

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.730
that's what killed the dinosaurs
so some huge events happened in the past

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:35.740
so some huge events happened in the past
 

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.430
so some huge events happened in the past
but now we have the entropic scene and

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440
but now we have the entropic scene and
 

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.400
but now we have the entropic scene and
it's one important cause for this

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:41.410
it's one important cause for this
 

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.090
it's one important cause for this
biological disappearance of many

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:45.100
biological disappearance of many
 

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.940
biological disappearance of many
important species but I will not be

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:47.950
important species but I will not be
 

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.590
important species but I will not be
talking about this other issues let me

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600
talking about this other issues let me
 

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.080
talking about this other issues let me
concentrate on just climate change and

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.090
concentrate on just climate change and
 

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.970
concentrate on just climate change and
I'll do that by talking about these

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:53.980
I'll do that by talking about these
 

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.260
I'll do that by talking about these
three myths these are three points in

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:58.270
three myths these are three points in
 

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.230
three myths these are three points in
which there is some misunderstanding

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240
which there is some misunderstanding
 

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.030
which there is some misunderstanding
misunderstanding

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.040
misunderstanding
 

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.770
misunderstanding
particularly by the general public but

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:04.780
particularly by the general public but
 

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.800
particularly by the general public but
also by many politicians the first one

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:07.810
also by many politicians the first one
 

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:11.430
also by many politicians the first one
is the idea that all climate is very

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440
is the idea that all climate is very
 

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.340
is the idea that all climate is very
complicated so maybe some scientists

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.350
complicated so maybe some scientists
 

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.620
complicated so maybe some scientists
think that something is happening or we

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:16.630
think that something is happening or we
 

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.120
think that something is happening or we
should worry about the climate but many

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.130
should worry about the climate but many
 

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.520
should worry about the climate but many
other scientists believe that's just

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:20.530
other scientists believe that's just
 

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.890
other scientists believe that's just
natural climate after all has changed in

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:22.900
natural climate after all has changed in
 

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.150
natural climate after all has changed in
the past so it's not clear that it's due

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.160
the past so it's not clear that it's due
 

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.120
the past so it's not clear that it's due
to human activities that's a myth why

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.130
to human activities that's a myth why
 

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.390
to human activities that's a myth why
because surveys have been carried out

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400
because surveys have been carried out
 

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.840
because surveys have been carried out
very explicitly really measuring what

agrees climate change is certainly
taking place and it's different from the

it's most likely the consequence of
human activities so that's what is very

like to expose that when these surveys

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.290
like to expose that when these surveys
 

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.460
like to expose that when these surveys
were done there were

all scientists are skeptics we don't

all scientists are skeptics we don't
 

00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:26.149
all scientists are skeptics we don't
accept a new thing in in science until

it will and so on and so forth what that

science so there are no good

other than the accepted science and the
point is we understand very well what

point is we understand very well what

smaller I believe of scientists that

there are many scientists that still

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:14.190
there are many scientists that still
 

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.770
there are many scientists that still
don't believe in this but because they

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780
don't believe in this but because they
 

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.289
don't believe in this but because they
are not experts and have not looked

are not experts and have not looked

like to point out one of the main ways

like to point out one of the main ways
 

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.570
like to point out one of the main ways
in which the non scientists or

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580
in which the non scientists or
 

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.750
in which the non scientists or
scientists in different specialties or

scientists in different specialties or
politicians they point that all

00:21:31.399 --> 00:21:31.409
politicians they point that all
 

00:21:31.409 --> 00:21:33.620

something must be wrong with climate

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:33.630
something must be wrong with climate
 

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.750
something must be wrong with climate
science they don't take into account

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760
science they don't take into account
 

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.690
science they don't take into account
that climate is a complex issue just

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700
that climate is a complex issue just
 

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.570
that climate is a complex issue just
like the human body ok we are complex

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580
like the human body ok we are complex
 

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.930
like the human body ok we are complex
and that's why medicines don't work 100%

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940
and that's why medicines don't work 100%
 

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.570
and that's why medicines don't work 100%
of the time because we're some of us are

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580
of the time because we're some of us are
 

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.789
of the time because we're some of us are
different and so you have to talk about

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799
different and so you have to talk about
 

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:52.039
different and so you have to talk about
probabilities and so on and so forth and

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:52.049
probabilities and so on and so forth and
 

00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:54.649
probabilities and so on and so forth and
you might have sometimes a very good

you might have sometimes a very good
 

00:21:54.659 --> 00:21:57.669
you might have sometimes a very good
theory what things remain to be

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:59.870
theory what things remain to be
explained the same thing happens with

require additional science research to

require additional science research to
 

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.770

science works it's more like this like a

science works it's more like this like a
 

00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:06.529
science works it's more like this like a
puzzle and we have pieces of the puzzle

harmless little kitten movie so the

harmless little kitten movie so the
bottom line is that the science is very

bottom line is that the science is very
 

00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:30.769
bottom line is that the science is very
well-established and so I'll tell you

well-established and so I'll tell you
 

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:32.479
well-established and so I'll tell you

itself I'm not going to have time to go
into much detail but first I want to

00:23:37.399 --> 00:23:37.409
into much detail but first I want to
 

00:23:37.409 --> 00:23:40.369
into much detail but first I want to
highlight we are talking about a global

00:23:40.369 --> 00:23:40.379
highlight we are talking about a global
 

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:42.379
highlight we are talking about a global
problem and it's a problem with the

00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:42.389
problem and it's a problem with the
 

00:23:42.389 --> 00:23:45.379
problem and it's a problem with the
atmosphere which you cannot see because

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:45.389
atmosphere which you cannot see because
 

00:23:45.389 --> 00:23:48.019
atmosphere which you cannot see because
the atmosphere is transparent but it's

00:23:48.019 --> 00:23:48.029
the atmosphere is transparent but it's
 

00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:50.899
the atmosphere is transparent but it's
also very thin I like to make the

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:50.909
also very thin I like to make the
 

00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:53.590
also very thin I like to make the

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.570
analogy it's like the skin of an apple
because most of the atmosphere is is

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580
because most of the atmosphere is is
 

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.669
because most of the atmosphere is is
that close to the surface above 50

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679
that close to the surface above 50
 

00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:04.340

that people can affect climate in any
significant way anymore but if you

but what is what's happening well let me

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720
but what is what's happening well let me
 

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.430
but what is what's happening well let me
just explain very briefly here the

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440
just explain very briefly here the

just explain very briefly here the
following reasoning that was already

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.110
following reasoning that was already

what scientists were dealing with in the

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:34.590
what scientists were dealing with in the
 

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.590
what scientists were dealing with in the
nineteenth century the question at that

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600
nineteenth century the question at that
 

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.940
nineteenth century the question at that
time was how does the climate of our

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:40.950
time was how does the climate of our
 

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:46.669
time was how does the climate of our
planet come about to be and the

00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679
planet come about to be and the
 

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:49.460
planet come about to be and the
reasoning was look we can measure how

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:49.470
reasoning was look we can measure how
 

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.710
reasoning was look we can measure how
much energy does our planet receive from

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720
much energy does our planet receive from
 

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.840
much energy does our planet receive from
the Sun and that's what is keeping us

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:53.850
the Sun and that's what is keeping us
 

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.549
the Sun and that's what is keeping us
warm and we know from physics and from

00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559
warm and we know from physics and from
 

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:02.600

is in thermal equilibrium namely it

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:10.410
is in thermal equilibrium namely it
 

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.830
is in thermal equilibrium namely it
absorbs energy from the Sun but it emits

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840
absorbs energy from the Sun but it emits
 

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.240
absorbs energy from the Sun but it emits
the same amount of energy

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.250
the same amount of energy
 

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.280
the same amount of energy
it receives it's no longer accumulating

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.290
it receives it's no longer accumulating
 

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.410
it receives it's no longer accumulating
energy there are some energy inside the

planet put it it's very well insulated
 

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.680
planet put it it's very well insulated
from the surface so it doesn't affect

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:23.690
from the surface so it doesn't affect
 

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.230
from the surface so it doesn't affect

and do you know of course that warm

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.150
and do you know of course that warm

bodies emit radiation we can measure a

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520
bodies emit radiation we can measure a
 

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.970
bodies emit radiation we can measure a
lot in the lab and as you increase the

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:02.980
lot in the lab and as you increase the
 

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.980
lot in the lab and as you increase the
temperature eventually they can become

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:04.990
temperature eventually they can become
 

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.730
temperature eventually they can become
red-hot that's when they begin to emit

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:08.740
red-hot that's when they begin to emit
 

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.760
red-hot that's when they begin to emit
some visible radiation already very warm

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:11.770
some visible radiation already very warm
 

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:15.120
some visible radiation already very warm
and white hot like in incandescent bulb

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.130
and white hot like in incandescent bulb
 

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.360
and white hot like in incandescent bulb
then it's relief very high temperatures

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.370
then it's relief very high temperatures
 

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.390
then it's relief very high temperatures
and the son of is of course one of this

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400
and the son of is of course one of this
 

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.940
and the son of is of course one of this
very high temperature but fortunately

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:23.950
very high temperature but fortunately
 

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.760
very high temperature but fortunately
were not that warm that's why life could

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:26.770
were not that warm that's why life could
 

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:32.519
were not that warm that's why life could
evolve and infrared light emitted by the

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:32.529
evolve and infrared light emitted by the
 

00:27:32.529 --> 00:27:37.200
evolve and infrared light emitted by the
our planet is not visible and so you

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:37.210
our planet is not visible and so you
 

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.289
our planet is not visible and so you
could measure that in the laboratory and

00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299
could measure that in the laboratory and
 

00:27:39.299 --> 00:27:42.360
could measure that in the laboratory and
measure the dependence of these energies

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:42.370
measure the dependence of these energies
 

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:45.419
measure the dependence of these energies
on temperature and the answer that was

00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:45.429
on temperature and the answer that was
 

00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:48.870
on temperature and the answer that was
first obtained by doing this balance is

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880
first obtained by doing this balance is
 

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.840
first obtained by doing this balance is
that our planet should be at around

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:51.850
that our planet should be at around
 

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.769
that our planet should be at around
minus 18 degree Celsius that would be a

00:27:55.769 --> 00:27:55.779
minus 18 degree Celsius that would be a
 

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:58.190
minus 18 degree Celsius that would be a
frozen planet we wouldn't be here so

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200
frozen planet we wouldn't be here so
 

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.830
frozen planet we wouldn't be here so
that's not the case just to explain that

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840
that's not the case just to explain that
 

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.539
that's not the case just to explain that
this initial finding of what the

00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:06.549
this initial finding of what the
 

00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:09.690
this initial finding of what the
temperature was was wrong because the

about two-thirds of the energy that
comes from the Sun gets all the way to

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:11.410

course that reflected is transparent to

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:18.580
course that reflected is transparent to
 

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.580
course that reflected is transparent to
visible radiation so it makes it all the

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:20.590
visible radiation so it makes it all the
 

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.800
visible radiation so it makes it all the
way to the surface but then I was

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:22.810
way to the surface but then I was
 

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.320
way to the surface but then I was
explaining that at the temperatures that

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:25.330
explaining that at the temperatures that
 

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.440
explaining that at the temperatures that
we have the surface then emits in

we have the surface then emits in
 

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.330
we have the surface then emits in
principle it would be the same amount of

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:30.340
principle it would be the same amount of
 

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.340
principle it would be the same amount of
radiation except that we do have this

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:32.350
radiation except that we do have this
 

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.790
radiation except that we do have this
blanket and because the atmosphere

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:34.800
blanket and because the atmosphere
 

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.570
blanket and because the atmosphere
absorbs this infrared radiation it has

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:39.580
absorbs this infrared radiation it has
 

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.000
absorbs this infrared radiation it has
to emit about twice as much because in

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.010
to emit about twice as much because in
 

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.280
to emit about twice as much because in
the atmosphere absorbs it then yttrium

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:44.290
the atmosphere absorbs it then yttrium
 

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.740
the atmosphere absorbs it then yttrium
it's this radiation absorbed the

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:46.750
it's this radiation absorbed the
 

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.990
it's this radiation absorbed the
molecules in the atmosphere absorb it

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000
molecules in the atmosphere absorb it
 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.690
molecules in the atmosphere absorb it
then they remit this energy in all

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:51.700
then they remit this energy in all
 

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.300
then they remit this energy in all
directions roughly half upwards half

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:54.310
directions roughly half upwards half
 

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.930
directions roughly half upwards half
downwards that's why you have to the

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:57.940
downwards that's why you have to the
 

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.960
downwards that's why you have to the
surface has to meet about twice as much

00:30:59.960 --> 00:30:59.970
surface has to meet about twice as much
 

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.430
surface has to meet about twice as much
half of that comes back to the surface

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440
half of that comes back to the surface
 

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.400
half of that comes back to the surface
warming it up and the only the two

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:05.410
warming it up and the only the two
 

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.520
warming it up and the only the two
remaining arrows is what goes out to

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:08.530
remaining arrows is what goes out to
 

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.740
remaining arrows is what goes out to
space and so in principle you are not

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:10.750
space and so in principle you are not
 

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.380

accumulating energy anymore that's it

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:13.390
accumulating energy anymore that's it
 

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.420
accumulating energy anymore that's it

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.150
has already reached equilibrium long
time ago but this explains very clearly

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:18.160
time ago but this explains very clearly

and you would get a frozen planet so

00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399
and you would get a frozen planet so
 

00:33:36.399 --> 00:33:39.060
and you would get a frozen planet so

change very much with time if we have a

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:49.990
change very much with time if we have a
 

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.130
change very much with time if we have a
little cooling from the year eight for

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:53.140
little cooling from the year eight for
 

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.230
little cooling from the year eight for
the eight thousand years ago that might

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240
the eight thousand years ago that might
 

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.260
the eight thousand years ago that might
have continued put long before we get a

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.270
have continued put long before we get a
 

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.450
have continued put long before we get a
nice ice age that might take several

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:00.460
nice ice age that might take several
 

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.790
nice ice age that might take several
tens of thousands of years if we were to

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800
tens of thousands of years if we were to
 

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.190
tens of thousands of years if we were to
continue that way and suddenly we jump

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200
continue that way and suddenly we jump
 

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.710
continue that way and suddenly we jump
upwards to a temperature that we haven't

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720
upwards to a temperature that we haven't
 

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.380
upwards to a temperature that we haven't
seen for a long time okay for for tens

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:10.390
seen for a long time okay for for tens
 

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.990
seen for a long time okay for for tens
of thousands of years and of course the

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000
of thousands of years and of course the
 

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.290
of thousands of years and of course the
question is given all this explanation

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:16.300
question is given all this explanation
 

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.960
question is given all this explanation
about the signs of the climate they

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:18.970
about the signs of the climate they
 

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.250
about the signs of the climate they
should be connected but how do we

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260
should be connected but how do we
 

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.320
should be connected but how do we
evaluate that and one way to do that is

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:25.330
evaluate that and one way to do that is
 

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.480
evaluate that and one way to do that is
there's a group of scientists they get

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:27.490
there's a group of scientists they get
 

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.580
there's a group of scientists they get
together there are voluntary scientists

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:29.590
together there are voluntary scientists
 

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.380
together there are voluntary scientists
and about every five years they

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:31.390
and about every five years they
 

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:33.500
and about every five years they
published a report that's it

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:33.510
published a report that's it
 

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.040

Change the IPCC they write a report

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.050
Change the IPCC they write a report
 

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.080
Change the IPCC they write a report
summarizing the science and their

conclusion is that indeed we're not

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.240
conclusion is that indeed we're not
 

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.980
conclusion is that indeed we're not
quite sure that the temperature changed

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:46.990
quite sure that the temperature changed
 

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:50.430
quite sure that the temperature changed
this caused by co2 we only can do that

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:50.440
this caused by co2 we only can do that

this caused by co2 we only can do that
can make statements in terms of

the last report claimed by this group is

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:58.300
the last report claimed by this group is
 

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.940
the last report claimed by this group is
about 95 percent so

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:00.950
about 95 percent so
 

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.849
about 95 percent so
some possibility that that time that is

that it's indeed caused by human
 

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:17.380
that it's indeed caused by human
activities okay so that's the science

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:17.390
activities okay so that's the science
 

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.890
activities okay so that's the science
itself but let's look at the next myth

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:20.900
itself but let's look at the next myth
 

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.599
itself but let's look at the next myth
namely that we shouldn't worry about

00:38:22.599 --> 00:38:22.609
namely that we shouldn't worry about
 

00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:24.510
namely that we shouldn't worry about
this this is just something that our

climate changes very slowly well that's

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720
climate changes very slowly well that's
 

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.849
climate changes very slowly well that's
not really the case the Arctic sea is

worrisome perhaps is that we have

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:44.420
worrisome perhaps is that we have
 

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.050
worrisome perhaps is that we have

extreme weather events heat waves that
are already killing many people and we

00:38:49.569 --> 00:38:49.579
are already killing many people and we
 

00:38:49.579 --> 00:38:54.400
are already killing many people and we
have also here against floods and

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:54.410
have also here against floods and
 

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.520

us about this science very cautiously

us about this science very cautiously
 

00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:31.870
us about this science very cautiously
but nearest 10 15 years ago say well

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.880
but nearest 10 15 years ago say well

that's why I don't ill we have good

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:34.069
that's why I don't ill we have good
 

00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:35.920
that's why I don't ill we have good
enough statistics but now it's very

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:35.930
enough statistics but now it's very
 

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.650
enough statistics but now it's very
clear there is indeed a connection and

clear there is indeed a connection and
 

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.550
clear there is indeed a connection and

much for that means but the last is a
very important one why should we worry

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480
very important one why should we worry
 

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.230
very important one why should we worry
about fossil fuels they are so important

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240
about fossil fuels they are so important
 

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.599
about fossil fuels they are so important
for the economy we cannot really touch

that's how what our economies depend on

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960
that's how what our economies depend on
 

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.260
that's how what our economies depend on
fossil fuels well that turns out to me

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:19.270
fossil fuels well that turns out to me
 

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.120
fossil fuels well that turns out to me
to be a myth as well because now we have

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.130
to be a myth as well because now we have
 

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.490

course it's difficult to change society

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:47.650
course it's difficult to change society

course it's difficult to change society
that's one of the difficult for them to

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:49.510
that's one of the difficult for them to
 

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.630
that's one of the difficult for them to
change fast because investments have

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640
change fast because investments have
 

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.760
change fast because investments have
already been made but the point is that

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:53.770
already been made but the point is that
 

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.620
already been made but the point is that
we can already do it and we don't need

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:55.630
we can already do it and we don't need
 

00:40:55.630 --> 00:41:01.470
we can already do it and we don't need
to to sacrifice economic growth and this

sort of energy forms also generate a lot

00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:04.869
sort of energy forms also generate a lot
 

00:41:04.869 --> 00:41:06.660
sort of energy forms also generate a lot
of jobs and so on so there's no longer

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:06.670
of jobs and so on so there's no longer

this change it is economically
 

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.540
this change it is economically
competitive ok of course there are still

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:15.550
competitive ok of course there are still
 

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:18.140
competitive ok of course there are still
issues that require further

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:18.150
issues that require further
 

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.150
issues that require further
technological development such as these

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160
technological development such as these
 

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.339
technological development such as these
are intermittent so of course solar

00:41:23.339 --> 00:41:23.349
are intermittent so of course solar
 

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:25.650
are intermittent so of course solar
energy only works in the day not at

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:25.660
energy only works in the day not at
 

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.109

night wind energy sometimes doesn't work

00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119
night wind energy sometimes doesn't work
 

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:31.470
night wind energy sometimes doesn't work
but there are lots of technological

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480
but there are lots of technological
 

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.790
but there are lots of technological
advances storing this energy and that

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800
advances storing this energy and that
 

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.010
advances storing this energy and that
there are already some that are working

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:38.020
there are already some that are working
 

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.900
there are already some that are working
and many more that are being developed

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:39.910
and many more that are being developed
 

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:44.780
and many more that are being developed
so we can do it and the question then is

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:44.790
so we can do it and the question then is
 

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:49.260
so we can do it and the question then is
what has the world done about this which

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:49.270
what has the world done about this which
 

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:51.690
what has the world done about this which
is perhaps the most serious challenge

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:51.700
is perhaps the most serious challenge
 

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.790
is perhaps the most serious challenge
that society's facing certainly the most

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800
that society's facing certainly the most
 

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.200
that society's facing certainly the most
serious environmental challenge but in

00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:58.210
serious environmental challenge but in
 

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.079
serious environmental challenge but in
terms of what might happen in the future

and good news is that to begin with we

00:42:05.609 --> 00:42:05.619
and good news is that to begin with we

2009 I was there in Copenhagen and there

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480
2009 I was there in Copenhagen and there
 

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.770
2009 I was there in Copenhagen and there
were more than 120 heads of state at

were more than 120 heads of state at
 

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.730
were more than 120 heads of state at
that time and they all agreed there was

that time and they all agreed there was
 

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.319
that time and they all agreed there was
consensus we need to do something about

00:42:25.319 --> 00:42:25.329
consensus we need to do something about
 

00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:28.380
consensus we need to do something about
climate change heads of state all agreed

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:28.390
climate change heads of state all agreed
 

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:32.460

rising two degrees it should hopefully
 

00:42:44.799 --> 00:42:47.250

remind you we're already halfway there

00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839
remind you we're already halfway there
 

00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:53.700
remind you we're already halfway there
and even if we were to stop emissions

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:53.710
and even if we were to stop emissions
 

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.819
and even if we were to stop emissions
now because the planet is not yet in

equilibrium that temperature would
continue to rise for a while so we're

00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:00.849
continue to rise for a while so we're
 

00:43:00.849 --> 00:43:03.089
continue to rise for a while so we're
not that far but that's what the heads

00:43:03.089 --> 00:43:03.099
not that far but that's what the heads
 

00:43:03.099 --> 00:43:06.829
not that far but that's what the heads
of state agreed but not unfortunately

much happens in Copenhagen what we kept

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:20.230
much happens in Copenhagen what we kept
 

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.309
much happens in Copenhagen what we kept
working very hard and finally in

in five years so in a few years that
will happen to explain what else needs

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:00.009
will happen to explain what else needs

to be done so that the climate doesn't
keep changing okay and of course it's

keep changing okay and of course it's
 

00:44:05.529 --> 00:44:07.380
keep changing okay and of course it's
going to be measured and so on and so

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:07.390
going to be measured and so on and so
 

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:10.109
going to be measured and so on and so
forth so that's an incredible

00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:10.119
forth so that's an incredible
 

00:44:10.119 --> 00:44:13.650
forth so that's an incredible
achievement which means it's just like a

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:13.660
achievement which means it's just like a
 

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.019
achievement which means it's just like a
Montreal Protocol but it's only halfway

I need it's only on its way but here is
what's happening if we look at the

what's happening if we look at the
 

00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:26.430
what's happening if we look at the

half way if we do only the Paris Accord

00:44:41.039 --> 00:44:41.049
half way if we do only the Paris Accord
 

00:44:41.049 --> 00:44:42.299
half way if we do only the Paris Accord
we might get

00:44:42.299 --> 00:44:42.309
we might get
 

00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:44.099
we might get
all the way to three degrees who knows

00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:44.109
all the way to three degrees who knows
 

00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:48.539
all the way to three degrees who knows
what if we do nothing that's a big worry

00:44:48.539 --> 00:44:48.549
what if we do nothing that's a big worry
 

00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:51.689
what if we do nothing that's a big worry
that's the red line we could reach three

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:51.699
that's the red line we could reach three
 

00:44:51.699 --> 00:44:57.719
that's the red line we could reach three
or five degrees okay and so what should

00:44:57.719 --> 00:44:57.729
or five degrees okay and so what should
 

00:44:57.729 --> 00:44:58.319
or five degrees okay and so what should
we do

00:44:58.319 --> 00:44:58.329
we do
 

00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:00.809
we do

I need to put it up to date but the
point is that if if that all the

yes hey so yesterday one of the
 

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.190
yes hey so yesterday one of the
panelists said that there were numerous

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200
panelists said that there were numerous
 

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.420
panelists said that there were numerous
grand challenges that we need to face in

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:15.430
grand challenges that we need to face in
 

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:17.490

climate change was special in that it

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:20.140
climate change was special in that it

managed to enter the consciousness of

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:22.300
managed to enter the consciousness of
 

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.960
managed to enter the consciousness of
the general population and my question

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:24.970
the general population and my question
 

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:29.210
the general population and my question
is what you think that the climate

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220
is what you think that the climate
 

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:32.280
is what you think that the climate
science community did that allowed it to

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:32.290
science community did that allowed it to
 

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:34.520
science community did that allowed it to
make so much progress compared to

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:34.530
make so much progress compared to
 

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:37.740
make so much progress compared to
potentially other branches that did not

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:37.750
potentially other branches that did not
 

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:42.090
potentially other branches that did not
succeed as well then we make sure I

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:42.100
succeed as well then we make sure I
 

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.950
succeed as well then we make sure I
understand the question is now if I time

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960
understand the question is now if I time
 

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.020
understand the question is now if I time
I change is special yes why is climate

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.030
I change is special yes why is climate
 

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.940
I change is special yes why is climate
change special in public consciousness

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:47.950

efforts by the scientific community I've

00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:58.390
efforts by the scientific community I've
 

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:00.810

anyhow the point is that one of the most
 

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:12.450
anyhow the point is that one of the most
worrisome what I would say clearly the

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:12.460
worrisome what I would say clearly the
 

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.630
worrisome what I would say clearly the
most worrisome one is climate change

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640
most worrisome one is climate change
 

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.450
most worrisome one is climate change

his last reports would I very much agree
 

00:54:49.329 --> 00:54:51.660
his last reports would I very much agree
with him is that the damage has been

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:51.670
with him is that the damage has been
 

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.329
with him is that the damage has been
grossly underestimated and you cannot

00:54:54.329 --> 00:54:54.339
grossly underestimated and you cannot
 

00:54:54.339 --> 00:54:57.180
grossly underestimated and you cannot
measure it in dollars only how do you

this there's an MIT Energy Initiative
and they have a board with many people

from industry so I get not just the

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:41.740
from industry so I get not just the
 

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.069
from industry so I get not just the
academic perspective but also industry's

00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079
academic perspective but also industry's
 

00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:46.620
academic perspective but also industry's
perspective ok and the view there is

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:46.630
perspective ok and the view there is
 

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:51.270

do with waste but the amount of waste is

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:05.260

do you put it
 

00:59:10.569 --> 00:59:12.960
do you put it
but in principle it's technologically

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:12.970
but in principle it's technologically
 

00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:15.569

point just to mention it which is we

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:41.380
point just to mention it which is we
 

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.849
point just to mention it which is we
waste a lot of energy and we know that

00:59:44.849 --> 00:59:44.859
waste a lot of energy and we know that
 

00:59:44.859 --> 00:59:46.500
waste a lot of energy and we know that
in some places the Scandinavian

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:46.510
in some places the Scandinavian
 

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:48.839
in some places the Scandinavian
countries waste a lot less and they have

00:59:48.839 --> 00:59:48.849
countries waste a lot less and they have
 

00:59:48.849 --> 00:59:50.970
countries waste a lot less and they have
a very acceptable standard of living so

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:50.980
a very acceptable standard of living so
 

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.970
a very acceptable standard of living so
we can do a lot better without

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:53.980

proposed geoengineering methods such as
 

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:38.410

what are your views on those ideas okay

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:46.570
what are your views on those ideas okay
 

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:50.109
what are your views on those ideas okay
two points first my views yes said I

01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119
two points first my views yes said I
 

01:00:50.119 --> 01:00:52.900
two points first my views yes said I
think it is all right and the scientific

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:52.910
think it is all right and the scientific
 

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:56.790
think it is all right and the scientific
community should carry out the research

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:56.800
community should carry out the research
 

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.010
community should carry out the research
but I also agree with the consensus that

01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:00.020
but I also agree with the consensus that

just like some volcanoes do and we know
that the temperature drops when

the future there will be ways by the way
there is also now a trend it's fusion

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:50.890
there is also now a trend it's fusion
 

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:54.190
there is also now a trend it's fusion
for many years Fusion was 50 years in

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:54.200
for many years Fusion was 50 years in
 

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.630
for many years Fusion was 50 years in
the future no matter when you were

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640
the future no matter when you were
 

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.460
the future no matter when you were
talking about always 15 years in the

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:57.470
talking about always 15 years in the
 

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:59.980
talking about always 15 years in the
future but now there are some findings

01:02:59.980 --> 01:02:59.990
future but now there are some findings

again knife mit has made a lot of

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:02.540
again knife mit has made a lot of
 

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:05.130
again knife mit has made a lot of
progress here because they can have huge

and the idea is that not next year but

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:12.380
and the idea is that not next year but
 

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:15.750
and the idea is that not next year but
within a decade with my very well

finally see fusion coming around that

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:19.190
finally see fusion coming around that
 

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:21.940
finally see fusion coming around that
that would be imagine if you have a

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:21.950
that would be imagine if you have a
 

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:24.460
that would be imagine if you have a
solution of that type without adverse

solution of that type without adverse
 

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:27.750
solution of that type without adverse
consequences then you would not need

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760
consequences then you would not need
 

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.580
consequences then you would not need

few years is very clear examples of
 

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:23.890
few years is very clear examples of
negative consequences and you can cite

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:23.900
negative consequences and you can cite

you probably know that you suddenly
 

01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:37.330
you probably know that you suddenly
reach a threshold and suddenly things

01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:37.340
reach a threshold and suddenly things
 

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.810
reach a threshold and suddenly things
change not smoothly but suddenly okay

01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:40.820
change not smoothly but suddenly okay
 

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.110

the the main difficulty here because of

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:44.120
the the main difficulty here because of
 

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.850
the the main difficulty here because of
the complexity of the climate is that

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:45.860
the complexity of the climate is that
 

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.580
the complexity of the climate is that
it's very hard to predict but these

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:48.590
it's very hard to predict but these
 

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:51.100
it's very hard to predict but these
these so-called surprises okay so that

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:51.110
these so-called surprises okay so that
 

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:53.490
these so-called surprises okay so that
you would have just to show them by

01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:53.500
you would have just to show them by
 

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.330
you would have just to show them by
example and that's one disadvantage of

01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:57.340
example and that's one disadvantage of
 

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:00.040
example and that's one disadvantage of
condensing the conversation just in the

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:00.050
condensing the conversation just in the
 

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:02.500
condensing the conversation just in the
two degrees or in the temperature change

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:02.510
two degrees or in the temperature change

it's just one way to illustrate what I

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:04.850
it's just one way to illustrate what I
 

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:06.550
it's just one way to illustrate what I
would emphasize it's an

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:06.560
would emphasize it's an
 

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.030
would emphasize it's an
oversimplification to talk just about

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:10.040
oversimplification to talk just about
 

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.060
oversimplification to talk just about
this surface temperature change that

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:13.070
this surface temperature change that

just one way to summarize issues but

01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:15.860
just one way to summarize issues but
 

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:18.730
just one way to summarize issues but
it's not the main worry thank you please

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:18.740
it's not the main worry thank you please
 

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.940
it's not the main worry thank you please
yeah thank you so much for the great

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:21.950
yeah thank you so much for the great

lecture one thread that I hear that is
 

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.230
lecture one thread that I hear that is
common to yesterday's discussion and

common to yesterday's discussion and
 

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.180
common to yesterday's discussion and
your lecture today is that our greatest

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:28.190
your lecture today is that our greatest
 

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:29.800
your lecture today is that our greatest
challenges are not scientific and

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:29.810
challenges are not scientific and
 

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.440
challenges are not scientific and
technological they are political and

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:32.450
technological they are political and
 

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:36.400
technological they are political and
cultural right would you agree that we

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:36.410
cultural right would you agree that we
 

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:39.640
cultural right would you agree that we
need more Grand Challenge initiatives

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:39.650
need more Grand Challenge initiatives
 

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:42.430
need more Grand Challenge initiatives
that address politics and culture yes

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440
that address politics and culture yes
 

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.300
that address politics and culture yes
very much so

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:43.310
very much so
 

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:49.060
very much so
and let me give you two so ways in which

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:49.070
and let me give you two so ways in which
 

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:52.240
and let me give you two so ways in which
we can do that one way is extremely

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:52.250
we can do that one way is extremely
 

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:54.130
we can do that one way is extremely
important unfortunately not very fast

01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:54.140
important unfortunately not very fast
 

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.360
important unfortunately not very fast
but nevertheless they're really

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:55.370
but nevertheless they're really
 

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:59.140
but nevertheless they're really
important and that's a change in a decay

01:06:59.140 --> 01:06:59.150
important and that's a change in a decay
 

01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:02.960
important and that's a change in a decay
because we have now new waste to educate

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:02.970
because we have now new waste to educate
 

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:06.710
because we have now new waste to educate
starting with with elementary school how

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720
starting with with elementary school how
 

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.630
starting with with elementary school how
children learn science and there are new

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640
children learn science and there are new
 

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.970
children learn science and there are new
ways to do that in which they learn it

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980
ways to do that in which they learn it
 

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.970
ways to do that in which they learn it
very much faster much more efficiently

pass it what did that mean that means up
 

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.390
pass it what did that mean that means up
that means meant that US Congress had

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400
that means meant that US Congress had
 

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.010
that means meant that US Congress had
nothing to do with the Paris agreement

01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020
nothing to do with the Paris agreement
 

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.230
nothing to do with the Paris agreement
because they would not have agreed with

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:36.240
because they would not have agreed with
 

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.410
because they would not have agreed with
it to me but that's changing now we hope

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420
it to me but that's changing now we hope
 

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.440
it to me but that's changing now we hope
thank you another question please so a

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:42.450
thank you another question please so a
 

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:44.810
thank you another question please so a
lot of experts agree that agriculture is

01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820
lot of experts agree that agriculture is
 

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.880
lot of experts agree that agriculture is
one of the largest global emitters of

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:46.890
one of the largest global emitters of
 

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:49.670
one of the largest global emitters of
greenhouse gases and not only in that

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:49.680
greenhouse gases and not only in that
 

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.590
greenhouse gases and not only in that
respect but also a huge waste of water

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600
respect but also a huge waste of water
 

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.820
respect but also a huge waste of water
the use of pesticides and fertilizers

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:54.830
the use of pesticides and fertilizers
 

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:56.900
the use of pesticides and fertilizers
some of these experts agree that a

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:56.910
some of these experts agree that a
 

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:58.700
some of these experts agree that a
change to permaculture might be a

01:11:58.700 --> 01:11:58.710
change to permaculture might be a
 

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:01.510
change to permaculture might be a
solution to fixing that part of the

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520
solution to fixing that part of the
 

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.010
solution to fixing that part of the
greenhouse gas emissions issue so to

01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020
greenhouse gas emissions issue so to
 

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.270
greenhouse gas emissions issue so to
what extent do you think that

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280
what extent do you think that
 

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.250
what extent do you think that

I think you can you can mix it you can

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:25.950
I think you can you can mix it you can
 

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.770
I think you can you can mix it you can
if you have some ideas about some

01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780
if you have some ideas about some
 

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.590
if you have some ideas about some
changes in agriculture you can do

01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600
changes in agriculture you can do
 

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.530
changes in agriculture you can do
scientific tests and that that has

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:33.540
scientific tests and that that has
 

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.330
scientific tests and that that has
happened so there's it need not be

01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340
happened so there's it need not be
 

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.930
happened so there's it need not be
incompatible but that's a recognised

01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940
incompatible but that's a recognised
 

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.910
incompatible but that's a recognised
aspect of climate change it's not

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920
aspect of climate change it's not
 

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.520
aspect of climate change it's not
necessarily the the largest or the most

fossil fuels both agriculture practices

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960
fossil fuels both agriculture practices
 

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.830
fossil fuels both agriculture practices
had been part of this whole idea and in

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840
had been part of this whole idea and in
 

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.510
had been part of this whole idea and in
fact that peak as I was just talking

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520
fact that peak as I was just talking
 

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.030
fact that peak as I was just talking
about this group with with President

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040
about this group with with President
 

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.690
about this group with with President
Obama we have if not one and maybe two

01:12:59.690 --> 01:12:59.700
Obama we have if not one and maybe two
 

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.540
Obama we have if not one and maybe two
reports on agriculture who are we met

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:02.550
reports on agriculture who are we met
 

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:04.790
reports on agriculture who are we met
with experts some actually from this

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800
with experts some actually from this
 

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.490
with experts some actually from this
University that were very much experts

01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:07.500
University that were very much experts
 

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:11.260
University that were very much experts
on these issues and yes there are

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:11.270
on these issues and yes there are
 

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:14.600
on these issues and yes there are
problems excess use of fertilizers okay

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:14.610
problems excess use of fertilizers okay
 

01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:17.930
problems excess use of fertilizers okay
that effect the nitrogen cycle and so on

01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940
that effect the nitrogen cycle and so on
 

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.720
that effect the nitrogen cycle and so on
so what that should be improved but it's

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:20.730
so what that should be improved but it's
 

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.310
so what that should be improved but it's
even more important in developing

01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320
even more important in developing
 

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.510
even more important in developing
countries where they're just wasting

01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520
countries where they're just wasting
 

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.900
countries where they're just wasting
resources okay so there is a lot that

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:26.910
resources okay so there is a lot that
 

01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:29.900
resources okay so there is a lot that
can be done with agriculture to improve

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:29.910
can be done with agriculture to improve
 

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:34.400
can be done with agriculture to improve
the practices and again it's a huge

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:34.410
the practices and again it's a huge
 

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.320
the practices and again it's a huge
challenge not just because of climate

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:36.330
challenge not just because of climate
 

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:37.479
challenge not just because of climate
change for the

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:37.489
change for the
 

01:13:37.489 --> 01:13:40.140
change for the
you have to feed a growing population

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:40.150
you have to feed a growing population
 

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:43.770
you have to feed a growing population
but fortunately I think there are

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:43.780
but fortunately I think there are
 

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.779
but fortunately I think there are
there's good science in that field which

01:13:46.779 --> 01:13:46.789
there's good science in that field which
 

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:49.390
there's good science in that field which
is far from my own field but as I

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400
is far from my own field but as I
 

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.339
is far from my own field but as I
understand there is progress but there

01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:51.349
understand there is progress but there
 

01:13:51.349 --> 01:13:54.970
understand there is progress but there
again the politics is remains to be

01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:54.980
again the politics is remains to be
 

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.160
again the politics is remains to be
worked out and just give you one example

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:57.170
worked out and just give you one example
 

01:13:57.170 --> 01:14:00.729
worked out and just give you one example
which is in Mexico for we deal with with

01:14:00.729 --> 01:14:00.739
which is in Mexico for we deal with with
 

01:14:00.739 --> 01:14:02.890
which is in Mexico for we deal with with
science policy and one of the things

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:02.900
science policy and one of the things
 

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.270
science policy and one of the things
we're trying to change we have not

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280
we're trying to change we have not
 

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.580
we're trying to change we have not
succeeded yet is there is an incentive

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:06.590
succeeded yet is there is an incentive
 

01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:09.640
succeeded yet is there is an incentive
in agriculture where the government

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:09.650
in agriculture where the government
 

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:13.770
in agriculture where the government
simply gives away water and electricity

01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:13.780
simply gives away water and electricity
 

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:17.229
simply gives away water and electricity
and that's not very wise because then

01:14:17.229 --> 01:14:17.239
and that's not very wise because then
 

01:14:17.239 --> 01:14:20.049
and that's not very wise because then
people in business and so they don't

01:14:20.049 --> 01:14:20.059
people in business and so they don't
 

01:14:20.059 --> 01:14:22.649
people in business and so they don't
care they can waste water electricity

01:14:22.649 --> 01:14:22.659
care they can waste water electricity
 

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:25.270
care they can waste water electricity
government pays for it why should we

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280
government pays for it why should we
 

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.939
government pays for it why should we
care so we are suggesting to change the

01:14:27.939 --> 01:14:27.949
care so we are suggesting to change the
 

01:14:27.949 --> 01:14:31.180
care so we are suggesting to change the
subsidy not to remove it but to give

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:31.190
subsidy not to remove it but to give
 

01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:34.629
subsidy not to remove it but to give
them the resources in in cash inclusion

01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639
them the resources in in cash inclusion
 

01:14:34.639 --> 01:14:35.589
them the resources in in cash inclusion
in some other way

01:14:35.589 --> 01:14:35.599
in some other way
 

01:14:35.599 --> 01:14:39.489
in some other way
but so that they don't just waste the

01:14:39.489 --> 01:14:39.499
but so that they don't just waste the
 

01:14:39.499 --> 01:14:41.680
but so that they don't just waste the
water and the energy and so there are

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:41.690
water and the energy and so there are
 

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:44.500
water and the energy and so there are
many examples like this in the here and

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:44.510
many examples like this in the here and
 

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:46.660
many examples like this in the here and
in the developing world that need to be

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:46.670
in the developing world that need to be
 

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:48.339
in the developing world that need to be
changed with the help of science but

01:14:48.339 --> 01:14:48.349
changed with the help of science but
 

01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:50.169
changed with the help of science but
again we're talking a little bit about

01:14:50.169 --> 01:14:50.179
again we're talking a little bit about
 

01:14:50.179 --> 01:14:52.899
again we're talking a little bit about
the politics the science and the

01:14:52.899 --> 01:14:52.909
the politics the science and the
 

01:14:52.909 --> 01:14:54.370
the politics the science and the
technology thank you a quick question

01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:54.380
technology thank you a quick question
 

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:58.720
technology thank you a quick question
from this side first please Naomi Klein

in this changes everything

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320
in this changes everything

over admitting do you think that we can

01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:18.380
over admitting do you think that we can
 

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.040
over admitting do you think that we can
really make progress without changing

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:21.050
really make progress without changing
 

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:25.600
really make progress without changing
like the economic system that's a good

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:25.610
like the economic system that's a good
 

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:28.899
like the economic system that's a good
question and I think let me be very

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:28.909
question and I think let me be very
 

01:15:28.909 --> 01:15:31.890
question and I think let me be very
optimistic I think we can because

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:31.900
optimistic I think we can because
 

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:36.700
optimistic I think we can because
capitalism is the only form of guess of

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:36.710
