NITIN MANGTANI: Welcome.

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:06.130
I hope you're having fun
at Google, are you?

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.130
The tablets simply looked
awesome, so I'm sure you're

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.380
having double the fun now
with those tablets.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.800
Quick intros.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.700
My name is Nitin Mangtani.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.760
I'm a group product
manager at Google.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.040
I work in the commerce focus
area and I'm here today to

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.900
talk about shopping APIs.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.550
And with me, also, a colleague
of mine, Ali, he's going to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.430
join us later.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.610
So let me talk a little bit
about what we're going to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.370
focus on today, and as you
walk out of the session,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.920
exactly will you learn?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.420
So I just wanted to set the
stage and talk about, what are

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.190
the different innovations
Google is doing around

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.640
shopping and shopping search?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.020
And then I'm going to switch
gears a little bit and we're

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.910
going to talk about, how does
it relate to the development

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.650
community broadly?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.810
How can you collaborate with
Google and be part of the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.180
broader ecosystem?

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.350
As we're doing a lot of
innovations on the Google site

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.940
and this is where shopping APIs
are, in some ways, the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.080
heart and soul of
our ecosystems

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.790
and developer outreach.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.380
So we're going to focus a
lot on shopping APIs.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.030
The shopping APIs have multiple
components, so we'll

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.370
talk both about them and how
they interact with the Google

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.500
properties.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.630
We'll try to show you a couple
of live demos and also go into

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.810
details on the actual API and
the semantics of them.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.030
But before I do that, I just
wanted to step back and give

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.760
you guys a little update on
what's happening in the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.420
broader retail or the
shopping arena.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.650
So if you look at the retail
industry, the first online

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.530
transaction happened maybe
a decade or 15 years ago.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.720
Someone took the credit card
and bought online.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.650
Now it's been a long time since
we went from a purely

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.940
shopping at the store to online
shopping, but if you

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.610
look at some of the interesting
data points,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.700
what's happening is that, even
after 15 years, a good

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.840
portion, in fact a majority of
the shopping, still happens at

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.260
a physical store.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.100
In fact, the data shows 90%
of the shopping happens on

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.220
somebody's store where a user
walks into the store and makes

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.419
a purchase.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.840
What's more interesting is that,
even though 90% of the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.190
shopping happens in a physical
store, close to half, 43% of

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.540
those decisions, the purchase
decisions are made in the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.360
online world, which is even
before a user or a consumer

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.260
walks into that store, he or
she has researched that

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.340
product or that brand or
that retailer online

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.880
and made that decision.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.380
So that's why it's so important
for the broader

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.380
community to have that presence
in the online world

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.270
so that, whether you are a
retailer, a brand owner, or

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.910
you're a developer, if you're
thinking about shopping, it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.330
very important that you think
about what's the online

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.850
presence of your shopping
initiative.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.280
And last, but not the least,
there are a lot of data points

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.560
made last year which are
predicting that the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.230
smartphones will outsell the
desktop computer sometime in

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.260
2012 or 2013.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.770
Guess what?

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.980
It happened last quarter
of 2010.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
It didn't even take until 2012
or 2013, which is a pretty

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.800
interesting phenomena if you
look at the evolution of

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.310
computing and some of the other
computing paradigms and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.540
their adoption.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.190
Mobile is one of the fastest
growing technologies, and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.140
what's happening is, it's
blending these worlds of what

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.830
we used to call online shopping

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.710
versus in-store shopping.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.305
These two worlds are getting
blended, which, from a

00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:31.070
consumer point of view,
doesn't matter.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.090
You can start the search online
but actually purchase

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.800
the transaction going
into the store.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.050
[? And ?]

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.220
that mobile device is
bridging that gap.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.600
Because on the mobile device,
you can do the research and

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.130
you can even find the stores
near you which carry that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.310
item, and then they will show
you the directions.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.380
So you can just drive to that
store and pick that item.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.460
So it's a very interesting
dynamic which is changing how

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.900
shoppers look at broader retail
industry, and how they

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.180
are interacting with retailers
in general.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.130
So let's look at some other
interesting things that are

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.530
happening on the Google site.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.860
So I think most of you might be
aware of Google Shopping or

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.120
Google Product Search.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.160
If you type in any

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.050
product-related query on Google--

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.880
and you can try this, for
example, digital camera--

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.480
we would show you the
different cameras.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.089
We will also show you the
information about them:

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.399
ratings, reviews, the price,
and the retailers that they

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.490
can buy from.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.270
This application has been live
for a while, and I'm sure many

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.070
of you might be already
playing with this.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.330
The interesting thing, which I'm
going to connect the dots

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.650
pretty soon is, I'll show you
how what you see here on the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.180
consumer side is related
to the shopping APIs.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.670
And how shopping APIs play an
important role in feeding this

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.235
data to Google.

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:41.570
So one of the APIs, which we're
going to go in a lot

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.120
more detail, it's called
Content API, which is

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.850
basically the heart and soul
of our infrastructure.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.040
And that's how these items get
listed on Google Shopping.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.760
The next innovation we did is,
back in the days when you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.310
typed in a query, digital
camera, we would show you the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.850
same camera and the same image
multiple times, basically

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.070
showing you all the retailers
that sell those products.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.600
And obviously, from a consumer
point of view, that wasn't the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.400
best experience.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.030
So we improved the experience a
lot by creating something we

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.650
call the product page, which
is, this particular camera,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.150
Canon Power Shot, is sold
by multiple retailers.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.420
In fact, 158 retailers, but
it's is the same product.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.520
There's no point showing that
image 158 times, or the

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.350
description, or the ratings
and reviews.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.130
Because no matter whom you buy
this product from, the product

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.100
remains the same.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.820
So we created this canonical
catalog pages for the products

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.410
so that, as a consumer, as you
are typing in a query, we show

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.250
you this product page.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.740
You can look at all the
information about the product

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.840
and then, at the bottom grid,
you see all the retailers.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.800
We still show you the retailers
ratings, because

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.950
that's equally important.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.690
Once you know that this is the
right product to buy, you also

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.330
want to know which is the right
retailer to purchase

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.920
this product.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.850
So that's where we show you that
information and then we

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.650
show you the price and
other attributes.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.310
So that's where the next

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.130
evolution in Google's shopping.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.000
The third thing, which I
mentioned to you, mobile is a

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.380
pretty interesting paradigm.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.480
In fact, if I look at my own
personal behavior, and some of

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.920
the shopping queries that we
see on Google, this is

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.010
increasing at a much faster pace
than any other revenue.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.570
Because users are using shopping
and mobile as the

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.650
primary conduit to
do the shopping.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.380
And at Google, we launched this
application called Google

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.090
Shopper, which essentially
allows you to scan a barcode

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.800
or an image and it will find the
product which matches the

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.770
description or that UPC code.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.740
It will tell you all the
information about it.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.870
How many people have downloaded
Google Shopper?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.420
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.840
So for the rest of you,
please try it.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.460
So, it's a free application and
it's available on both on

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.310
Android and iPhone.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.400
It's pretty cool.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.670
It's shows you the power
of what you can do

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.930
with a mobile device.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.430
This is something which is my
personal favorite, which is

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.350
mobile meets local.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.600
We went from desktop-based
shopping, to a canonical

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.800
product, to mobile, and then
this is the ultimate nirvana

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.010
where now, I can not only search
that product, but it

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.330
tells me precisely that this
item is available on these

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.940
stores near me.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.630
And in fact, we get-- and this
is why the API is important--

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.510
we get this real time inventory
feed from all these

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.160
retailers so we can precisely
tell you whether this item is

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.950
on the shelves at that
store or not.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.420
Because the opposite of it is,
you find a product, you like

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.170
it, you drive to a store,
and guess what?

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.355
That item is not available.

00:07:34.355 --> 00:07:36.980
And I call that phenomenon
anticipointment.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.920
I kind of felt this anticipation
like, I got the

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.900
product, I want to buy it.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.970
You walk into the store.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.720
It's not there and you
get disappointed.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.940
We wanted to make sure we
avoid that phenomenon of

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.210
anticipointment, and wow the
users by giving them this

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.770
perfect information and giving
them this assurance that this

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.090
item is actually on the shelf
right now in a store near you.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.450
And then last, but not the
least, you can obviously click

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.150
on Get Directions and it will
guide you to that store.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.360
What can be better than that?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.560
And this is really changing how

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.850
people think about shopping.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.050
Because back in the days,
there was this clear

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.090
distinction between what was
online shopping and what was

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.000
shopping at the store.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.810
The reality is that there
is no such distinction.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:16.950
These worlds are merging.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.270
A lot of times users will walk
into the store, but complete

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.000
the transaction in
the online world.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.920
Or vice versa, which is a more
common scenario, they will

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.090
start their research online but
finish their transaction

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.150
at a physical store.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.150
And there are various reasons
why they do so.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.990
And as a retailer, as an
e-commerce website owner, you

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.090
want to make sure that you give
the best choice to the

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.130
consumer, and let them
pick what's most

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:39.842
convenient for them.

00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:42.620
And this kind of local shopping
and mobile blends

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.840
these two worlds perfectly.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.030
So what are Google's shopping
APIs and how does it relate to

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.910
all the innovations that I
showed you on google.com?

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.290
So the shopping APIs
are essentially

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.110
divided into two segments.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.300
So this is kind of my style
of drawing a simple

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.520
architectural diagram.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.810
So bear with me as I try to
walk you through very bare

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.090
bones components here.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.330
But if you look at the heart
of it, we have something

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.680
called Google Merchant Center,
which is our webmaster kind of

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.200
tools for uploading
data to Google.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.260
How many people are aware of
Google Merchant Center?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.430
OK, so this is pretty good.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.760
It looks like at least
half of the audience.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.750
But for those of you who are
not developers, Google

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.260
Merchant Center is our simple
dashboard where you, as a

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.650
developer, or if you're working
for a retailer, can

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.780
interact with it to upload the
items that you but sell on

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.220
your website or in a physical
store near you.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.560
And what you see at the bottom
of this slide is

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.780
two different avenues.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.970
So you can either upload
this data, what we call

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:44.790
Product Data Feed.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.730
These are simple XML or Excel
files, and you can simply go

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.930
to the Merchant Center and
click File Upload,

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.435
and upload that file.

00:09:52.435 --> 00:09:54.460
Or you can use this new
API, which is the

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.190
Content API for shopping.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.900
This API has much more tighter
libraries, that's much more

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.230
easier for a developer to
program against them and

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.150
integrate back into
your system.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.550
Also the Content API
allows you to do

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.750
more incremental updates.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.050
So one of the most common
requirements we see is to

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.180
update price and inventory,
right?

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.090
During the day, a retailer
changes its

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.370
price multiple times.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.350
If you change your price from
$60 to $49, you want to make

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.780
sure that that price is updated
within minutes.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.820
So the Content API allows you to
do that, as well as, if you

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.990
run out of the stock with some
item, you can do so without

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.470
uploading your entire
inventory.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.730
We can make those fine grained
incremental updates.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.370
So we're going to talk a lot
about Content API today.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.070
But at this point, I just wanted
to give you a high

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.980
level overview.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.200
And then, on the client site,
obviously, I showed you a lot

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.940
of innovations on google.com,
which is the box Google

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.540
Shopping represents.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.870
But what's more interesting,
you can take those same

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.600
innovations and power search on
your own e-commerce site.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.630
So we have an API called Search
API for Shopping, which

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.740
allows you to take a lot of
innovations that are happening

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.440
on Google to power
the e-commerce

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.140
experience on your website.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.280
And also, that API allows you to
monetize the data inventory

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.880
feed here at Google.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.600
So you can be a publisher,
what we call, at Google,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.080
Affiliate Networks.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.540
So you can be an affiliate on
the Google Affiliate Network

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.700
and publish some of
these items. And

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.790
this applies to anybody.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.090
You don't need to
be a retailer.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.180
If you're a website owner,
blogger, or publisher, you can

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.090
leverage that API to monetize
your website better.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.530
So we're going to talk about
both of these APIs in a lot

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.300
more detail, and these
other two components.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.240
But at this point, let me
introduce to you, a colleague

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.120
of mine, Ali.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.990
And he's going to take
you through the

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.250
details of Content API.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:41.800
Ali?

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.810
Thank you.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:44.770
ALI AFSHAR: Thank you, Nitin.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.470
Hello everyone.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.480
Thanks for coming.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.420
As Nitin he said, I'm an
engineer working in Zurich on

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.010
the shopping APIs.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.690
I work for Developer Relations,
and really, my goal

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.977
is to help people use the APIs
and make sure that they're

00:11:56.977 --> 00:11:58.440
successful with them.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.660
So let's start.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.060
Well, hopefully, Nitin's
explained this, but I just

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.680
want to recap who should
be using the

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.240
Content API for Shopping.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.020
Well anyone who sells anything
online, firstly, and that's so

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.300
that people can find your
product when they search on

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.000
google.com and Google
Product Search.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.800
That's the first thing.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.170
And secondly, as he's told you,
and the research shows,

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.770
that people do research their
purchases online even if they

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.430
going to purchase offline.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.340
So for that reason, if you
sell things offline, you

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.040
should have your products in
Google Shopping, using our

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.070
Content API.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.740
So that equates to retailers.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.700
If you are a retailer, anyone?

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.690
If you work for a retailer, if
you write software that a

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.310
retailer uses, ERP systems,
online shopping systems, this

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.080
is an API you should, in my
opinion, be interested in.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.170
Right.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.720
Let's start from the
very beginning.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.480
I'm sorry if this is all very
basic information, but I just

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.750
want to make sure everyone's
on the same page.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.870
So they're HTTP-based APIs, in
the same way that your web

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.780
browser is.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.760
And we have a resource and
that resource has a URI

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.460
associated with it.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.330
We make a request that's
identical to a web request.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.840
That can be any one of the verbs
that we have, get, post,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.130
put, delete.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.040
There are others, but those are
the important ones we'll

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.800
be looking at today.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.330
And we get a response back, and
that response can contain

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.520
the data in any of the data
formats, such as JSON and XML,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.590
which are the ones were going
to be using today.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.660
So if you're familiar with
RESTful APIs, if you've heard

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.470
of the concept REST, this is
all going to be a bit more

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.210
obvious for you.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.790
But essentially, we have
resources, we make requests,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.420
and we get responses back.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.000
What is the data format like?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.170
Well, I said it was either
XML or JSON.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.280
And you do have a choice
with this API whether

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.560
you use XML or JSON.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.790
The default format is XML, for
this API and that really suits

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.440
the more enterprisey feel.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.070
Enterprises like using XML.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.010
It's built on GData and the Atom
Syndication Format, so

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.450
that we have a feed, corresponds
to a list of

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.130
products, and an Atom
entry corresponds to

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.360
an individual product.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.000
And inside there, we have the
various products attributes.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.710
You can see there the title,
the Atom title.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.820
And this is for an army knife,
a Swiss Army knife.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.590
I live in Zurich so we
know our knives.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.740
And you can repeat some elements
in that, so that's a

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.800
very high overview of that.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.020
And we'll look at the individual
data model.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.910
So each product we have, each
product you give us, you send

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.430
to us, is uniquely identified
by those four components you

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.920
see there: the channel by
which you're selling

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.890
it, which is online.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.580
EN there, which is the language,
the country, U.S.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.040
and your SKU, your individual
code for that.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.620
So those four components are
stuck together to make the

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.370
unique ID for the product.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.290
That's worth knowing.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.790
Why?

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.400
Because if you upload the same
product for a different

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.590
country, or the same product
with a different language,

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.110
that's regarded by our system
as a different product.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.640
So inside that product, we
have various attributes.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.500
I've only got the title
one up there.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.590
And each product can belong
to a number of product

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.270
categories.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.160
And we provide a taxonomy
for that that is fairly

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.980
comprehensive, so it should
cover all your product needs.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.730
As you'll see, we recommend
you use all of these.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.530
The schema itself.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.080
We have created a new namespace,
a couple of

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.680
namespaces to add on to the Atom
namespace to extend what

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.240
you can see.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.410
The title is the
product title.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.170
The content is the product
description.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.680
The link is the link to
the product page.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.090
That's really important.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.410
We don't host your product
information.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.030
We require a link from you--

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.190
a URL--

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.020
to a place where people can see

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.340
information about that product.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.450
Now typically, you know what
I'm talking about.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.710
There's an image there, there's
the price there, you

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.390
can click, Add to Cart, and
some product information.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.720
But we really require that.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.190
And then there are
some individual

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.830
elements for our API.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.380
So the target country, that
comprises part of

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.130
the ID that I said.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.330
The content language,
that's the language

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.920
of the content element.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.250
The condition, we do require you
to tell us the condition

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.110
of the product, new, used,
or refurbished.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.390
Information about the price,
including currency, and some

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.410
images, or one or more images.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.830
We do ask for one high quality
image, at least. So those are

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.570
the important required
elements.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.000
There are many more, 30 or 40,
and they're well documented.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.230
You can see the links
afterward.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.460
Right.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.760
Before I show the actual request
and response, I want

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.685
to give you some tips for
getting your products higher

00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:50.450
in the ranking, OK?

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.700
This is really important and
they're all really, really

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.420
common sense.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.250
So you're saying, oh, but
that's common sense.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.240
But actually, if you do all of
them, it will significantly

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.760
improve your rankings.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.130
So firstly, fill out as many
fields as you can.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.400
Our user of this product, Google
Shopping, google.com,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.619
is the person trying
to find something.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.710
So it's me trying to buy a
digital camera, or it's you

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.800
trying to buy something that
you want, a bicycle.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.829
Those are the users and we're
really keen, at Google, to

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.220
give users exactly what
they're looking

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.210
for, the best data.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.050
And we can give them that data
if you give it to us.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.960
So firstly, fill out as many
fields as you can.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.820
Secondly, use good
quality images.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.270
People love looking at stuff.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.400
We all love looking at stuff,
and if you can see something,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:36.990
you're going to buy it.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.620
That's a really, really strong
motivator to actually buy it.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.730
We do check that the images you
give us do exist. We do

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.970
check that the product pages do
exist. We do check that the

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.720
prices on the product page is
accurate to the information

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.710
that you sent us.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.910
And if there are discrepancies
with those, that can adversely

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.680
affect your rankings.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.170
Product identifiers.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.490
I very briefly mention
this here.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.440
Books have ISBN numbers,
products have UPC codes, and

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.530
more recently there is
a g10 Code that is

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.440
used by both of them.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.550
It's a generalization
of both of them.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.540
Now if you give us these
identifiers, then we can

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.080
accurately place your products
on one of those catalog pages.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.160
So we know that the digital
camera is the exact same

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.880
digital camera, and that will
put you in that catalog page.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.990
And also, it's very good for
your rankings as well.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.920
Product categories.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.410
People do like to search
by category.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.400
They do like to browse
products by category.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.880
And if you use our taxonomy,
then we can provide the

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.980
results when people are
looking for them.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.330
Again, it's all about the users,
all about the person

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.510
who's looking.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.920
So if you give us the
information, then we can index

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.330
it accurately.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.670
Good titles and good
descriptions.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.000
This is my favorite one.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.070
Don't write your titles
in all capitals.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.360
Use good punctuation.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.750
Ensure they're well spelled.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.750
We do check all of these things,
and again, we want to

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.060
give the user a good
experience.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.990
So we don't want to show them
all capitals, so we won't.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.340
And the last one is
more general.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.440
Include information about
tax and shipping.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.550
I've had the same experience.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.610
If I don't know how much tax I'm
going to pay on a product,

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.750
I just won't even consider
buying from that site.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.650
If I don't know how much it's
going to cost to get it sent

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.220
to me, I won't even consider.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.390
And it's so important.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.450
If you noticed, on Nitin's
demonstration, with all the

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.190
merchants, alongside reviews,
it had tax and shipping

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.680
information.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.570
It's that important that we
want to show that to users

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.450
immediately, because it
can affect where they

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.850
decide to buy from.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.440
So those are my tips.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.220
If you want to discuss
any of them in detail

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.070
with me, please do.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.160
I'm around all day today
and tomorrow.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.680
So let's get on to
the actual API.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.730
You saw there was a resource
in that that had a URI.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.610
There two types of resource
we use, mainly

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.170
for our Content API.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.010
The first one is the
product endpoint.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.050
Now that is used for any
operation which is general for

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.610
all the products
of a merchant.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.330
For example, if you want to
insert a product that's not

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.100
specific to a single product,
and so we would use this

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.130
endpoint, or to retrieve a list
of all your products.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.380
Now that's made up of a few
bits, the root URI.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.860
That's the URI of the API.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.060
Then the merchant ID is only
one, two, three, four, five,

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.300
and all merchants who have
signed up for the Merchant

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.170
Center have an ID.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.510
The path and then
the projection.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.160
I won't be talking about
the projection.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.020
It's an advanced option
on how we return some

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.510
extended parts of XML.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.520
You can read about that, and
again, that's something I can

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.720
talk to you about individually
if you're interested.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.070
So that's the product
endpoint.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.950
That's where we send any request
which is general for

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.640
the merchant.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.390
The second endpoint is a
specific endpoint for every

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.740
single product.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.130
It's identical up until the
point where we add on the end,

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.130
the four part product ID that
I spoke about earlier.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.840
So you can see, it's joined
by [? curl lines ?]

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.950
and it's made up of those four
segments that I spoke about.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.600
And when will we use
this endpoint?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.100
Well, if we have a specific
product operation, if you want

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.150
to update the information,
if you want to delete the

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.610
information, this is the
endpoint we'd use.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:20.240
So what we have online, is
it's an [? arguable ?]

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.320
code site, is an interactive
demo of this API.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.010
Now I find that the best way for
someone to get their feet

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.040
wet, to warm themselves
up with the API.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.940
What it allows you to do is,
enter your values, either in a

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.560
form, or as raw XML.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.920
You make the request and, I
don't know if you can see with

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.720
the resolution, but as I say,
I strongly recommend all of

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.950
you to go and try this.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.770
It shows you the request you
make and then the response.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.790
All I've done is-- because you
can't see this too well--

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.180
taken some segments out of
here so we can talk about

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.510
them, specifically.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.770
You'll see the link
for that later.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.610
Please use it.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.650
It's really useful.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.380
So the first thing we want to
do is create a new product,

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.290
upload a product to
Google Shopping.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.270
And this is probably the
most common use case.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.070
How do we do that?

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.580
Well, we make a POST request, so
inserting products, always

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.130
a POST request. And we make it
to the product URI, the feed

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.380
URI for that merchant.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.110
You can also see that we pass
a couple of extra headers.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.350
The first one is the
authorization header.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.510
Now, all requests for this
need to be authorized.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.040
We're using AuthSub here, but
it supports all of our

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.190
authorization methods.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.080
And they're talking about OAuth
and OAuth 2 here at the

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.550
conference.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.610
So if you're interested in that
part of it, please go and

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.765
have a look at that.

00:22:37.765 --> 00:22:40.270
But all requests need to be
authorized because we can't

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.270
let anyone just manage
your information.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.170
And the last one is the
Content-Type, and we're using

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.420
application/atom+xml.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.700
And this is what the body of
the request looks like.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.950
So first thing you notice,
well, it's XML and we've

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.820
encoded it as UTF-8.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.220
Please feel free to encode it
as whatever you like as long

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.020
as it's UTF-8.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.370
No, no, as whatever you like.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.630
And then you see the entry
element that we have. We've

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.840
got a few namespaces.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.410
I've left some out for brevity
and I've actually left out

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.510
some required fields here.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.080
So what you would have is
slightly bigger than this.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.830
But you can see the title, the
Content-Type text, the SCID

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.490
element, which is the SKU, the
condition element, the price,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.990
which has the units
of currency.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.410
The unit is required, and then
some tax information.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.740
Now tax is specifically
localizable.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.710
You can say, I want the tax in
California to be such and

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.200
such, or I want the tax in the
zip code to be such and such,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.830
or in this city to be
however you like.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:44.510
So you can specify arbitrarily
complex tax rules there.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.600
And what do we get back?

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.780
Well, we've just sent
the product.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.790
We've created a new product.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:50.320
Brilliant.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.060
And so we get back a
201 response, which

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.510
means you've created.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.320
This is interesting.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.090
From a REST point of view, not
only have we created a new

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:02.400
product, we've created a new
REST resource, a new place

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.940
where you can do stuff.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.360
And so we get back
in the headers--

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.080
a location header which shows
us our new resource

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.860
with our new URI.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.692
So you can store that and use
that if you want to update the

00:24:15.692 --> 00:24:17.910
information later.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.820
And with that, we get a response
back that is an echo

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.890
of our original request. So it
tells us that the fields we've

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.710
added have been successful.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.450
And with a few others added,
such as, the published, which

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.250
tells us that it's been
published and the date and

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.660
time, the APP edited,
that's the Atom

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.690
Publishing Protocol namespace.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.080
I've added here a couple of
elements that weren't in the

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.110
original POST request, which we
would have needed to have.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.990
And there you see, really
important, the link REL equals

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.130
alternate element that is the
landing page for this product.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.880
This is the page that
people would go to.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.690
So that's inserting products,
I think the

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.070
most common use case.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.350
As you'll see, you
can use this for

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.990
updating products as well.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.800
But I'm just going to show you
how to update a product.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.630
Now this time, instead of doing
a POST request, we do a

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:10.140
PUT request to the specific
product URI, which is there,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.690
and the same as the product URI
we just got back when we

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.740
created it.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.820
Again, it needs to be authorized
and we need to

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.750
provide the Content-Type
header.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.720
We send exactly the same body,
but it's not exactly the same

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.565
because you might be keen, and
notice that I've gone on sale

00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:27.480
and I've reduced my
price slightly.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.270
So if I want to update a
product, I send exactly the

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.800
same as I would to insert
a new product with the

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.900
additional information, but
this time I send it to the

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.760
specific product URI with
a PUT request. And

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.160
we get back a 200.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.430
We haven't created
anything new.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:44.380
We've just updated.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.530
It's just a simple 200 with,
again, the information that we

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.600
echoed and we got back.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.940
The third important use case
is deleting products.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.970
Well, that's really easy.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.850
We don't send anything,
you really you get

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.680
anything back, as a body.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.430
You just send a delete request
to the specific product

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.030
endpoint, and you just get
the response back.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.300
And that's how you
delete a product.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.060
One of our most important
features for this API is that

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.000
we support batch processing.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.990
Now a batch is a set of
operations, each one with a

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.970
project associated with it.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:25.090
So by operation, I mean you can
insert product A, you can

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.250
update product B, you can
delete product C.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.330
So each product in a feed
comes with an operation.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.340
And the advantage of that is you
can put, firstly, hundreds

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.640
in a single request. And so you
just saved the amount of

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.850
requests you have to make.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.990
And that can go up to a megabyte
in size which is

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.840
gzipped, so we'll see a little
example of that.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.620
But if you're like most
merchants-- and most merchants

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.320
don't have 10 or 15 products,
they have hundreds and

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.010
hundreds of thousands
of products.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.650
Some merchants here
have hundreds

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.620
of millions of products.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.320
So if you batch them, that's
really advantageous for you

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.730
because you make
fewer requests.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.750
Also say we get individual
responses for each batch

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.640
operation, so you will know
which ones succeed and you

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.940
will know which ones fail, and
you will get the error

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.370
information that you need.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.710
Let's have a look at one.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:21.080
All batch requests are a POST to
the batch URI, which is the

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.640
product feed with the
word batch attached

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.210
on the end of it.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.950
So they're all POSTs, it doesn't
matter what kind of

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.690
operation, because you will
specify the type of operation

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.925
in the entries themselves.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.750
And here's a batch body with
just one operation in there,

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.750
so imagine there could
be hundreds in there.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.470
Again, it's a feed at the top
level and its a simple entry

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:46.590
exactly like our other entry.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.140
And my laser light is gone.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.270
You can see then there's
the batch element.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:56.580
And that batch element has
an operation type and

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.090
that type is insert.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.070
So this will insert this
product, if we send the batch.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.820
And when we send the batch,
we're always going to get a

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.190
200 back, even if we send a
hundred operations that were

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.860
all complete garbage and none
of them succeeded, we will

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.370
still get a 200 back because the
batch itself did succeed.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.980
And this is what the response
looks like.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.920
Well, it's identical to our
other responses, but it does

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.560
have the addition, firstly, of
the batch operations that we

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.090
had parsed and then,
importantly, the response code

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.590
for that batch, which, in this
case, is the 201 created,

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.820
identical to the response we
got back when we made the

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.820
insert request. So
that's batching.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.960
I recommend you all use it if
you're uploading products.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.830
We also have real
time updates.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.070
Now, normally, when you upload
a product to Google Product

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.600
Search, it takes a few hours.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.380
You're thinking why, why does
that take a few hours?

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.470
Well, we have to validate it.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.480
We have to make sure that the
page exists, the product is

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.000
accurate, the information is
accurate, because we can't

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.450
risk people putting false
information, or we don't want

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.290
to risk that bad experience
for the user.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.350
So it takes a while to check.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.490
But the really important
information, and that is the

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.660
price and the quantity, as in
your inventory of the stock.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.990
If you change that, we have
a special fast track.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.300
So that means, within--

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.210
I've said five minutes but
it's actually shorter--

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.800
so almost immediately, that
result will be reflected in

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.280
Product Search.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.615
That's really great because as
Nitin said, people like to

00:29:25.615 --> 00:29:27.810
know when the product's
in stock.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.290
In fact, they need to know.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.910
So it gives them the most
accurate information as

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.140
quickly as possible, and people
are more likely to buy

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.310
stuff off you.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.810
We also have other features.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.090
I'm just going to race
through this.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.680
Firstly, inserts for existing
items are updates.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.370
So if you try and insert the
same item twice, and by the

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:50.140
same item, using that four part
ID, the second time won't

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.850
create a new item, it will
merely update the old item.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:58.255
OK, so that's the quickest
way to update an item.

00:29:58.255 --> 00:30:01.510
The difference with a normal
update is that, in a normal

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.110
update, if the product doesn't
exist, you'll get an error.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.360
You can't update a product that
doesn't exist. Whereas

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.310
here, it would just go on and
create the product, so this is

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.290
the quickest way of updating
your product information.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:16.110
We also have data feed API, not
to mention that you can

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.570
upload your products
using data feeds.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.400
It's a bit slower, it takes a
bit longer, but you can manage

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.950
these feeds programmatically.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.770
You can say these are my feeds,
or these are the third

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.680
party feeds who I manage.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.780
Here they are and this is
how you upload them.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.130
Also, we provide aggregator
accounts.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.670
You may have multiple accounts
underneath you.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.410
You may manage multiple
accounts.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.370
And to do that, we have a
specific API that manages

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.160
products for those
subaccounts.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.860
And you can use them for a third
party if that's the kind

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.840
of business, if you're in an
aggregator-type business.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.090
Think of the marketplaces.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.340
Just a little example of when,
just to put it into context.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.110
Now this is the simplest flow
you can have. So you have an

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.190
ERP system.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.590
If you're a normal retailer,
you have an ERP system, but

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.600
when something changes, you send
a notification to your

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.830
module that will handle this,
and that will make a single

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.330
call to the Content
API for Shopping.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.380
You write it once and you just
leave it forever, and for the

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.510
rest of time, your products
will be accurate in Google

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.540
Product Search, all the
time, up to date.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.030
People can find them
and people will

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.700
be able to buy them.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.630
So the Content API for Shopping,
an HTTP-based API

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.480
based on Atom and GData
by default.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.920
Use it to manage your product
data for Google Product Search

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.520
and Google Shopping, easy to
manage data feeds for yourself

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.180
or third parties, and you
can manage subaccounts.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.300
So that's that.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.580
I'll get Nitin back up here to
talk about our other APIs.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:51.820
NITIN MANGTANI: Great.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.450
Thanks, Ali.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.000
Switching gears here a bit.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.990
So, so far you saw a lot of
innovations that were

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.810
happening on Google Shopping and
Ali went into the details

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:06.290
of how can you use Content API
to upload your items to Google

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.710
so that it shows up on various
properties on Google, be it

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:12.490
Shopper, Google Shopping,
and things like that.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.710
I want to switch gears here and
talk about the other side

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.960
of our APIs, which is, once we
uploaded data to Google-- and

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.230
there's so much innovations
happening on Google--

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.770
how can you benefit from those
innovations and power your own

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.510
e-commerce site with the search

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.730
APIs that Google provides?

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.810
The search API that we provide
for that is called Search API

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.910
for Shopping.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.650
And the number one use case for
Search API for Shopping is

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.120
something we call a Google
Commerce Search.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.170
This one is actually
a paid product.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.820
Google Commerce Search, which
allows you to power e-commerce

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.110
experience on your
own website.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.440
Let me show you a live demo to
illustrate what exactly this

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.730
product does, and how shopping
APIs are used.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.850
If I go to one of our customer's
website, this is

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.440
Baby Edge which is a pure-play
online e-commerce website, and

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.020
the search here is powered by
the API, the search API, which

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.360
is based on the items they
uploaded to Google.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.360
For example, if I'm searching
for a stroller, as you could

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.370
see here, we leverage
all the features

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.430
that you see on Google.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.970
So the first thing you see is
search auto-completion.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.760
So we are showing you these
suggestions: strollers for

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.500
babies, strollers
with car seats.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.990
But then, what's more
interesting, you also see

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.290
instant, which is, you're seeing
the actual results even

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.495
before you finish your query.

00:33:30.495 --> 00:33:33.500
So literally, with three or four
keystrokes, we are able

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.460
to predict what the user is
looking for and in subseconds,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.160
show him or her all the
products, with the images, the

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.550
title, as well as the price.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.770
Now you can go ahead and finish
this query or you can

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.270
pick one of these suggestions.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.520
And you can see that, as I'm
altering these suggestions,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.560
the actual search results
are changing.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.350
So this is all real time, kind
of Google Instant, but for

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.930
your own retail website.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.320
At this point, if I hit enter,
I see a much more

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.230
comprehensive search result, so
you see a lot more details

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.530
now, whether this item
is in stock or not.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.450
But what's more interesting
are the things on the

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.340
left-hand side.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:07.770
So [? guests ?]

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.650
of e-commerce, people not only
like to do a search, but they

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.070
like to do more refined
searches.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.230
So it's like I'm looking for a
stroller, but I want the brand

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.280
to be Britax.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.150
So just by clicking on that
brand Britax, you can see now

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.159
all the strollers are only
from the brand Britax.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:26.090
And similarly, you can further
refine and say I'm looking for

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:30.909
a price between $300 to $500,
and now you can see only those

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.905
products where brand is Britax
and the price is

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.219
between $300 to $500.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:40.659
What's cool about this is this
number, 200 milliseconds.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:42.520
Because when you're building an
e-commerce site, the last

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.510
thing you want is it
slows you down.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.820
The technology slows you down.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.440
You want to make sure that your
e-commerce site is not

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.170
only fast, it's interactive.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.199
Think about the experience when
you walk into the store.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.199
What you like about it.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.560
The things you like about when
you walk into a store is,

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.410
somebody is speaking
back to you.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.810
And you want to make sure that
your website is fast enough

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.570
and is interactive.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.180
And that's why we have built
these features like Search as

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.730
you Type and Instant, because
it looks like as if the

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.480
website is talking
back to you.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.150
This is not like a static
website where you're typing in

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.850
your entire query, hitting
enter, and waiting five

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.900
seconds before you see the
first search results.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.780
This is much more interactive,
more real time and this is all

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.300
based on the Search
API for Shopping.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.650
The beauty about this model
here is that, because this

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.760
retailer, Baby Edge, has already
uploaded their data

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.940
items to Google so that it shows
up on Google Shopping,

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.660
they can use that exact same
feed to power search on their

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.570
own website.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.570
And there's a product around
it-- it's called Google

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.850
Commerce Search--

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.610
which provides a lot
more features.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.180
And the actual product itself
is a paid product, but we do

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.540
offer a [? double upper ?]

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.680
API.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.820
It gives you around 2,500
requests per day, so if you

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.390
want to build a quick
application or a prototype,

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.200
you can do it, there's
no charge for it.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.620
But once you use it
for production

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.320
use, it's a paid product.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.840
Let me show you a quick demo to
explain a little bit more,

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.960
because I don't have many slides
on Google Commerce

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.390
Search, but just to
set the stage.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.270
This is one of the demos
we built for you.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.710
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.170
NARRATOR: Since the dawn
of time, people

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.850
have engaged in commerce.

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:32.710
In the Stone Age, cavemen
traded in rocks.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.956
At the height of the Roman
Empire, people

00:36:33.956 --> 00:36:35.204
bartered for chickens.

00:36:35.204 --> 00:36:36.454
Then came [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.680
And finally, online shopping.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.892
This evolution in commerce got
us thinking about the future

00:36:44.892 --> 00:36:49.020
of retail, and that's why we
built the all-new Google

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.781
Commerce Search.

00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:53.100
It's an e-commerce search
solution that makes buying

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:57.371
easy, and selling,
very profitable.

00:36:57.371 --> 00:36:59.540
Here's how it works.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.900
Let's say you run
cavewheelhouse.com, a website

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.400
that sells stone
caveman wheels.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.600
Buyers visit cavewheelhouse.com
to search

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.940
for and purchase wheels.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.380
And with Google's new Search as
you Type feature, they find

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.140
relevant wheels in just
a few keystrokes.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.850
As the wheel merchant, you have
absolute control over the

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.690
search elements the customer
sees on your web page.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.050
You can easily introduce
promotions for discounted

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.190
tricycle wheels, high
performance

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.570
racing wheels, and more.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.530
And have these automatically
displayed when your visitor

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.460
enters a related search query.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.220
You can also designate
banner zones.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.240
You can even collaborate with
your colleague, the wheel

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.090
marketer, and any other
caveman you desire.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.770
The results, wheel enthusiasts
find the exact wheel they're

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.060
searching for, and maybe
even something

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.620
unexpected along the way.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.002
And if you have a cave wheel
house brick and mortar store

00:37:53.002 --> 00:37:55.240
with those items in stock,
Google Commerce Search even

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.810
lets your shopper know
that their items

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.140
are available nearby.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.520
By connecting visitors to
relevant products faster than

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.530
ever before, your business can
sell many more wheels.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.040
Start the next era of your
e-commerce store with Google

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.290
Commerce Search.

00:38:13.315 --> 00:38:13.710
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.740
NITIN MANGTANI: Well I just
wanted to spend a few minutes

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.120
explaining, it's essentially an
e-commerce search platform

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.910
and at the heart of it, it uses
the search API to power

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.930
the complete e-commerce
experience on your website.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:27.380
So whether you are a retailer
with a brick and mortar store

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.220
or you're a pure-play online, or
you just have an e-commerce

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.410
website, and you want to get the
full experience that you

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:37.070
see on Google, you can do so
using this product and the

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.310
actual API.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.160
Let me show you one last thing
before I move back to the

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.360
slides and go into the
details of API.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.710
So let's take one example.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.710
I want to show you what does it
take to build a new search

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.250
engine if you have an
e-commerce website?

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.680
So in this case, Forever 21,
which is one of our customers,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.130
they already upload
data to Google.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.390
So this is Google
Product Search.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:58.510
They're already giving data
feed, and they're actually

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.960
using the new Content API ,
which Ali went on the details,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.410
to upload items to Google.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.800
So these are all items that
Forever 21 has already

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.030
uploaded to Google.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.900
And let's say if they wanted to
build a new search engine

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.480
for their own website, all they
would do is, they would

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.480
go to this wizard, Commerce
Search Creator, they put in

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.010
their name, which is
Forever 21, select

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:21.730
the language, country.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:24.040
This is the ID which we give it
to them, so every merchant

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.930
has a unique merchant ID which
we give it to them.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.490
And this is a developer
key which they enter.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.510
At this point, you can go out
and create the search engine

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.730
and I can finish it.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.720
And basically, once you have
created the search engine, you

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.450
can try any of the
queries here.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:43.280
So if I'm trying, for example,
trousers, this is in real

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.950
time, searching for data that
Forever 21 has already

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.790
uploaded to Google.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.820
So without writing a single line
of code, we can generate

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.060
a basic bare bones e-commerce
search engine for any of the

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.650
retailers that have uploaded
data to Google.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.340
Now you can take the same
template and, obviously, put

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.900
your own styling guidelines,
because you want to make sure

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.520
that it's unique to your taste
and audience and plug it into

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.210
your website.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.020
And what's more interesting is
that, on the left-hand side,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.140
we can actually go
and generate some

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:10.930
code for you guys.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.170
So there's some auto-generation
of code going

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.190
here, which we can
also do that.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.400
Now, at the end result, what
you would see-- and this is

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.950
actually a true example--

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.320
is if I go to forever21.com, and
they actually use Google

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.040
Commerce Search, you can search
for any of these items.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.980
And you can see the UI and the
layout looks different than

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:33.120
what was on that quick demo,
is because they could take

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.440
that code, apply their styling,
and then power the

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.120
experience on their
own website.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.870
And then, obviously, you can
further refine these search

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.680
results, whether you're looking
for knit tops and

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.590
things like that.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.410
And this is, again,
powered by Google.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:48.260
So that's the overview of
Google Commerce Search.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:53.240
I want to talk about one more
use case before I hand it back

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:57.080
to Ali, to go into the details
of the Search API.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.930
The other use case, which is
pretty useful, is Google

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.240
Affiliate Network.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.110
So let's say you are
a publisher.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.590
You have a website or you have
a blog, and you want to

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.100
monetize your website.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.830
One way to do that is that you
can use the data feed from

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:15.870
Google to put the items that
are available from various

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:19.060
retailers and you can,
basically, make money through

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.220
the referral fee.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.050
So if there is a user who
clicks on that item and

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:25.750
actually makes the purchase back
on the retailer's site,

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.550
we share the commission
with you.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.220
And what do you need to
do is two things.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:32.710
You need to sign up to become
a Google Affiliate publisher

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.350
and then you need to request a
key, so that you can place

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.730
these items on your website.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.600
Those are the two
main use cases.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.860
You're either a developer
working with a retailer, or

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.870
you are just a publisher and
you want to monetize your

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.660
website better, you
can do so with the

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.790
Google Affiliate Network.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.790
And as I mentioned to
you, it's relatively

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:51.650
straightforward.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.480
If you do a Google on Google
Affiliate Network, it will

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.630
take you to the details
on how do you sign up.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.690
So with that, why don't I ask
Ali to come back to the stage

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.220
and walk you through the
Search API details.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.330
Ali?

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:09.280
ALI AFSHAR: Thank you
again, Nitin.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:09.560
Right.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.050
The Search API for Shopping.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.290
As Nitin said, you use it to
get product search like

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.170
results in a programmatic way.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:19.640
It's much, much simpler than the
Content API for Shopping.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.610
Firstly, it's only read only.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:23.610
We can't send any information,
we're only getting

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.470
information.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.990
So all operations are Get
requests, and all operations

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.510
go to a single URI resource.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.200
And that URI resource contains,
as part of it,

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.720
again, the merchant ID, so
you're getting products from

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.390
the specific merchant.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:43.330
So all Get requests, all
to the same URI.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.640
The data format this time,
by default, is JSON.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.480
Again, you have a choice, but
the default format is JSON.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.600
Now why is this the case?

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.430
Well, we feel that the
applications that would use

00:42:54.430 --> 00:43:00.000
this API would benefit from a
lighter data format, one that

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.450
would run natively in a
browser, run on mobile

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.670
platforms, and that's the kind
of application that we think

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:06.590
would use this API.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.310
Again, you can use XML
if you want to.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:14.795
The JSON is equivalent to the
XML, so we have attributes in

00:43:14.795 --> 00:43:20.530
the JSON that correspond to
elements in the XML itself.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.230
These are the main attributes,
and you can see there's a big

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:27.070
similarity with the ones we sent
for the Content API: the

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.480
title of the product, the
content, the descriptions, the

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.340
link, the home page
for the product.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.740
The country, that corresponds to
the target country, and the

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.880
language, again, the
content language.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.920
We give all the other
information that you've

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.950
provided, or the merchant has
provided, we give that back,

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.490
too, in the condition element,
the price element,

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.950
any numbers of images.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.690
So it's the JSON format, and
this is just an example of

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:51.800
what it looks like.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:57.020
So I've done a search there
for strollers and I got

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:01.165
513,000 results and this is just
the first one, and I've

00:44:01.165 --> 00:44:02.815
even cut off the description
because it would

00:44:02.815 --> 00:44:05.640
have gone on for ages.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.360
So this is the kind of result
that we get back.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.000
It's just an example.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Now to go through what
Nitin actually did.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.350
We provide options to the API
by providing URI parameters.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.200
Now Nitin's search for a
stroller, I don't know if you

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.380
noticed, s, he typed,
then, s-t.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.650
Now each time he typed a
character, a web request was

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:30.040
being made and they
looked like that.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.060
So the first one was just q
equals s, s-t, s-t-r, s-t-r-o,

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.910
and each time he was getting
a response back.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.210
And that was being rendered in
the page and that's what gives

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.800
the instant results.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.430
So that's how you do
that free text

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.440
search using the q parameter.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.240
We also have structured
search results.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.130
You noticed he did a narrowing
his results down by the brand

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:54.220
Britax, and we have the restrict
by parameter that you

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.790
can pass most of the attributes
that you can have

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.820
in there, and you can restrict
the operation.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.770
So if you want just the Britax
brand, you parse restrict by

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.200
equals brand Britax.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.230
If you just want brand new baby
equipment, it's probably

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:11.500
likely, then you just
parse condition new.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.800
Also we have a method by which
we will rank the results that

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.500
we'll give back to you.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.260
So you don't need to order
them yourself and that's

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.620
useful if there are
500,000 results.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:25.010
But you can rank by price, by
relevance of your results, and

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:28.520
by the date published, in both
directions, so ascending and

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.450
descending.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.490
One really cool feature of this
API is that we provide

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:35.840
results diversification.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.990
When you're doing a search, if
you search for a digital

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.440
camera, you may notice that the
first 50 are all from a

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.450
certain brand, or all from
a certain publisher.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:48.230
This allows us to say, I only
want one result from each

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:51.920
brand, or I only want one result
from each retailer.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.810
And in this case, we pass the
parameter that we want, and

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.000
then the number of results fit
that parameter, so I want one

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.940
result for each brand.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.880
There are actually some other
ways that we can do structured

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.640
search, and that's all
in our documentation.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.110
This is just a quick overview.

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:12.050
And there are other features,
as I say, and these features

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.310
relate to cool Google
stuff that is good.

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:16.380
Firstly, spelling.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.830
So if someone misspells the
product, we pick that up, and

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:23.720
in our results, if you ask for
them, we give back a did you

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.110
mean style thing for the product
they were actually

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.880
looking for, and we give those
recommendations for how it

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.240
should be spelled.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.740
Thumbnails.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.450
Remember I kept saying about
high quality images, why do we

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:36.530
need high quality images?

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.480
Because we create thumbnails
for you.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.830
We create any number of
thumbnails of any size up to

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.960
226 pixels.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.340
We will give them back to you.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.830
So, in your request, you parse
thumbnails equals--

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.300
well I want four thumbnails--

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.350
6,428.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.140
Name them like that and the API
will create them and give

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.010
you links back.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:59.700
Even cooler than that, if you're
doing instant search,

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.630
the thumbnail data will be
inlined in the response.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.570
So all you need to do,
then, is just render

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:05.690
them straight back.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.700
You don't need to make
additional requests to get the

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.310
thumbnails.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:11.830
And that's how you get that
instant result with the

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.600
thumbnail images next to them.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.620
We also provide histograms
so you can get a

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.810
spread of the data.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:22.120
You give us a number of slots,
I want price slots, and it

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.165
will split it up into that
number, let's say 10, and it

00:47:25.165 --> 00:47:27.720
will give you how many products
for each price slot.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.650
That's useful if you want to
compact your prices with the

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.910
whole ecosystem of prices.

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:38.390
We provide field filtering,
which means we don't always

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.050
give back all the fields
in every response.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.570
You can specify which ones you
want and that's useful for

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.450
quick responses where you don't
want the whole 40 line

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:50.870
description, you just want the
title, you just want the

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.120
pricing, you just want
the thumbnail.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.920
So you can specify that.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.080
And like all APIs, if we're
returning hundreds of results,

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.170
we'll give you a way that you
can page the results.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.860
You can get the next hundred and
the next hundred and then

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.090
the next hundred, if that's
what you want to do.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.800
There are other features as well
and, again, they're all

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.570
documented, but it's all about
trying to get the results back

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.970
fast that you can display
them to your users.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.080
So that's the Search
API for Shopping.

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.760
A quicker run-through because
it's a simpler API with just

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.630
the one endpoint.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:20.860
It's, again, HTTP-based.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.750
This time the default data
format is JSON, but you can

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.540
use JSON or XML.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.960
And it loosely, it searches
products programmatically in

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.080
the same way that you would do
if you were on Google Shopping

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.550
or Google Product Search.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.320
You can use it for the Google
Affiliate Network, and you can

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.840
use it for Google
Commerce Search.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.120
That's the Search API
for Shopping.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:40.670
Right.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.230
That's mostly all done.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:43.810
Thanks for bearing with me.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.100
To put my commerce hat on for
a second, I just want to

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.150
discuss the two important
things in business.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:51.080
You guys are into business and
commerce because that's why

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.790
you're here and no
somewhere else.

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.210
So what's the most important
thing in business, anyone?

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.650
Well, obviously, making money.

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.700
So, hopefully, we've shown you
how to make money by driving

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.240
traffic to your site by
uploading products with the

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.680
Content API for Shopping.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.710
The traffic is driven not just
through Google Shopping, it's

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.450
driven through google.com.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:14.090
People would type something in
google.com, and within a

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:16.880
click, they will be on your site
if you use the Content

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.820
API for Shopping.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.780
I'm just going to pause
there that because

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.260
that's really important.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:22.780
OK?

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.110
That's the first thing.

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:26.270
Second most important thing
in business, anyone?

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.470
Making more money.

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:32.730
Thank you very much.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:33.950
I knew someone would know.

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:35.480
So you can make even
more money.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.040
You can improve your conversion
rate by using

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.090
Google Commerce Search.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:41.620
People will find what they're
looking for immediately.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.020
And they will buy it because
you've got a good experience

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.790
and that shows that when
people can find

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.420
stuff, they buy it.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.180
You could make a little
bit, even more

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.380
money if you're a publisher.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.840
If you've got any content, you
can include results, products

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.770
results, on your blog, on your
website, in your application

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.240
that has product-related
stuff.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.420
And you will receive money when
people click on those,

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:01.850
and [? converse ?]

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:02.910
on those.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:05.250
So my most important
things in business.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:07.020
Thank you very much
for listening.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:10.170
We'll take questions, and good
luck with all your ventures.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:13.310
If you do have questions, by
the way, come up to the

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.057
microphone.

00:50:14.057 --> 00:50:15.307
It's really important.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.060
NITIN MANGTANI: So we have 10
minutes or so, for questions,

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.700
so if you guys can
please line up.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.890
Go ahead, [? sir. ?]

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:25.930
SPEAKER 1: Does Google plan
to monetize the shopping

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.420
themselves with ad words?

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.860
NITIN MANGTANI: So the question
is, does Google plan

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.600
to monetize shopping?

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.290
It's actually already
monetized.

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.910
So if you go to Google Shopping,
there is ad words,

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:39.280
just like Google, which
are paid placements.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.750
And then there are organic
results, which are free.

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.740
So we don't charge for Content
API, if you want to upload

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.970
data to Google, but then you
can place ad words on that

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:49.220
result set.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.000
SPEAKER 2: In terms of inventory
information, in

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.120
stock, out of stock information,
and I think that,

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.650
at this point, it's not
a required field.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:01.990
Do you see that becoming
required in the near future?

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.550
NITIN MANGTANI: So those two
things around inventory, one

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.210
is your online availability.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:10.010
So we do want to know whether
this item is out of stock or

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:11.140
is it available?

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.360
And the second part is, your
in-store availability.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.580
So if you have both online
presence as well as in-store

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.510
presence, the in-store
availability is

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:19.620
not a required field.

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.250
In fact, currently it is a
separate API in a feed,

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.910
because it requires a lot more
complexity to give us feed for

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:26.790
all your stores.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.220
You might have hundreds of
stores just in North America.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.580
And that's completely
optional.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.350
We are slowly rolling
that program out.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.630
And basically we can associate
both these feeds together so

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.316
we know that this is you as a
retailer who's giving us both

00:51:40.316 --> 00:51:41.900
those feeds.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.120
SPEAKER 2: But more important
for the online?

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.030
NITIN MANGTANI: Well
it depends.

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:48.630
I think if you have both online
presence them as well

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.770
as a physical store presence,
I think it's in your best

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:53.760
interest to give us your
physical store inventory, too.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.900
Because as I showed you in the
slides, earlier, 90% of the

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.480
revenue is still happening in
the physical stores, and you

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.860
want to get that foot traffic
as well, right?

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.570
SPEAKER 3: OK, I have two
questions, actually.

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:10.710
Sorry.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:15.500
One, the taxonomy for
categories, we have feeds in

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.820
several languages, but I haven't
figured out how to do

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.680
the taxonomy for any language
but English.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.130
Are you doing that translation
behind the scenes or are you

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:28.500
going to release the other
languages eventually?

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.750
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.650
ALI AFSHAR: Use the taxonomy in
English, and then it will

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:35.640
be automatic.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.800
SPEAKER 3: OK, that's good.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.550
ALI AFSHAR: That's the safest
way to do it because certain

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:43.130
products don't translate that
well, certain words that

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:45.870
describe products don't just
translate that well, so use

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:47.290
the English taxonomy.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:47.600
SPEAKER 3: OK.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.080
I apologize to the other
people behind me.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.510
The second question is, for the

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:54.990
individual product updating.

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:58.500
I know, for the batch product
uploading, there's a cap to

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:01.860
the number of products you can
send, both per feed and

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.800
overall for your account.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.620
How does that cap translate to
the individual products?

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.920
Do some disappear when
you upload more?

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.740
Or is there no cap, or what?

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.490
ALI AFSHAR: The short answer is
that almost every operation

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.640
you can possibly do
does have a cap.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.500
We can have caps on, and I can't
go into details, but

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.360
number of products you have
uploaded, number of

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.370
operations, it's all capped
because we don't want to get

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:24.510
spammed, and we don't
want to get

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:26.310
denial of service attacked.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:31.040
But the caps are all
very, very high.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.620
And if you do reach one of the
caps, you can just ask for an

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.040
increase and there's
no problem.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.330
SPEAKER 3: So, you would get
an error response if you

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:38.750
reached a cap of some kind?

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.840
ALI AFSHAR: You get a specific
response, too many operations,

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.790
that's the error message,
so you'll know.

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:46.510
It's unlikely that the small
to medium people will

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:49.340
encounter this, but we're
keen for the data.

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.430
So we're that keen for the
data that we will keep

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.730
increasing your cap if
that's what you need.

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:55.870
We do investigate the use case,
but yeah, you shouldn't

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:56.090
have any problem.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:57.775
NITIN MANGTANI: Yeah, and the
point here of what Ali is

00:53:57.775 --> 00:53:59.620
saying is that we want to
relevate your account and

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.770
understand that indeed, you need
a higher cap, and if you

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:05.980
feel like you should file a
support ticket with our

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.160
operations team, and we'll
look at your application.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.730
Hopefully you're not hitting
that limit right now.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.550
SPEAKER 3: We're hitting
the limit, yes.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.650
Good.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:15.450
NITIN MANGTANI: OK,
well, thank you.

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:17.190
Why don't we take a couple
of questions on that?

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.550
Go ahead.

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.370
SPEAKER 4: Just a question
about the

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:20.410
categories on the left.

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:23.470
Are they customizable, like size
and color and all that?

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.610
NITIN MANGTANI: On your
own websites?

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:25.180
SPEAKER 4: On your
own website.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:25.620
NITIN MANGTANI: Yes,
absolutely.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.080
So we call them facets
or parametric search.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.930
Let's just go back here.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:36.090
What I was showing here, in one
of the demos, the things

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.930
that you see on the left-hand
side, for example, things like

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:42.856
price, brand, these things are
called facets, and they are

00:54:42.856 --> 00:54:44.210
fully customizable.

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:49.870
For example, if you're selling
appliances, you can have a

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:53.060
field on the left-hand side
which is BTU, or convection

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.650
oven, or regular oven,
and things like that.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.550
So you can decide what do you
want on the left navigation,

00:54:57.550 --> 00:54:58.800
fully customizable.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:04.420
SPEAKER 5: You mentioned that
you had to validate the

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.200
pricing information.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.570
Do you guys do it often where
you would come by a couple of

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:10.990
times a day or something like
that, so if we don't give you

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:13.830
the information fast enough, you
may say our information is

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:16.650
invalid and we will decrease our
search rankings, or do you

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.140
have a little buffer
with that?

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:22.140
ALI AFSHAR: The situation you've
describe could happen,

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.980
but the good thing is,
we check again.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.890
So it may not be valid for the
period of time that we

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:29.980
couldn't access the home page.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.360
Or, for example, the
price is incorrect.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.230
So we do recheck, but yeah,
that's a good tip.

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:38.260
Make sure your data
is accurate when

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.140
you upload to us.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.480
NITIN MANGTANI: It's also
good for you, right?

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.280
If you're running a business,
you have a pure-play online,

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.000
or you have a physical store,
as your prices are changing,

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.900
you want the consumers to know
about the change, right?

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:58.030
Most likely the prices, you're
doing some discounting, or

00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:59.160
they're going down.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.900
And in that case, actually it's
in your best interest

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.360
that the consumer knows that
the price went from--

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.390
for this camera, which was
like $199 to $149, right?

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:10.920
And having that discrepancy
leaves a bad taste, both in

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.420
the consumer's thing and
it also disserves you.

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.340
Now there are some instances
which we have seen--

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.680
I'm sure it's not you guys--

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.320
but where people are
purposefully giving us wrong

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.770
data, which know I think
there's a term in the

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:24.550
industry, they call it bait
and switch, right?

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.280
And we definitely want to make
sure that we catch those

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:32.990
issues and we basically disable
those feeds because

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:34.810
that doesn't help the
entire ecosystem.

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:36.430
We want people to be genuine.

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.375
But if it is a technical issue,
a few hours later, we

00:56:39.375 --> 00:56:41.750
are monitoring this, and
we'll notify to you.

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:44.970
And the reason we created this
new Content API is exactly

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:47.470
with that use case in mind.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.880
If you're selling a million
items, and let's say you

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.680
change the price only for 10
items, you don't need to

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.220
upload your entire data
feed for those million

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:56.650
items again to Google.

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:59.890
You can just write a small
program which updates price

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:02.740
for those 10 items, and within
5 or 10 minutes, we would go

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:03.800
and update the price.

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.890
So I highly encourage you, if
you're in a situation where

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.810
your prices are changing within
a day, multiple times,

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:12.190
please leverage Content
API for Shopping.

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:14.960
If your prices don't change,
then feeds are fine.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.940
You can upload once in a day
and we'll take care of it.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.460
SPEAKER 5: Thank you.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.540
SPEAKER 6: Mine is an
interface question.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.040
When you look at the sites
like shopping.com and

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.540
pricegrabber, they're
all laid out in a

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.140
much more usable format.

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:32.980
But when you go to Google
Shopping, things are in

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.840
different places and they're
a little bit wonky.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.860
I'm wondering if the plan is to
work on the interface for

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.240
the consumer.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.530
NITIN MANGTANI: Well,
the Google shopping

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.570
is a consumer interface.

00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:47.600
If you go to Google, you can
type in a query, for example,

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.790
digital camera, or any of the
other queries, and we show the

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:53.630
search results right on
the first page, right?

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:56.780
So we are driving a lot
of value to both

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:57.840
the consumer, right?

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.840
So when a consumer comes to
Google, he or she can have

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.310
multiple intentions.

00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:06.110
Maybe he just wants to do
research on what a digital

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:08.420
camera is and what's
a zoom lens and

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:09.260
some things like that.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.970
Or maybe he wants to buy it.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.010
So we want to show
this information

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:13.580
right here to the consumer.

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.850
Now, at this point, we are
driving a lot of traffic back

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:20.310
to the retailer, but obviously,
we want to give

00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:21.790
them the full information
here.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.740
So this is absolutely tailored
towards both

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.240
consumer and retailer.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.820
As far as usability is
concerned, we do a lot of

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.060
experimentation so, without
commenting on some of the

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.050
other players that you
mentioned, we have our own

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:34.010
usability team.

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:37.390
And we do a lot of research on
what consumers like, and it's

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:38.630
a hard science.

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:42.250
There's no perfect answer, and
that's why we do a lot of

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:42.530
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:45.540
testing, much like you guys
do on your own website to

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:48.670
determine what things appeal
most to the consumers and

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:50.890
tried to tailor our
website around it.

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:52.150
ALI AFSHAR: But having said
that, if you've got any

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:55.840
specific suggestions or
feedback, come and see me

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.170
because we've only got
50 seconds left.

00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:58.900
But come and see me.

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.090
I'll write them down and
I'll take them to

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:00.670
the shopping team.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.090
Thanks.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.230
We appreciate all
your feedback.

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:05.210
NITIN MANGTANI: Well, I think
we are out of time here.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:07.180
I want to thank everyone here.

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:10.160
We are in a very exciting time
here on the commerce and

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.090
shopping in general.

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:14.390
And we want to work with the
broader ecosystem, so whether

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:18.560
you're a developer, a publisher,
or a retailer, we

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.870
absolutely want to
work with you.

00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:21.940
And this is why shopping
APIs are so critical.

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:25.680
As Ali mentioned, we both will
be here as well as we have the

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.330
office hours, so happy to get
more feedback from you,

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:30.080
inputs, and as well
as insights.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.180
So thank you once again.

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:31.740
Enjoy your day.

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.850
ALI AFSHAR: Thank
you everyone.
