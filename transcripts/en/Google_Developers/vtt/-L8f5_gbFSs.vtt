00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:07.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is I/O Live.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.190
You just saw the
developer keynote

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.650
where Jason and team brought
you through the latest updates

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.000
to our developer
products and platforms.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.780
Android, Google Assistant,
the web, material design,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.160
machine learning, Firebase,
and AR core were all discussed.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.250
We now have a few special
guests joining us to summarize.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.770
First up is Dan from the Android
Developer Relations team.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.540
OK, Dan.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.370
There was a lot in
the Android section.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.534
What are your highlights?

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:37.950
DAN GALPIN: I'm really looking
forward to hearing feedback

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.620
from developers around Android
Jetpack and Android Studio 3.2,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.240
all part of our plan to make
Android development easier,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.740
faster, and more testable.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.430
Now, Jetpack builds
on the foundations

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.270
of architecture components
in the support library

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.645
to create an easy to use
toolbox that allows you to craft

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:53.290
a single code base
that runs on almost

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.060
all active Android devices.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.550
Jetpack's work manager
is totally cool.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.430
We've long needed a unified
API for scheduling constraint

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.100
triggered background tasks.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.656
Well, Navigation combines with
Studio's navigation editor

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.280
to visualize and
implement the way apps

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.205
navigate between screens, easing
many developer pain points

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:09.830
in the process.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.410
And Kotlin is so fun to use,
it's more popular than ever.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.880
And Jetpack's KTX extensions
make it even better.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.740
Now, speaking of our
tools, the Emulator

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.190
now starts up super fast
and supports snapshots.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.720
Meanwhile, the
Studio and Play teams

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.720
are rethinking app
distribution with app bundles

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.740
and dynamic delivery,
allowing developers

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.510
to dramatically reduce app size.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.820
And this is important because
the larger your app gets,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.500
the less installs
you tend to get.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.420
By rebuilding your
app as an app bundle,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.324
Google Play's new
dynamic delivery

00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:37.990
will only deliver the
code and resources

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.760
a specific device
needs, and it's

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.650
launching production use today.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.970
And one more thing.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.440
Starting today in
our Dev channel,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.810
Chrome OS will have the
ability to securely run

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.180
Linux apps, which
means you can now try

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.424
Android Studio on Pixelbooks.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:53.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Dan.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.650
Next up is Wayne to talk about
Android Things and Google

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.460
Assistant.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.764
Hey, Wayne, what's your summary?

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:01.180
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
Well, Timothy, it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.580
starts with Android Things
graduating this week

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.160
from developer preview to
1.0, which is really exciting.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.970
We're now ready to create
production devices with updates

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.420
to help developers build secure
internet of things devices.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.490
You can use Android
Studio and everything

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.740
you know about Android
to write code, then

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.280
use our console to push updates
to your fleet of devices.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.930
Jumping over to the
Google Assistant,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.310
we now have over 500
million Assistant

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.130
enabled devices out there.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.810
Every developer
should be thinking

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.030
about an assistant
action as a companion

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.280
experience to your
main app or website

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.700
that users can access
from a smart speaker,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.680
a wireless device, or even
in the car, when they're not

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.600
using their phone or computer.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.340
And you can share state between
your apps and your actions

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.740
easily, personalizing
it for users

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.400
and keeping track of any
subscriptions or purchases.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.130
It's really easy to get
started building with actions

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.830
on Google, using tools
such as Dialogflow,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.530
which uses machine
learning to make

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.730
building conversations easy.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.770
We also introduced
some things to help

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.680
you get lots of people
engaged with your experience.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.710
Action links are hyperlinks
you can use anywhere that point

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.110
directly into your action,
and they make it easier

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.730
to promote your actions.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.680
We have action
notifications that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.050
give you a way to let your
users know about new content

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.270
or features in your
assistant action.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.310
These are particularly
cool because they

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.710
work on a phone or
any assistant device,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.890
even if your users don't have
your Android app installed.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.750
After someone engages
with your action,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.910
you can now use
routine suggestions

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.800
to prompt them to add your
action to their routines,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.440
such as waking up in the
morning or getting to work.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.046
And one last thing
to note is in built

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.800
in intense, which are
a neat way of giving

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.940
the Assistant a deeper
understanding of what

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.100
your action can do so it
can bring you more traffic.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.640
So in summary, lots of
new features, and now is

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.980
a great time to start
developing with our actions

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.650
on Google Platform.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Wayne.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.100
Jumping over to web,
Meggin, tell us more

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.214
about what's been announced.

00:03:57.214 --> 00:03:58.380
MEGGIN KEARNEY: Hi, Timothy.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.570
So excited to be
here at I/O to get

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.910
to meet and talk with
all kinds of developers

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.950
from all over the world.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.890
If you're a web developer or
just curious about the web,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.500
this is the year
to find out more.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.400
One area we're really excited
about is Progressive Web apps.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.050
As you've heard,
Service Worker--

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.959
the API that makes
PWAs possible,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.770
is now supported on
all major browsers.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.030
We're also happy that
Lighthouse launched version 3.0,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.570
as mentioned in the keynote.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.380
Lighthouse analyzes
your site and tells you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.800
how you can improve
your user's experience.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.200
With 3.0, your
performance metrics

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.450
will be even more precise.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.450
Also, I'm personally
very excited about AMP

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.250
and its continued
progress in making

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.560
it easier for developers
to build pages

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.720
that load instantly.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.360
We're introducing
e-commerce experiences,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.170
like a full featured date
picker, search auto-complete,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.380
and web packaging for URLs.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.620
And finally, WebAssembly
now has broad support

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.320
across browsers
and devices, making

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.050
it possible to run high
performance, low level

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.420
code written in many languages.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.515
And that's the web.

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:12.389
Bye.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Meggin.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.409
Jumping over to material design,
Yasmine, what's the latest?

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:19.950
YASMINE EVJEN: Well,
Timothy, there's

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.330
a lot of great updates today.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.057
Material design
is a design system

00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:25.140
that can help you build
beautiful, usable products

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.340
across platforms.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.470
And today, we've expanded
Material with our biggest

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.630
ever update to the
system, including

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.820
a new suite of
tools that help you

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.490
at every stage of the design
and development process.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.852
Material theming is a new
capability of the Material

00:05:37.852 --> 00:05:39.810
system that enables you
to express your brand's

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.080
unique identity using color,
type, and shape consistently

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.460
across your products.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.500
Today, we also released
a suite of tools

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.610
that make it easier to go
from design to implementation.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.090
The Material theme
editor helps you

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.860
create your own
branded Symbol Library

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.940
and apply global style
changes to color, shape,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.040
and typography.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.510
Currently available
for Sketch, you

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.010
can access the
Material theme editor

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.080
by downloading the
Material plug-in.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.850
You can then share
that work easily using

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.400
Gallery, a tool for
collaborating on design work,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.310
getting feedback, and tracking
iterations all in one place.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.470
Optimized for Material,
Gallery generates

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.960
interactive red lines,
developer documentation,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.356
and design parameters
for Material components.

00:06:15.356 --> 00:06:17.730
And finally, we want to make
this all really easy for you

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.550
to build and code, so our open
source material components

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.650
for Android, iOS, the
Web, and Flutter all

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.677
support Material theming today.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.870
Thanks, Yasmine.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.190
Now on to machine learning.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.420
Magnus, what's up with ML?

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.430
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Well, Timothy,
our vision for AI at Google

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.700
is to turn the latest technology
into products that empower

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.590
developers and end users.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.020
We heard about a few new
things, including cloud TPUs.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.140
They are now
available to everyone.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.710
Just head over to g.co/cloudtpu.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.750
AutoML is another exciting area.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.400
It automates the creation
of machine learning models.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.510
Our first widely
available release

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.590
will be AutoML
vision, which makes

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.220
it possible to recognize images
unique to your applications

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.800
without writing any model code.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.510
We're looking forward
to bringing AutoML

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.360
to more machine learning
tasks very soon, as well.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.370
And of course, TensorFlow--

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.500
we recently announced
TensorFlow.js,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.520
which brings machine learning
to millions of web developers

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.820
through JavaScript.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.150
You can also create new models
in the browser, or as well

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.370
on the server side,
through null.js.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.323
Also, models can be run
with a webGL acceleration.

00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:27.150
Oh!

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.790
And we brought TensorFlow
to Edge devices,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.610
including Android
and iOS mobile phone,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.660
with TensorFlow light, which
also now supports Raspberry Pi.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.380
In addition, we
released ML Kit in beta.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.150
ML Kit is an SDK that
brings Google's machine

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.270
learning capabilities to mobile
developers through Firebase.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.590
And speaking of Firebase, I'm
sure you'll want to hear more

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.129
from Jen about this topic.

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:54.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Magnus.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.322
Hey, Jen, let's talk Firebase,
and of course, ML Kit.

00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:00.780
JEN PERSON: In the
past few months,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.380
we've brought Crashlytics,
Fabric's flagship crash

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.240
reporter into Firebase.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.400
With the combination of
Crashlytics, performance

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.350
monitoring, and
Google Analytics,

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.050
Firebase really helps you
better understand and improve

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.220
your apps.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.240
I'm also really excited about
how we've been introducing ML

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.600
to Firebase.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.940
One example is with
Firebase Predictions,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.220
which predicts the future
behavior of your users,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.110
allowing you to take proactive
actions to optimize your app.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.610
This is something that can be
useful for a variety of things

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.570
like A/B testing, sending
offers to specific users,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.309
and changing the
difficulty of a game,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.809
depending on users'
retention levels.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.944
And of course, as
Magnus mentioned,

00:08:38.944 --> 00:08:41.659
ML Kit is now available
in public beta.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.840
With it, we're bringing
ML tech from across Google

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.580
and making it available to
mobile developers for Android

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.920
and iOS.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.470
My favorite API
is image labeling,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.990
which helps identify
objects like trees, dogs,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.610
and Google I/O attendees.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.215
And since ML Kit is
available through Firebase,

00:08:59.215 --> 00:09:01.850
it's easy to take advantage
of the rest of the Firebase

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.480
platform, like storing your
image labels in Cloud Firestore

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.680
or experimenting with
different custom models

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.730
using A/B testing.

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:12.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Jen.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.850
OK, one more topic.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.934
Hey, Fred, let's talk
about augmented reality.

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:19.350
FRED SAUER: You
know, I first want

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.600
to start by saying I
think augmented reality is

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.510
one of those really exciting
advances in mobile computing.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.360
It allows us to all interact
with digital content

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.370
and information in the
context of the real world.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.420
And we can do it on
the devices that we

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.810
have with us every single
day in our pockets.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.074
At least most of us do.

00:09:37.074 --> 00:09:38.490
Well, there's kind
of three things

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.530
I want to highlight
from the keynote,

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.810
all about AR Core, which
is Google's platform

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.570
for building the augmented
reality experiences.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.240
First, we heard
about Scene Form.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.580
It's a brand new 3D framework,
physically based render that's

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.326
optimized for
mobile, and it really

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:53.700
makes it easy for
Java developers

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.490
to build augmented
reality applications.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.250
The SDK has everything that
you need, as a developer,

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.680
to start building those
3D experiences right

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.987
into your apps.

00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:05.070
There's an Android Studio
plug-in that's currently

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.760
in beta, and that helps
you important preview

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.450
3D assets right
in Android Studio,

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.000
and works with your workflow.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.270
We also heard about
augmented images.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.650
That makes it possible to attach
digital content and experiences

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.900
to images in the real world.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.640
And I went to images.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.810
It doesn't just detect images,
but it lets you continuously

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.170
attach content appropriately,
because it gives you

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.781
the precise location,
orientation of those images,

00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:36.030
and then you, as a developer,
place your content right

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.080
where you want it.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.350
And then finally, we
heard about Cloud Anchors.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.917
Air Course Cloud
Anchors are just--

00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:45.000
I think they're really
exciting because they allow

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.110
multiple devices to have
a shared understanding

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.940
and context of the real world.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.600
So multiple users can get
together on their phones,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.480
and they can see and interact
with the same digital content,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.430
and it's all anchored to the
world in exactly the same way.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.680
Now, Cloud Anchors are
available for Android and iOS,

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.210
so developers can build those
cross-platform, shared AR

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.430
experiences that we
all want to have.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.960
And of course, all
of these AR Core

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.240
features-- they're
available for use today.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:15.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Fred.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.590
All right, everyone.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.089
Your first sessions
will be starting

00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:19.089
at the top of the hour.

00:11:19.089 --> 00:11:20.880
Remember to stay with
us after your session

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.415
ends to get your first look
at the sandbox with Lorena.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:25.290
She'll be taking you
over to the Android Dome

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.056
to see what's new with
Android TV and Android Play.

00:11:28.056 --> 00:11:31.165
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is I/O Live.

00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:35.205
