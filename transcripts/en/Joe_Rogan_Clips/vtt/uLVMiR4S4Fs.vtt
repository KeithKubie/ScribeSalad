1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.730
You did thrown the guy who many people,

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:06.870
including me were saying as of is a very good argument for the best welterweight

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:11.340
ever.
I felt like Tyron is like,
you gotta give it,
there's like two does,

4
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.570
legendary status,
right?

5
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.410
There's like Matt Hughes has legendary status for being the original.

6
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:20.370
He was one of the first wrestlers who really knew who to submit guys and then

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.730
George St Pierre was of course many people's eyes.

8
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.030
The greatest of all time in the welterweight division went on this long run,

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.020
but I was like,
man,
when you,
if Tyron beats ooze,
mono is like,

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.190
there's a real good argument for him being number one of all time beaten.

11
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.340
Wonderboy beat smashed and Darrin tail beaten.

12
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:41.430
Damien Maia knocking out Robbie Lawler to win the title.

13
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.930
<v 1>Absolutely.
I considered him.
I put him in that conversation.</v>

14
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.680
Now he's in that conversation for sure.
For sure.
I put them in that conversation.

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.340
I ain't know nothing but respect for tiring.

16
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.130
<v 0>It was nice to see afterwards.
It was,</v>

17
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:59.110
there's a video of you and Tyrons mom and tiring and Tara's mom after it is a

18
00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:00.040
beautiful video.

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.320
<v 1>Yeah,
man.
It's a tear jerker I freaking,</v>

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.870
I let it go cause I'm one of those guys,

21
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:09.710
I never really sit and stop and smell the roses and things like that.
I always,

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.190
I always have a chip on my shoulder and I'll explain why that is.

23
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:16.970
But I always had this chip on my shoulder with everything that I do.

24
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:20.390
So I never really sit and celebrate and say,
Oh yeah,

25
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:24.740
I accomplished this or I did that or did that.
But I had known,

26
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:29.180
I known his mom.
I've met her previously to to that,
the fights.

27
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.760
I fought in Saint Louis one time,
man,

28
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.190
of course I'd seen her several times at his fights,

29
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:39.191
but I'll have fighting in Saint Louis and I was there early and she was at the

30
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:43.910
hotel tire,
wasn't fighting or anything,
but she just came to the hotel.

31
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:47.840
I think she was just hanging out and I got to sit with her before,

32
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.450
like all the fighters even came into town.
I had to sit with her.

33
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:54.770
I think we sat for a couple of hours,
maybe three,
four hours just talking.

34
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.490
I got to know her and she was,
she was just such an angel,

35
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.280
but at the same time,
she's,
she's a gangster to like you can,

36
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.450
you can,
you know,
she sees everything.
And the only thing,

37
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.170
the biggest thing I could compare it to is if you ever seen that show for way

38
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:16.070
backs called touched by an angel,
and I forget what her name is.

39
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:18.700
She's like the famous like black actress.
And um,

40
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.070
do you remember that woman's name?
I forget her name.
What does that my Angelo,

41
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.660
it was,
it wasn't,
no,
it wasn't my Angela,
it was that late.
I mean,

42
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:30.290
she was my Angela status,
how big as she was and inspirational.

43
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:35.030
But that's Kinda what I compare her too.
And so we got,
we got,

44
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.750
you know,

45
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.430
I knew her and Tyron obviously wasn't who I would have chosen to take the belt

46
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:44.690
from,
but is how long can you hold yourself back?

47
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.110
Because being a chain,
there's a huge entire sent himself.

48
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.670
There's a huge difference between being a challenge and a champion.

49
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.650
And of course I,
I need,
I needed to have my family in that,

50
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.270
that argument.
I,
I need,

51
00:02:56.271 --> 00:03:00.760
I need to get them to that status to where now setting my daughter up and I'm

52
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.590
setting everyone up for,
you know,
life better,
life forever.

53
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.380
And I couldn't continue to hold that back.
So yeah,

54
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.590
it was unfortunate that I had to take that from him and I kind of,
in a sense,

55
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.520
I felt like I was taken away from what he was doing for them.

56
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.630
So when I saw her walking backstage,
I just couldn't control it.
I just let,

57
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.710
I just let go and I just couldn't help but cry on her shoulders

58
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.070
<v 0>does a great,
it's a great video.
What is,
her name was women's actresses.
Roma.</v>

59
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.320
Downey ramen.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's right there.

60
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.000
The video is amazing cause she's hugging you and she's telling you

61
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:36.160
congratulations and she's telling you that they're coming,

62
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.160
they're going to be coming for you.
So train hard.
Yeah.

63
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.280
And just like her attitude,
man.
It's,
it's beautiful man.
It's,

64
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.220
it's amazing her character that she handled that,
I mean this is her baby.

65
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.280
Her baby just lost and lost every round and it was a pretty dominant victory by

66
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:58.411
you and for her to treat you that way afterwards just shows amazing character.

67
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.430
Yeah,
it's,
there.
It is right here.
You can see it up here.
Look at her.

68
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.260
She's embraces you.
Open arms.
It's all good.
It's all good baby.

69
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.980
Look at that.

70
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.780
<v 2>Oh
amazing.</v>

71
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.280
That's an amazing woman right there.
All work for a couple of phone calls.

72
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.000
So you take it too.
It's all good.
Wow.

73
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.110
<v 0>That's amazing man.
Yeah.
And even tiring the way tire and hit.
It's crazy,
right?</v>

74
00:04:30.111 --> 00:04:33.930
It makes me cry.
So I'm in the air over here.
I got to do it.

75
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.450
I got it made me cry when I saw it.
It's making me cry now.
Yeah,
man.

76
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.930
And the way she treated tire and to the same thing.
I mean,
she's just,

77
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.780
<v 1>that's,
and that's,
that's kind of,
that's how my mom is to that.</v>

78
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.860
So I felt such a connection to that to her because my mom is the exact same way.

79
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.330
My mom would've done the same thing to tire it.
And um,
it just,
it was powerful,

80
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:01.980
man.
It was moving.
And because it's,
and it goes to a test to how,

81
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.450
how the sport has,
how bay the sport is as well.
Yeah.
Like it's not all man,

82
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.530
it's just a regular fight.
You guys hate each other and you're fighting.
No,

83
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:12.750
this was a competition.
Yeah.
You know,

84
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:17.070
this was two men that went in there too for a competition and one guy,
one.

85
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.660
And you know,
you saw the aftermath.
They see the family receive each other.
Yeah.

86
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.350
<v 0>I love that man.
They love when people put all that bullshit aside.
I mean,</v>

87
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:30.430
you guys had a lot of trash talk at the press conferences and there was a lot of

88
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:30.821
that going on,

89
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:35.080
but that sells tickets and it's good for everybody and it's natural and normal.

90
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.640
But after it was over the,
it was nothing but respect.
