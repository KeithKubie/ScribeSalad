Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And I'm just checking in on you. I'm just checking in here. Sorry, I'm just checking in on you to seeing how you of weeks ago. A little half hour checking in. How you doing? How you doing? Okay. Fed fucking tastic. You know it's funny, I'm always a day late and a dollar short to shit, so I fucking got a youtube page now. Um, we're doing all this animation. I'm fucking hiring people to do stuff. Try to get this fucking thing going so someday I won't even have to leave my house. All I gotta do is just sit here, ramble on about crazy shit as I slip into fucking senility and I'll still be able to eat my apple sauce. I'll still be able to pay for some fucking applesauce. All right? That is what, that, that is what the old age is all about.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Okay? You don't leave your house, but checks is still coming in. Okay? You got a cupboard full of fucking applesauce. Once you open them, you put them in the fridge. You know, even though it hurts your teeth, right? Cause you got fucking nerve involvement and all you fucking, I get teeth, right? You go back to eating the same shit you used to eat as a baby. It's just, it's like apple sauce is Gerber food for fucking old people, right? So you got that. What else do you have? You mixed a little Manet's in there and either you don't have to fucking Choo. Um, so I'm getting the youtube page going and, and you know what? These fucking constant youtube do know if, I can't even tell you they got this thing where they decide if what the fuck happened on your thing is, is a little too offensive.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Like they fucking decide and then you don't get any of the ad money. And I'm like, but the ads still there, who gets the money? Youtube keeps it fucking unbelievable. I'll tell you right fucking now the number one commandment broken it. I'm telling you, it's stealing. And this more stealing that goes on, on the legal side of business fee, everybody's always make going fucking Scorsese. He's always doing that, you know, whatever that fucking song is. I could go from rags to riches. That's what the hell it is, right? All that good fellas. Shit, fuck you pay me. Fuck you pay me all of that. Like that doesn't exist in the legal world. It's even fucking worst and it's more overt that it's just straight up fucking stealing. So I don't know what I'm going to do with the youtube page. I'm actually thinking, what am I, why don't I just move it to my fucking website? Right. I'll reach out to fucking Matt Miller high life. You want to fucking, uh, you want to fucking just be on all my videos and I'll just do it on my, my page and I can do say whatever the fuck I want and not worry about somebody taking my fucking retirement applesauce money.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       It's not like I'm making any fucking money anyways. You got to have like a billion hits, I think to make $7. Well, you know, you got to cure rate as they're talking to you here. Like a cash machine going off in the fucking background, whatever. Who gives a shit. All right. You know what? I am actually in a great mood here. I am in a great mood. And, um, despite that highway robbery, youtube, she called it your tube to your fucking bullshit. You're keeping all the fucking money, your cons, um, who gives a shit right at the end of the fucking day? Well, obviously you do, Bill, you wouldn't have brought it up. I don't fucking mind. Just, just fuck me over. Why can't you just fuck me over? Why can't you just come out and just say, listen, we're going to fuck you over. Why do you to lie? Why do you got to sit there and act like you're not going to do it? And then you turn around and you do it. That's what upsets me. It's not that you're doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       So you said you weren't going to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       Alright, anyways, uh, Brad Marshawn suspended for two games for stab and Jake Dodgen in the balls. So he got one game for each balls, each ball that he fucking stabbed him. And, and uh, it makes sense. I know a lot of people like, why didn't Sidney Crosby? Cause what Sidney did don't you see as he turned his fucking stick sideways and he gave him a little tap, a little tap of the ball back, like the same level that when you know the doctor, you go to get a physical, he as you cross your legs and you know he hits you and your knee goes up. Right? Just like that. He was just testing the guy's reflexes. So he gets no suspension or a penalty, you know, plus he has those big pouty lips and everybody feels bad for him. That's the genius to Sidney Crosby. Sidney Crosby has a look on his face, you know, like right before you make your girlfriend cry and then you're like, oh my God, she's going to cry.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       So you just abandon your argument. Like that's what his face looks like. So I think that's why he's able, that's why he's able to get away with what he gets away with. Plus, you know, he's a superstar and he makes everybody a ton of money. So Brad Marshawn, you know, you live by the sword, you die by the sword. I remember branded press, fucking stabbed them in the nuts, uh, when we will play in Vancouver a couple of years ago. And then what's funny is still listen to Jack Edwards when he sees Marshawn, he's such a fucking homer. He's just sitting to go, oh, look at all that is blatantly out of the rules. That is a delicious video for the boys in New York. Hope you enjoy your day off. You're talking about definitely a suspension and a, and then marsh shun wave, you know, fucking just, I mean, he uppercutted this dude's nuts. His stick was not on the flat side. Like he was giving it a backhand or you know, he did an upper cut with the stick to the guy's Tatun ball area. And, um, like, you know, when your wife tells you to shovel the driveway and you're already pissed at you, you know how hard you throw those first two fucking scoops of snow over your shoulder. That's how hard he hit this guy in the fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       And I gotta tell you as a Bruins Fan, I thought I was like, oh my God, he just fucked us over cause he just got kicked out of the game. I think it was still zero to zero against the Tampa Bay lightning. And we were waiting to, um, you know, see if we were gonna make the playoffs. I'm like, Oh my God, you just got to give right at the end of the first period. I'm like, he's going to get kicked out. That's going to fucking know, give Tampa a little jumping. They'll their, their game. They're going to win this fucking game. He's going to be out for the rest of the season. And, uh, and then we're gonna, you know, I catastrophize in my head, what if we fucking, you know, don't make the playoffs because of that playoff. But fortunately we ended up winning I think four to one and four to nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       And, um, if we beat Ottawa tonight, we can actually, uh, you know, we at the very least, uh, are, are going to be a wild card. But I mean I don't, obviously, I don't feel like playing fucking the capitols right now. They looking like world beaters, but um, eventually you will have to play it, but it'd be nice to maybe have a chance to win a playoff series. We'll see how we do though. You never know goaltenders can get, they get hot at the right time in here. There's no telling how far you could go in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Um, I feel like for me, I just feel that, um, that's actually become part of my vocabulary now. Cause every time Nia watches those fucking reality shows, people just go for me or Tinky I just feel, and now I've done it so much, now I'm doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       So I am officially bill Kardashians right now. All right. I'm not thinking about transitioning. I'm not going to die. What's left of my fucking, I got my, got my head shaved now by my beard. I'm not gonna dry dyed fucking jet black, you know, but like at Kardashians I did marry an African American, so I feel like I'm halfway there. I think I could actually say that I'm one of their cousins. I don't know. Oh, I see a Photoshop coming anyways, um, to get back to, uh, to the hockey. Um, and so yeah, so we're in the playoffs for the first time in three fucking years, so it's great to be in there and hopefully we'll be Ottawa tonight. And uh, I bet Marshawn cost himself a little bit of fucking money there. You know, I would think in his contract that he gets a bonus if he gets 40 goals and the man was sitting on 39, we're going to play Ottawa tonight.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       Forget about the rest of the game that he could have played in Tampa playing Ottawa tonight. And according to the puck off podcast, hosted by Joe Barnick on the all things comedy network, he said that, uh, auto has got a lot of injuries in their defense. Who knows? Who knows? So I guess what you take away from all of that is that if you're in the NHL, if you're going to fucking hit somebody's ball bag, you do it with the flat side of the stick. All right? You get yourself, you know, some collagen injections in the ellipse like a Kardashians. I don't know. Maybe they did. It didn't, I dunno. Um, you know, so you look like you're about ready to cry like Cindy Crosby and you will not get suspended. All right. But I guess you heard Crosby does and they fucking slashed somebody. You almost took the end of his fucking, like the guys that ended the guy's finger was hanging off.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       You know, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that guy, he's going to have a uh, there's not really like any of the goons anymore. These to have like that. That's like players like Crosby's just have like security like back in the day in like the 80s, like the fucking tough guys back in the 80s, where like they did everything but just have like blue blazers on in ear pieces standing next to the goal scores. If you went anywhere near them, they'd fucking murder you. And I'm, I'm trying to think of who, who the penguins have penguins never really had a goon. They had a bunch of fucking knee breakers. They were really into like, well, we're not going to fight you. We're just gonna end your career, blow out your fucking knee boards, you and that type of shit. Filthy, filthy fucking franchise. But you know, the penguin is a dirty bird, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       Sort of the pigeon of the Antarctic, isn't it? Did you guys hear their buildings on luxury condos down there? Luxury condos in Antarctica? You know, people in Silicone Valley, they don't know where else to spend their money. They already bought up San Francisco. They're starting to come down here to la and a for a summer place because San Francisco so fucking cold. Um, that the next thing that they're going to do, they're gonna be down in Antarctica. You can look it up. It's true luxury condos in Antarctica and a la to Antartica. They're going to have the first direct flight in July. All of that is true. I'm not making this up at all because I have a half hour to a to fill up here and I'm only 10 minutes in. I would never do that to you guys. Um, all right, let's talk about, oh, Billy beef. K Care.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       All right. Fucking Dad Bod Magoo who uh, after his European run last Selma is up to a fucking 190 pounds. And then I kinda started working out, getting ready for my special. I got down to like a buck 78 finished the special. And are they really specials anymore now that there's one coming out every week? It was just sort of bill talks for an hour, I think since my special came out in January, there's been 97 other hour long specials. I think there's been out one out every day. Um, anyways, so I uh, I got down to a buck 78, 79 ish and uh, and then I was just like, oh, right now I'm waiting to become a dad. You know, my wife was in the third trimester, so I'm going to try meth. I'm going to fucking blame her a little bit, even though I don't, I was just drinking too much everything. So I got up to like a backup to like a buck 85 buck 86. So now last week I got myself down to 180 pounds. This week I wanted to lose at least two pounds. All right. The way in is tomorrow, but uh, I'll just start doing them on Thursday. So I wanted to get down to one 78 maybe one 77 got on the scale today. One 77.6.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       All right, so I am, I got one day on a film coming up. Oh, aren't you fancy, Bill? Yes, I am. I got one day at a film. So ultimately, you know, I need to be, to not get too much shit on Twitter about being a big Booz headed fucking baldheaded red cunt, you know, which always fucking happens. All these fucking actresses fucking bitch moaning and complaining like the Internet has only mean to them. I swear to God, fucking self-involved lunatics, right? Um, I gotta get down to like my fight once, usually about a buck 72 on camera. If I walk around a buck 75, you know, um, if you just see me coming down the street, I look radiant. Okay. You're gonna look at me like Jesus. Bill, are you expecting book at that? Look on your face. I'm fucking with you. But I got to get, but on camera I gotta be down to a buck 72.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       All right. And every fucking actor knows what fucking wait, you gotta be at c, you know, and you'll all get all, you just gauge it on social media feedback cause you're just going to get a ton of shit. The second you go, a little power dude, you look like Vince Vaughn in the end of the fucking a, the breakup. You know, that was my favorite part of that fucking movie. I love that fucking movie. I loved how Vince did the fucking, he had the a not in a relationship fucking, you know, out there crushing ass. And then when he was in the relationship, he had that extra 10 to 15, you know, the Netflix, wait, let's sit here and you know, make some Mac and cheese and play footsie. Um, I don't wanna ruin the end of the movie, but that's one of the best, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       And that was a chick flick too, cause it was about a relationship. And that's one of my favorite things about it was it played out in a real way. Right down to the, you know, when he's not in a relationship, he's fucking, you know, he's at his fighting weight. You know, I'm trying to attract somebody to fuck me again. Okay. You were a layup so I had my layup extra 15 on right. That's what I'm trying to lose right now. Little Billy layup weight. So I'm down to one 77.6 so next week the official way in is on Friday, but I'll do them on Thursday just to give a, just add a little excitement in your life because I'm so self involved and I feel like you guys actually give a shit. So do it with me. Lose two pounds this week at least if not three.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       So I want to be down to about a buck 74 a by Friday next week and then we shoot the following week. So I could actually be down to one 73 you know, if I puke behind a dumpster, you know, take the old fucking, you know, you know what route, I guess you can't even see. You can't even say bulemia without people freaking out unless you're like, it's one of the worst of the those. You can't even use it as a comedy reference. Are you allowed to, are you allowed to say, you know, use that as a reference. Like I'll go, I'll go if I have to, if I have to, I will make myself fucking Yak for fucking a day to get down to the buck 72 to deliver my line and a half on this movie.

Speaker 1:          00:14:18       Bill Burger King of the line in a half. If you've got a line in a half that you need to fucking be delivered by a tertiary character. Did I use that word correctly? I am your fucking man. I will show up on time in shape, ready to fucking work. I'll show up at my fighting weight of one 72 I will deliver that line. I'll even give you a look. All right. He gave me like a special and special appearance by bill borough and the opening credits, whatever the fuck that is called, I will actually throw in, I'll give you, I'll give you the rock, you know, with one of my invisible eyebrows that you can't really see. Um, yeah. Anyway, so I'm going to get down to that. I'm going to get down to hopefully like a book, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       72 whatever. Look at me. I sound like the fucking Raymond, but that's the only way to do it. And then eventually I'd like to get down to one, a buck 68. Okay. And then not do what I always do to be like, oh, I'm a buck 68, you know, who wants some fucking cookies? Let's get a fucking 12 pack, you know? And then I just, I slowly but surely go right back up and uh, and I, I have to make a lifestyle change. I just feel like for me, I'm going to be a lot happier if I cut out gluten and I still don't know what gluten is.

Speaker 2:          00:15:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       It's some sort of chemical that's in wheat, I believe. And evidently it's not good for you, even though wheat is is from the earth, but you know there are poisonous plants or is gluten like some shit that some fucking nerds made for psychopaths that have food companies that adds to the density or some shit and somehow they make more money. Is that what it is? But always looking to do that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       You know what I mean? You can't fucking satisfying these fucking lunatic. These fucking guys did. The men at the top of these corporations, you know what they like? They like a bunch of fucking broads, you know what I mean? Like no matter what they have, they never fucking happy. You know, you got straight hair now you want curly hair and now you want short hair. You know they ain't want to wear a crop top that you want to fucking, you know, have clam digger zone. I, I don't, I don't know what the fuck is she doing? Can you just put on a fucking pair of sweatpants and just sit down for five fucking minutes? You know, hard. My wife would be laughing at this shit right now because I'm the one who I, I fucking the coat look like this is supposed to be my relaxed energy right now and I'm still talking to fast. Whenever I listened back to my podcast, I'm like, why? Why do I talk so fast? I thought I w I thought I talked a lot slower. I need to have like cocktail party energy now. Even at cocktail party, you gotta yell. You got to yell over people, right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       I Dunno. Cocktail party, just call it what it is. We're getting away from our kids to get shit faced for a few hours. All right? And somebody's going to try to dominate the conversation. Somebody is going to fucking bring up politics. Someone's going to get too drunk. Then there's going to be a fucking argument and there's got to be apologies afterwards. Why doesn't everybody just pick a fucking corner of the room? Okay. Stare at the carpet and just

Speaker 3:          00:17:13       start drinking. Okay. That's it. Why else would we here is this some swingers party? We going to trade off here? Like what? What is going on? I don't, Maggie, I don't give a shit about your worldview. You don't hold public office. You do not have access to top secret documents in the Pentagon. So at the end of the day, what am I doing here? And I really listening to like a nurse trying to tell me how to fix a car. Isn't that kind of the same thing? Would you like to hear what I think about fucking the Middle East? Cos You wouldn't lie right there. Finish your fucking drink.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Um, anyways. Uh, what else is going on this weekend? Oh, I'm going to be in, I'm going to be in San Antonio, but not one show. Two shows at the majestic theater. Oh my God. It's so majestic. They added a second show. I'm going to be doing some morning radio tomorrow to hype that second show, um, doing that one show. I'm doing two shows like Brad Marshawn. I'm not going to fucking stab you in one ball. I'm stabbing into not going to get suspended for one game. You're suspended for it. I'm gonna do one show for every game. Brad Marshawn was suspended. Okay. Was unfairly targeted because he in a, in a moment of emotion, he used the shoveling, the snow fucking technique, and he did not have the Sidney Crosby pouty lips for when he went to the board in New York.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       I think that's what Crosby does. You know, he just, he doesn't even have to go to New York. They just fucking put him on Skype and he just sits there like, hi guys. Oh, I'm sorry. You know, I was just having a bad period. Oh, isn't it amazing how much I could talk without even know what the fuck? Um, I ain't know what I'm talking about here. Um, Hey, do you guys want to know how to change a shitty diaper properly? Are there any parents out there? Here's one to grow on. Here's one of my, here's a tip for you. All right? What happens is, is when you have a little base, say the word, say the God damn fucking Raj, I'm going to be out. Uh, if you have a baby, um, and you're breastfeeding it as opposed to giving it formula,

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       I'm staying away from that shit. I just, I don't like that fucking name formula at that fucking name alone. I'm not giving my baby formula. You know, I would just picture like one of those Frankenstein movies with the graduated syndrome cylinder and the dry dry ice smoke coming out of the top of it. So anyways, so they bait. Yeah, they got a liquid diet going on. So when you know, when the fucking backdoor comes off the hinges, as they say, uh, you know, this is the deal. The second you hear the fucking, you know the rumblings in the grumblings, what you gotta do is you gotta get your kid not horizontal. You got to have them upright. All right? Now this is the problem when you take them down to the changing table, when you lay them back down again, okay? And you take an off the one Z, you got to elevate him a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       You know, as they say, shit runs down hill. Okay? So what you want to do is you want to use gravity as a favor. This, it's a two person job. If you're going to save that fucking onesy all right? Which you got to do is you have to have the baby fucking standing up on the change in table. All right? The other person on does the onesy lifts the onesy up over the fucking diaper, and then you'd take the diaper off like you'd taken the transmission out of a car that's up on a lift. All right? Then you use gravity. Everything drops down. I'm trying to be as not graphic as humanly possible. Okay? Then you know, then you begin the fucking, uh, the restoration because I'm telling you right now, if you're home alone, all right? And you lay that kid down, then one shit runs downhill. Now what's on the One z? You got to take it off. You got to go over the kid's fucking head and now you got shit on the fucking, I'm sorry. And this is what it is. I don't want to put shit on the kid's head.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       I'll tell you it's a rough one. You know, so fortunately if that fucking app is, is somebody else around, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get that graphic, but you know, people who are parents of telling you just one person holds it up, the undo the ones, he, you dropped the diaper out like a fucking trans mission, you know, do a little cleanup. Then you fucking set the kid down, then you finish the fucking clean up, Bam. A new diaper. Actually you don't even do that. Usually we just bring her into the fucking shower and start all over again with a brand new squeaky clean fucking kid. And there you go. There's a little percent. That's my first per unsolicited parental advice. Okay. I just felt like for me, I just felt like it needed to be sad.

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       Is anybody watching that reality show? Black ink? Uh, my wife watches it all the time. There is a woman on there that makes my temper look like a fucking summer breeze. Good Lord that she lose her fucking shit.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       It's like she's possessed. Um, I actually just said literally have to walk around a little, but I, you know, I keep forgetting this show. I started the watch, I watched the first three episodes and I absolutely fucking loved it and I tweeted about it. It was a cartoon from Japan, I guess they're called anime, which I did know that, but I didn't realize it was such a divisive thing to say that you like to show that was anime. I feel like is animated like the Emo of fucking cartoons. Like I tweeted that, I liked this show called one punch man. All right. And the fucking responses that I got, I got, dude, are you fucking drunk? Oh my God, you're in the enemy. And then other people just like this is like the create it. However, I just like to show, I've watched enough for the same type of shit and I was scrolling through and I was like, what the fuck is this show? And I looked and it had five stars, four and a half, five stars, which is why I really hope Netflix doesn't go to thumbs up, thumbs down. Like I said, because it's so fucking, you know, stubbing your toe, thumbs down, Adolf Hitler, thumbs down. I mean the thumbs down is, this is a big gap between Hitler and the, you know, stubborn your fucking toe. Um, anyway, so I put this thing on and what I loved about the show,

Speaker 4:          00:23:54       um,

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       aside from the fact that I really thought it was funny that you actually kind of got like a sense of what young people

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       feel like in Japan as far as their view of going into the corporate world was very similar to the empty feeling unless you're a fucking sociopath over here. I find like a very like common thread to that and to basically give the overall thing the superhero in it. He's not a suit. He doesn't want to be a superhero. All right. Any fucking trained really hard cause he wanted to be the strongest guy in the world. And in his training he lost all his hair, which is hilarious. And he's really self conscious about it. But he ended up developing like this punch. And no matter what monster he runs into, he doesn't give a shit whether they kill him. He's just completely devoid of any like passion or emotion. Like what happens to you when you get shoved into a fucking cubicle and a, and he's got this one punch and he just fucking can punch so hard that no matter how fucking Badass the monster is, he gives him one, somebody said they should have called the show, the right they have Fred, he gives him the fucking Brian in the fucking, in the face is Eddie Murphy says in the face, um, and their fucking head explodes and the monsters that he fights, you also get more of an insight into where people's heads are at, uh, in Japan.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       And it was like, you know, one of the monsters you fought with, some giant virus sent here by the Earth to get rid of the, all the humans cause of what we'd done to the planet. So there's an environmental thing. Then my favorite one was this guy who was crab man. He was half like up top and he was all a crab. And then the bottom, he was, he was half a guy and he was in, but the bottom half, he's in his bare feet and tidy whities and the guy's like, oh, I ate so much crab meat that I became a fucking crab. And to me he represented the upper 1% corporate guys, you know, on some power lunch. Just eaten all the fucking Sushi and just take, take, take, take, take, nothing spiritual about them. So he gave him the all right there, Fred.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       And then he fought this fucking lady and she had command of all the mosquitoes and she'd stick the mosquitoes on everybody suck all the blood out of you and all your fucking energy. And then it would make her stronger. And to me it's like, oh, this is a gold digging blood sucking whore. Right. And then once she got it to do it to all the animals and everybody there, she didn't need them mosquitoes anymore. She told all the mosquitoes to go fuck themselves. And I'm like slash this is also somebody who becomes successful and forgets where they come from. And they look at everybody where they used to be. It's like a Bunch of Fucking pee ons, a bunch of little insignificant little mosquitoes. Right? It's a lot of levels to it. Or he just get fucking high and watch this bald headed dude fucking punch half a crab in the head and wants you to explode. I enjoyed it.

Um, anyways, let me get back to, sorry, I was just giving you guys a little behind the scenes on voiceovers. Did you like that? Did you feel like you were there? All right, let me wrap this up. This weekend I'm for the first time, I think I'm going to watch an entire MotoGP race. I believe it's in Argentina. It's somewhere down south. [inaudible] I'm all shook up no further south than that. Good coach. Go a little samba action.

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:22       Who the fuck I'm getting texts from right now? Oh my God, I don't remember that person in a minute. All right. Anyways, MotoGP and then the Chinese Grand Prix. Um, this is, this is a very great weekend before the, the NFL and NBA playoffs. If you would like to watch some alternative sports sports that are not as big as the big four here in the United States of American. Who? Who's kidding, who are country matters the most? Therefore our sports matter the most. All right. People know our star athletes around the world. Nobody knows people in the premier league. You know, the only reason why we knew that one fled Beckham guys, cause they made a movie about it and he was fucking one of the spice girls. All right? If he wasn't fucking some chicken, a girl band, nobody knew who that guy was. Okay. We mattered the most.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       All right, let's, let's try to have a little more empathy as Americans here. Let's watch some fucking great sports from around the world. MotoGP if you want to watch a bunch of lunatics driving about 180 miles an hour right next to each other, taking turns fucking maniacs. And he also the technology and that sports, you know, like those suits. Now, I don't know how they figured it out, but they figure out that the riders fallen off the bike and before he hits the payment pavement, ideally like the, the, the, the suit that they wear has like an air bag that just fucking immediately inflates and protects all the vitals in theory. You know, obviously, I dunno if you fucking slam into a wall. I don't know what happens then. But, um, and then the Chinese Grand Prix, the second race, the second of 20 races, there's only 20 races.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       It's very easy to watch this and continue to watch all the other sports that you love. He can tape it, you can just fucking watch it. And uh, the Ferrari's one, the first one was Sebastian Vettel I believe. And uh, you know, I'm sorry. I'm sure fucking I'm the fluxes name. Uh, Lewis Hamilton is not happy about that shit. Um, and I was actually going to go to that tt race this year and the Isle of Man and ended up fucking falling apart. So, um, I got to go next year. I got to go next year before they make it fucking safe. I have to go. And if you've never seen that race, more people have died than years that they've had it. Um, the balls these people have, it's like fucking real life mad max type shit, except there's still running water and all that stuff. Um, anyways. All right, let me talk about my glutes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       Give me a, this is something I realized as I'm rehabbing all these injuries and my body is that through years of sitting on planes and sitting on cars, like I fucking, I have like no glute muscles whatsoever. Like beyond the usual fucking white guy, no ass type of shit. It's just like my fucking thighs do all the work. So I've been, I've been doing these squats where you kind of push from your heels. And when I'm coming down and I'm trying to have most of my weight on my squat, all my squats on my heels with my torso, like straight up and down, not leaning forward to counterbalance the lack of glute muscle that I have, I start to come down into a seating position. I have to do it like over my workout bench. Cause if I just tried to go, you know, mainly depending on my glutes, I will literally fall down the like the first 30 degrees I'm okay. And then I just fall

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       down to the bench. So I gotta get that going. Um, so that's what I've been doing. I just went on and I looked up the top 10 glued things, don't do an alternative leg lunges. I got an exercise ball up against the wall that it put on my back and I go all the way down to a deep squat pushing up through my heels. Then I do the one, um, where you lay on your back, your feet are planted on the ground and then you, you lift your hips up, you know, with the glutes that way, it's almost like you're, you're, you're sort of thrusting up as if you were fucking somebody, you know what I mean? But way up, like they were lighter than air and you could actually possibly do that. So I do those and then I do the alternative fucking leg lunches.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       That's what I'm doing so far. So hopefully, I dunno, I had no idea my body was so god damn fucked up. But evidently it is. But I am one 77.674 excited about that and a deal with me. Everybody come on, the summer's coming up, lose a couple pounds a week with me. Cut out the chips, the cookies. Just fucking drink waters, sign up for that blue apron shit. You know, have a robot come and deliver it to your house. Be done eating by five, six o'clock at night. And even if you get home later, just, I always try to go like fucking at least 12 hours without eating when I'm trying to lose weight for like the last day. Like if I finish eating around seven, I'm not going to have breakfast till like fucking nine. Um, if you do have a day job, just have like, I don't know, have like a lighter breakfast to something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:58       I, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. All I can tell you is what works for me. All right. That's the podcast. Uh, have a great weekend. You can check out some of the outline. You know, what else is on this weekend? The fucking man. I'm the one golf tournament that I really try to watch every year. It starts today. So just, um, you know, if you don't wanna watch the last couple of fucking games of hockey, you know, I know baseball is going in that type of stuff, but, uh, I dunno, this racing stuff is pretty fucking God. Damn cool. All right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. We'll see on Monday.

Speaker 3:          00:40:29       So first he is completely addicted to skating now and he wants to get better at it and I'm, so we're fucking in Edmonton the next morning we got to drive down to Calgary and Forrest, he's going like this gotta be a place here to skate. So we find out they have, uh, they have a skating rink at the mall. And not only is it a mall, it's one of the most giant malls in North America. America. Yeah. West Edmonton Mall rivaling. Uh, what's that one in Minnesota. Mall of America. Mall of America. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, which I've been to that one too. So we go to that one. We're walking through there with our fucking skates, two middle aged guys walking through this thing with fucking skates. And, uh, we walk in, there's like this giant pirate ship. I mean like, yeah, you could sail the fucking ocean with this fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:41:15       Yeah. It was a fuck alone special. And I look on the other side, it was really deep water and they took all this time to make it look like there was a ship rapping. Jesus Christ. I mean like you could fucking, you know, it was monstrous man. Like Shaq could drown in this water if he didn't. That's how fucking deep it was. Huge. And then we look on the other side and I'm like, Paul, I'm like, is that a sea lion? They had sea lions at this thing and they're like thrown it fish and shit. Fish. And it was catching a train or was don't, it wasn't like people just walking by throwing shit from the food court. It was a trainer throwing it. And um, so we're just walking through the mall, walking through the mall. Endless fuck them all. They had a water park there.

Speaker 3:          00:41:51       Yeah, it was insane. I didn't look at any stores. I was too distracted by the shit in the middle. And then we finally get all the way to the ice ice palace. They called the Ice Palace and we got all excited and were the only people with skates just walking through holding a fucking dumb skates and we get all the way to the other side versus all excited like, dude, I'm, I'm telling you I'm going to get better at this. You wait, I was getting, I was ready this summer. He's already talking, Shit, don't call it right now. I'm going to be fucking skating backwards. You're going to be like, what the fuck happened? [inaudible] yeah, right. And then we show up and uh, there's a big judo tournament where the ice rink is and they'd fucking put all this floor flooring all over it. I was in denial.

Speaker 3:          00:42:26       I'm like, maybe this isn't their rank. They might acknowledge this dude. It says ice palace fall. This is it. They covered it up. This is it. I got upset though at the mall, man, member number, that girl, man, that really bothered me. We were walking through the food court and you know, we had a gyro. Great Gyro and yeah, yeah, a great gyro at this place called Jimmy the Greek, the one complaint. And you agreed a little too much white sauce and it was pasty. Yeah, it wasn't. Yeah, it was a little pasty. You should have got one scoop. You went to one, one scoop lesson, a little hot sauce and it would have been fuck it. He got excited. It would have been epic. Yeah. Well you got excited. So then I said to bill, you know, I like a little dessert after I eat. You know, I like a little candy bar. I like a little, you know, so I love sugar in tank.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       Yeah. So, so I go bill man, it was it frozen yogurt place. I go, yeah, pink barriers. I'm just going to go with frozen yogurt. See? All right, so we're walking light the picture, so to middle aged men with skates and I'm like, you keep saying I'm middle age. Do you want a middle age? I'm 30 I just turned 35 35 times two 70 most guys fucking drop. Well I call, I call like I call middle it. Yeah. All right. What, what would you call it? No, I got, I guess you're right. I guess, you know, I always just, when I thought of it as a kid, I always felt, you know, it was no, I don't know. I just remember, dude, I, it's, I dunno, we'll just say 40 forties but I, you know, bought e's for to people. Do people live long, man, dude, I'm fucking be 46 46 times two is 92 you're going to really, I can't really sit there and say, I'm middle age.

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       Tell you the way I'm eating and smoking. Yeah, no, no. So, so we walked through and we were like, where is that? Where was that frozen yogurt place? Let's go to that frozen yogurt place. So we too, we see two young women walk by and we figure, Hey, I looked at him and I'm like, these, these, these ladies, they're going to know where they're going to know where a pink berry is. So we walk up and you go first. You say to the friend, you go, hey, you got, you guys know her. Oh that good. That good looking too, by the way. Yeah. I've got good looking girls and you go up first, you go, hey, you guys know where the frozen yogurt places and like she did like a double take. Like she did a double take, so fucking rude, right? And she was like, what?

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       And then I looked at the other one and I go, yeah, like a pink berry. And she kind of just like gives a shake off. Like how would I know? Like why? And she fucking did. This is what she did. She did the classic pretty girl, you're clearly just asking me this because you want to talk to me thing. And I'm like, no bitch, I want some fucking yogurt. Okay, I want fucking, I want fucking treat. You know, I just had lunch and it really bothered me, dude. And we were walking around and I wanted to find her. I wanted to find past this again. They did the loop on the fight. I didn't know that, but I said to bill when we got to the car, I go, I wanted to find it. Cause I would've just went up there and go, you know something. I found it. And you're a mean jerk and then you go, why would you do that? You're a mean jerk. That's terrible. What am I gonna call her a cunt?

Speaker 3:          00:45:10       Well, don't call her anything if you're going to go with me and jerk. I mean, you know, I hate that you're, you're on that pretty good state. Your main, but you're a jerk if you want to stay clean. But if you go, you're a mean jerk. No, you're not. You're not. You're not pretty inside. You're not pretty. Inside. Doesn't give a fuck. She's still hot girl at the mall. Paul put yourself in her fucking pumps.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       All right? With two fucking jackets standing there with ice skates when there's a judo tournament down the way, asking if they know where the fuck the ice cream store is. They looked at us the way they were supposed to. I, you know what, dude? I like a sweetheart. I don't care how you [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:45:48       love to hear them tell the story and they come and then there's just creepy guy comes up like that's the way they're going to hear it. Paul. Paul. Do you ever watch those fucking prison shows? Which ones? Like the scared straight? No, not those ones where they talk about the worst prisons in the country and that type of shit. Oh yeah. I seen a couple of them. And you just sit there watching it going, how the fuck would I go in there and not get raped? What would my game plan? He gets scared watching it in your bedroom, right? Women have to walk out of the house worried about that. That somebody is gonna do. Just imagine if our,

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       I did. I had a winter hat on with a puffy ball on top of it. Holding Ice Skates, asking for yogurt. If anything, she probably thought I was fucking gay. [inaudible] you don't look gay, Paul. I know, but you're not asking that question that your beards to terrorists. You need to get a little more metro-sexual. I going to do that. We was, we had sweatpants on though. We were a mess. Everybody in the fucking girl. Yeah, that's what you love my beard. My beard actually fucking says everybody on the fucking ground. No, but dude, I don't like the pretty girl who can't be approached with a question because Oh, this guy's hitting on me. It's, it's awful. And he knows something that got, especially the blonde one who went like shook her head like what? She's going to be a nightmare. She's a fucking nightmare for some future guy. I'm telling you, she's a nightmare. She's already selfish. It's over. What if she just knows what she wants and we're not at fault. Well

Speaker 3:          00:47:17       this is the thing dude, you actually aloud like how old do you think they were would probably 2122 yeah. You let at 2122 year old. I met girl at my age, not even a one way. She shook it all that and let it ruin like the two we're driving down to Calgary. Yeah, she ruins, we got the rocky mountains on the right hand side of the car and you're just still calling. You're calling her a cunt the whole way down and father the shit out of me. It was like, why are you, why would you ask me? How would I know? Dude. You realize how funny that is that they did that to us? Like what? Like yeah, they really made us feel like shit. That's fucking hilarious. If you look at it, it bothered and the whole time it's cause you wanted to get frozen yogurt.

Speaker 3:          00:47:58       That how funny would it be if we chased him down and I went, you got frozen yogurt with sugar-free gummy bears on it. It was still all natural, no organic gummy bears. How great would it be if we chased him down and I just walked up to her and I go, you know something, you hurt my feelings. It just fucking broke down. You know, you hurt my feelings. It just want a yogurt. By the way, from people listening here, this is last week, you know, you know, just trying to kill, just trying to make jokes to not go out of your mind being on tour this fucking long. Yeah. As we were doing the danger fields, everything. Oh, I'll tell you, I've got a friend of mine loves yogurt, you know, so we were doing that and once that went away, that got old. Somewhere along the line.

Speaker 3:          00:48:38       You started doing it, you started saying really sentimental shit to me and then pretending like you were crying and then that just became like the running joke and then you started laughing and then you were just like, you got to do that onstage. Do that cry and think. So now we'll just go up and like if we'll be like, hey man, I'm tired, but too, you know what? Hang on, hang on. What you on the road has been great. You're the only one I could have done it with and then bill would come and tag it. That's the best thing. Bill would come and tag hour to do it. Oh, I was hoping you were going to say that, but go to, it's been, it's been fucking wonderful for my anger. I'm going to try to do that when I get home. Just pretend like I'm crying, man.

Speaker 3:          00:49:17       It's fucking hilarious. So two stories. We go in to eat and we have this Filipino waiter, right? By the way, I like to play the Games where I sorta hell, where are we? Was that Edmonton? Was that Calgary? That was Edmonton. Yeah. Was Edmondson. So I like to do this thing where sometimes I like to fuck with people, so I'll just get on a phone and I'll be like, Bill, go along with it and we'll be in an elevator and I'll go, what? No, that's horse shit. And like bill just be like, what happened? So like I said, like he had a parole officer called and he said, and bill goes, oh, they worked it up. And then instantly Burgos yeah, but what about that video tape? I go, no, no. They said it's in submissive and like, and like the guy there was just a stranger there.

Speaker 3:          00:49:51       Right. Sometimes I break out laughing, so bill calls it, he gets a little emotional guy. So we turn this crying thing, we do it to like, this is big. Great, right? We turn it, we turn that into doing it in public. So we have this Filipino waiter, right. And the whole guy guy was great. He was talking to us and at the end I just go, he goes, here's your bill. And I go, I just want to say so. And I kept a dead straight face. Like you've been a great waiter, man. And I put my hand on his fucking arm and I got you. You know what? You're bringing the waters and bill just looks at and goes. He gets a little, he gets a little emotional, you know what I mean? I know, but it's, it means a lot. Guy Didn't know what that I had no, cause he was so fucking polite.

Speaker 3:          00:50:30       Eddie was actually from the Philippines, so he's [inaudible] jumped right in perfectly to my friend. He gets a little emotional, but not Billy. He'd been the waters dude who, he was freaked out though. Oh, that's the new game on the road. You had the best one. I got to say, the best one was at the airport yesterday. We got to the airport yesterday and bill starts busting my balls about my laundry and he goes, Versie fucking 16 days and you're carrying, you know, dirty socks and underwear. And I go, dude, I go, I bought new ones. You know the dirty ones are tied up tight in a, in a plastic bag and bill just goes, just secure emotions. And Dude, I fucking could not walk. I couldn't walk and I had to stop pulling my fucking the bag I'd checked cause we were laughing so hard. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:51:13       work Stowe, it makes, it makes, it's fucking great. It's driving a tour manager nuts. Oh yeah. That's the ones that we will because women don't want to see a guy getting emotional like that. It's just, well no, because once somebody cries it's over. You know, like when I go out afterwards and I'm taking pictures with people and stuff, I always come back. I was just saying, I got to tell you, you know, I've seen a lot of people do that, you know, doing the picture thing, but you gotta be one of the best wives. She's going, would you stop fucking doing that? Our lives are going to go nuts cause you know, the first thing I want, I see stays and you see your wife. We're just going to go. It's been so long. I miss you so much. No, you got it. You got to set it up with talking, like you said, to start off normal, what you're going to say. Something really sentimental to them. So they're almost crying and then you cry, which ruins their crime. And I swear to God, you get slugged in the shoulder, which is all you really want. Oh Shit. 20 minutes in. I'll tell you Paul, you know, time really flies with you on the pool. It's been so fun.

Speaker 3:          00:52:09       This is probably only funny to us, but I don't give a shit. Try it with your friends. Oh fuck that. If people gain, if the game is called, he gets emotional and just walk into a bar. Just have one of your friends started hitting on a woman and then, and then the other friend's got to go along. Yeah. And then just starts welling up and then the other guy goes, I'm sorry. He just gets emotional and you just got to let the other person deal with it. Dude, you'll want at the fucking airport where you walked up to that lady at the car, the little fucking I sell gum, whatever the hell it is. And she said, excuse me, do you have the, I have the, what are the biggest night I broke out here I go, hey man, how you doing? What are the biggest condoms you got and what's the biggest size condoms you have?

Speaker 3:          00:52:44       I turned around and walked the one you turned around and walked away and I'm just staring at her and I'm biting my tongue as hard as I can to not laugh. And then I just burst out laughing and she said, what? And then when you went to repeat it, you try to point to it and I lost it. You lost it and had to walk away. Paula punchdrunk out here. You don't, one of my favorite things in this business was opie from the opion Anthony show was he had this thing that he would do when guys would start crying when they would play audio. Yeah. Oh my God. It was fun. And his timing was perfect. Every time someone would be talking like retiring from a sport, like when Mike Schmidt retired, which is, you know, it's very difficult to watch. He was like, you know, you know, he just was ending as like 38 years ago, a little boy began a journey to play the wonderful game of baseball and that the oop would always go, oh boy.

Speaker 4:          00:53:36       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       what am I favorite? And it always, oh boy, it always meant right. Nobody wants to see a man just completely, you know what it is. I can watch a guy cry if something terrible is happening. Just don't try to talk while you're crying. No. That's the thing. The talking and then bursting out into cross. Let your shoulders go. Yeah, let me shut fucking crying, but don't foe for the love of God a man. You got to try and manage the cry in private. Yeah, you do that in the shower. You do it in the shower. Like when my son was born, everyone's like, did you cry yet? And I'm like, no, what are you talking about? And then when my son was born, it all hit me later and I went home to go get stuff from my wife in the hospital and I sat on the couch and I didn't like weep. But I just,

Speaker 4:          00:54:19       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:54:21       I didn't weep, but I got emotional. But love just fixing you sitting on the couch by yourself and just used to go. That's stupid. It's just completely unexpected to use your thing from your podcast. Oh, that's unexplored. Z effect. Unacceptable dude on a completely [inaudible] right. Don't talk into it. Right. Yeah. The talk into it. That's, that's what the funny thing about crying is, you know? Yeah. You know, you always do this to me. You know you always do this to me and I'm trying my best and it's over. Yeah, it's fucking over. Whenever my friends die, I've had so many of fucker died. I just cry in the shower. Yes. Right though I asked the girl, we asked a girl. Right, because you don't feel like you're crying cause there's all that water on your face anyways.

Speaker 4:          00:55:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       No, we asked the girl, we go, what would you do if your dude started crying? Like if it wasn't, if nobody died, if a dude and you were just arguing, you just had a bad day and he just had a bad day and you got into and he broke down and cry and she goes, yeah, no, over, over, over, get the fuck away from me. Yeah. You know what's funny? There's some women, they think that they want to see that part of you. They don't. What that is to them is that's their total conquest. Yeah. You know when you bang a girl in the ass, you just like, yeah, I got this shit. I'm fucking with you.

Speaker 3:          00:55:35       Their version was that Jesus built, no, fuck we do. Their version of that is, is if they can get you to be so vulnerable around them that you cry and then it's one of those things. It's always like when the crowd screams out of joke, they already heard, they think they want to hear it again and then you tell it's like, Huh. Yeah. It wasn't as good. No. It's the same thing as that. Yeah. You said something, you said something about like if a burglar comes in, if you cry in front of a woman, all in her mind is like, what if the Burger comes in at this fucking guy? Yeah, no, it's over. You can't cry. You Strip a woman a security if you cry in front of her. I think, I don't think I've cried. I think my wife's on that. That's a great, that's what it is. Yeah. You Strip her of her security cause she's like, oh, I got this fucking, yeah, this funny crisis. This baby sleeping next to you every night, you know? Yeah. It's, it's over. You know what I mean? I know you just, you might as well just have a pullover sweater, you know, walking around and then she mocks you. What are you going to cry, bitch? Yeah, you saw me?

Speaker 3:          00:56:34       Yeah, it's fucking over, dude. You can't have that. Have you ever cried alone listening to a song or like, not cried, but have you ever been like, oh no, I've completely broken down and I've told her three cars just weeping uncontrollably. Have I? Yeah, totally cry. No, no, I definitely teared up. Listen, as an, as an artist, at some point you're going to have to go to those emotions. You need to, you need to be, you need to meet too with your instrument. I have, I, what was the once like I had this weird thing where, um, I stopped crying at some point. I don't know when I stopped crying and got mad more when I got hurt in my brother, beat the shit out of me. Um, you know that most of the crying I be just like at the end of it. But I wasn't, but I wasn't crying and then I didn't cry ever.

Speaker 3:          00:57:26       One time my brother is bigger than me. My little brother was bigger than me. Right. Big Dog like, and I remember he, I said, I said, if you fucking take my clothes again, if you take my clothes, like he did it every day he would go into my room, he would take my belt, he would take my clothes and I'd come home and I guess in a boy band and I need to go, I need to go out. Right. And I go, mom, if he does it again, I'm fucking hitting him. Her and my mom be like, oh, you know, and one time I need really needed a shirt and I'm fucking throwing shit through the house. And he gets out of his friend's car and he starts walking up and he's got it on and I fucking snapped. And my grandmother was there and I jumped on him and I started punching him and he stood up.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       He just goes, what you made your older brother crying on? My younger brother. Oh, he's bigger than me. But he didn't know what to do. He got so upset that he just got, and he looked around and he just, he was so angry that something needed to come out. And he just goes, what did you feel bad? And you start laughing. I kind of just walked away and you know, we laughed about it afterwards, but to now, now he's a, he's a fuck. He's a big kid. But you know, my mom had the opposite. I got a little brother, man, he's an animal, you know? Nope. My mom says she went to, she went to a funeral once and everybody was there and everybody was crying and she was overwhelmed with emotion that they had to fucking drag her out. She said she had them all.

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       One of the most embarrassing things happened to her where she said she uncontrollably laughed because they said that that can happen sometimes. So she's sitting there, she's sitting there and everybody's crying and like she went up and she could not stop laughing and like she and I said, why? Like? And she was like, Paul, I just don't know. She goes, I could not stop laughing and I had to walk me out and like, and she just is your mom? Yes. She said because the emotions or soundbites that they said that that can happen sometimes where it just, you just like, she didn't know what to do. So instead of just breaking down, she went the other way and just couldn't, couldn't control herself. Like humans will protect you and a really like, that's what they don't get sometimes when comics make fucking horrific jokes about some bad event.

Speaker 3:          00:59:28       Make good jokes. Yeah. It's about a horrific event. So they go that so fucking me, it's a defense mechanism. It's my mom. My mom is a sweetheart who felt bad and her emotions just went the other way. And she goes, Paul, I felt so bad. I couldn't control myself. I couldn't control myself. I hate to say this cause somebody lost somebody. But there was, if there was video of that, oh my God. Oh I'm so, I was saying, so I stumbled around, I don't know, 10 or 11 I didn't cry for years. Years and years and years. And I didn't, I didn't cry until a friend of mine killed himself. And even then I was sad and it's just, Oh, I went, ah, I was in the bathroom once again. Yeah. And it was in there. And I remember I started to cry and then I started thinking like, wow, I'm crying. I haven't cried in a long time. And then I stopped cause I got out of it cause I stopped thinking about the dude kill himself. Wow. Yeah. I went 10 years without a cry and then I had one, what was it over yogurt. Gummy bears?

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       No. Uh, I think yeah, might have been almost, it might've been one of my son was born, you know, it might've been my second one. That's acceptable. I guess it's acceptable.

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       I got it other than when I went down the pool, cause I go down to the pool, I'm down there to me it's fucking Jay law head who's been killing it in front of me and a the lovely Nia and her cousins and we're hang all right cousin. I mean we're hanging out down the pool and they're doing the usual shit. You know, if you're a redhead and you go down to the pool, like you just asked for it. People that all, you know, look how white you are. You know? Like I never noticed. It's like I'm fucking around myself. I've been around myself since the sixties the late sixties I know how white I am and if I ever forget how white I am, there's always somebody that remind me. Sorry, I don't know if you've noticed your skin tone. What am I meditating? Floating up on my body. All right, so these people up with go, come on. Come on in the pool and like, I don't want to go in the pool. I don't want to go in the fucking pool. You know? They're like, why? No, why don't you want to go in the pool? You know, why? Cause a fucking,

Speaker 5:          01:01:32       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       look, look at these people. Look at them, look at them. And you're gay. You're getting your, you know, would you take a bath with aught, with any one of the people that you see here? These fucking just messes of human beings. There's not enough chlorine in a fucking pool to kill whatever the fuck they're dragging in the pool, you know? And so I finally end up going to the pool. Then everybody made fun of how white my fucking alabaster chest was at. Then I had to stay in the shade of the fucking, uh, the lifeguards chair, you know, you know, I had a show to do, I'm being a professional, I can't come up stage later, half in the bag, looking like, oh, lobster, right? I got to do my little song and dance later on that night. So anyway, so I ended up getting in the fucking pool against my, what I wanted to do, you know, and then I get out of the pool. First of all, for my age, I am in absolutely phenomenal. Top shelf shape. Alright. I gotta tell you the, the fucking, just the touch stuff. Fuck the humanity that I saw poolside in Las Vegas, the fucking humanity

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       keyword manatee.

Speaker 4:          01:03:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       Not The skip step on a Jim Gaffigan. I just realized he used to use that reference and I'm pretty sure he used it. I can't remember how the fuck he used it, but if he used it to describe a fat Pale Torso, not really pale, but whatever, whatever the fucking shit. I saw the side of that. He was dead on that. Oh my God. Is there anything worse than seeing a tattoo come of age? You know, Jesus Christ, if you get a tattoo, you better. You better just make the mental decision that you're going to P90x for the rest of your fucking life because when you don't do it, I saw this guy down at the pool. All right. He had like not only the worst tattoos you've ever seen in your life, like the worst placement, you know what I mean? Like you get one like or the side of your arm up by your shoulder that looks good, right on the bicep.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       That looks good. You know, CIOs, somebody got gets one right over their voice box. Like I don't give a fuck what you have surrounding that. That leads into that part of the, of of the work or the piece, whatever they call it. It looks fucking horrible. Leg Tattoos, horrific, horrific. So this fucking jerk off. He has basically the exact sort of like tribal thing that the rock has, except he doesn't look tribal. He looks like an accountant, you know, and he doesn't work out. So just imagine if the rock was his pasty as I was and it never worked down in his life, but it has that saved tattoo that starts at the elbow, goes up the arm, over the shoulder and covers one whole peck. But the way this guy had it done was it didn't cover his whole packet, came swinging in and went right above his, his man nipple. So now all of the, all of that is like colored in. So because of the pasting that's of his torso, your eye is just drawn to his right nipple.

Speaker 1:          01:05:08       Is he standing in the fucking pool? My neck was sore from shaking my head at people. It was, it was absolutely fucking horrific. Right? So anyways, um, I go back up to the, uh, I go back up to the hotel room. Right? You know, you gotta make sure that I'm all shipshape from my goddamn show and I put on the news and what are they ended up doing a story about, they start doing a story about the amount of, uh, fecal matter found in public pools right after I just got out of a goddamned pool. You know, and I know what people always think, oh, stay away from where the kids are. Stay away from the Kitty Pool Rights. Stay away from that. They always blame the fucking kids. Will I, you know, something that after seeing what I saw poolside, you know, there weren't a lot of kids in there, but I guarantee you somebody got a cola. I know this is fucking disgusting, but people, you're basically bathing, you don't see even more fucked up is, is Vegas is just like, you know, people fly in from all over the world. You're taking a fucking aids bath, you know, with a shot of fucking a, what the hell was that shit that came out, but it killed people so fast that it just burned out. Everybody just ran into the woods. The fuck was that shit called

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       Ah, Christ. I can't remember a bola. That's it with a shot of a bola or whatever. Food poisoning. I don't know what it is. A salmon, Ella shower, whatever the fuck you want to call it. I'm done with public pools. The only pool that I will ever swimming again is my pool. If I ever get one or the pool of some hot chip that I want to fucking bang, cause I have Nias permission. That's the only way it's going to go down. Other than that, you know, I'll just go. I'll just go take a bath.

Speaker 1:          01:07:06       That way I'm out of the sun, you know, I'll take a couple of vitamin E pills, whatever the fuck it is you get from the sun. Other than skin cancer, I'm done with it. You know what America needs to implement after years and years of calling the French people smelly. You know? That's Kinda like the thing when we went over to France and save their ass for the second time last century. Oh wait, did we do it once? We did it one time, right? I can't fucking remember. So anyways, we've always made fun of the French fathers. They smell. If you've ever watched a bugs bunny growing up, man, you saw pepe Le Pew. If you noticed he had a French accent, you know, that's the kind of shit you couldn't get away with today because of political correctness. I guess they were basically saying that you know that they stunk. But I'll tell you one thing that the French have when it comes to hygiene over Americans. All right? Is the big day. All right? I can guarantee you, if I ever go swimming in a public pool again, it's going to be at France. Unless there's a bunch of Americans or I know I've been over to England. I never saw the day over there, you know? But they is basically a carwash for your asshole. And, uh, you know, it leaves you feeling refreshed, puts a fucking smile on your face. And evidently in France, she's so fucking happy. You forget to put on deodorant, but I'll tell you right now, you can jump in that pool. I bet they're not dead, but they're not talking about that shit over there right.
