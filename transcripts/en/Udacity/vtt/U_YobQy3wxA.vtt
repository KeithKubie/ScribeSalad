As we saw Dr Zale using positive reinforcement to increase behavior, sometimes,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.689
we want to decrease behavior, and we can do that through extinction. And you'll

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.970
remember that we had extinction in classical conditioning also. For operant

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.778
conditioning, extinction is the process of withholding the reinforcer when the

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:21.647
behavior occurs. Eventually if you take the reinforce away that behavior is

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:24.827
going to decrease, so it's a process of removing the reinforcement and a

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:30.700
general decrease in behavior across time. Although it's easy to talk about

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.486
extinction, it can be difficult to implement. And one of the main reasons is

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:37.686
that behavior that's undergoing extinction often results in aggressive or

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:41.694
emotional behavior. And sometimes we originally see an increase in that

00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:44.540
behavior, when we start the extinction process.
