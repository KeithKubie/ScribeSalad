00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.736
- It's long enough for
both of us to be like,

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:06.306 align:start size:84% position:16%
"What is happening?
(laughing)

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.708
"Why are we fighting?"

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.811 line:0%
(soft dubstep music)

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.061
- Welcome to This Is
Not Happening presents

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.295
Fisticuffs.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.730
If you've never been
to the show before

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.698 align:start size:94% position:6%
this is a bunch of comics
telling fun stories

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.666
about real shit that happened.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.002 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Give it up for Kurt Braundhler
everybody, let him hear it.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.105 line:0%
(audience applauds)

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.544 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Give it up for Ari
everybody, keep it going.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.280
Okay.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.114
Hi.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.985
This is gonna be a
story about my first

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.987
and last bar fight ever.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:01:00.026 align:start size:97% position:3%
I know you're looking at
me, you're going, "Only one?

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.730
"Tough guy like you?"

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.900 align:start size:84% position:16%
I realize I look
like a camp counselor

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.337 align:start size:84% position:16%
for a camp that only
teaches feelings.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.311
But I did get into a
fight at a bar once.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.014
So the setting is, it was
my friend John's birthday

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.950
and so we went to this
bar and I love this bar.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.318
This is my favorite bar to go to

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:28.088
because they had
ice in the urinals.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.722
And ladies, I don't
know if you know this

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.692
but sometimes bars will
put ice in the urinals

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.027
and I love that.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.863
Because then I can imagine

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:39.532
that my penis is a giant laser

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:43.703 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I'm just destroying
Eskimo villages from space.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:50.143 align:start size:97% position:3%
And, oh, this bar is located
in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.544
I used to live in Baltimore,

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.079
has anybody ever
lived in Baltimore?

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.280
No? Alright.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.950 align:start size:84% position:16%
Baltimore is a
fucking crazy place

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.819
and it encourages a very
love hate relationship

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.287
with its citizenry.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.824 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, I remember, the only
way I think about Baltimore is

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.392 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think about Baltimore
the same way I think about

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.629
my alcoholic, autistic cousin.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.632 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, most of the time I
don't know what you're doing

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.601
and every once in
a while I'm like,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.804 align:start size:88% position:13%
"That is how many
nickles are in that jar.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.805
"Are you magic?

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.807
"You seem magic,
you seem magic."

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.542
I love you Baltimore.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.746
In fact, while I lived there
Kurt Schmoke was elected mayor.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.915
And he was elected mayor
on a literacy platform

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:32.652 align:start size:88% position:13%
because 20% of Baltimore
could not read.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.622
He gets elected,
takes all the money

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.790
for the literacy
program and builds

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
the Baltimore Ravens
football stadium

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.862 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then, with like the
remaining 10 cents left over

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:46.299
just has painted
on every bus stop

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.902
Baltimore: the city that reads.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.507 align:start size:97% position:3%
But every single one I ever
saw had been vandalized

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.444
to read, Baltimore:
the city that breeds.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:02.148
But they just put a
B in front of reads

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:06.920 align:start size:97% position:3%
so they all said Baltimore:
the city that breads.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.121
'Cause they're illiterate.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.691 align:start size:88% position:13%
You see Baltimore writes
a joke for itself.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:16.262
And that's why you
love it so much.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.166
So we go to this bar.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:23.002 align:start size:97% position:3%
We go to this bar specifically
'cause we want to dance.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.070
'Cause we're tough guys.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.271
You know how tough guys like to

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.840
go out dancing with each other.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.178
And the DJ is horrible.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.546
The DJ is terrible.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.815
The DJ's name is DJ Jazzay.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.553
He named himself that.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.257
We drink so much
the bar closes down

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.593
and kick everybody
out onto the street.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:50.129
And so we're all outside
waiting just to do nothing.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.631
There's nothing else to do.

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:54.968
And I don't know why
John decided to do this

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.803
but he leans over to
me and he just goes,

00:03:56.803 --> 00:04:00.907
"Hey man, I think DJ Jazzay
just called you a douchebag."

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:06.279 align:start size:84% position:16%
And now DJ Jazzay
was pretty far away.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.282
I don't think John could've
heard him if he did do that.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.651
But at the time I was very drunk

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.821 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I was also
really into spelling.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.289
Just as a concept.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.391 align:start size:84% position:16%
I would just spell out
everything for fun.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.627
I was a real piece of shit.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:25.131
So my response to this
news is to just start

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:29.168
scream spelling douchebag
at the top of my lungs.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:32.505
Just, D-O-U-C-H-E B-A-G,

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.308
D-O-U-S-C-H-E B-A-G.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.577
I don't even know how
to spell douchebag

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.846
but I am scream spelling it.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:43.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now, why I'm doing that,
agreed is confusing

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:49.322
but why DJ Jazzay chose
to take offense at it

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.923
is still beyond me.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.393
But he does.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.428
And he approaches me
and he gets in my face.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:58.064 align:start position:0%
And at this point now I'm still
scream spelling douchebag.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:01.100 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now I can understand
why he's upset.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.535
And he gets up in
there and I'm like,

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.804
oh, I'm gonna have a fight.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:10.677 align:start size:94% position:6%
And then I was like,
gotta come up with a plan.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:14.881
So my plan is I am going to
launch myself through the air

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:18.851 align:start size:81% position:19%
and attack his
soft middle parts.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.388
End of plan.

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:28.027 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm still scream spelling
douchebag but I've got a plan.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:32.098
DJ Jazzay pushes me, I kind of
get off balance a little bit

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:34.534
but I'm like, enact the plan!

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:38.638
So I jump, I leave the ground,

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:42.342 align:start size:88% position:13%
I screaming jump through
the air like this.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:46.045 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I don't know if you guys
know a lot about fighting

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:49.882 align:start size:88% position:13%
but one rule is, keep
your feet on the ground.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:54.053 align:start size:94% position:6%
It gives you a place to
hit from or run away from.

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:55.788
I leave the ground completely

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:58.057
but I'm a little bit
off balance when I do.

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I just end up just
grazing his side,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.664 align:start size:84% position:16%
falling to the ground,
spraining my wrist,

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:10.737 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then taking the skin off
my arm from here to here.

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.473
You can still see the
scar I think there.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.808
And now I'm fucking furious.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.815
'Cause this is my
first bar fight

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:27.587 align:start size:84% position:16%
and all of my injuries
are self-sustained.

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.658 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I remember having a
specific thought on the ground

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:35.528
of being like, I don't
want my future children

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.897
to see this moment.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.166 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's a weird thought
to have, I agree.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:43.002
And why Yvette and Klaus
would get in a time machine

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:44.704
and come back to that time.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.239
And see I don't
have children now

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.841
but that's what they're gonna
be named, like they're Nazis.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.443
I've already got it planned out.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:54.247 align:start size:84% position:16%
And watch their
father's humiliating
moments, I don't know.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.915
But I leap up with
that information

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:59.619
and I'm screaming now and
in DJ Jazzay Nice's eyes

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:01.053
you can see he's like, "Oh no.

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:04.857 align:start size:94% position:6%
"I have engaged with
someone who is not well."

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:09.028
And I grab him in what
can only be described

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.197
as like a reverse headlock.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:15.301 align:start size:88% position:13%
His head is this way and
his butt is this way.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.771 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I've just got him
comfortably around the middle.

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:21.674
And then my first thought is
to get him to the phone booth

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:22.842
which is on the corner.

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.544
It's about 15 feet away.

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.746
I don't know what my plan was.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.648
To like, kick some ass
and make some calls.

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.017
I don't know but
I was just like,

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:32.285
first thought, best thought.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.122 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then I just start
slowly waddling him over

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:40.359
to this phone booth
and it takes awhile.

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.728
It's long enough for
both of us to be like,

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.297
"What is happening?

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.801
"Why are we fighting?"

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm waddling him over
there and I'm just like,

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:55.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
I have to commit,
people are watching.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:58.511
I don't know what, and I
think, and this is 2000

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.246
in Baltimore, Maryland
so they still have like

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.881
glass stand-up phone booths.

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.617
And I maybe thought, maybe I
was gonna like bash his head

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:08.054
into the thing but
his hands are free.

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:11.224
So I go to like push him in
and he just opens the door

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.725
and kind of comes into it.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:16.729
And then I get in behind
him and close the door.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:24.971
And now

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.809
we are in this far
too intimate space.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.647 align:start size:94% position:6%
And we can't fight anymore
'cause we can't get

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.817 align:start size:84% position:16%
our arms out to like
punch each other.

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:42.755
And I don't know whose
thought it was first

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.391
but we both kind of decided

00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:48.461 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we're gonna
headbutt each other.

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:52.832 align:start size:88% position:13%
But we just kind of
like screw up the timing

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:57.003
and we end up just kind of
smashing mouths together.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.146 align:start size:84% position:16%
So there I am, the
light has now come on.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.149
I'm in a phone booth

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:15.121 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a man who's named
himself DJ Jazzay,

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.889
I'm bleeding onto him

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.060
and it's my first bar fight

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.162
and I just kissed a dude.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.833
And then, like I get out
and his friends grab him

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.035

I'm like, that's
right, that's right!

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.737
You get outta here.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:35.174 align:start size:88% position:13%
Or else, else I'll
suck your fucking dick!

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:41.380
And that's why I don't get
into bar fights anymore.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.748
Thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen.

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.751

guys, that's the episode.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.792
Thank you Kurt for doing in.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:56.262
Wow, what a tremendously
pussy-ish fight that was.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.998 align:start size:97% position:3%
I can't believe anyone
actually bragged about that.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:02.435 align:start size:97% position:3%
So last week I asked you
guys to leave us as comments

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.136
leave your best stripper names

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.105 align:start size:84% position:16%
and so we got a
bunch of good ones.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.874 align:start size:97% position:3%
Next week I want you guys
to leave your best DJ names.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.710
DJ Jazzay is a good one.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.644
That's horrible.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:12.845
Make one up.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.513
Or if you actually
know one let us know.

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:15.948
