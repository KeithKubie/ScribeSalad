00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.589
Remember before,

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.540
when I asked what you thought when
you heard of the term infinity?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.050
Infinity means something that
goes on forever without limit.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.440
Infinity can be positive or negative.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.570
This is how we write positive
infinity and if we want to write

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.115
negative infinity, we just write
a negative sign in front like that.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:24.888
So, which is the largest positive value,
is it infinity,

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:29.160
one trillion, one billion,
one quadrillion?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.070
Please select one.
