00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.950
This image is called the Blue Marble, and
it was taken in 1972 during the Apollo 17

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.950
mission.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.090
It has become a symbol not only of cool space
travel, but the environmental movement back

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.539
here on the ground.

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.230
Think about it: when you’re on the earth,
it seems pretty dang big and solid.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.060
But seen from far above, it’s just a blue
marble flecked with beautiful green.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.480
Inspiring, isolated, and not really all that
big.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.300
And thanks to technologies like air travel
and the Internet, and to a booming human population,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.080
it keeps feeling smaller.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.710
And thanks to technologies… and a booming
human population… it keeps losing those

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.780
all-important green flecks.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.149
Today is the history of climate science, which
leads to some dark questions about the future

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.600
of life on earth.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.320
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.120
Scientists tend to be conservative—not politically

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.800
conservative, but careful, resistant to big
claims.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.070
So evidence for the possible end of the living
world took a while to be seen as such.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.420
One problem was the structure of modern science.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
Remember how those ancient Greek, Indian,
and Chinese natural philosophers tended to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.690
study astronomy, math, the living world, and
human society, all at once?

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.979
By the 1900s, professional scientists had
gone in the other direction, specialization.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.890
Scientists tended to focus on learning about
one specific thing, often practically oriented

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.890
things.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.980
Another problem was actually epistemic: studying
weather patterns in one region is useful,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.659
but how do you study global climate?

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.909
How many local patterns add up to a global
one?

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.990
And there are so many elements involved in
the earth’s systems—solar radiation, human

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.710
activity, carbon, nitrogen, water, nonhumans:
how do you know which variables matter in

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.079
answering any given question?

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.060
Big Data suddenly becomes not a source of
potential answers, but a serious problem.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.289
So how did we get here?

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.489
English inventor Guy Callendar correctly predicted
rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.489
in 1938.

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.549
He analyzed measurements of temperatures from
the nineteenth century on, correlating them

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.790
with measurements of carbon dioxide.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.960
He saw that temperature had increased and
proposed that this was an effect of increasing

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.960
CO2.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.269
Most scientists were skeptical, but Callendar
died convinced he was onto something.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.260
And his work influenced a small number of
scientists.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.460
In 1957, Revelle published a paper with Hans
Suess suggesting that human emissions of greenhouse

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.320
gases like CO2
might create a “greenhouse effect”—these

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.519
heat-trapping gases would be trapped in the
atmosphere, not absorbed quickly enough by

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.260
the oceans—which would cause global warming.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.630
Revelle also convinced geochemist Charles
Keeling to keep measuring atmospheric CO2

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.799
concentrations at Mauna Loa Observatory, starting
in 1958.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.010
These measurements showed seasonal variation
as well as a clear arc over time: the planet

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.170
is warming, and CO2 is rising.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.610
This trend is called the Keeling Curve.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.510
In 1988, the World Meteorological Organisation
established the Intergovernmental Panel on

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.210
Climate Change, or IPCC, which has become
the premiere body for establishing just what

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.229
is going on with the earth’s climate.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:22.519
And in 1996, the governments of the world
came together to ban chlorofluorocarbons or

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.500
CFCs, a group of odorless chemicals that were
used in hair sprays, refrigerators, and lots

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.810
of other places… and that were causing a
hole in the earth’s protective ozone layer.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.550
By the 2000s, many scientists had overcome
their conservatism to speak out about global

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.010
shifts in climate which were affecting living
systems of all sorts, agriculture, cities,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.269
and, well, everything.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.989
In 2000, atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen
coined a term for these global shifts, and—however

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.620
imperfect—it has stuck: the Anthropocene,
or the “Age of Man.”

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.580
Some scholars have called into question naming
this era after “the” human, as if all

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.010
humans are equally to blame.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.299
Other contenders include Donna Haraway’s
the Chthulhucene, or Age of Science Fictional

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.820
Badness; the Manthropocene, or Age of Dudes,
which not so subtly hints at the gender bias

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.660
in science; and, catching on with some historians,
the Capitalocene, or Age of Political–Economics.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.390
This is a fight among historians over how
to discuss longue durée history, or history

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.810
across many millennia.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.590
It’s also a fight among geologists about
where to place so-called “golden spikes”—moments

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.420
that represent shifts in the very makeup of
the earth, usually visible shifts in the fossil

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.420
record.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.140
In fact, the Anthropocene is a political fight
about the intersection of geological epochs

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.140
and human history.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.270
The problem with the Anthropocene is there
are so many good candidates for the golden

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.050
spike of a human epoch.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.180
Show us, ThoughtBubble:
First, there’s the original fossil fuel—coal—which

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.500
was mined extensively in certain regions starting
in the late 1700s and ramping up seriously

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.820
in the late 1800s—the Industrial Revolution.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.780
Second, there’s radioactive material in
the form of strontium-90, which could be traced

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.430
all over the world
soon after the Trinity atomic bomb test—the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.250
first of many such tests.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.180
So this date for the beginning of the Anthropocene
would be the specific date of July 16, 1945—the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.380
day of the Trinity Test and the birth of the
Cold War.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.800
Third, there’s plastic, steel, and concrete—but
especially plastic.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.240
Humans built stuff and even had plastic before
World War Two, but development took off at

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.020
an unprecedented pace around 1960.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.330
This “Great Acceleration” saw rapid, often
exponential growth in human population, use

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.351
of freshwater, ability to produce and move
food, greenhouse gas emissions, temperature

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:46.520
of the earth’s surface, and consumption
of natural resources of all kinds.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.050
The period of the Great Acceleration also
gave rise to the first megacities, or urban

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.390
areas with over ten million people.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.920
In reaction to massive urbanization, humans
have also set aside more land as national

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.570
parks or greenways, creating a landscape dominated
by industrial agriculture and cities but also

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.750
sporting well-defined breaks of deep green.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.990
All of these changes can be seen in the earth’s
geological record, and they all symbolize

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.370
how some humans have changed the physical
world.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.070
But perhaps the best candidate is number four:
chicken bones!

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.389
With more than twenty-three billion alive
at any time, chickens—whose bodies have

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.330
been heavily designed by humans—are the
most common terrestrial vertebrate species

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.390
on the planet.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.310
Aliens visiting the ruins of earth could reasonably
conclude from our fossil record that the only

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.310
life-form that ever mattered on this planet
was the chicken.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.490
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.160
But the Anthropocene is only one way of viewing
geological change and human disruption of

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.610
natural cycles.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.540
Also influential are the Planetary Boundaries—a
set of nine specific ranges for natural processes

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.540
within which humans can definitely live.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.980
These include measures such as climate change,
ocean acidification, and ozone depletion,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.510
but also the genetic diversity of life on
earth and how much land is converted to cropland.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.280
But we can’t talk about climate disruption
without mentioning the pushback.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.490
Even though the vast majority of scientists
realized that humans have had a tremendous

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.980
impact on the earth, politically conservative
talk shows run stories about how there’’s

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.130
no consensus.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.120
So where did this idea come from?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.650
In 2010, geologist and historian of science
Naomi Oreskes and NASA historian Erik Conway

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.320
showed that fossil fuel companies had hired
some of the same PR agents and strategists

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.880
who had worked for the tobacco companies,
decades earlier, to invent climate denial:

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.340
that is, to create doubt about science that
was not doubted by scientists.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.290
Ultimately, climate science isn’t just about
long-term shifts in the movement of carbon,

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.480
water, heat, and other natural phenomena.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:54.290
The big questions for scientists in the Capitalocene
include epistemic, technical, and moral ones.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:00.050
Epistemic questions include how fast are humans,
and especially humans working within capitalism

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.520
changing which ecosystems, in what ways?

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.919
For example, we know that many important pollinators
such as honeybees, bumblebees, and butterflies

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:07.919
are dying out.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.940
Which is real sad, but also potentially an enormous problem.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.700
And we have some ideas as to why.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:18.639
A major cause is off-target damage from pesticides—which,
no surprise, they literally are made to kill

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.639
bugs.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:21.949
But which pesticides affect which bugs in
which ways?

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:23.389
Are there are safe options?

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:27.669
Can we test lots of ways of doing agriculture
and see which is most bug-friendly?

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:33.459
And which forms of agriculture are most likely
to erode soil from the land, and which help

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:34.690
build soil back up?

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.919
Basically: what kinds of knowledge do we need
to make today, in a connected, fragile, increasingly

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.680
“disrupted” world?

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.770
In terms of technical questions, earth scientists
are increasingly being pushed from the role

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.610
of description to recommending action.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.610
Some prominent scientists are calling for
governments to seriously consider geoengineering,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:58.800
also known as climate engineering: the intentional,
global-scale transformation of the environment

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.550
to combat global warming and other disruptions.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.990
Some geoengineering would be relatively uncontroversial,
likelike creating more forests.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.740
But other ideas have been hotly debated,
likelike fertilizing the ocean with iron to

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.120
accelerate the growth of algae, thus capturing
more CO2 from the atmosphere.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.620
But perhaps the biggest shift in professional
sciencing today is moral.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.370
Who should pay for solutions to global-scale
problems such as sea-level rise and global

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.370
warming?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.370
Everyone?

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.600
Or only the people who most contributed to
the problem?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.830
The Yellow Vest movement in France is a recent
example of this conflict: people across the

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:37.520
country were subject to a new tax on fuel,
in order to help lower carbon emissions.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.850
But many of the working poor, especially in
more rural areas, simply couldn’t afford

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.750
to pay more to get around, and riots broke
out.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.120
And think about all of the scientists working
on topics related to the environment but…

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.310
maybe on the wrong side of history.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.770
What if you are a professional geologist,
and Exxon, BP, or Shell hired you to find

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.940
more fossil fuels to extract?

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.480
Should you not do the science you’ve spent
a decade getting really good at?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.970
What if you work for a chemical company to
study the unintended effects of a pesticides

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.399
on animals, and when you report your findings,
the company tries to bury them?

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:15.010
And that's not a hypothetical, it's exactly what happened to leading amphibian
endocrinologist Tyrone Hayes in the 2000s.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.029
He reported to Syngenta that one of their
key products, the herbicide atrazine, disrupts

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:24.240
the hormones of frogs and may have other serious
unintended consequences.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.410
And for that, Syngenta spent years trying
to discredit their former collaborator.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.050
As it approaches the present, the history
of science and technology becomes less about

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:39.370
discoveries and inventions and more about
how the choice to make specific knowledge—or

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.080
bury that knowledge—is highly political.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.960
This isn’t a portrait of doomsday, but a
call to reflect on science’s strengths…

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.310
and its limits.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.500
Science alone can’t answer tough questions
about how humanity should address climate

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.110
disruption, and who should pay for potential
solutions.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.260
One thing is certain: whether we call it the
Anthropocene, Capitalocene, or something else,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.730
the new era in which some humans have dragged
the Blue Marble will forever change how we

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.140
make and share knowledge and tools.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.820
Next time—we’ll finish the series with
a look at how science is gendered: not only

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.180
how important women have been to the history
of science, and how difficult it sometimes

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.420
is to tell their stories.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:25.440
But also how our understandings of the natural
world reflect our ideas about humanity.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.300
