00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.250
We're going to use the master detail
structure in the Von Villain's app

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.020
to show details on each villain.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.770
Here you can see the villain table and

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.260
then if I could click on Jaws a detail
view appears with an image and

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.670
a label and if I go back I can do
the same for any of the villains.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.739
You've already seen all the steps to
build this now it's time to put them

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:19.380
all together.
