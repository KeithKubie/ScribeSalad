&gt;&gt;Teacher: -- the most important
things we learn about the galaxy,

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:09.176
the great power of the universe.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:19.586
And please look around you--

00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:22.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This is
the digital generation.

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:25.836
&gt;&gt;Girl: I text more
than I call people.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.586
Like no one calls anyone anymore.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.236
&gt;&gt;Girl: My iPod is
like my entire life.

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:33.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A generation of
kids raised in a media rich,

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.706
networked world of
infinite possibilities.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.776
&gt;&gt;Boy: A lot of my movies
are special effects,

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:43.176
things that you really
couldn't do in real life.

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:46.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They are learning,
communicating and socializing

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:48.106
in new and exciting ways.

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:52.556
&gt;&gt;Boy: I'm showing video to the
other people that are in the meeting

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:54.116
to get them to help review.

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:57.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For them,
technology is more than a tool.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.566
It's an essential component
of everyday life

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.066
that frames their world view.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:05.336
&gt;&gt;Girl: These are all different
people in need in Haiti,

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:08.326
and click on one of these families.

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:09.846
Learn more.

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:11.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But there's
more to their world

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:13.346
than just playing with cool gadgets.

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:15.346
It's about engagement.

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.116
&gt;&gt;Girl: Okay, guys, join.

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:18.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Self directed learning.

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:20.666
&gt;&gt;Boy: It's not just animation.

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.906
You need to know a lot
of different things

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:26.166
like biology, to see how things move.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:27.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Creativity.

00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:30.676
&gt;&gt;Girl: This is my avatar
as she typically will look.

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:32.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And empowerment.

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:34.156
&gt;&gt;Girl: Do you think there
can be people that will try

00:02:34.156 --> 00:02:35.346
and hurt you on a website?

00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:39.836
&gt;&gt;I'm teaching young, elementary
kids how to stay safe online.

00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:43.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They're hyper connected
to their friends and family,

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:46.976
mastering new tools and
techniques with ease.

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:49.806
&gt;&gt;Girl: I like this
'cause it's competitive

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:53.296
and it's really using
strategy in your mind.

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:55.736
&gt;&gt;Henry: For those kids who
become leaders of guilds in World

00:02:55.736 --> 00:03:00.006
of Warcraft, that's as much an
experience as being the captain

00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.586
of the football team, being the
editor of the school newspaper.

00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:08.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Behind every successful
kid are adults and peers who guide,

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:09.726
motivate and support them.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:11.136
&gt;&gt;Akili : Kids on their
own are jumping

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:13.306
across from all these different
mediums, so we really need

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:15.926
to kinda explore all of them as
well, and try to support kids

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:18.476
to become better producers
and consumers.

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:19.706
&gt;&gt;Did you put sound in it?

00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:20.226
&gt;&gt;Boy: It's annoying.

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:21.156
I don't like it anymore.

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:24.426
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Very rarely, the kids look
at instruction manuals these days.

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:28.606
They are empowered to just go out
and learn, and if I'm a parent

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:31.776
and I'm wondering, "Wow, how do I
provide the technology resources

00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:32.356
for my children?"

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:34.546
just get outta their way.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:37.456
&gt;&gt;Liz Perle: Hey, this digital
life, it's a good thing.

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:41.806
It's gonna help your kids
create, meet people, explore,

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:43.916
compose, express themselves.

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:46.856
They have more powerful
tools than they've ever had

00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:47.976
in any generation in history.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:51.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This is
the digital generation.

00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:54.946
Welcome to their world.
