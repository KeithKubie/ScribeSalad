00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:02.447
(click)

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.055
(light piano music)

00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:13.139
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.639
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:21.753
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:25.926
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:28.343
Aware that death is evitable.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:31.413
Yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:34.146
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:37.770
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.853
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.895
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:44.895
to the past.

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:50.501
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:54.668
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:59.727
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:01.310
of humans like you.

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.244
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.852
- So I thought I'd take
the director's prerogative

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:41.255
and spend the first five,
ten minutes going back

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:44.680
in time over some of the
events that lead to the work

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.053
I'm going to present.

00:01:46.053 --> 00:01:48.184
And also because some of
the people that are here

00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:50.750
in the audience are involved in some

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.012
of these early phenomemon.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:56.679
So first let's step
back and go to the 1950s

00:01:57.706 --> 00:02:01.443
when the work of many
people had clearly shown

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:05.293
that we shared a common
ancestor with the great apes.

00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:08.118
Most likely the chimpanzee
but it was considered

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:12.141
to be this great golf that
needed to be resolved.

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:15.711
In Sarich and Wilson in the
60s immunochemical techniques

00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.418
and Goodman, Russ Doolittle
here in the audience

00:02:19.418 --> 00:02:22.699
and others showed but most of
the proteins were identical.

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.967
Sequences are essentially identical.

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:28.555
And Mary Claire King in
her thesis work was asked

00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:30.722
to find something different.

00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:33.033
And she couldn't find much at all.

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.710
So they wrote this famous
paper that said that maybe

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.608
the genes are nearly identical.

00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:38.917
And the proteins identical,

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:40.767
they're just expressed differently.

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:43.755
And this theory actually
held, believe it or not,

00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:45.394
for almost 20 years.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:48.041
A part of it is definitely true

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:52.318
until Maynard Olson, who is
also here in the audience,

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:56.017
suggested in 1999 that
gene loss may be important.

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:58.490
That is getting rid of a gene
might be just as interesting

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.501
as having more a gene or changing
a gene or it's expression.

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.668
By some coincidence, actually,
that the end of that year

00:03:07.677 --> 00:03:11.327
just before that we
reported the first genomic

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:13.993
and biochemical difference
between humans and great apes.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.748
The first known at the time.

00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:18.956
And it was due to gene loss, CMAH.

00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:20.930
I'll come back to what CMAH is.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.645
So let's define some of the words here.

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:24.663
Hominin.

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:28.901
Hominins are human ancestors
and our extinct evolutionary

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.249
relatives, that is Neanderthals example.

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:36.421
Hominids are human ancestors
and our living and extinct

00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:39.505
evolutionary relatives, which
includes the great apes.

00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:40.826
So we go back to our diagram here.

00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:43.317
There are the hominids.

00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:44.843
And there are the hominins.

00:03:44.843 --> 00:03:47.787
And we are one of the group of hominins.

00:03:47.787 --> 00:03:50.149
So if you go back into
detailed background-

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.656
oh before of the aficionados get upset

00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:57.810
the branching relationships
here only do not reflect timing.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.554
The branch link does not,
it's just relationships.

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:03.596
And there is one time
point that does matter

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:07.179
and that's the one shown
down there, .5 million years.

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.133
Right here is .5 million years.

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:12.622
The junction where the common
ancestors, Neanderthals,

00:04:12.622 --> 00:04:14.021
Denisovans and humans.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.801
So let's look at what
happened going up to there

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:17.573
and this is a very complex slide.

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:19.922
But it includes all the known information

00:04:19.922 --> 00:04:22.702
except for the last couple
of years from Wood and Boyle.

00:04:22.702 --> 00:04:27.016
Talking about all the
different hominins that existed

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:30.710
in Africa until about
two million years ago

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.268
when the genus homo emerged
and not only stayed behind

00:04:34.268 --> 00:04:36.629
in Africa and spread across Africa

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.759
and spread all across the old world.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.676
And eventually gave rise
to us again in Africa.

00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:50.024
Homo, of course, had a
wanderlust and wondered all over

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:52.142
the old world, never
crossed the water way.

00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:55.120
He couldn't see the other
side as far as we know.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.699
But otherwise, you've heard
of peeking man, java man

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.304
and so on.

00:04:59.304 --> 00:05:01.904
This probably went on for
about two million years

00:05:01.904 --> 00:05:05.401
and finally our own species,
again the numbers have changed.

00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:09.235
They change every month now
because of new data coming in.

00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:11.034
But the general pattern is true.

00:05:11.034 --> 00:05:14.092
Emerged in Africa and
spread out across the world

00:05:14.092 --> 00:05:16.420
essentially replacing
all the other species.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.350
Including the species in Africa
with limited interbreeding.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.317
So we had found a pseudogenization,

00:05:22.317 --> 00:05:25.855
a gene deletion in
humans and this has to do

00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:28.887
with sialic acid,
another word in my title.

00:05:28.887 --> 00:05:31.027
So what's sialic acid?

00:05:31.027 --> 00:05:34.529
All cells in nature without
exception are coded with a

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.203
dense array of glycans or sugar chains.

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:41.666
Here's a classic slide
from in the early days.

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:45.141
He always saw the stuff
sitting on the surface.

00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:47.696
But if you look over
here at a mammalian cell

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:50.880
you can see this huge
thick layer of sugars.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.346
Same in the bacterium
and even many viruses

00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:55.135
are coated with sugars.

00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:58.837
So this massive layer of
glycans which is sort of a dark

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:01.283
matter of the biological universe.

00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:03.231
That most people don't study or even

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.561
acknowledge their existence.

00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:08.503
You didn't see it in any of the
slides in the first session.

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:12.038
(audience laughing)

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:16.484
- So this on the outer most
strip of vertebrate glycans

00:06:16.484 --> 00:06:19.125
are these sugars called
sialic acid which sit out

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.042
at the tip.

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:22.696
There's a lot of them.

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:25.622
There can be millions and tens
and even hundreds of millions

00:06:25.622 --> 00:06:27.372
of copies per cell.

00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:30.595
A recent calculation said that
a lymphasite had a density

00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:33.345
of 100 millimolar on the surface.

00:06:34.302 --> 00:06:36.467
That's right, millimolar.

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:37.821
That's a lot.

00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:41.675
And so obviously they must
have a lot of biological roles.

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:45.842
And the story we have been
pursuing is the fact that

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.935
there are many kinds of sialic acids.

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:53.633
The two most common ones are
called Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc.

00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:55.226
(audience laughing)

00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:57.540
- [Ajit] Yes, we have some
rock and rollers in my group.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.006
(audience laughing)

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:02.587
- [Ajit] And Gc is
derived from Ac by adding

00:07:02.587 --> 00:07:03.643
one oxygen atom

00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:05.893
by this enzyme called CMAH.

00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:09.133
And so here's that single oxygen atom.

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:12.332
You may think that's
trivial but that's a single

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.648
oxygen atom added to 100
millimolar concentration

00:07:14.648 --> 00:07:15.928
of something on the cell's surface.

00:07:15.928 --> 00:07:18.195
So that's a big effect.

00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:20.803
And what we basically found
was that Gc was missing

00:07:20.803 --> 00:07:23.803
in humans due to a mutation in CMAH.

00:07:25.163 --> 00:07:28.372
Looking further into this
with Toshiyuki Hayakawa,

00:07:28.372 --> 00:07:31.180
Yoko Satta and Naoyuki Takahata

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.979
we found, Pascal and I
found that there was this

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:39.028
alu-mediated inactivation
that occurred in this manner

00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:42.304
taking out this critical exon
that is fixed in all humans.

00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:45.804
All of you have this mutation, homozygous.

00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:48.861
And this exercise was also
useful because this allowed

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:51.062
timing by several different methods,

00:07:51.062 --> 00:07:52.500
none of which are perfect.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.323
But I won't go into the details of timing.

00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:56.170
But all of them gave a time

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.346
of about 2.5 to 3.5 million years

00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:01.189
where the mutation first occurred.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.106
So we went further and collaborated

00:08:05.022 --> 00:08:06.819
with Sevante Paabo and Meave Leakey

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:10.386
back at that time
looking at fossil samples

00:08:10.386 --> 00:08:12.664
and the sort of side fraction
from the DNA extraction

00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:15.386
we could find only Ac
in Neanderthal fossils.

00:08:15.386 --> 00:08:18.805
So we thought that maybe
there was no geno sequence

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:19.942
at the time.

00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:21.772
Also missing CMAH.

00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:23.585
But then the question came up,

00:08:23.585 --> 00:08:26.252
how did this mutation get fixed?

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:31.486
And Pascal came up with
a very interesting idea.

00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:33.943
After all, when you get a
mutation if this mutation

00:08:33.943 --> 00:08:36.272
is due to a pathogen that is binding Gc

00:08:36.272 --> 00:08:39.031
leaving some people with Gc negative,

00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:41.770
you're expecting kind of a
polymorphism like you see

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.082
in sickle cell disease.

00:08:43.082 --> 00:08:44.195
How does it get fixed?

00:08:44.195 --> 00:08:47.049
By the time we had mice
with the same mutation

00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:49.108
which have a lot of phenotypes
by the way that I'm not

00:08:49.108 --> 00:08:51.595
going to go into, human life phenotypes.

00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:54.616
So we could do this
experiment that he suggested.

00:08:54.616 --> 00:08:58.116
Which was to show that while the rare male

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:01.569
that is Gc negative,

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:04.969
because a large number
of males are Gc positive.

00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:08.154
The Gc positive sperm are
killed by antibodies produced

00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:09.729
by the female.

00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:13.355
In fact, humans serum will
kill chimpanzee sperm also.

00:09:13.355 --> 00:09:16.722
And so Steve Springer
actually did a calculation

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:20.051
saying that within 30 to 650 generations

00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:23.128
this could actually generate two lineages.

00:09:23.128 --> 00:09:27.295
And so the hazard of this
might be the genus homo.

00:09:28.508 --> 00:09:31.635
Unfortunately sialic acids
and DNA do not survive

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:32.908
in African fossils.

00:09:32.908 --> 00:09:36.835
Samples the Meave Leakey gave
us had no sialic acid in them.

00:09:36.835 --> 00:09:39.350
But very recently, this
is hot off the press,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.731
we found that these N-glycolyl
groups, these Gc groups,

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:47.327
actually survive in a byproduct
called chondroitin sulfate

00:09:47.327 --> 00:09:48.910
in ancient fossils.

00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:53.583
In fact, Meave sent us some
samples from a four million

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:57.750
year old bovid fossil and
we could find GCCS there.

00:09:59.037 --> 00:10:02.235
We now wonder whether we
can go back to this theory

00:10:02.235 --> 00:10:05.790
and try to improve our
techniques and convince people

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.789
to share with us small amounts
of their hominins samples.

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:13.748
If you can do that we could end
up with N-glycol-CS positive

00:10:13.748 --> 00:10:15.860
N-glycolyl-CS negative fossils

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.336
and this brunch would then
try to break up this big bush

00:10:19.336 --> 00:10:22.545
that everybody's studying right now.

00:10:22.545 --> 00:10:24.612
And get some lineage out of it.

00:10:24.612 --> 00:10:26.652
Okay, what's a Siglec?

00:10:26.652 --> 00:10:29.422
A Siglec is a molecule,
a family of molecules

00:10:29.422 --> 00:10:31.824
that we discovered and
named some years ago

00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:35.134
which through this red domain in the

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:38.717
this is the cell membrane
bind sialic acid.

00:10:39.862 --> 00:10:42.575
They have many functions, but
one of their major functions

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:46.112
is the subgroup called
CD33-related Siglecs.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.643
What they basically do is see sialic acid

00:10:48.643 --> 00:10:51.484
as self associated molecular patterns.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.140
You hear about danger associated
and pathogen associated

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.643
molecular patterns, why
don't you cells attack you?

00:10:56.643 --> 00:10:58.923
One of the reasons is they see sialic acid

00:10:58.923 --> 00:11:00.006
and say halt.

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.258
So the immune cell is stopped by that.

00:11:03.258 --> 00:11:07.341
So you can think of it as
brakes on immune cells.

00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:11.747
These molecule patterns
are actually widespread.

00:11:11.747 --> 00:11:13.699
Pascal suggests that I show this picture

00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:16.616
because the picture
speaks a thousand words.

00:11:16.616 --> 00:11:20.526
Here's a fresh blood smear
that's glycophorin on the surface

00:11:20.526 --> 00:11:22.720
covered with sialic acid red blood cells.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.640
Here's a white blood cell in neutrophil

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.376
and you can see all the
Siglec-9 is clustered.

00:11:26.376 --> 00:11:29.260
The red cells are holding
to the neutrophils

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.644
saying wait there buddy,
you're not ready to fight yet.

00:11:32.644 --> 00:11:35.291
And so, of course, pathogens
have taken advantage of this

00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:39.357
and it turns out that
no pathogen can make Gc.

00:11:39.357 --> 00:11:41.202
How have we lost Gc?

00:11:41.202 --> 00:11:43.928
We threw away our best cell signal.

00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:47.461
Now we have these bugs of
wolf in sheep's clothing

00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:49.211
that are invading us.

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:52.751
And so then we found a
second mutation effecting

00:11:52.751 --> 00:11:55.834
sialic acid biology in Siglec-12

00:11:55.834 --> 00:11:58.556
and here had fixed genomic changes,

00:11:58.556 --> 00:12:02.041
polymorphic genomic changes
and major expression changes

00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:04.725
in three of the major categories.

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.973
But we're really quite frustrated
because without the level

00:12:07.973 --> 00:12:09.701
of molecular biology we could do

00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:11.254
we couldn't go much further.

00:12:11.254 --> 00:12:15.974
But fortunately many
people are getting interest

00:12:15.974 --> 00:12:17.571
in the chimpanzee genome.

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.988
This is an article I wrote and baby Papot

00:12:21.869 --> 00:12:25.351
photographed by Pascal
Gagneux and Sarah Varki

00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:26.486
by Hudson Freeze.

00:12:26.486 --> 00:12:28.195
I did get permission from Sarah Varki.

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:29.502
(audience laughing)

00:12:29.502 --> 00:12:31.676
- [Ajit] And go Maynard
got excited about this

00:12:31.676 --> 00:12:34.603
and actually 9/11 has
something to do with it.

00:12:34.603 --> 00:12:38.724
That's a story for another
time and white papers

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:41.023
are submitted we actually
had the first ever symposium

00:12:41.023 --> 00:12:44.534
just before the chimpanzee
genome came out.

00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:47.449
That's Sarah again with her permission.

00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:50.131
So now we have the sequence
the chimpanzee genome

00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:54.053
and fast forward now 10-12
years and we could look

00:12:54.053 --> 00:12:55.971
at all these Siglecs.

00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:58.191
The long and the short of
it is in the circle of life

00:12:58.191 --> 00:13:02.274
that Pascal drew for me,
we find rows of Siglecs,

00:13:04.141 --> 00:13:08.682
mutations of Siglecs
involving many different parts

00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:11.309
of the circle of life.

00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:15.793
From cells ranging from sperm
to Gut Epithelia to T&amp;B cells

00:13:15.793 --> 00:13:19.960
to Pancreatic Islets and
ROS Production and so on.

00:13:22.336 --> 00:13:25.522
The problem was that we
had just one or two genomes

00:13:25.522 --> 00:13:27.514
of each of the apes.

00:13:27.514 --> 00:13:30.182
There's always this worry,
is it just genome quality?

00:13:30.182 --> 00:13:31.339
Is this just chance?

00:13:31.339 --> 00:13:33.609
Is just ascertainment bias?

00:13:33.609 --> 00:13:37.734
Are we like the proverbial
drunk looking under the lamppost

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.817
for the keys?

00:13:41.942 --> 00:13:43.917
Fortunately at that time Evan Elchler

00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:46.886
and Tomas Marques-Bonet came
up wit great ape genetic

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:48.726
diversity and population history

00:13:48.726 --> 00:13:51.652
involving many people in CARTA as well.

00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:54.406
So we had access to ape genomes.

00:13:54.406 --> 00:13:57.090
Now we could get a reasonable
number of ape genomes,

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.273
not as many as humans of course

00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:01.162
but still something to work with.

00:14:01.162 --> 00:14:03.538
We did that, it turned
out that in fact even some

00:14:03.538 --> 00:14:06.681
of the polymorphisms we
thought were fixed in apes

00:14:06.681 --> 00:14:10.378
were not fixed, they're
polymorphic, they're not fixed.

00:14:10.378 --> 00:14:13.865
So in fact we've seen that
apes don't have many mutations

00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:17.036
so this finding over here,
and some of these of course

00:14:17.036 --> 00:14:20.536
expression pattern changes is significant.

00:14:22.872 --> 00:14:26.107
We've shown you multiple
genome events altering hominin

00:14:26.107 --> 00:14:29.867
sialic acid biology and now
we'll come to the actual topic

00:14:29.867 --> 00:14:32.617
of the, about the common ancestor

00:14:34.011 --> 00:14:36.157
of humans and Neanderthals.

00:14:36.157 --> 00:14:38.590
These mutations are all
found in African populations

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.244
so they predated the common
origin of modern humans.

00:14:42.244 --> 00:14:45.787
Actually a paper just on
line including Tony Capra

00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:49.637
I think is here, shows that
genes involved in sialic acid

00:14:49.637 --> 00:14:52.556
biology do not harbor at
least strong signatures

00:14:52.556 --> 00:14:54.668
of recent positive selection.

00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:58.314
So they're of more ancient origin.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.814
Stephane and Kay from Lifesake

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:04.276
showed a new method
and showed that in fact

00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:06.812
there's no evidence of strong
selection on these genes

00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:08.727
after the divergence of humans

00:15:08.727 --> 00:15:11.352
and Neanderthal common ancestors.

00:15:11.352 --> 00:15:15.019
So now we can zoom in
here and start looking

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:20.124
at the wonderful data that
Servante Paabo and so many others

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.469
have generated on Neanderthal
and Denisovan genomes.

00:15:24.469 --> 00:15:29.261
Looking at these sequences
we find that we can find

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:33.205
essentially all these
mutations, almost all of them,

00:15:33.205 --> 00:15:36.541
although obviously the population
sizes here are very small

00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:38.772
so we don't know if they're fixed or not.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:42.939
We can find mutations
Siglec-3, 12, 14, 16, 13, 17,

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.580
Siglec-12, CMAH.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.667
There's a few other genes
that we're looking at.

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:50.595
As for these expression pattern changes

00:15:50.595 --> 00:15:52.467
we've looked at comparisons with chimps

00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:54.300
and bonobos and so on.

00:15:55.262 --> 00:15:58.303
We don't have all the
possible comparisons.

00:15:58.303 --> 00:16:00.655
Something seems to be going
on where a large number

00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:04.156
of genes seem to have been
turned on in the human lineage

00:16:04.156 --> 00:16:05.489
in many tissues.

00:16:07.607 --> 00:16:11.416
What we believe is that
this cluster of genes

00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:14.631
in chromosome 19 has
undergone some changes.

00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:17.687
Clearly undergone a
lot of genomic changes.

00:16:17.687 --> 00:16:22.100
And perhaps, secondarily,
perhaps effecting epigenitics

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.048
in transcription and so on.

00:16:24.048 --> 00:16:27.375
Also, produce a lot of ectopic expression.

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:30.800
We think of Siglecs and
various other tissues,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.820
but there's a lot more work
to be done before we can

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.625
say much about that.

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:37.919
But in terms of what we
think happened, you can never

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:41.373
be sure in evolution you
just make up stories and see

00:16:41.373 --> 00:16:42.533
if they fit.

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:45.611
It's more like a murder
mystery and actually a patient

00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:47.985
in a coma in an emergency
is the kind of thing

00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:51.173
I'm more used to doing actually.

00:16:51.173 --> 00:16:54.629
But we think that the CMAH
mutation really occurred

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:56.567
two to three million years ago.

00:16:56.567 --> 00:16:58.682
We have some other
connections to the genus homo

00:16:58.682 --> 00:17:00.712
that we haven't published yet.

00:17:00.712 --> 00:17:04.355
Perhaps there was some
incident or incidents

00:17:04.355 --> 00:17:07.981
involving loss of CMAH
and selection of the kind

00:17:07.981 --> 00:17:10.024
that we suggested.

00:17:10.024 --> 00:17:13.529
And perhaps pathogens and it
turns out that the binding

00:17:13.529 --> 00:17:16.072
pockets of the Siglecs, I'm
not showing you the data,

00:17:16.072 --> 00:17:19.267
have evolved very rapidly as well.

00:17:19.267 --> 00:17:22.184
So maybe there was selection there.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.260
Conclusions-

00:17:25.407 --> 00:17:29.115
multiple genomic events
altering hominin and sialic acid

00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:31.949
and Siglec biology and there's
and few other sialic acid

00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:35.618
changes I've not mentioned,
predate the common ancestor

00:17:35.618 --> 00:17:36.841
of humans and Neanderthals.

00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:38.639
Actually I don't know of any
other system where there's

00:17:38.639 --> 00:17:40.527
been so many changes.

00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:42.955
There are likely multiple
selection forces affecting

00:17:42.955 --> 00:17:46.628
innate immunity and
host-pathogen interactions.

00:17:46.628 --> 00:17:50.014
And perhaps, this is the interesting part,

00:17:50.014 --> 00:17:52.133
the secondary consequence
has been human-specific

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:55.926
expression of CD33rSiglecs in
unusual cell types and tissues

00:17:55.926 --> 00:18:00.334
including brain, microglere,
mucosal surfaces,

00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:03.917
reproductive system,
amnion, placenta, etc.

00:18:05.692 --> 00:18:09.755
So I'll leave it there
and say that we have a lot

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.331
of work to do.

00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:15.052
Encourage others interested
in this area to join us

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:16.773
in this pursuit.

00:18:16.773 --> 00:18:18.010
Thank you.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.036
(applause)

00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:23.619
(upbeat music)
