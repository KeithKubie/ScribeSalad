00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.665
This wave has the largest, what we call, amplitude which is this distance from

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:08.273
this imaginary middle line up to the peak. All these other waves have smaller

00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:11.636
amplitudes. It's this amplitude of the wave that controls the loudness and the

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:15.045
loudness of a sound is measured in something called decibels.

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:18.990
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, is amplitude the only way a wave can be different?

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.545
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, you tell me. Amplitude affects the volume of a sound. Is volume the only

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:24.530
property of sound that we can hear?

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.050
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, no, some are really low and some are really really high, like high pitch

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.910
voices compared to low pitch voices.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.265
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly, and you've said yourself. You used the word pitch and pitch is

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:37.415
actually controlled by what's called the frequency of a wave.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:39.545
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Andy, what exactly is frequency?

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.338
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, remember have we said that waves will be caused by these little

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:44.060
vibrations? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.620
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, frequency just measures how many vibrations are happening each second.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.980
So, if something's vibrating slowly, or if it's vibrating quickly. And we

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.844
measure this with a unit called Hertz. So, if these vibrations are slow, we get

00:00:55.844 --> 00:01:00.188
a low frequency wave. If they're fast, we get a high frequency wave.

00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:02.204
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I see.
