00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.680
RYAN LOREN: Darien, thanks a
lot for being here, man.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.300
DARIEN: Thank you
for having me.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.940
RYAN LOREN: It's been a long
time coming, and I'm happy to

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.550
have you here.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.060
DARIEN: Absolutely happy
to be here, man.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.990
RYAN LOREN: Just wanted to have
a quick chat before the

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.710
performance.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.180
So just real quick, tell us
about yourself-- where you

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.260
come from, your heritage, and
what Black History Month means

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.180
to you, because this
is a celebration of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.000
Black History Month.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.520
DARIEN: Absolutely.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.950
Well, my name is Darien Dean.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.810
I'm an independent solo artist
out of Mount Vernon, New York.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.740
It's a great time to be an
independent artist, especially

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.090
one who has message-driven
music.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.250
And during Black History Month,
I have an opportunity

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.650
to really, really showcase some
of the message music that

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.730
I'm putting forth.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.120
So right now, I'm in the process
of working on a new

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.930
record, "Notes From The
Journey." But my previous

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.990
record, "If These Walls Could
Talk," had a song called "Love

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.060
Revolution." And I was able to
really tour with that song and

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.560
move throughout the country with
it, really, and really

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.960
not just have it be a month but
have it be something that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.600
is a lasting effect and
goes wherever I go.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.450
So it's nice to have the month
to focus, but for me it's a

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.990
constant journey.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.280
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.190
And that's good to hear.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.460
And what's the new album
going to be called?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.410
DARIEN: "Notes From
The Journey."

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.370
RYAN LOREN: "Notes From
The Journey."

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.490
DARIEN: Indeed.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.030
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.810
All right, you've been
on indie scene.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.970
I wanted to ask you--

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.210
there's so many talented
people in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.920
New York and overall--

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.340
what separates those who have
the talent but those who get

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.210
more exposure, those who
are more successful?

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.770
What's going on out there?

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.830
What separates the good
from the better?

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.740
DARIEN: It's crazy, because
there are a lot of talented--

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.650
I see you on a regular-- we're
out and on the scene and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.990
seeing the talent that's
out there.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.980
So it's not necessarily
something that's split via the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.250
talent at this point.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.460
There's a lot of political stuff
going on in all areas of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490
music, not just independent
music.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.120
I think the artists that hustle
the most-- and by that

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.730
I mean they're consistent and
they're working and putting

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.470
out the best product
that they can--

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.680
eventually do get a bit of a
foothold and move forward.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.520
But I think we're still at a
space where we do need some

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.389
tastemakers with a little bit
more power to step up and make

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.510
some moves for these artists
because, I always say, if I've

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.790
got to step out of the kitchen,
I can't cook.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.160
And that becomes part of the
issue in being an independent

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.870
artist, is that you have to
juggle so many things--

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.380
be good at your craft but at the
same time go out there and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.320
now do this hustle.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.050
And there's a myriad of
musicians at this point, and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.210
that actually makes it
difficult as well.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.570
RYAN LOREN: Definitely.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.020
So can you describe your music
for those who might not know

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.790
about you that are going to be
watching and are here tonight?

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.240
DARIEN: Indeed.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.650
Well, my music is an
amalgamation of all the things

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.000
that I've come across.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.310
I started off as a dancer.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.540
I was a choreographer, and
I was deep into hip-hop--

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.890
so definitely have those
hip-hop roots that

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.280
are infused in there.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.620
I've been traveling.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.440
The musicians that I play with,
they range from church

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.060
musicians to jazz musicians.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.130
So they add their flavor.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.710
But at the end of the day, I'm
really into the craft of

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.360
songwriting, so I try to present
stories, hence the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.130
titles, "If These Walls Could
Talk," "Notes From The

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.420
Journey." Most of my songs are
stories about life that I've

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.630
either come into contact with
people and had discussions or

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.470
my own life.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.800
So that's pretty much the range
but, again, infused with

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.510
a bit of hip-hop and
a bit of a jazz and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.740
fusion kind of thing.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.400
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.050
Yeah, and I think when I first
heard your album title for the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.560
first one, it actually evokes
an image in my head.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.870
DARIEN: It's a visual,
for sure.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.150
RYAN LOREN: And I think that's
really cool that that's how

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.290
you approach things.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.350
So we're at Google, so I'd like
you to talk a little bit

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.370
about technology.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.130
I know you're a techie.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.660
DARIEN: Well, you know
I'm a techie.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.550
I'm into this.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.140
This is my thing.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.460
So technology has been really
helpful in my journey.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.310
And I didn't get into
it after the fact.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.300
I'd always been.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.880
But it just helps so
much in what we do.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.760
As an independent musician,
you're always fighting a

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.870
budget battle.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.840
It's always a budget thing.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.460
So the more that you're able to
do on your own, the better

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.810
it is for your pocket.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.670
So in doing things like mixing
the album, I have my own

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.610
set-up, and we do that kind
of thing at the house.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.740
For instance with Google Tools,
some the things that I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.300
do, there was a point where I
was writing songs on random

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.680
pieces of paper everywhere.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.820
And I just could never find them
and piece them together.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.440
And even later on, I got into
something where I was writing

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.430
songs on my laptop.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.340
But I might not have it with me,
so now I'm doing something

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.220
here or there.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.520
One of the things that I use
now is Google Drive.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.990
And I actually write songs that
I'm able to get into the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.520
cloud and basically add to them
from wherever I am-- my

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.260
phone, my iPad, whatever.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.040
So those are the kind
of things that help

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.850
me get things done.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.810
I find myself writing faster,
and I find myself getting my

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.850
ideas out more clearly because
I'm not looking for the scrap

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.500
and going, I know there's a
good scrap here somewhere.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.670
That's where I'm at sometimes
with it, so it's been really

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.330
helpful, absolutely.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.790
RYAN LOREN: Yeah, and I know,
as a songwriter, you never

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.070
know when you're going
to get that idea.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.700
DARIEN: You never know.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.602
RYAN LOREN: So if you have the
phone and it all syncs, then

00:04:56.602 --> 00:04:57.255
it works out really well.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:57.930
DARIEN: Absolutely.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.395
RYAN LOREN: Cool.

00:04:58.395 --> 00:04:59.645
I'm glad to hear it.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.240
I just wanted to thank you
again for being here.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.460
You have the album coming out.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.730
When should we expect that?

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.790
DARIEN: As an independent
artist, I don't

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.360
have the exact date.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.790
That's how it goes.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.840
But I will say I'm really,
really amped

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.980
about the new project.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.130
I have some incredible people
working on it with me.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.420
And I've been able to, I feel,
really build off the last

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.290
record and build my
skill set even.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.500
And so I can't wait
to present it.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.920
I'm really excited about that.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.190
RYAN LOREN: Great.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.570
Well we're really excited to
have you here and can't wait

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.720
for the performance, and I
wish you all the best.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.490
And thanks for your
honest music.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.660
DARIEN: Thank you
once again, man.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.170
RYAN LOREN: All right, man.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.420
DARIEN: [INAUDIBLE].
