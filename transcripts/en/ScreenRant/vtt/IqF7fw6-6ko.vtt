00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.670
Blockbuster movie franchises have raised the
bar for profitability in Hollywood with certain

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.450
series pulling in multi-billion dollar returns.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.860
However, while it�s no surprise that established
IPs like The Avengers and Harry Potter pulled

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.880
in record-breaking numbers, what about the
films that came out of nowhere?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.640
10 Most Surprisingly Profitable Movie Franchises

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.130
Karate Kid

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
A straightforward coming of age tale, made
with less than $8 million in funding, the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.980
Karate Kid earned Noriyuki "Pat" Morita an
Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Mr.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.750
Miyagi � after the film grossed over $90
million in North America alone.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.660
However, the simple tale of a troubled teenager
finding self-confidence and honor through

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.260
the disciplines of Karate has remained a Hollywood
go-to-property for almost thirty years � resulting

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.530
in two sequels, a spin-off, and a modern remake.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.820
Together, the Karate Kid: Part II and Part
III added another $150 million to the franchise�s

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.399
box office take � while limited entirely
to North American distribution.

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.260
The spin-off, featuring Hilary Swank as The
Next Karate Kid, secured international release

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.240
� but was a box office bomb at home and
around the globe, earning only $15 million

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.689
total.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.420
Nevertheless, sixteen years later, Sony Pictures
dusted off the franchise with a reboot starring

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.539
Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith that, much to
the chagrin of its detractors, earned $359

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:35.340
million in worldwide ticket sales.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.340
Home Alone

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.660
Produced on a budget of $18 million, with
an unknown child actor in the lead role, Home

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.029
Alone became one of the most profitable comedies
in film history.

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:51.289
A clever premise combined with a holiday-friendly
storyline resulted in critical acclaim and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.619
a monstrous global box office take of $476
million back in 1990 � turning Macaulay

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.399
Culkin into a household name.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.391
Nevertheless, the film�s direct sequel,
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York didn�t perform

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:11.980
quite as well critically or commercially � ultimately
bringing in $359 million (over $100 million

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.099
less than the original).

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.010
Yet, 20th Century Fox was not done with the
series � pushing out another theatrical

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.550
sequel, titled simply Home Alone 3, that did
not feature any returning cast members.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.860
That third chapter bombed � culling a mere
$79 million globally.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.480
The series would continue on in two (entirely
forgettable) made-for-TV productions but the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.790
franchise�s theatrical run capped out at
$914 million.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.790
American Pie

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.790
It�s hard to imagine that an R-Rated romantic
teen comedy, centered entirely around the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.720
sex lives of high school seniors, would prove
to be an enduring comedy franchise but, somehow,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.909
American Pie has stood the test of time.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.329
The original film posted a solid box office
run � with $235 million around the globe.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.159
Yet, unlike other entries on our list, nearly
every other American Pie film made similar

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.450
money � showing that even if some viewers
came and went, a majority of the series�

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.170
audience returned for each subsequent instalment.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.420
The fourth and final chapter, American Reunion,
under performed in North America (making only

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.280
$58 million) but still managed to secure a
total of $235 million worldwide � bring

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.959
the franchise�s total gross to $989 million
(and that doesn�t even include the direct-to-DVD

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.290
tie-ins starring Jim�s Dad, Eugene Levy,
titled Band Camp, The Naked Mile, Beta House,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.519
and The Book of Love).

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.370
Alvin and the Chipmunks

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.519
Alvin and the Chipmunks may have been an iconic
animated series in the 1990s but there was

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.569
no guarantee that a CGI/live-action hybrid
film would attract a new generation of kids

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.569
to the franchise.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.659
Still, armed with a series of �Chipmunkified�
pop music covers, Alvin and the Chipmunks

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:01.010
managed to shrug off harsh reviews from critics
and pulled in $361 million.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.909
Of course, 20th Century Fox didn�t stop
at one film and introduced The Chipettes in

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.389
the Squekquel � which went on to surpass
the box office power of the first film with

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.370
$443 million.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.540
The third film, Chipwrecked showed signs of
franchise fatigue and, subsequently, underperformed

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.030
in the domestic market.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.720
Still, thanks to strong international brand
loyalty, the movie squeaked by with another

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720
$342 million.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720
Future installments are planned but, even
in the face of nasty reviews, the three films,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720
collectively, have grossed almost $1.15 billion
for the studio.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720
The Hangover

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720
Armed with just a clever setup and cast of
mostly unproven leading men, including Bradley

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720
Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis, director
Todd Phillips surprised audiences with a memorable

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.720
one-off comedy misadventure in The Hangover
� the result: in $467 million in global

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.720
box office ticket sales.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.940
With a bankable drug-induced amnesia comedy
formula, Phillips returned to the series again

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.320
in 2009 (to the tune of $586 million worldwide)
and again in 2013 (adding another $362 million

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320
to the franchise gross).

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320
Even though the third movie was the least
successful of the series, proving it might

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320
be time to give The Hangover a break, Warner
Bros. still made off with a grand total of

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.320
$1.4 billion from the franchise.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320
The Fockers

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.330
Meet the Parents is a Hollywood remake of
a1992 indie film � both of which featured

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.920
a straightforward premise: a loving boyfriend�s
first meeting with his girlfriend�s parents,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.480
The Byrnes, results in a series of awkward
encounters and comedic misunderstandings.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.100
It was a simple setup - one that was turned
into a smash hit franchise thanks to the film�s

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.020
leads, Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.710
With $330 million in global box office revenue,
Meet the Parents was a solid release for Universal

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.960
Pictures but it was the film�s sequel, Meet
the Fockers, which turned the story on its

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960
head.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.530
Brining in Hollywood heavyweights Dustin Hoffman
and Barbra Streisand, it truly exceeded expectations

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.670
� turning a successful franchise into an
international hit with $516 million.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.020
The final film, Little Fockers was significantly
less successful with reviewers but still managed

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.130
to add a respectable $310 million to the series
- for a total haul of $1.15 billion.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.130
Bourne

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.620
Based on Robert Ludlum�s novel series, The
Bourne Identity delivered a quality international

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.650
spy thriller - in spite of a modest budget
and relatively niche source material.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.520
The first entry in the series was a surprise
hit in America, which was responsible for

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.600
over half of the movie�s $214 million worldwide
gross.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.400
The Supremacy sequel improved upon the first
in ticket sales, cementing star Matt Damon

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.200
as an American James Bond, and with audiences
primed for more, the series� third entry

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.830
raked in over $442 million globally.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.050
Despite underwhelming reviews, even the Bourne
Legacy, a spin-off starring Jeremy Renner,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.781
was financially successful - bringing the
franchise�s total box office take to $1.2

00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:28.760
billion (over the course of a single decade).

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.500
Night at the Museum

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.680
Inspired by Milan Trenc�s 1993 children�s
book, Night at the Museum hit a very calculated

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.710
box office sweet spot � a film that could
enchant kids but layered in enough fun moments,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.460
and familiar faces, to keep parents entertained.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.710
Still, no one could have predicted that Ben
Stiller, a T-Rex skeleton, and a cast of quirky

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.370
comedians portraying historical figures, would
manage to bring in $574 million globally.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.250
Unfortunately, the film�s sequels, Battle
of the Smithsonian and Secret of the Tomb,

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:12.370
fell short of capturing the original movie�s
ticket selling power, but combined, parts

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.020
two and three still culled another $750 million
for the series � brining the trilogy�s

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:49.500
complete run 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:08:14.360
to $1.33 billion around the world.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.520
The Mummy

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.960
When it was first announced that classic Universal
Studios monster The Mummy would be turned

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.340
into an Indiana Jones-like action adventure
film, moviegoers scoffed at the idea � especially

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.360
when they heard that George of the Jungle,
Brendan Fraser had been cast as the film�s

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.560
heroic lead.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.150
Nevertheless, sharp humor and eye-popping
visuals rocketed the movie to $415 million

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.080
in global ticket sales.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.060
Subsequent chapters would stretch the storyline
to the near-breaking point but still proved

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.550
to be bankable � with both sequels, The
Mummy Returns and Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.940
earning over $400 million a piece.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.280
That said, the franchise began to sputter
with the release of spin-off prequel The Scorpion

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.320
King in 2002, which limped in with an added
$160 million, for a total franchise bank of

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320
$1.4 billion.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.870
The Fast and the Furious

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.840
Back in 2001, Universal Pictures premiered
The Fast and the Furious � a high-octane

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.990
drama that explored the seedy life of illegal
street racing.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.180
Thanks to likable leads Paul Walker and Vin
Diesel, along with exciting car stunts, the

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:32.980
original Fast and Furious was a success � pulling
in $363 million at the worldwide box office.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.320
Following a string of less successful sequels,
the series took a dramatic shift from street

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.130
racing drama to over-the-top automotive heist
action.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:47.130
As a result box office returns nearly doubled
with Fast Five reaching $550 million and Fast

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.780
&amp; Furious 6 collecting $788.7 million worldwide.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.080
So far the series has made a grand total of
$2.3 billion in theatres

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.450
That�s our list of surprisingly profitable
movie franchises.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.340
Agree or disagree with any of the picks - or
have other movie franchises that you were

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.410
surprised to see pulling in big box office
numbers?
