00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.410
This little pocket pistol, will shoot a matchstick
with power, blast toothpicks into fruit, and

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.490
lob fiery darts over 20 feet away.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
In this project we're turning your boring
old clothes pins, into a powerful arsenal,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.150
of desktop weaponry.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.280
All we need for this project, is some wood
glue, a utility knife, and a simple clothespin.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.030
Just make sure it's the wooden kind with the
metal spring.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.570
Alright, let's get started by pushing on the
clothespin sideways, so we can break the tension,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.390
and remove the spring.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.239
Next we'll need to hold the two wooden pieces,
back to back, so the notches line up near

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.120
the center, like this.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.050
Now let's make a marking on the top piece
about half an inch from the hole, and an angled

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.890
marking on the bottom, that we'll cut out
later.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.449
Now just for convenience, I've gone ahead
and filled in all the areas that will need

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.149
to be chiseled out, so grab your utility knife
and carefully carve out all the areas marked

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.149
in blue.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.059
The long channel we just made here, is going
to be one half of our gun barrel.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.610
Let's go ahead and carve the other half, into
the bottom piece as well, then cut out a notch,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.010
where we made that other mark earlier.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.960
With our two pieces cut and pressed together,
you should have something that looks like

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.960
this.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.000
Ok, it's time to make this permanent, so why
don't we try using a dab of wood glue on a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.190
scrap piece of paper, then carefully slide
the pieces through it, giving them both an

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.670
even coating.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.580
Now simply press the two sides together, wiping
away any excess glue, and let it sit for a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580
bit.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.280
After about 5 to 10 minutes it should be just
strong enough for us to attach the spring.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.360
Push one end of the spring, into the inner
chamber, and hook the other end over the outside

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.560
notch.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.670
With the spring in place, your pocket gun
is finished and ready for action.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.720
All we need now are some wooden matchsticks,
that we can use as ammunition, and they should

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.930
slide loosely into the barrel.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.460
You can see that as we continue pushing the
match, the gun cocks itself automatically,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.670
and is instantly ready to fire.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.730
You can hold it just like a little pistol,
and when you're ready to shoot, simply pull

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.060
the trigger.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.630
It's amazing to see, just how much power is
stored in the spring.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.860
That's evident by how it slams forward in
just a fraction of a second, blasting our

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.640
projectile over 20 feet away.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.010
Now let's see if this can work with toothpicks
as well.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.659
If we snap off one of the sharp ends, it exposes
a broader surface, which just might work.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.670
Why don't we go ahead and test it out on an
apple.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.959
You can see that from a distance of about
6 inches, there's just enough power to impale

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.049
the surface.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.470
Of course, the closer you are, the deeper
it penetrates.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.349
And it's impressive to see the results, are
all fairly consistent.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.760
Now I went ahead a put together a whole battery
of these tabletop toys, and experimented with

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.950
different ways to handle and fire them.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.560
I discovered a technique for lighting the
matches first, then lobbing the fiery darts

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.579
high into the air.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.700
Which, of course, should only be done outdoors,
and with adult supervision.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.980
Now, as a final thought, if the tip of your
gun looks like this, feel free to customize

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.019
it so it looks a little cleaner.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.389
Another option is to carve the end back, and
smooth out the barrel with a drill bit.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.969
Well now you know how to take any ordinary
clothespin, and turn it into a mini weapon

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.260
of mass satisfaction.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.069
If you liked this project, perhaps you'll
like some of my others.
