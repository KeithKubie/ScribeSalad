DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm Don Dodge, and this
is Google Root Access.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.610
Today I have a special guest,
my friend and colleague Louis

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.360
Gray.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.040
Welcome, Louis.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.250
LOUIS GRAY: Thanks for having
me back on the show, Don.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.990
DON DODGE: Hey, it's
great to have you.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.660
So you wrote a blog post
recently, something about you

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.650
don't get a medal
just for showing up.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.950
What did you mean?

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.900
LOUIS GRAY: I have
a five-year-old boy

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.858
who's in Little League.

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:30.770
And every day he's
constantly telling me

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.280
about how he's going
to get a medal.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.450
And he's just going
to get two trophies,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.033
and this'll be his second trophy
because it's his second year.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.700
And when you're
five years old, you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.580
might get a participation
trophy for being in the league.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.200
But when you're an adult and
when you're participating

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.770
in the workforce, be it in
Silicon Valley or anywhere

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.360
around the world, you don't
get a presentation medal

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.630
just for showing up.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.130
So my blog posts
have been something

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.630
I've been thinking about, not
just for months but for years,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.320
about people's sense
of entitlement,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.010
people's sense of
risk and working hard,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.142
and how there's really
this calculation of effort,

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.100
the amount of work that
you put into something,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.849
the amount of hours that
you put into something,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.349
the amount of thought
and innovation

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:09.150
you put into something
against market opportunity

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.610
and against risk.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.690
The people who are
the household names,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.840
be they the Steve Jobs
and the Bill Gates

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.602
and the Marissa Mayers and
the Jack Dorseys of the world,

00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:19.060
they are all the
products of people

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.550
who saw something and
took exceptional effort.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.010
Nobody just shows up to
Silicon Valley and sits back

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.600
and waits for the
money to roll in.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.710
It might look easy based on what
you read, but it's not real.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.630
DON DODGE: Right.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.870
So you don't get a medal
for being smart or working

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.130
really hard either.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.655
So those aren't necessarily
guarantees to success either.

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:40.280
LOUIS GRAY: No.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.700
There's a lot of smart
people in the world.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400
And one of the exciting
things about working at Google

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.410
is I feel like I've
seen a lot of them.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.900
And I know a lot of
people who work very hard.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.770
But the catch is
that even though you

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.900
might be an exceptional
employee and you

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.407
might be a very
smart person, you

00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:56.740
could end up working at a
company that just doesn't work

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.450
out based on timing
or market fit

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.730
or issues with the product or
unforeseen market conditions.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.289
And I think that's something
we hear a lot in economics.

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.830
And on the flip
side, you have people

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.770
who possibly, if
you were to stack

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.720
rank them, don't work as hard,
but might actually make money

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.240
because they were at the
right place at the right time.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.860
There is no crystal ball that
makes this a perfect scenario.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.410
And you see often this
dichotomy of very good,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.320
strong employees who work hard
at companies that don't work

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.160
out relative to people who
might have been more mid-level

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.100
or possibly underperforming,
but ended up at the company

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.610
at the right time when they got
acquired by a bigger company

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.490
and they got to write a paycheck
that someone else didn't.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.770
And you could look back at
that and say, woe is me.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.070
I wasn't on the right
side of the ledger.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.280
But the truth is that
you have to keep going.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.430
Something that I know you
and I talk about a lot

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.200
is that the ratio of startups
that fail to those who succeed

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.550
is very high.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.824
I was always taught 9
out of 10 startups fail.

00:02:55.824 --> 00:02:57.490
And I've seen that
number bandied about.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.350
It could be 80%, 50%, 70%.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.650
But we all know that there's
a very good chance when

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.320
you take a risk, it might
not end up with a pot of gold

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.900
at the end of the rainbow.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.270
DON DODGE: So you're
a big baseball fan.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.870
And in baseball, if you're a 300
hitter, you're a big success.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.717
And those numbers sort of
translate to startups, too.

00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:18.800
LOUIS GRAY: Well, they do.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.690
And one thing about baseball
is it's extremely hard.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.687
You fail 70% of
the time, and you

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:26.020
end up being one of the top
10 or top 20 in your league,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.478
depending on the year and the
distance to the mound and all

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:29.840
that good stuff.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.590
But with a startup,
it's not just 70%.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.190
It might be even
higher than that.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.530
And one thing I remember
reading about a lot,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.440
when I first started working
in the Valley 10, 15 years ago,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.780
is that people would
change jobs frequently.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.080
And they were talking about
people not having careers

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.870
where they stayed
10 years, 20 years,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.240
30 years at IBM
like they used to.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.334
But they were changing jobs
every 18 months to 24 months.

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:53.750
It was an interesting scenario,
because not only was there

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.920
the availability of jobs and
the ability for job hoppers,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.790
as they were called, to move
from company to company,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.410
but people would keep
trying to make it work.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.900
And they never gave
up based on the fact

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.400
that the last place
didn't work out.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.460
They just kept going.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.020
And everyone kind of sees
that there is an opportunity.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.280
And sometimes you get
this feeling of the grass

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.640
being greener on the other side.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.740
And you see people do
a lot of that flipping.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.040
And so it's no longer like
a black mark on your resume

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.320
to say that you've worked
at six places in nine years.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.380
It's almost expected.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.670
DON DODGE: So you
also said there's

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.100
this intersection
of skill and luck

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.360
that happens in Silicon Valley.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.110
And to extend the
baseball analogy,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.360
sometimes mediocre
players get lucky to be

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.480
on great teams that win.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.000
And the same
happens in startups.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.250
LOUIS GRAY: I think
that's a perfect analogy.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.270
You've seen people who end
up sitting on the bench

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.311
or don't even play; they're
on the disabled list.

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.905
And yet, the next year they
get a World Series ring.

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:50.320
And you go, well, come on.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.750
Here's a guy who
maybe won 25 games.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.010
That's an incredible
year for a pitcher.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.209
But he played for
the third place team.

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:59.750
Luck didn't work
out in the playoffs,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.120
and they didn't get to go.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.790
The same thing is true
when it comes to business.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.440
Even if you read all the
tomes from Jack Welch

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.030
and the other guys who've
been there and done it before,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.920
it doesn't mean that
you're guaranteed

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.440
to have a positive outcome.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.880
One thing I remember
specifically,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.007
when I was at Berkeley my senior
year and the year afterward,

00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:20.590
I would go to the
city public library,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.510
and I would read all these
stories about Silicon Valley.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.220
I remember specifically reading
one about Larry Ellison,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.770
where it said if you know
the difference between God

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.936
and Larry Ellison it's that
God doesn't believe he's

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:31.420
Larry Ellison, one of the
most memorable titles.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.210
And I remember
having a conversation

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.150
with a friend of mine.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.157
And she almost
mocked me and said,

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:38.490
why are you reading these books?

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.060
It doesn't mean that
by reading these books

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.800
you're going to end
up in the Valley.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.000
And I kind of want to
turn around now and go,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.906
well, here we are.

00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:45.280
We're actually
working at Google.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.821
It's very cool place
to work, and you

00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:49.440
have to impact on these
really innovative things.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.890
But just because you read
about it or you know about it

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.410
doesn't mean that you're going
to have that mastery of it.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.360
And it doesn't mean that
even if you do everything

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.022
to the best of your
ability that you're

00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:00.980
going to be the guy with
the trophy at the end.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.660
And so I wanted to
put this post up.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.159
What I've been
really thinking about

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.502
is you see a kind
of an assumption

00:06:06.502 --> 00:06:08.460
from the outside world
about what the Valley is

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.710
like, that there's a gold rush,
or that you go to Sand Hill

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.390
Road and get funded,
not once but thrice,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.810
or that you should be
able to join a company

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.990
and 18 months later go IPO.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.150
I think both you and I have
had real business experiences

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.990
at companies that--
yourself with Napster

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.776
is a fantastic example, at
a company everybody knew,

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:28.650
and everybody knew it
would be the hot thing.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.650
And you didn't get
rich from Napster.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.200
And I was at a company
for 8 and 1/2 years

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.190
where we grew from first
customer ship all the way

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.845
through filing for IPO,
not once but twice.

00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:42.220
And very interesting scenarios
all the way through as you

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.607
go through rounds of
layoffs and venture funding.

00:06:45.607 --> 00:06:47.690
And the type of things I
think you and I have seen

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.872
could fill books.

00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:51.080
And that's part of what I
want to get that story out,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.440
for those who haven't
been here yet,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.400
or those who have only seen
the good news, that they should

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.650
know that there's a flip
side to the coin, too.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.420
DON DODGE: Well, that's a
good topic for another show.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.750
But that's all we
have time for today.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.850
So thank you for joining us.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.370
I'd like to remind you
if you're a developer

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.840
and you're building
applications on the cloud,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.450
you might try the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.109
We have a special
$2,000 credit for anyone

00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:16.150
who would like to try it.
