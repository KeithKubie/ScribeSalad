&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:23.510
[ Silence ]

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.190
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Welcome.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.840
So I thank you for joining us today
here at our Books and Beyond talk,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.650
and today we are cosponsored with
The Daniel A.P. Murray Association.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.950
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.300
I'm director for the
the Center for the Book.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510
And I welcome you.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.370
At the Center for the Book, we are
committed to making a productive

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.040
and lasting difference in the world
of reading, promotion and literacy.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.510
And as a part of the new national
and international outreach division

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.640
within the Library of Congress,
it's our mission to nurture

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.350
and empower the network of
organizations with whom we partner

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.500
to strengthen our capacities,
to serve communities,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.280
and to provide the broadest
access to the vast, diverse

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.710
and rich collections that are
here at the Library of Congress.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.420
We promote books in
libraries, literacy in reading,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.350 position:56%
poetry in literature, knowing that
they are the best tools for creating

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.080
and sustaining informed
and engaged societies.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.380
And also the best weapons
against intolerance and ignorance.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.770
So the Center for the Book's
mission is carried out nationwide

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.310
with the assistance from our
affiliated Centers for the Book.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.030
There's a state Center for
the Book in every state,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.640
the District of Columbia,
and the Virgin Islands.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.370
We have a partnership of a network
of more than 80 organizations

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.330
that are also focused on
reading, promotion and literacy.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.340
Additionally, we play
an important role

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.640
with the National Book Festival.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.280
This year, the festival
is September 24,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.810
at the Washington Convention
Center here in D.C. And I urge you

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.580 position:56%
to attend this wonderful event in
celebration of reading and literacy,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.410
and you can visit us on
the web to learn more

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.320
about that at loc.gov/bookfest.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.770
A few logistics before I
introduce today's author,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.070
we would like to have the
conversation go undistracted,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.730
so if you could take a
moment, look at your phone

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.260
and make sure it's turned
on silent or vibrate,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.990
we would appreciate that.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.800
Also we are recording today's event

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.680
so if you ask a question
you should know

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.210
that you'll be part of our webcast.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.610
And it's exciting for some maybe.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.940
We do have our webcasts available.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.820
We have at the Center for the
Book, we have more than 250 so far,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.910
of author discussions of
all genres of writing,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.230
and you can visit read.gov
to check those out as well.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.430
Today's author's book will be for
sale here at the back of the room,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.570 position:56%
and following the presentation
she'll be available to sign her book

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.250
at the table here to my right.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.400
And you'll have a chance to
talk with her about her work.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.280
So we're excited for
today's conversation

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.440
and glad she's being
generous with her time.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.720
The chief criteria for
deciding which books to feature

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.540 position:56%
in this series is that there must be
a strong connection to the Library

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.410
of Congress and in
most cases it means

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.460
that the writer did
the research here,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.780
and that's true for today's author.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.270
Amina Hassan has authored the book
Loren Miller: Civil Rights Attorney

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.930
and Journalist which discusses
one of the nation's most important

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.460
but perhaps not widely
studied civil rights attorneys.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.790
Loren Miller was a legal strategist

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.200
who challenged the
nation's racial order,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.720
effectively abolishing
housing covenants,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.760
restrictive racial
housing covenants,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.070
arguing cases before
the Supreme Court.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.570
And one of those cases Shelley
versus Kraemer from 1948 is taught

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.700
in nearly every American
law school today.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.600 position:56%
Mr. Miller also played a key role in
Brown versus The Board of Education,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.970
alongside Thurgood Marshall

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.640
which ended legal segregation
in public schools.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.170
So I think Dr. Hassan will
tell us more about Mr. Miller

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.410
so I'll tell you a little
something about her.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.520
And it's an extraordinary honor
to have you here with us today,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.560
we thank you for your presence.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.190
Amina Hassan is a highly
accomplished citizen.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.530
She's an independent historian

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.470
and an aware winning
public radio documentarian.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.560
She has produced many nationally
distributed works including an NPR

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.180
radio series on how race, class
and gender shape Americans' fort,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.540
and she's also produced
another notable documentary,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.180
among many of her accomplishments,
on the Bill of Rights.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.200
She's a native of Los Angeles.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.900 position:56%
Dr. Hassan has received her
Bachelor of Arts from the University

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.910
of California Berkeley and her PhD

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.570
from Ohio University in
rhetorical criticism.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.420
I'd like to welcome
her to the stage now,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.720
to discuss with us her new book.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.680
Her first book, as it happens.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.010
Thank you.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Well, I
certainly want to thank Pam Jackson

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.260
for that wonderful introduction,
and I want to thank her other staff

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.590
which was Ann Bonnie who
helped make this talk possible,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.190
and I thank you all for coming,
for taking time out of your day.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.710
So let's start with me
telling you a story.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.880
A story of a man more
introvert than extrovert,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.850
who made America better
not just for himself alone.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.900
A man who knocked down the last
legal crops of segregated housing

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.950
and segregated education.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.730
Loren Miller's legacy and his
legal accomplishments as his well

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.300 position:56%
as his journalistic accomplishments,
are the subject of today's talk.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.010
I hope today when you walk away.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.640
you'll have a better understanding
of Loren Miller as a man,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.500
and beyond that, as a
champion of equality.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.320
Today I will present a
description of Miller's early life,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.490
then follow that with his
importance and his accomplishments

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.290
on civil rights, and
his impact on America.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.240
You'll see 2 letters I found
in the Library of Congress here

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.250
between Loren Miller
and Thurgood Marshall.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.970 position:56%
You will hear of his friendship
with Langston Hughes, and their trip

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.030
to the Soviet Union in 1932.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.780
His marriage and his
legacy as a journalist.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.080
Then at the end, I will be
happy to answer your questions.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.510
So why is Loren Miller important?

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.140
Why is a man who died
in 1967 relevant today?

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.720
Imagine yourself being sued by
your neighbors because you moved

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.890
into a neighborhood where
everyone looks different from you.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:55.590
Imagine the community using the
court system to force you to move.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.610 position:56%
This situation might sound outdated,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.630
but discrimination is
not obsolete in 2016.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.540
Miller is relevant today
because he brought an end

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.750
to racial segregation in America.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.110
Because the struggle for civil
rights still continues today,

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.550
because our ability to
promote progress cannot happen

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.760
without our court system,
our current freedoms,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.380
or lack there of, are
rooted in the past.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.570
Future changes depend on previous
court decisions and battles.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.940
Loren Miller's story is a
story of an extraordinary man,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.980
an unsigned hero who changed
the course of history.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.500
A story that most people
today are unaware.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.210
Federal Appeals Court Justice
A. Leon Higginbotham Jr.,

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.010
in paying tribute to the
black lawyers of our country,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.600
Higginbotham said in 1979, that
one man who would have been,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.480
should have been on
the appellate court

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.610
or the U.S. Supreme Court
was a late Loren Miller.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.530
Others felt that he was
barely second in importance

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.540
to the late Thurgood Marshall.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:23.860
Let me read briefly from
the opening of my book.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.170
"Loren Miller died on Vasteel
Day, a fitting coincidence

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:34.200
for a man dedicated to storming the
hush hush of court room injustice.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.060
The coolness of the summer evening
of July the 14th, 1967, a Friday,

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.890 position:56%
he succumbed to pulmonary emphysema.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.720
By noon on July the 19th, thousands

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.190
of people overflowed the
capacity of the Methodist Church.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.690
Filling the pews or
crowding out doors,

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.140
was virtually every back lawyer
and most of the judges in the city.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.220
A multitude of greats, near
greats, among them dignitaries

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.830
and just plain Joes, came to pay
final respects to the great man.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.950
Lena Horne, the show stopping
beauty of film and song,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.800
blacklisted in the 1950s
for her political views,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.760
spoke at the ceremony and later
acknowledged hundreds of letters,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.310
condolences, and telegrams.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.570
Mourners came from far and
near to attend the rites

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.630
of the longtime civil rights
leader and prolific writer,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.270
lawyer of intimidating
rectitude, and key strategist

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.620
in the legal campaign to
overturn racial discrimination,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.930
particularly in housing
and education.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.930
A man, who by sheer force
of will and determination,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:55.050
improved the lives of those
on the periphery of justice."

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan:
Although Miller became one

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.450
of the nation's most prominent and
influential civil rights attorneys

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:06.920
of the 1940s to the 1960s, he grew
up in a mutable, unbearable poverty

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.090
on farms in Nebraska and Kansas.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.280
He wrote in his unpublished
autobiographical novel

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.400
of his childhood, that one night,
there was a sudden clapping

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.430
of the trap, and the
squeal of the rat.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.190
Before the night ended, his
mother had caught 14 rats.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:32.530
They were what might be called
a family of itinerant squatters.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.000
And here, I am going to return to
my book and read about the kind

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.700 position:56%
of world Loren Miller was born into.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.300
"Loren Miller came into the
world on the western edge

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.360
of the Omaha Indian
reservation in Pender,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.450
Nebraska, on January 20, 1903.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:57.790
He was born during the American
coal famine of 1902 to 1903,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.060
when fierce industrial warfare
erupted in the coalfields

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.700 position:56%
of Pennsylvania and caused a fuel
shortage with a broad ripple effect.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.210
In Nebraska, people turned from
burning coal to burning corn

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.180
to hear their homes and cookstoves.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.540 position:56%
In neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa,

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.830
fuel-starved factories
threatened to shut down.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:25.840
Public schools in many states were
closed as coal supplies dwindled.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.960
In Indianapolis, along the railroad
yards, poor people scavenged lumps

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.290
of coal and hauled them away
in wheelbarrows and sacks

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.150
in broad daylight in full
view of guards with rifles.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.000
Eventually, the federal
government intervened,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.400
turning from the strikebreaker
to peacemaker

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.200
for the first time in US history.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.260
Perhaps, the atmosphere
of social, political

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.100
and economical unrest surrounding
Miller's arrival presaged what lay

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.730
ahead for him, a life on
the front line of justice

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.800
where he would shine a
light into the dark shadows

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.970
of racism and inequality."

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:19.010
Miller was soft spoken, slightly
built, intellectually brilliant,

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.460
extraordinarily sensitive,
and scholarly looking.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.150
The FBI reported he had
a small scar on his chin.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.470
Born in 1903 in Nebraska, he
was a son of a former slave

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.910
who married a white woman.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.310
He wrote that his mother's love
for his father was so great

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.370
that it led her to
cross the color line.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:45.030
However, the hard scrambled
life, living in abject poverty,

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.240
sometimes took a toll on his
mother, a former school teacher.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.780
It was during these times that
she leaned heavily on her bible

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.370
to keep cheerful despite
the hardships.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:01.980
As a child, he was shy,
small, easily intimidated.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.800
He played ball just enough he
said, to keep from called a sissy.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.000
He grew up on a farm, but he didn't
like killing chickens or hunting.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.730
He cried at the sight of his
father bating a fishing hook

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.510
with live sparrows
taken from their nest.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.510
Before Miller entered school, he
had taught himself how to read.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.700
By the time he was
10, the townspeople,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.760
who happened to be mostly white,

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.750 position:56%
began saying that 10 year old Miller
was the brightest child in school.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.520
When Miller was a boy living
in Nebraska, his father worked

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.810
at the courthouse as a janitor.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.710
His father would take him to
work where Miller would sit

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:50.090
in the court room and listen to
the trials, watching and learning.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.330
Whenever people asked him what he
was going to be when he grew up,

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.490 position:56%
his answer always remained the same.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.930
I'm going to be a lawyer.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:06.510
This is what his father had
hoped him to be, and he did.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.340
Eventually, Miller's
family moved to Kansas.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.960
Displeased with his new
school, he wrote to complain

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.340
to his former school
teacher back in Nebraska.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.150
In her reply, and this is 1914,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:27.450
she said don't you get discouraged
Loren about your school work.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.510 position:56%
If you do your best, you will surely
become far greater than the teacher

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.740
who won't give you for
credit for what you do.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.650
Maybe you will be our
president someday.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.490
But if you do not become president,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.410
you will surely feel some other
good place if you do your best.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.200
100 years ago, it was
impossible for a black boy

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.250
to even consider becoming
President of the United States.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.050
But this school teacher,
who happened to be white,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:15:00.150
believed that one day he would
do something very important.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.450
Determined to succeed, Miller
returned to his studies

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.930
and worked harder than ever before.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:11.210
He went to college where he
studied to become a lawyer.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.250
In 1928, he graduated
from Washburn College

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.010
in Kansas, with a degree in Law.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.480 position:56%
Although Miller trained as a lawyer,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.210
what he really wanted
to do was be a writer.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.450
To write novels and poems.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:31.190 position:56%
But he was born at a time when
educated black people had 3 choices.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:37.250
In 1929, following the
death of his sister,

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.700
Miller set out for Los
Angeles from Kansas.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.840
He was a freshly minted
member of the BAR

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.340
who preferred political activism
and writing to the practice of law.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.660
Straddling a career as a lawyer
and journalist, when he arrived

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.630
in Los Angeles, he quickly found
work as a newspaper reported

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.240
for the largest black
newspaper at the time.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.850
Very quickly, he became the
newspaper's city editor.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:11.320
In 1932, using his clout at the
newspaper, he invited his friend

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.460
and prominent writer, Langston
Hughes, to Los Angeles.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.380
Shortly thereafter, they decided
to drive to New York and travel

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.010
to Russia to make a film
about blacks in America.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:27.130
That trip sealed their
friendship for the next 40 years.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.570
However, 5 months later, the
project ended for political reasons

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.820
and Miller returned
to the United States

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.460
without the movie ever being made.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:44.180 position:56%
Soon after returning to Los Angeles,
Miller married Juanita Ellsworth,

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.160
who in 1927, graduated from the
University of Southern California,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.200
where she studied to
become a social worker.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.750
After his trip to Russia,
Miller, urged by his new wife,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.440
returned to the practice of law.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.810
Although he sought to pursue the
writer's life, the need to put food

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.510
on the table at the height of the
Great Depression propelled him

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.650
to work as both lawyer
and journalist.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.010
He admitted that he was
dragged kicking and screaming

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.340
into the practice of law,
because you in those days he said,

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:24.410 position:56%
a negro could be a doctor, lawyer or
school teacher and that's about all.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.840
He sacrificed his dream, not a man
given to brooding or self pity,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.380
Miller accepted the
career path he chose.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.780
Miller and his wife Juanita
maintained a circle of friends

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.340
which included, among others,
the singer and actor Lena Horne,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.730
Nobel Peace Prize recipient,
Ralph Bunche,

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:52.650 position:56%
the Harlem Renaissance painter,
Aaron Douglas, and Carey McWilliams,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.360
editor of The Nation Magazine and
one of the Hollywood ten attorneys

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.770
who defended black listed film
makers during McCarthyism.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:06.420
As Miller's legal work focused
increasingly on civil rights,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.950
he became friends from with
prominent attorneys from the NAACP

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.720
and The American Civil
Liberties Union.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.850
His reputation as a skilled
and brilliant attorney grew

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.710
from local prominence
to national recognition.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.840
Miller became known locally in
Los Angeles as the go to guy,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.170
if you were turned away
from an ice skating rink,

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.310
a movie house or a restaurant.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:38.540 position:56%
He started taking on higher profile
cases that impacted national issues.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:45.690
During World War II, when President
Roosevelt authorized the interment

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.860
of Japanese Americans, Miller

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.770
and his ACLU colleagues took
a very unpopular position.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.280
A position that not even
Jewish organizations

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.490
or the NAACP would take.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.780
Although Miller and his friends
fought hard to halt the curfew

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.800
and interment of west coast
Japanese, their efforts failed.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.570
When the army trucks and soldiers
came for Miller's neighbors,

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.640
he did more than watch as they
were carted off to the camps.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.390
He had already arranged
the whole [inaudible]

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:22.440
of his Japanese neighbors until
they returned after the war.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.790
What is not so widely known, is
that in 1946, before Brown V Board

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.900
of Education of Topeka
Kansas, Miller was part

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.340
of an important class
action suit in California.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.230
It challenged the constitutionality

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.530
of segregating Mexican
American children

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.210
from California's public schools.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.040
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: On behalf
of the National Lawyer's Guild,

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.200
the NAACP and the ACLU, Miller
submitted amicus briefs,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.210
friend of the court legal briefs,
in support of Mendez V Westminster.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:05.610
It was the first case to hold
as school segregation itself

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.550
as unconstitutional and
violates the 14th amendment,

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.420
the constitution's
equal protection clause.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.970
What is important about the Mendez
case is that it was the first case

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.850
to use sociological and
psychological evidence

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.600
to show how segregation
damages children.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.600
And this was before Brown
V Board of Education.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.720
The uniqueness of Brown, is

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.400
that it too used sociological
data as evidence.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.150
That strategy led to the historic
decision to end racial segregation

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.580
in America's public schools.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.340
Although Loren Miller
did not stand up in court

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.860
to argue the historically famous
Brown case, he drafted most

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.830
of the legal briefs that lead
to this monumental victory.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:21:00.120 position:56%
At the same time that Miller worked
on the Mendez case, Hattie McDaniel,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.690
the first black woman to
receive an Academy Award.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.230
She won an Oscar for her
role in Gone with the Wind.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.650
She was being sued because she had
audacity to buy and live in a house

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.850
in Los Angeles's exclusive
Sugar Hill district.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:19.300
It was thought that there
was little possibility

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.110
that a black movie star
would be forced to move.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.730
However, this was a
time in Los Angeles,

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.130
when the only way a
black person could live

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.310
in a restrictive area,
was as a servant.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.690
It was a time when the black
residents of Los Angeles,

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.690
long fed up, filed more
suits contesting the validity

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.870
of restrictive covenants than
in any part of the country.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:49.210
On December the 5th, 1945,
Hattie and her 50 co-defendants

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.950
and hundreds of sympathizers,

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.160
appeared in court in
all their finery.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.950
One writer said, that the stylist
atmosphere in the court was such as

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.450
to make one wonder if the
judge would pour tea during the

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.210
afternoon recess.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:10.000
Ultimately, Miller won what
considered the first restrictive

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.830
housing case on constitutional
grounds.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:18.280
Afterwards, Miller wrote
a friend "I rushed home

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.970
to try the Sugar Hill case, and
succeeded in pulling a rabbit

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.930
out of the hat by inducing
a local judge

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.810
to hold race restrictive covenants
unenforceable on the grounds

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.310
that such enforcement would
violate the 14th amendment."

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.690
The Sugar Hill victory
was a monumental moment.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.470
For Miller, it was the first
of many high profile cases.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.710
Because Miller argued more
segregated housing cases

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:50.930 position:56%
than any attorney did, 100, he
earned the title of Mr. Civil Rights

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.110
of the Western United States.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:59.800
By the mid 1940s, Miller
was part of a group

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.780
of brilliant NAACP legal
defense fund attorneys led

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.570
by Thurgood Marshall, who
changed the course of history.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.510
Miller argued two landmark cases
before the US Supreme Court.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.650
In 1948, he argued the
famous Shelley V Kraemer case

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:23.640
that all lawyers study
in law school today.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.750
Alongside Thurgood Marshall
and Charles Hamilton Houston,

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.370
Miller overturned racial
restrictive housing covenants.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.690
This meant that it became
illegal to stop people from living

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.570
where they wanted because
of their race.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.470
However, before the Shelley
case ever came to court,

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.860
the NAACP held several meetings
across the country to determine

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.100
which cases, which strategies,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.390
and which attorneys should stand
before the US Supreme Court.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:24:01.360
On the screen here, in this April
1947 letter from Loren Miller

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.990
to Thurgood Marshall, found
here at the Library of Congress,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:09.490
Miller suggests that "They seek
outstanding lawyers from all

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.840 position:56%
over the nation to join forces" and
naturally he adds that he'll be glad

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.610
to do whatever he can to assist.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:25.800
In this next NAACP letter,
dated October the 27th, 1947,

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.230
Thurgood Marshall confirms that
Loren Miller will argue one

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.510
of the four cases before
the Supreme Court.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.670
According to Marshall, he
is under extreme pressure

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:40.050
to select a big shot attorney,
not someone like Miller

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.530
who had never tried
a Supreme Court case.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.980
In page 1, paragraph 3 here,

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.820
Marshall mentions there has
been a lot of discussion

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.580
on what lawyers will be selected.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.830
But here he says I am not
for having a person simply

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.530
because he is refuted
to be a big shot.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:03.360
Then on the second page, Thurgood
says there is a tremendous amount

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.580
of fast foot work going on and
these cases are too important

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.250
to tolerate any shenanigans.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.020
He stuck with Miller because
he had more experience

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.820
than any attorney did.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:21.040
[ Silence ]

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Thurgood
Marshall remained unconvinced,

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.280
in this particular case, that
the equal protection clause

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.270
of the 14th amendment
was the best strategy.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:34.770
Miller unflaggingly
persistent, convinced Marshall

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.470
that the equal protection clause
and the due process clause

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.380
of the 14th amendment
are intertwined.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:46.370
When the Shelley case finally
did reach the Supreme Court,

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.630
it included nonlegal,
sociological materials

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.670
on the affects of segregated
housing.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:58.740
Miller said "The question before
the Supreme Court was a simple one.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.010
What the court decided was that
no state could enforce any law

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.640
that deprives its citizens
of life, liberty,

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.350
or property without due
process and equal protection.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.190
In other words, restrictive
covenants violate the

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.310
14th amendment."

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:20.930
Thurgood Marshall said that the
Shelley case was unquestionably one

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:26.110
of the most important in a
whole field of civil rights.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.830 position:56%
Aware that Miller's strength lays in
his command of the English language,

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.180
Marshall again turned to Miller.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.570
This time to write the
majority of the brief

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.620
in Brown V Board of Education.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.390
Six briefs to be exact.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.730
Because of Miller's contribution,

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.710
segregation in America's
public schools became illegal.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:53.320
These cases laid the foundation
to end segregation in America

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.440
and fueled the civil rights
movement and the passes of laws

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.090
like the Civil Right Act of 1964.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.320
Yet, during the 50th and 60th
anniversary celebrations of Brown,

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.740
Miller is not even mentioned.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.580
His erasure from our collective
memory is a real travesty.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.410
Loren Miller lived
a well rounded life.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.570
While he focused much of
his life on legal battles,

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.290
he never fully abandoned his
love of writing and journalism.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:32.640
By the 1950s, Miller owned his own
newspaper, the California Eagle,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.110
publishing the news for and about
the black residents of Los Angeles.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.460
Brad Pie, the sports
writer who worked

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.290
for the California Eagle
Newspaper wrote how Cuz,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.050
as Miller was affectionately known

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.630
around the newspaper,
enriched his life.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:55.030
Using sports metaphors, Pie
wrote, in the civil rights field,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.250
to me he was a Jim Brown
of the legal profession,

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.760
knocking down racial
barriers all around them.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.190
He dribbled through the courts
of the land like Elgin Baylor

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.520
and scored as many
points in the legal field

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.900
as Wilt Chamberlain does
on the basketball court.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.730
As a lawyer, journalist,
author, publisher and scholar,

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:20.980
he was an all around man as
Willie Mays is on the Diamond.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:28.710 position:56%
Towards the end of his legal
carrier, in 1964, he became a judge.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.550
Although Miller's intelligence,

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.690
admired by virtually
everyone he met,

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.650
he had a tendency towards
razor sharp outspokenness.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.220
His asset whip was quick to burn
holes into the toughest skin

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.820
and eat right through double
talk hypocrisy and posturing.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.980
I would like to conclude by
saying Miller was committed

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.560
to making democracy
work for every American.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.950 position:56%
He said "It goes without saying that
I am opposed to any discrimination

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:04.900
of any kind on racial and religious
grounds, or on any other grounds.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.520
I think that we must do that,
not only in simple justice

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.520
to minority groups of any
kind, but out on a realization

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.970
that the majority has
as big of stake,

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.860
if not bigger, than the minorities.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.640
Either we shall have to make
democracy work for every American,

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.320
or in the last analysis,
we shall not be able

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.530
to preserve it for any American."

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:34.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Loren Miller
died in 1967 at the age of 64.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.250
His words ring out
just as loud today.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.690
His impact on all our lives
and freedoms is experienced

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.720
when we can live where we
want, study where we want.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.540
His legacy laid the foundation

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.210
for today's ongoing
progress for civil rights.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.670
In recognition of his many
contributions to the field of law,

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.320
the state BAR of California

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.950
in 1970 established the Loren
Miller Legal Services Award,

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.560
a lifetime achievement award
given annually to a lawyer

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.460
who has demonstrated
a long term commitment

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.880
to providing legal
services to the poor.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.610
We owe much to this great man

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.710
and we shall celebrate him
as a true American hero.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.510
Thank you, and now
for your questions.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:30.120
[ Applause ]

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan:
So just pop up there.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.720
Yes.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for your presentation.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.250
I was impressed by your research,

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.550
especially at the Library
of Congress.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:43.650
I noted that you used several
judicial papers and NAACP records.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:49.930
You mentioned earlier that you
had an unpublished autobiography.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.120
Where did you find that?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: His
family donated his papers

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.370
to the Huntington Library
in San Marino, California,

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:03.090
and earlier the family, a
couple years before that,

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:07.030
had come across papers that Loren
Miller had of Langston Hughes

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.160
over their many years
of corresponding.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.080
And that group was donated first.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.760
And then finally the latter group.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.300
I got really lucky, I wasn't
really decided if I was going

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:24.660
to do a Loren Miller book, but I
want to the Huntington the very day

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.280
that the curator was signing
the receivership of the papers.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.210
He had not even seen them.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:34.160
He said you want to go down to
the basement and I said yeah.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.360
And so he let me look for like
three or four hours, and I was just

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.160 position:56%
in awe, I said I'm going to do this.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.600
I saw a lawsuit against him
from the newspaper publisher

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.030
when he had bought the newspaper
[inaudible] and I said oh okay.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.790
And so I did a great
deal of research there.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:58.890
I also did an amount of research
at the National Archives as well

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:03.070
as interviewing people but the
Huntington had the basis of it

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:05.470
because they had his papers,
and like you mentioned,

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.210
the unpublished autobiography.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.510
Yes?

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.510
&gt;&gt; I'm not from the United
States, I'm from the Caribbean.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:33:13.100
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan:
He was quite critical.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.700
10 years after.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.090
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Yeah,
because he basically was

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.200 position:56%
on the delivered speed, because most
of the briefs that he wrote were

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.670
for Brown 2, because there's
a Brown 1 and Brown 2.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.010
And yes, he wrote,
he criticized people

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.680
for basically sitting
on their morals.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.310
He said there's a lot to
do and it's been 10 years

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.050
and these kids aren't
even the schools yet.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:45.120
And so he was very critical of that
and that was like his personality

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.100
because I think maybe he wasn't
so well known because he kind

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.950
of burned some bridges because even
though he owned a newspaper and all

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.350
of that, and he was involved in
so much especially in LA and all,

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:03.240
but because he didn't promote
himself, he wasn't an opportunist

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.810
in that sense, I mean, he
ran for congress and lost,

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.450
he didn't get past the primary.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.760
But only because people
were pushing him to do that.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.050
And there's a long letter
in his files about that,

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.740
about how he didn't exploit
himself for other people,

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.410
you know to promote
himself in that way.

00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:24.410
Because basically he was
a [inaudible] kind of guy.

00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:29.190
His wife was more the society
maven, and she was involved

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.660
in a great deal, women's
organizations,

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.120
black women's organizations,
literary organizations

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:42.030
in California, and she and someone
else started an organization called

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.840
the League of LA Arts in Los
Angeles when Langston Hughes

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:51.900
in 1939 could not find a theater
to put on one of his plays and out

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.710
of that relationship they
started this literary organization

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.010
which continues today.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.510
&gt;&gt; Let me ask another question.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:26.110
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: I'm sorry,
I can't quite hear the question.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:36:05.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Well,

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.280
he supported Pan-Africanism
I think intellectually,

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.170
and also because in the 30's,
he was much more to the left.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:18.440
He mellowed out by the time
the 40.s and the 50's happened,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:23.080
because he belonged
to the John Reed Club

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.540
and that's why he also had
an FBI file that started

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.730
in I think in 1941 or 42.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.860 position:56%
So in fact his becoming a judge took
a long time because he was so close

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.190
to the communists because he wrote

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.770
for a great many communist
publications.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.660
In the 60's, he supported
the Freedom Now movement,

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:47.100
he wrote several articles
particularly in the nation,

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.540
and one is called Farewell
to Liberals,

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.420
which is basically saying okay,
you've helped us white people,

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.320
you've got us this
far, but now we need

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.620
to lead this movement ourselves.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.290
So he was very clear there.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:04.740
Also in 1963, after
a shootout in 1962,

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.740
he represented I think 14
black Muslims in Los Angeles.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.510
Actually, something very
similar is going on now,

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.550
with the police force is that there
was a shoot out and one man died,

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.640
I think 7 were shot and
injured, and there was case

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.180
where 14 of them went to court.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:29.020
They lost but Miller was one
of the attorneys handling that.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:34.180
So even though he sort of
distanced himself from the left

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.430
in a particular way, he
always was the Marxist

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:44.920
and I think his distancing
himself from the communists later

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.540
in the 50's and stuff was
just sort of self preservation

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.990
because of what had happened
to other attorneys in that era.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:59.700
But this woman back here,
she wanted to ask something.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.430
&gt;&gt; Can you speak a little
more to his relationship

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.000
with Charles Hamilton Houston?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.550
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: He
was very critical of him,

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.400
and there was a particular case,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:14.320
I think it was called the
George Crawford murder trial,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.790
and in 1935 or around there.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.260 position:56%
Even though he belonged to the local
branch of the NAACP in Los Angeles

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.490
as one of the legal
team, he was critical.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:29.550
Nationally, during the time of the
Scottsboro Trial, he took the side

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.470
of the communists against the NAACP
about how that was being handled

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.220
and then because of that era,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.180
Charles Hamilton Houston was
quite involved with the NAACP,

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.500
so he was very critical
at that period

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.570
but by the time the Shelley
case comes up in the mid 40's,

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:51.230
he sort of changes his
tune to the point that,

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.500
I can't remember what was the
reason he wrote a letter to him,

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.880
but he compliments Houston on some
particular thing, so he had kind

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.580
of mellowed out, but he
was quite critical earlier

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.460
in this one particular case that
had gone, he thought he had sold

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.520
out this black man
in his murder trial.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.820
Yes?

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.480
&gt;&gt; Was he a published author?

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.240
Did he publish any books?

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.470
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Yes,
he has a definitive study,

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:27.220
it's called The Petitioners,
the History of the Negro

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.180
in the United States Supreme Court.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.510
And it came out about a
year before he died, 1966,

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:39.990
and it started the definitive
history of the interaction

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.740
between African Americans
and the Supreme Court.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:47.430
And it's quite interesting in
one respect, because in it,

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.660
he doesn't mention his
involvement in several of the cases

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.290
that he mentions in the book.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:56.960
He doesn't, he didn't
say oh I did this.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.090
No, it's very distanced
in that sense.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:06.840
And it's something that new lawyers

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.100
that are studying different
aspects of the law read.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.820
It's sort of a primary
text in that sense.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.160
So it's a very interesting thing.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.690 position:56%
And that's where I also found out he
had this grand uncle who had a case

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:24.470
that went to the Supreme Court,
I write about it in the book,

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.360
who had a Supreme Court case,
a public accommodations case

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.890
that wound up in the
Supreme Court in 1883.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:34.940
And so this very cantankerous
grand uncle of his,

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:40.530
he went into a hotel restaurant,
sat down, and this was in Kansas,

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.120
to be served and they
refused to serve him

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.820
and it even made the papers.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:51.290
And he marched immediately to
the Kansas US Attorney General

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:57.180
and complained, and that case
would up going to the Supreme Court

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:01.540
and was bundled I think
with 4 other cases,

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.980
and what the Supreme Court
said, the decision was,

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.680
it said that Congress had no right

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.990
to pass the Civil Rights
Act of 1875.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.530
So there was that.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:18.350
But the same man, his uncle, grand
uncle, he was in the civil war,

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.470
along with two of his brothers.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:26.820
And he fought for his pension
for years, his veteran pension,

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.950
for about 9 years or
something like that.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:33.690
And then he, I hope this isn't
offensive, and then he's quoted

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:38.190
as saying, you know he
was fed up at that point,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:41.260
that he can't get his pension,
he loses in the Supreme Court

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.140
and he says I'm going off
to live with the heathens

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:44.940
and he moved to Oklahoma.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:49.060
[ Laughter ]

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: But
it comes from this family

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:56.100
that won't lay down,
they'll challenge it.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.400
Yes ma'am?

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much
for this presentation.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.300
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Oh, thank you.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.000
&gt;&gt; I see Lester Grainger's
name here,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.800
and I wanted to know the
nature of that relationship

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.960
and also whether Loren Miller was
a mason because Lester Grainger was

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.640
and [inaudible] was,
Thurgood Marshall,

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.360
and there was a behind the
scenes cavalry of masons

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.330
that supported the
Civil Rights Movement.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.720
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: I'm
not sure if he was a mason.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.480
I think he might have been.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:33.690
I didn't find anything but then
you know, his files are massive.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.750
I do know spoke at
some Mason Hall's.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.050
Lester Grainger.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:41.250
He and Lester Grainger,
were political buddies,

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.450
they belonged to some of
the same organizations,

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.170
political organizations,
leftist organizations,

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:56.470
and when Loren Miller went to
become an editor of the New Masses

00:42:56.470 --> 00:43:01.590
and another newspaper in New York,
Lester Grainger and Miller were

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.900
like roommates, and they kept
a really long friendship.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.280
And I think Lester Grainger
had come to California

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.090
with the Urban League first,
before he became the head

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:15.490
of the Urban League later on, and
so they were really good friends

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:20.620
and I think Lester
also wrote columns

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:27.520
when Miller bought the California
Eagle in 1951 that Grainger wrote.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.170
And every time Miller and his
wife would go to New York,

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:34.620 position:56%
he would visit Lester Grainger and
his wife and family and all of that.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.140
So they were very, very close.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.540
In fact there was one letter
that Grainger writes him,

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:45.260
wanting him to sort of endorse
something with the Urban League,

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.300
and Miller writes back and
says you don't want to use me.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.700
I still have that pink tinge
and you'll do more harm

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:59.410
by having me write a letter of
endorsement or something like that.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:03.400
And it did follow him
for a long time.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.920
Any other questions?

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.220
Yes, ma'am.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you Dr. Hassan.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.010
Just for clarification,
because Mendez

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:15.130
versus Westminster
also is marginalized

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:21.210
in history much like Miller.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:30.360
So, within that case, is
Miller arguing for violation

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.770
of the 14th amendment or is
he arguing that officially,

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:39.390
Mexican Americans are
legally classified as white

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.150
and therefore shouldn't
be subjected to separate?

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.050
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: I believe
it was just the 14th amendment.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:54.520 position:56%
And he was just an amicus brief, but
he happened to belong to the NAACP,

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.870
he belonged to the National Argue

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.100
and he was also a member
of the ACLU.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:06.130
And so, he wrote and
submitted briefs

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:11.830
under those three organizations
but he didn't argue it.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:19.510
I was wrong at one point, I say
it in the book and I'm wrong,

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:25.710
that he argued it because I
did come across a document

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:30.560
that said he argued as an
amicus which is sort of rare,

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.330 position:56%
but he didn't and I stand corrected.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:39.430
I don't think, and I haven't really
read the Mendez case carefully

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:44.070
to see if they use the Treaty
of whatever, Hidalgo something

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:49.580
or other, that for those that
don't know, in California,

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.640
Mexicans traditionally have
been known as, are designated

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.270
as Caucasians, white, and even
though they're ill treated,

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.860
it has something to
do with the history

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.860 position:56%
of California being originally under
the ownership of Mexico and Spain,

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.530
and the whole sort
of history of that.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:06.830
But I don't know.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:10.950
I haven't really read
it carefully to know,

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:17.420
because when I research I'm just
looking for stuff for Miller.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.720
Yes ma'am?

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.040
&gt;&gt; What is your next
project you're working on?

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Amina Hassan: Well, I
am having trouble with that.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.440
I was going to do something
on Agustus Hawkins,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.580
who's the first African American
and Congressman from the west.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:41.790
He was in the California
Assembly for 20 years

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:46.120
and then he became a Congressman,
and he lived a long time,

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.240
and he was very important in
terms of labor and education.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.450
There's a Humphrey Hawkins Bill and
I went to UCLA where his papers are

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:58.570
about a dozen times and
I just couldn't get fired

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:02.530
up about him as a personality.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.360
What I liked about Miller is

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.440
that he wasn't just
committed to black people.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.080
He was just about what's
right and what's legal.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.050
And that's why he's associated with
Mexican Americans in California,

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:21.800
with Japanese Americans, just very
close to Jewish American community

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.050
in California, particularly
southern California.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.280
And that's what made him
so interesting for me.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.630
And so I played around with the
Agustus Hawkins thing for a while.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:35.030
Now I'm thinking something
else, it just sort of popped

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.420
up in my head the other day.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.640
So I think I might ask someone else
to kind of give me their opinion

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.400
about it because when I
find that there are books

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.300
that haven't been written like
Loren Miller, there wasn't any,

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.720
and I thought more people knew

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.730
about him even though I didn't
know very much about him.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.590
But as I've been speaking to
people, I found that really,

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.420
I'm just surprised that he's in
because he really had done so much,

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.350
there's an elementary
school in Los Angeles,

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.390
there's a park named after him.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:15.090
He is the co-founder of the Los
Angeles Sentinel Newspaper in 1934.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.140
It is still functioning today.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:25.160
It has like over 150-175
thousand readers

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.180
and he doesn't even
get credit for that.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.910
It's his cousin, Leon
Washington gets the credit

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.430
for being the founder of
this ongoing newspaper.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:40.170
He wrote editorials for it
all the way through the 40's.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.050
He was always the legal consultant

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:45.420
and when his cousin Leon
Washington had a stroke,

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.720
he took over this paper.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.400
But he also helped found it.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.240
In fact he brought his cousin
from Kansas to Los Angeles.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.100
But he doesn't get credit for that.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.620
And that's really interesting.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.920
So yeah, there's another thing.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.420
I know California a little bit
better, even though I live here,

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:03.720
and I live part of the
time in California.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.020
I know it a little better.

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.320
But because, also I'm interested
in the west because there's

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.620
so much written about African
Americans, it's mostly in the south

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.920
or the east coast, not too
much even from the Midwest.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.490
But you are seeing more and more
things about African Americans

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.230
and their contributions to the
history of the country in northern

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.530
and mostly southern California.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:14.870
More books are coming out, and so
I kind of have more of an affinity

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:16.340
for that, and I always like
people who have been overlooked,

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.230 position:56%
or the kind of radio programs I
used to do, it's always about people

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:19.530
who are disenfranchised
some kind of way.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:20.830
That always kind of
gets my juices going.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.130
Any more questions?

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.430
I think we're kind
of close on our time.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.730
You want to come up here?

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.530
Oh okay. Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So, thank you
so much for sharing yourself

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.830
and your work, your expertise.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:40.110 position:56%
I just want to make sure everyone
knows that we have the book for sale

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:44.860
in the back and that Dr. Hassan
will be signing books and available

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.800
to talk a little bit more and
sign the book in the back as well.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.510
And to again say thank
you for being here.
