00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.510
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.410
is talk about modern campaigns.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.050
In particular, we're
gonna talk about the cost

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.510
and the duration of modern campaigns,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.070
especially in the United States.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.110
And this graphic here, which comes from

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.920
the Campaign Finance Institute,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.330
and it's based on data from
the Federal Election Committee,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.230
it clearly shows how the cost
of congressional campaigns

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.850
have increased dramatically since 1986.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.760
If you look at nominal dollars

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.100
for the House of Representatives,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.070
so this is just the actual dollar amount,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.140
you see it's almost grown
by a factor of four or five.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.520
But even if you adjust it for inflation,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.440
the cost has doubled for
your average House campaign.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.660
And you see a similar trend
in the Senate campaigns,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.550
where, even adjusted for inflation,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.920
the cost of your average Senate campaign

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.330
has increased by 50%.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.890
Now, this also does not capture
all of the outside money,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.330
things like super PACs and whatever else.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.260
If you fast-forward to 2016,
your average Senate campaign

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.700
costs a little over 10 million dollars.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.300
But there's about that much money,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.840
approximately 10 million dollars,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.260
that also comes in from
things like super PACs.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.110
And so it's totalling
near 20 million dollars

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.940
for a Senate campaign, on average.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.770
And so particularly competitive campaigns

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.480
can be a lot more than even that.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.850
And if you wanna talk
about really big money,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.020
you just have to look at
presidential campaigns.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.450
So this right over here is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840
the last presidential campaign, in 2016.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.210
And you can see that Hillary Clinton's

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.660
candidate committee money was
over half a billion dollars.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.840
She actually had a good
bit more than Donald Trump.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.000
And she had a good bit more outside money.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.960
But the entire Hillary Clinton campaign

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.510
had a nearly 800 million dollar budget.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.710
And if you combine Hillary
Clinton plus Donald Trump,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.640
you have a total of 1.2 billion dollars

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.760
for the 2016 campaign.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.060
In 1980, the total was 92 million.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.520
So, more than a 12-fold increase.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.740
And even if you were to
adjust for inflation,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.160
which these numbers are
not, but even if you did,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.640
you would see a several-fold increase

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.050
in the cost of a campaign.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.010
So when you look at
these types of numbers,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.370
there's a couple of interesting
questions that come up.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.690
One is, what is the money for?

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.193
Money for what?

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.850
Well, there's many answers to that.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.720
One is, is that, especially
in a presidential campaign,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080
and to a lesser degree in
a congressional campaign,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.890
the campaigns have to pay
professional, full-time staffers.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.890
So campaign, campaign staff.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.130
You'll often have a lot of volunteers,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.130
but for example, Hillary Clinton, in 2016,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.330
had approximately 4200 people on payroll,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.180
where about 800 people were working

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.770
directly for her campaign,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.760
another 400 with the
Democratic National Committee,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.380
and roughly 3000 people with
state Democratic parties

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.020
in the battleground states.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.130
And beyond, on the staff,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.860
you also might have paid
political consultants.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.550
Now, what do all these people do?

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.610
Well, they come up with
a campaign strategy.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.360
Some of them will do polling,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.210
to understand the sentiment
in the larger population

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.560
on specific issues or on the candidate.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.150
And they will do a lot of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.790
campaign advertising and marketing.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.720
Advertising.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.180
And so the staff will think about,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.910
well, what kind of
advertising do we need to do?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.510
And then a large chunk of the money

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.450
actually goes to the advertising itself.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.760
Advertising.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.900
Especially in mass media,
if we're thinking about

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.300
radio and television.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.760
Now, an interesting question is,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.360
given that in the 2016 campaign

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.410
Hillary Clinton outspent
Donald Trump by so much,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.030
how was he able to
actually win that campaign?

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.900
Well, there's several
possible explanations to that.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.320
One is, is that Donald Trump was

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.850
very effective at
getting himself attention

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.670
that he didn't have to spend money for.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.950
On top of that, a trend that has emerged

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.770
really since the 2008 Obama campaign

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.680
is the increasing use of
social media in campaigns.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.030
Before social media became a major player,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.860
most of that energy really
was in mass media advertising.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.560
But now with social media,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.430
you could cater a message
to specific groups.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.760
You could focus your message.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.750
You could activate your base more.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.450
And so more and more, social media,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.970
which is currently a lot less expensive

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.870
than, say, TV advertising,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.860
is becoming a bigger and
bigger part of campaigns.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.170
Now, a last answer to the
question of why so much money

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.000
is that you have long
campaigns in the United States.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.860
In some countries, the campaigns might be

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.680
anywhere from two to six weeks.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.090
In the United States, the formal campaign,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.830
if you think about the first primaries,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.520
it's in February of an election year

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.200
in a presidential cycle,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200
and then the election is in November.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.950
So you're looking at
roughly nine to 10 months

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.970
from the first primary and
caucuses to the election.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.170
But well before the first caucus,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.760
you're going to have
the various candidates

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.670
raising money and trying
to get name recognition.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.330
And so the actual campaign
and money raising,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.230
for a lot of these candidates,
might be closer to two years.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.530
And so you can imagine, if
you're spending two years

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.050
with consultants, trying
to do advertising,

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.000
just so you have a showing

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.930
in some of those first
caucuses and primaries,

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.510
well, that's going to
cost you a lot of money.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.700
Now, it's for you to think about

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.440
whether these are good or bad things.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.970
Many people would argue that having

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.630
such a long election cycle

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.140
doesn't allow a lot of
focus on other things.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.750
Especially if someone's the incumbent,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.320
if they are campaigning the whole time,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.820
can they even govern?

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.220
And then another argument
against all of this money

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.360
is it might put too much influence

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.150
in the hands of people who can give money.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.693
I'll let you think about that.
