00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.834
- Hi. My name is Elizabeth,
and I help create the SAT.

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:06.877
In this video, I'm going to
tell you about the section

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:08.758
of the new SAT called the Reading Test.

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:11.822
We'll go over what it
tests, how it's scored,

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:14.086
and what you can expect to see on it.

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:16.582
The new SAT is made up
of two main sections,

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:19.403
math and evidence-based
reading and writing.

00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:21.330
And the evidence-based
reading and writing section

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.825
is made out of two tests,
reading, and writing and language.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.251
So let's learn more
about the reading test.

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:29.480
The reading test is designed
to measure how ready you are

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.222
to read and interpret the kinds of texts

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:34.244
you're likely to encounter in
college and in your career.

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:39.742
The reading test is scored
on a scale of 10 to 40.

00:00:39.742 --> 00:00:41.077
Your score on the reading test

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:42.877
and your score on the writing
and language test combine

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:45.883
to give you your evidence-based
reading and writing score,

00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:49.180
which is on a scale of 200 to 800.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.061
When you get your SAT scores,

00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.221
you'll also see some subscores.

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.416
Along with some of the questions

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:55.821
on the writing and language test,

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.261
some questions on the reading test

00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:59.281
will ask you to interpret
the meanings of words

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.836
based on the context of the passages

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:02.484
in which they appear.

00:01:02.484 --> 00:01:03.645
These questions contribute

00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:06.665
to your words and context subscore.

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.684
Other questions on the
reading test, again,

00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:09.857
along with some of the questions

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:11.262
on the writing and language test,

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:13.816
will ask you to interpret,
synthesize, and use evidence

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:15.615
found in a wide range of sources,

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.297
including graphics and a variety of texts.

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:19.516
These questions will contribute

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:22.221
to your command of evidence subscore.

00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:25.924
Both of these subscores
are on a scale of 1 to 15.

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:27.817
In addition to subscores, you'll also see

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:29.964
some cross-test scores.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.276
These scores will be reported

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:32.495
on a scale of 10 to 40

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:34.016
and will be based on selected questions

00:01:34.016 --> 00:01:36.675
from the reading, writing
and language, and math tests

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.402
that reflect the application
of reading, writing,

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:41.980
language, and math skills in history,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.778
social studies, and science contexts.

00:01:44.778 --> 00:01:46.299
All of these scores
help to build a better,

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.582
more detailed picture of your
college and career readiness.

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:53.636
Okay, now back to the reading
text and what it looks like.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:55.320
All of the questions on the reading test

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.676
are linked to a passage,
a pair of passages,

00:01:57.676 --> 00:02:00.915
or a passage with an
informational graphic or graphics.

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:04.340
Think of tables, charts, and graphs.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.499
The reading test has five
passages that vary in length

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.576
from 500 to 750 words each.

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:11.932
Every passage or pair
of passages has 10 or 11

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:15.659
questions with it for a
total of 52 questions.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.679
You'll have 65 minutes
to read the passages

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.873
and answer the questions.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.092
On each test, you can expect to see

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:23.031
at least one pair of passages

00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:24.331
and at least one passage

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:27.152
with an informational graphic or graphics.

00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:30.820
For example, here's a single
social science passage

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.478
followed by a bar graph.

00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:35.732
Let's take a minute to talk about

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:37.879
the different types of passages.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.331
In the reading test, you're going to see

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.372
both literary and informational passages.

00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:45.019
Literary passages will be
drawn from works of fiction,

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.341
usually an excerpt from
a short story or novel

00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.535
from the U.S. or other parts of the world.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.218
The informational passages will be drawn

00:02:51.218 --> 00:02:52.740
from published non-fiction works

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.770
in the area of history,
social studies, and science.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.417
You can expect to see at
least one science passage,

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:00.471
at least one social science passage,

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:02.897
and at least one passage
from the founding documents

00:03:02.897 --> 00:03:04.755
along the lines of the
Declaration of Independence

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:07.994
or the Constitution or from
the great global conversations

00:03:07.994 --> 00:03:10.293
such works inspire.

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:12.939
The purposes of the passages will vary.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.716
The purpose might be to tell a story,

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:19.336
make an argument, explain a
study or experiment, and so on.

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:22.309
The passages will also
cover a range of complexity,

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.050
from texts written at a 9th grade level

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.151
up to what you would expect
to see early in college

00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:29.274
or other post-secondary training.

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:31.132
Now let's talk about
the types of questions

00:03:31.132 --> 00:03:33.697
that are on the reading test.

00:03:33.697 --> 00:03:36.809
Generally, the questions fall
into three main categories.

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.212
You'll see questions about
the information and ideas

00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:40.408
in the passage.

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:42.636
That is, what the passage says directly

00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:44.750
or what it implies.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.316
You'll also see questions that ask about

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:47.931
the rhetoric in the passage.

00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:51.448
Think about structure, purpose,
and the craft of writing.

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:53.190
These questions ask how the author

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.489
of the passage says something.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.810
And you'll see questions
that ask you to synthesize

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.795
information by asking
you to draw connections

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:01.572
between two related passages

00:04:01.572 --> 00:04:02.930
or between a passage and

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.751
an informational graphic or graphics.

00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:07.969
If you'd like to know more about
the reading test questions,

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.989
you'll be able to see videos
that give an in-depth look

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.510
at the different question types,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.935
how they work, and what they look like.

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:15.909
So that's the introduction
to the reading test.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.349
Now try reading a few passages

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.673
and answering some practice questions

00:04:18.673 --> 00:04:20.420
to get familiar with the SAT.
