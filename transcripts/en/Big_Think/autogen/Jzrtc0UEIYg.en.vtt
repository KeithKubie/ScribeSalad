all histories in all communities and
it's one that this generation is going

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
it's one that this generation is going
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.309

because it end of the right to but these
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.910
because it end of the right to but these
rights also will will bring out their

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
rights also will will bring out their
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.890

own struggles and I mean I see this all
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.800
own struggles and I mean I see this all
the time and and you know so I think we

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
the time and and you know so I think we
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.500
the time and and you know so I think we
all need to be more alert to the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
all need to be more alert to the
 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.589
all need to be more alert to the
differences that we experience and and

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599
differences that we experience and and
 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.440
differences that we experience and and
and and and give witness to based on

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
and and and give witness to based on
 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.000
and and and give witness to based on
where we are in history but I think we

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
where we are in history but I think we
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.110
where we are in history but I think we
also have to understand that you know

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120

what we all have struggles and as a

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769
what we all have struggles and as a
 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.800
what we all have struggles and as a
result we are all struggling people and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810
result we are all struggling people and
 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.170
result we are all struggling people and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.470
that that should be able to elicit a
certain kind of empathy that can sustain

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
certain kind of empathy that can sustain
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.410
certain kind of empathy that can sustain
