00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.020
In a competition between the DC and Marvel
Comic Universe, Marvel has reigned supreme

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.550
in the last decade with projects on both the
big and small screen.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.860
With X-Men and The Avengers pulling their
substantial weight in big budget films and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.430
Netflix becoming the home of Jessica Jones,
Luke Cage, and Daredevil, and with even more

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.480
projects in development, it seems the Marvel
Universe has become a ceaseless machine.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.850
With so much interest in the Marvel Universe,
there has been plenty of discussion of its

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.620
characters, plots, and potential crossovers
but even with die-hard fans there are some

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.290
secrets that have mostly stayed hidden.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.320
Here are 10 Marvel Cinematic Universe Secrets
You Didn’t Know About.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.050
Antman was going to be made long before the
other Marvel films.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.020
Iron Man was released in 2008 but before there
was even a script for the billionaire genius

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.340
with the great one-liners, the studio was
set to make a film about another smart guy,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.450
Scott Lang, who has the ability to change
his size for the sake of crime fighting.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.930
Edgar Wright, the man who brought us Shaun
of the Dead and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.159
had his own script ready to go.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.150
It was a comedic heist film.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.689
However, there were far too many delays and
Marvel studios decided to change the script

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.650
to better fit within the cohesive universe
causing the original script to fall by the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.900
wayside and for audiences to wait until 2015
to see an Ant-Man film.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.260
There was almost a Hulk origin story film.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.729
After Edward Norton was signed on to play
Bruce Banner for 2008’s The Incredible Hulk,

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.770
the actor took it upon himself to rewrite
the existing script to give the depressed

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.680
scientist more of a backstory.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.850
Norton attempted to convince the studio that
a longer more detailed account of Hulk’s

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.079
origins would be a better story and would
help give layers to the character in general.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.659
Ultimately, the studio disagreed and preferred
more action scenes rather than more character

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.230
driven drama.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.940
One story element remained from Norton’s
script, Banner’s attempted suicide appeared

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.390
in The Avengers.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.440
There was no script when they filmed Iron
Man.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.510
When Marvel studios decided to make Iron Man
in 2007, they prepared with production schedule

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.400
and casting but failed to provide the cast
or the crew with a script.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.800
According to Jeff Bridges, who played Obadiah
Stane, when the actors arrived to shoot the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.310
film, they were given an outline but no dialogue
or further information.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.680
The studio had rushed production to ensure
a May 2008 release but didn’t worry themselves

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.280
with such necessary materials like a script.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.590
The dialogue was largely improvised moments
before the cameras began to roll.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.870
Bridges stated that there were a few phone
calls to writers for suggestions but the actors

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.210
had to come up with most of the interactions
on their own.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.629
Comic book writers were brought into the writer's
rooms to ensure quality.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.890
Marvel fans are loyal and most of them became
fans long before their favorite characters

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.280
were in films.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.599
Since there is so much importance placed on
making sure a character is true to his or

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.870
her comic version of themselves, the studio
created a group of comic writers along with

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.470
their film writers in the form of a brainstorming
think-tank.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.280
Unfortunately, that group was dismissed in
2015, so time will tell whether their dismissal

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.850
will negatively affect the Universe.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.290
The president of Marvel Studio got his job
for basically being a comic book nerd.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.750
Kevin Feige started out as an executive producer
on soap operas like The Guiding Light and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.060
films You’ve Got Mail and Volcano.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.750
In 2000, Feige was given the job as a producer
for X-Men.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.909
His impressive film fandom along with his
extensive comic book knowledge, particularly

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.340
with Marvel comics, caught the attention of
the studio who gave Feige his first major

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.900
gig with the company.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.050
Seven years later, he was named president
of Marvel Studios.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.150
Wolverine almost had a cameo in the first
Spider Man movie.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.310
Crossovers and fun cameos after the closing
credits have become a fixture of Marvel films

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.330
ever nice Nick Fury showed up at the end of
Iron Man.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.500
However, this tradition could have started
years earlier, if the studio was more careful

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.160
with Wolverine’s wardrobe.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.270
In 2002, while filming Spider Man, there was
discussion of Wolverine having a cameo as

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.490
a way to tie-in the universe but there was
an issue with locating Hugh Jackman’s costume

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.270
and the idea was scrapped.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.470
What their scene would have entailed remains
a mystery.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.530
There are unused scripts waiting to be made,
including another attempt at Blade.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.490
Casual fans may not have realized that Blade,
the half-vampire, half-human originally played

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.970
by Wesley Snipes in the 1998 film is based
on a Marvel comic.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.410
Along with a few other major players in the
Marvel Universe waiting for their own big

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.150
movie, there is a fresh script for a new Blade
film to be a part of the new revamped universe.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.030
Just as Netflix’s Daredevil revitalized
Matt Murdock after 2004’s big screen attempt,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.610
Blade would also be given another go.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.241
Wesley Snipes has shown interest in playing
the titular character again, but there have

00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:27.310
been no serious plans made by the studio.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.330
One of the writers for Guardians of the Galaxy
didn’t actually write any of it.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.139
If you check out the credits for 2014 Guardians
of the Galaxy, you may notice the name Nicole

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.020
Perlman along with the film’s director and
writer James Gunn.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.949
While it is common for a film to have multiple
writers working on a script, this is a case

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.139
of one person getting a credit for no sensible
reason.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.370
It was Perlman who first came up with the
idea of making a film but the final product

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.199
has nothing to do with her original script.

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.479
Perlman inspired Gunn to write his own script
for Guardians and did just that.

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.729
Perlman’s credit remains almost as an appreciation
for coming up with the idea to write a screenplay

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.380
for a film based on someone else’s comic
book.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.560
The passionate kiss after the credits for
Thor: The Dark World was filmed with Chris

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.410
Hemsworth’s wife standing in for Natalie
Portman.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.620
There are some actors who are so busy, scheduling
reshoots or additional footage can become

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.620
a problem.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.860
Natalie Portman being an in-demand actress
made it impossible for her to return to film

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.410
a short scene for the post-credit sequence
of Thor: The Dark World.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.270
For the final moment in which Thor returns
to Earth and is greeted with a kiss from Jane

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.300
Foster, the filmmakers didn’t bother the
Academy Award winner.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.050
Rather than having Portman return, they simply
put her wardrobe and a wig on Hemsworth's

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.500
real-life wife Elsa Pataky who happens to
be an actress and the same size as Portman.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:50.810
No one seemed to noticed this behind the scenes
secret.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.979
Jon Favreau helped make the Marvel Cinematic
Universe but then mocked the entire process

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.220
with his own independent film.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.340
Actor/writer and director Jon Favreau became
part of the Marvel Universe as the director

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.980
of the first two Iron Man films.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.889
For the third film, the studio went another
way and after Favreau’s departure from the

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.190
massively budgeted films, he made his own
indie film called Chef.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.949
The plot of Chef is a thinly veiled mocking
of how Marvel runs their studios.

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:24.940
Favreau’s character in the film plays a
Chef for an upscale restaurant who is berated

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.830
by his corporate boss.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.270
The boss forces his character to make foods
he believes will be received well rather than

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.610
using Favreau’s character’s natural talents.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.690
Of course, the food critics are not fond of
this creation and give terrible reviews.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.440
This causes Favreau’s character to quit
the big impressive restaurant to start his

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.330
own food truck and do what he wants to do.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.879
This move leads to freedom and success.

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:52.129
Along with shedding light on what occurred
behind the scenes between Marvel and the director,

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:57.940
there are also Marvel cameos in Chef including
Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.940
&nbsp;

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.940
There you have it.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.440
