00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.620
RODNEY PRIESTLEY:
Research is exciting

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.960
because it's cutting edge.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.590
And this is the
type of excitement

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.710
that we're trying to share
with the REU students

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.670
when they come in to
campus, is that, hey, look,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.290
you're not just doing research,
you're actually doing something

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.170
that no one's ever done before.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.560
CRAIG ARNOLD: But they all
get this unique Princeton

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.440
experience.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.700
We have resources that rival
any resources anywhere.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.850
And to be able to share
with those kinds of students

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.840
what I'm able to do today
is very meaningful for me.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.040
RODNEY PRIESTLEY: REU itself
stands for Research Experience

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.660
for Undergraduates.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.830
It's an NSF-supported
program that

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.030
allows us to bring upwards to
10 to 20 students to campus

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.620
during the summertime to
undertake research along

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.250
with a faculty adviser.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.960
We very often recruit
students from institutions

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.050
that are not Ph.D.
research institutions

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.100
and so students may not
have the opportunity

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.150
to do research at the level
that we're offering them

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.200
through the Princeton
REU program.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.900
And so it gives
them the opportunity

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.320
to actually decide and
to learn whether or not

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.780
academic research is
actually right for them.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.780
ILANA KRAUSE: Currently,
I attend the University

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.330
of Florida and I'm majoring
in materials science

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.300
and engineering.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.240
So here at Princeton,
I'm working

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.600
with Dr. Richard
Register on a project

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.820
about catalytic hydrogenation.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.300
Catalytic hydrogenation
ends up altering

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.520
the thermal properties.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.690
And so you can see
it being applied

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.610
to the pharmaceutical industry,
the food industry, in oil,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.190
and it really has a potential
to impact people's lives

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.810
on a day-to-day basis.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.480
JON WILSON: My main
interest in research

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.340
is developing technologies
for renewable energy

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.420
like solar cells and
new battery chemistries

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.310
to store that energy.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.390
So I'm working on researching
lithium ion batteries here

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.960
with Dr. Arnold.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.940
At Princeton there's a lot
more equipment available to me

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.510
and also the ratio of
professors to students

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.880
seems to be quite a bit higher.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.570
And so you get more availability
for one-on-one interaction

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.230
here.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.060
LEE HAMPTON: I'm working
with a polymer that

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.250
is actually very prevalent
in a lot of household items.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.360
And what I'm doing is
I'm trying to alter

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.280
physical properties without
chemically degrading it.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.560
You can't say you're an
expert or you know that much.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.640
It's just the opportunity
to be in the environment

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.010
and be in the atmosphere with
all these other guys who've

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.510
been working on this like
three, four, five years

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.680
and see how far they've
come in their research.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.140
And knowing that
some of their work

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.890
could very well be published.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.740
And talking with
professors who actually

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.130
have published research and
stuff like that -- it's special.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.590
CRAIG ARNOLD: You
know, for me when

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.750
I went to graduate school
coming out of a small school,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.520
having a little bit of research
experience under my belt

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.880
really gave me a lot of
confidence, a lot of ability,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.990
to step right in and
be able to, in a sense,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.360
compete with
everyone else, to be

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.860
at the same level
as everyone else.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.640
And so these little
experiences like that, I think,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.810
can be very valuable.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.650
And I really appreciate
to be in a position

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.250
where I can share
that with others.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.830
ILANA KRAUSE: The
experience that I've

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.040
had so far at Princeton has
blown my expectations away.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.240
Being on the brink of
discovery and being

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.930
able to really
just try new things

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.110
and do really
interesting experiments.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.100
LEE HAMPTON: The more
you talk to people

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.810
and the more you get
around, the more you

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.120
understand that everything
is kind of interconnected.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.790
And even though someone
else is focusing

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.110
on something completely
different, nine times out of 10

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.320
they're doing something,
there's a certain aspect

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.980
in their research that could
very well pertain to yours.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.440
ILANA KRAUSE: You're
able to engage

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.820
with other students
in the REU program

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.600
in an intellectual
environment and I

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.710
think that's a really,
really rewarding thing

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.110
that not all REU programs have.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.650
RODNEY PRIESTLEY:
And so we're hoping

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.670
that they enjoy the program,
they meet new friends,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.280
they do interesting and
exciting new science,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.880
they learn a lot about their
research in their new areas,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.420
and they not only get excited
about the science, but also the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.380
in the University and
the possibility of coming

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.340
back here in a few years
as graduate students.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.380
CRAIG ARNOLD: I'm really looking
for them to come out of it

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.880
and say, 'Wow, I loved this!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.520
I want to do more of this.’

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.050
And I want them to think
that, 'Hey, wait a minute,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.640
you know, I could do this.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.910
I could see myself
doing research.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.890
I could see myself being
involved in science.’

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.560
And for some of these
students, they never

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.790
thought of that before.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.140
