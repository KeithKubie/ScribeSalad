00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the goal of all this is to actually

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
define the customer persona or archetype,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which is just a fancy way for saying

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want you to know everything about those customers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What could be everything?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
At the end of the day, not only do you know about the pains and gains

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
of these customers, but you specifically know who they are.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If they're in a company their position and title, their age, their sex, their role.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Consumers could be parent. They could be child.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For a consumer it could be housemate, et cetera.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
How do they buy? Where do they buy?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
How much money do they have discretionary to spend?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And again, it's true in companies, and it's true for consumers.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In companies do you know how much each individual department can sign off for?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That is, if you've priced your product $1 too high,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
sometimes it requires the next level of management to sign off.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Same at home.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you're trying to sell to kids, do you know what their allowances are

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and where they get their money and how often they get it?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And if you're selling to consumers who are parents

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
what's their weekly spend on discretionary items?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You need to understand what matters to them, what motivates them,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
who influences them, and this one isn't trivial.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The influences them, you're going to go back to this

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
when you do customer relationships later,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and it would be great if you actually knew how to reach these people

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and what buttons to push when you do.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And so if you start asking these questions when you're starting to talk to them,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
trying to define them, it makes spending for marketing and demand creation,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that is, for customer acquisition and activation,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
incredibly easy because you already asked them up front

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
how would I get you to buy this?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So marketing doesn't become some mysterious process later on.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Customers already told you "Oh, this is how I buy, and this is how much I spend,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and here is who I listen to when I want to make a purchase."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
As I said earlier, to me the goal is actually for you to know enough

00:01:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to confidently go up to a white board and draw the day in the life of a customer.
