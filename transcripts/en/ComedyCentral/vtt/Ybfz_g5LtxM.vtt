00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:03.337
It's just over a week
since a furious bird's nest

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.473
was elected president,
and many peop...

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:07.975
Oh, they're getting out
right there.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.476
The birds are getting out.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.378
People are still very afraid

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.714
because it's not just civil
liberties being threatened.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.016
It's also shiny things.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.120
The Donald has promised
to tax imports from <i>China,</i>

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:21.488
-which could...
-Wow.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.490
raise the price of the iPhone,

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:27.528
not to mention his plan to ban
all iPhones that aren't white.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.496
-Uh, this...
-(laughter) -Wow.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.300
-Listen, you know...
-(cheers and applause)

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.802
These phones...

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.641
This potential $50 to $97
increase is,

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:41.975
of course,
most concerning to liberals

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.011
since many Trump supporters
prefer to communicate

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.613
-through illuminati fluoride
brainwaves. -(laughter)

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:48.482
So, comedians, how else
might Trump's presidency

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.184
affect the new iPhones?

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.152
James Davis.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:55.255
-Now you can grab Siri
by the pussy. -All right.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.725
(laughter,
cheers and applause)

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.765
(imitating Siri):
Please don't do that right now.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:07.467
Uh, Dan Levy.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.137
It works a lot better than you
expected... in the red states.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.272
-HARDWICK: All right.
Uh, points. -(laughter)

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:13.640
Arielle.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:15.242
He'll bring back
the headphone jack,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.010
-and suddenly, everyone will
love him. -DAVIS: Yes.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.779
HARDWICK:
Yeah, that's all he's got to do.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.380
-(applause) -Yes.
-That's all he's got to do

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:23.183
is put the headphone jack back
where it belongs.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:23.283
We need it!
