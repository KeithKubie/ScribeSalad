00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.010
This is a special presentation of w n y c New York public

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.560
<v 1>radio, opera. People are on that.</v>

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.890
<v 2>The ride of the Valkyrie is my theme song.</v>

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.690
I'm trying to work it into my memorial service. I think you're [inaudible]

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.120
<v 0>blur all nuts and what makes blogging rights special.</v>

6
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.590
They're more not too more intense.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.360
<v 2>Probably some volume with more than that from</v>

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.740
his desire to change his audience, not just to entertain them,

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.860
but to change them, to get inside of them and sturm up.

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.490
I just was so moved by that thing. This is what he was doing.

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.360
This is what he did and he succeeded. I could still just sing about, it.

12
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.940
Still makes me think of tear up, but you know

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.410
<v 3>the man was an absolute horror when it came to stealing money,</v>

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.580
stealing women, but he never wants compromised his artistic vision.

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.020
What I always tell people when they recoil at the idea of watching the ring or

16
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:59.170
other operas is these are mirrors of us.

17
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.060
<v 2>When you see a lot of people making a huge fuss over work of art or an event or</v>

18
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:09.890
a happening, you get curious.

19
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.210
The rain cycle is one of the biggest works of art ever created by one of the

20
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:16.430
most controversial artists to ever live.

21
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.190
Over the next hour we'll explore the question,

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.070
just what is this thing and why does it continue to inspire? Yeah.

23
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.770
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

24
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.930
<v 2>I'm Jack and Ron. This is the ring and I, The Passion and the myth, the mania.</v>

25
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.093
Stay with us.

26
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.793
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

27
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.540
<v 0>so what is</v>

28
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.020
<v 1>the ring, if I had to describe it in one sentence,</v>

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.400
it would go something like this.

30
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.680
<v 0>The ring is a German romantic view of Norris and Teutonic myth influenced by a</v>

31
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.050
Greek tragedy and a Buddhist sense of destiny told with the sociopolitical

32
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.890
deconstruction of contemporary society a psychological study of motivation and

33
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:04.860
action and a blueprint for a new approach to music and theater.

34
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.750
We'll get to all that. The first thing to know about Wagner,

35
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.490
his ring is that it is an event productions of the ring.

36
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.030
Seva will happen all over the world at different times,

37
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:19.140
but here in New York seems to rule through about once every four years like the

38
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:22.410
Olympics and when it does, the air changes,

39
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.260
people's eyes dilate and ring classes like this one, a Julliard,

40
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.260
a practically standing room only.

41
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.170
<v 3>Okay, so let's begin the serious part of the class.</v>

42
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.170
<v 0>This is professor John Mueller. He stands by a piano in surveys, the 40 or so,</v>

43
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.730
mostly older Wagner lovers who are lucky enough to make it into a seminar.

44
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.440
<v 3>We're going to start with a quote,</v>

45
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.170
and it may seem like an odd way to begin this class,

46
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.360
but when the third installment of the Lord of the rings trilogy came out,

47
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.030
they were doing a showing of all three of them.

48
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.370
They referred to this as the trilogy Tuesday and author of the article in the

49
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:00.010
Times made the comment

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.390
<v 0>about you the need to see all three of them together. He says,</v>

51
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.430
shouldn't all three movies be watched together?

52
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.070
Our forebears had Wagner's ring cycle.

53
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.410
We have Peter Jackson's Tolkien trilogy. I took offense to this statement,

54
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.110
a theatrical flourish.

55
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:21.280
Professor Muller flings a newspaper article away from him and discussed almost

56
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.900
hitting a student. Sorry about that.

57
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.140
[inaudible] is still very much with us and I don't think it's something just for

58
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.650
our forebearers and that statement really bothered me.

59
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.210
<v 5>[inaudible] nonetheless. One of the reasons I,</v>

60
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.590
and I would guess many people are curious about Buckner's ring now was because

61
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.230
of the Lord of the Rings Connection With the Lord of the rings for they could

62
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.850
not have existed in the form that that we know it now without vokner as an

63
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.730
example, according to New Yorker music critic Alex Ross,

64
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:55.570
there are the superficial connections like the way the characters dress and also

65
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:59.290
a lot of the language particular Wagnerian phrases,

66
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.310
a ride like a ride to ruin in the world's ending and those similarities he says

67
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:09.130
can be chucked up to ancient Norse mythology were both token and vokner got

68
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.250
their stories, but Wagner threw something new into the mix.

69
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.990
Which token borrowed outright a ring. This is the main connection.

70
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.860
This notion of this object which gives you power and it ultimately makes you

71
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.730
powerless. Ultimately you are a slave to it.

72
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.820
<v 0>Yes,</v>

73
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.180
the ring is very much with us and you know there are people who travel all over

74
00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:31.940
the world going to wring cycles and I don't know,

75
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:33.530
maybe some of you are those people.

76
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.580
It's like the people who travel all over the world going to solar eclipses

77
00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:39.290
wherever they may may happen.

78
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.090
We're talking about four operas here or one opera in four parts and it's 20

79
00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:46.850
hours in all, but it's more than that too,

80
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.280
which was clear from John Mueller's class,

81
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.960
like a hobbit convention or a grateful dead tour. A ring cycle is an event.

82
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.090
It's a happening. It takes planning, so you'll need provisions.

83
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.160
<v 6>That's where we had to fairway.</v>

84
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.550
Fairway is Manhattan's biggest grocery store and when there's a ring in town

85
00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:09.870
it's where you'll find Manhattan's biggest ring fan bread. Yes. Hey.

86
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.180
Hi Chad. Nice to meet you. Pleasure to meet you. Fred. Plot Kid.

87
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.080
He writes about food and opera and get,

88
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.840
this is on his 38th ring cycle.

89
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.330
This year I'll be seeing three ring cycles in different places I'm going to to

90
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.260
at the met with different casts and then I'm going to one in Finland.

91
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.780
My idea of creating a menu to dine while watching all four ring operas is to the

92
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.600
Beastie Maddick with the ring and inspired by the rain.

93
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.670
And I decided to look at the cycle and look for gastronomically queues of which

94
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:49.671
there are so many throughout the ring cycle of foods of food products.

95
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.800
He calls this the Wagner meal cycle.

96
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.190
He's able to tell the entire story of the ring through food and that's why we're

97
00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:58.160
here for sustenance a,

98
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.360
<v 0>I take doggy bags when I attend performances and meet them at the intermissions</v>

99
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.080
and v because the plot of the ring cycle can get complicated fast.

100
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.630
And this is an easy way to remember what's happening on stage.

101
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.640
So Fred begins how the ring cycle begins with gold,

102
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.630
which we find it fairway in the chocolate aisle. John D,

103
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.790
your Yorkie are essential to the ring cycle because these are little gold wrap

104
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:26.960
nuggets of chocolate. They're like currency but hate like bricks of gold.

105
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.310
The first opera,

106
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.990
the Rheingold begins underwater at the bottom of the Rhine river.

107
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.920
We see three Ryan made in swimming around. They guard the gold.

108
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.490
All is fine with the world, says Fred, while the gold stays there.

109
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.860
That's you fundamental thing of the rain cycle.

110
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:47.861
When it's stolen theft and it's given away like taxes to the rich.

111
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.220
What happens is everything goes to skew and therefore we try to put the gold

112
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:57.950
back in the Ryan. It takes 20 hours to do it, but for the moment,

113
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:02.000
what we see on stage are Rhine maidens, swimming, she marine gold,

114
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.750
and what we hear is the orchestra building around the one e flat chord,

115
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.160
and this is where things get interesting. As John Muller tells his class,

116
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.760
this may be more than just pretty water music. In one sense,

117
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:18.761
the opening of the prelude is showing you the Rhine River from the very depths

118
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:23.720
of the Ryan when you get the opening e flat and the double basses then to higher

119
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.740
levels and more activity with our pzegeo figures in the strings,

120
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.600
but on a much deeper level.

121
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.950
Wagner is giving you creation itself and he represents this by using the

122
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:38.951
overtone series and other words we have in a sense the creation of tone from one

123
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.580
pitch, the birth of an entire universe as told in music.

124
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.770
Note by Note Adam by Adam,

125
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.300
which is why Professor Miller tells his students when they're in the audience

126
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.230
during the scene,

127
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.640
they may want to close their eyes going to burst out after more than three

128
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.070
minutes and you get the first ride.

129
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:02.750
Vaden entering who Glinda at initially she sings a couple of nonsense syllables

130
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.900
until she actually starts to speak the words the opera.

131
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.580
So it's as if Faulkner is also trying to convey the creation of speech

132
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.160
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

133
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.160
<v 0>this is just one indication buggers approach to drama is pretty wild on stage.</v>

134
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:35.180
The eyes in our head are seeing Ryan maiden swimming while the eyes and our ears

135
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.620
are getting another image,

136
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.810
the cosmos being born and perhaps Wagner meant for our mind to somehow run to.

137
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.460
The question remains though,

138
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.740
how do you even get the first part right to visuals? This is opera members.

139
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.570
So along with music we've got the problem of staging

140
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.890
the ring is the biggest project. I think that any

141
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.370
<v 7>opera house faces always. This is Joe Clark.</v>

142
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.150
The Metropolitan Opera is technical director and we're on stage during a

143
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:03.840
changeover.

144
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.660
There's a challenge there that I don't think is like anything else too.

145
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:11.190
I write 4,000 empty seats to our left 60 some odd worker's swing hammers and

146
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.940
push props, and to my dismay for the swimming Ryan maiden scene,

147
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.740
he says they don't use an aquarium.

148
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.970
It's certainly not realistic water by any means. In fact,

149
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.860
it's very stylize,

150
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.890
but the whole proceeding was filled with a number of moving gauzes that are

151
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.270
painted to look like water. They're constantly in motion in their smoke,

152
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.800
dry eyes effects operating at the same time with fans scan,

153
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:42.420
it sort of seems like Colin sonder Warren and the three Rhine maidens.

154
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:46.110
Meanwhile, Joe has them stand on three separate stage lifts,

155
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.640
which move up and down, but very slowly so you,

156
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.060
you get that sense of water flowing.

157
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.630
<v 5>We'd heard that the Seattle opera takes it a bit further.</v>

158
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.730
So we called director Speight Jenkins.

159
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.550
His company has taken the Rhine maidens to new heights.

160
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.210
Literally they suspend the singers 25 feet off the ground.

161
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.073
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

162
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.100
<v 8>well, it looks like [inaudible] is what it does. The first time I saw it,</v>

163
00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:11.650
I almost dropped because you see, first of all,

164
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:15.340
we dress them in kind of mermaid ish type things. Wonderful wigs.

165
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.600
It looks as though the, it's a very fluid and easy movement. They can go down.

166
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.520
In other words, they can go down and they can spin.

167
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:26.521
Now what makes it unusual is that they do in fact flip as they seem

168
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:31.803
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

169
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.250
<v 8>the three young women at first were,</v>

170
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.320
you know a little bit nervous about that as the,

171
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.900
as we moved on into rehearsals and got to the provinces,

172
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.930
they flipped all the time as they saying, they would flip on singing. High note

173
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.470
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

174
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.460
<v 5>very good. You don't put it into [inaudible].</v>

175
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.160
This voice right here, that's where the trouble starts.

176
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.100
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

177
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.820
<v 5>this is al the evil dwarf. He shows up at the bottom of the Ryan,</v>

178
00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:03.010
starts to chase the Rhine maidens round and round.

179
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.280
They laugh at him.

180
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.790
Then he steals their gold and forges a ring that will make him master of the

181
00:11:09.791 --> 00:11:10.624
universe.

182
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.510
Eventually the gods steal it from him and the world begins to go south.

183
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.083
<v 4>Fun.</v>

184
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.510
<v 5>Wagner, his musical universe really starts to take off.</v>

185
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.240
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

186
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.700
<v 0>for more on that we visit pianist Jeffrey Swan.</v>

187
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.520
<v 5>Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.</v>

188
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.570
<v 0>Jeffrey Swan lectures all over the country about the ring and in particular on a</v>

189
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.850
system Wagner developed called light motif.

190
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.900
It's as if he gave each character a theme and then change those teams as the

191
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:43.740
characters change.

192
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.880
He demonstrates as we sit at a grand piano that takes up almost as entire

193
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.073
midtown apartment.

194
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.190
The ideal listener to the ring early on needs

195
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.020
<v 9>to become aware, I suppose of leitmotifs a real obvious one.</v>

196
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.480
When we hear the, um, the Rhine maidens and the very first scene, um,

197
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.830
when they're singing their song of joy and they say, Ryan Gold, Ryan Gold

198
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.510
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

199
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.470
<v 9>they sing it over and over again.</v>

200
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.973
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

201
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.570
<v 9>at the end of the work,</v>

202
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.590
we hear the ride main sort of off stage and now there'd be wailing their fate as

203
00:12:34.591 --> 00:12:35.910
it were because they've lost the gold,

204
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.890
lost their gold and the gods aren't giving it back to them.

205
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.863
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

206
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.240
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

207
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.820
<v 9>here it's something concrete, a change of harmony.</v>

208
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.160
The fact that the orchestration is completely different.

209
00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:03.900
There's just a harp on stage, the difference

210
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.580
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

211
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.060
<v 0>but this is just the tip of the iceberg. It gets much, much,</v>

212
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:15.680
much more complicated with Jeffrey because often Wagner will use light motifs to

213
00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:18.080
comment on the action. What a foreshadow,

214
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.500
and this is something film composers have eagerly embraced. I mean,

215
00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:24.830
just imagine if the Rhine maidens are swimming and you hear this in the

216
00:13:24.831 --> 00:13:25.664
orchestra,

217
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.010
you know immediately what's about to happen to them.

218
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.770
It seems obvious, right? But think about how powerful this is. Just two notes.

219
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.800
Create the image of a big fish in your mind,

220
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.420
which brings us back to Lord of the Rings

221
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:48.890
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

222
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.870
<v 7>and Oscar winning composer Howard shore.</v>

223
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.591
Howard,

224
00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:58.730
if I were to call your scores for the Lord of the Rings Movies Wagnerian not

225
00:13:58.731 --> 00:14:01.370
saying I would, but if I were to call it that,

226
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.730
you would think what I would think like Motif, music,

227
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.870
expressing emotional ideas and the use of leitmotifs.

228
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.230
Is that something you made use of in your score? Oh, I think tremendously.

229
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.960
How so? Well, there's over 50 and fatigue. Oh, really? Used in the piece, uh,

230
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.080
didn't reflect each individual character by they reflect, uh,

231
00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:24.140
characters and places and objects.

232
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:28.490
The ring itself has four motifs for its different moods.

233
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.470
And here's the one you may recognize if you've seen the movies.

234
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:42.710
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

235
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.110
<v 0>just seems like a good time to ask the question. Why a ring?</v>

236
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.890
This was something token borrowed from Wagner, but where did Wagner get it from?

237
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.980
And what does it mean? Hi, it's

238
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.230
<v 5>Chad and w and Y, Z e right there.</v>

239
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.410
So we visited Lori Shapira in her small offices.

240
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.880
<v 11>Brooklyn. Laurie, Shakira is a union analyst,</v>

241
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.000
also teaches a class about north Smith

242
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.340
<v 12>volunteering and symbolism in the ringside. Well, first of all,</v>

243
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:11.390
the ring is made of gold. It's made of the gold.

244
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.220
So it's manufactured. And I think that's an important piece of this.

245
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:19.110
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

246
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.590
<v 12>gold is a treasure, right? But in its raw state,</v>

247
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.710
it's perhaps worthless in a way.

248
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.540
Only valuable if it's made into something else.

249
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.910
<v 11>That's a very western concept.</v>

250
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.750
<v 12>A person who is willing to renounce love and who has the skill to forge the gold</v>

251
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.400
into a ring,

252
00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.390
we'll be able to have measureless might is the way it reads the libretto reads.

253
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.800
<v 5>It's a very modern idea. New Yorker music critic Albatross.</v>

254
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.120
It's not something that a,

255
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.110
the old story tellers seem to think about any random person in be able to,

256
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.040
to pick up an object and automatically, uh, have power over everything. It just,

257
00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:04.440
it wasn't part of their, their way of looking at the world.

258
00:16:04.441 --> 00:16:07.130
Power wasn't infinitely transferrable.

259
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.880
Those who had power were born with power and those who didn't, uh, you know,

260
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.990
would never be able to touch it.

261
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.460
<v 12>You know, he wrote this around the middle of that of the 19th century.</v>

262
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:22.060
Wagner wrote the ring in the same year that Marx wrote the communist manifesto

263
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.130
and there was a revolution going on.

264
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.760
There was something in the air we could view that as perhaps the real dawn of

265
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:32.864
the age of [inaudible].

266
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.180
<v 5>No, what that means is open to interpretation,</v>

267
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.030
but Lori Shapira defines it as the beginning of the end.

268
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.340
Destructive technology was on the horizon.

269
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.580
Kings and queens were being replaced by new belief systems.

270
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.260
Wagner was creating a mythology for these uncertain times with the ring of power

271
00:16:49.261 --> 00:16:53.490
at the center, a symbol of both what's possible and what might be missing.

272
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:53.731
<v 11>It's a,</v>

273
00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:56.640
it's a myth that appears apparently at around the same time that coins were

274
00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:59.980
invented, Pulitzer Prize winning playwright, Tony Kushner and it,

275
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.990
and it has always stood on some level for the invention of money,

276
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.930
the transfiguring power of gold in that it's a f,

277
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.420
it's an invisible force.

278
00:17:09.421 --> 00:17:12.960
I mean the ring is always the thing that makes you invisible and unseen so that

279
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.320
it can be there and not be there or what's the thing in our lives that's there

280
00:17:16.321 --> 00:17:20.610
and not there at the same time that has immense power but is essentially

281
00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:22.110
invisible. It's the power of money.

282
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.993
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

283
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.630
<v 5>Speaking of money,</v>

284
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.530
my first opera ends with the gods and marching triumphantly into their new

285
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:51.840
castle. Valhalla built by giants and paid for with stolen gold

286
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.580
<v 6>block and explains it's a real estate deal and the the gold is stolen by Al</v>

287
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.320
Brick. The dwarf and then is taken by vote Tom,

288
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.420
the chief God who gives it to the giants factor and facile for their laborers to

289
00:18:07.601 --> 00:18:10.750
build Valhalla. Yeah. How do you get to this great big castle?

290
00:18:10.751 --> 00:18:14.140
You have to build a rainbow bridge. It takes energy to do that.

291
00:18:14.141 --> 00:18:17.230
So what do you eat? Rainbow Trout. And that's what we're going to do.

292
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.650
See if they have rainbow trout

293
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.800
<v 5>coming up. Incest apocalypse now in a ring of fire,</v>

294
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.020
you are listening to a special presentation from wny scene,

295
00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:33.480

300
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.110
This is a special presentation from W and y c New York public radio,

301
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.230
the ring and I, The Passion, the myth, the mania.

302
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.240
It's amateur night cafe Tochi uptown.

303
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.140
This place we've been told is where professional opera singers hang out after

304
00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:56.220
performances and also where three times a week up and comers strut their stuff.

305
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.550
This is one of those nights and we're hoping to see something from the ring

306
00:19:59.551 --> 00:20:04.200
cycle to use in this documentary, but this Guy Brian Griffin, flat out refuses.

307
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.620
I could never sing the ring in my life no matter what I do.

308
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.360
I just don't have that kind of voice. I mean it's the epitome of singers,

309
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.840
dumb things. That's a word.

310
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.150
Another aspiring singer takes the stage and let's rip some Italian opera.

311
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.140
Well, I head to the back to join a table of dramatic files.

312
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.370
Includes rock guitars, Gary Lucas, formerly at the band captain Beefheart.

313
00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.680
<v 13>Let's just say that some of the classic led Zap rifts could be considered</v>

314
00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:37.150
Wagnerian. Can you give specific examples? I wonder celebs have. Okay,

315
00:20:37.151 --> 00:20:41.290
let's go to the very first led. Zep Hits whole lot of love. You know,

316
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.453
it's got this motif

317
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.250
and that motif is really hammered home.

318
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.170
<v 14>This is a special presentation of w n y c New York public radio</v>

319
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.180
<v 15>opera. People are all nuts.</v>

320
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.490
<v 2>The ride of the Valkyrie is my theme song.</v>

321
00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:03.750
I'm trying to work it into my memorial service. I think your point was all nuts.

322
00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:07.200
Then what makes Wagner rights special? There are more, not too more intent,

323
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.660
probably on volume with more than

324
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.870
[inaudible] [inaudible] desire to change his audience,

325
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.480
not just to entertain them, but to change them,

326
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.640
to get inside of them and stir them up. I just was so moved by that thing.

327
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.650
This is what he does do. This is what he did and he succeeded.

328
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.140
I could still just think about it still makes me kind of [inaudible]

329
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.823
but you know

330
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.000
<v 3>the man was an absolute horror when it came to stealing money,</v>

331
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.170
stealing women, but he never wants compromised his artistic vision.

332
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.350
What I always tell people when they recoil it,

333
00:21:43.351 --> 00:21:47.760
the idea of watching the ring or other operas is these are mirrors of us.

334
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.783
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

335
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.460
<v 2>When you see a lot of people making a huge fuss over a work of art or an event</v>

336
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.470
or a happening, you get curious.

337
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.790
The ring cycle is one of the biggest works of art ever created by one of the

338
00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:05.010
most controversial artists to ever live.

339
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.370
<v 14>This is a special presentation of w n y c New York public radio</v>

340
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.360
<v 15>opera people are all nuts.</v>

341
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.640
<v 2>The ride of the Valkyrie is my theme song.</v>

342
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.930
I'm trying to work it into my memorial service. I think it was blur all nuts.

343
00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:24.350
Then what makes Wagner rights special? They're more nuts and more intense,

344
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.870
probably on volume of more than [inaudible].

345
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:34.510
His desire to change his audience, not just to entertain them,

346
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.280
but to change them, to get inside of them and stuff.

347
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.860
<v 14>This is a special presentation of w n y c New York public radio</v>

348
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.860
<v 15>opera people are all nuts.</v>

349
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.140
<v 2>Well, the right of the Valkyrie is my theme song.</v>

350
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:52.430
I'm trying to work it into my memorial service. I think you're blur all nuts.

351
00:22:52.431 --> 00:22:54.260
Then what makes blogging rights special?

352
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.290
There are more nuts and more intense probably because volume is more than

353
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.183
[inaudible].

354
00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.570
It's desire to change his audience,

355
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.150
not just to entertain them, but to change them,

356
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:11.370
to get inside of them and stir them up. I just was so moved by that thing.

357
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.320
This is what he was doing. This is what he did and he succeeded.

358
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:19.180
I could still just sing about it. Still makes me kind of, but you know,

359
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.680
<v 3>the man was an absolute horror when it came to stealing money,</v>

360
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.850
stealing women that he never wants compromised his artistic vision.

361
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.030
What I always tell people when they recoil it,

362
00:23:32.031 --> 00:23:36.440
the idea of why human ring or other operas is these are mirrors of us.

363
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.510
<v 4>[inaudible] when</v>

364
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.350
<v 2>you see a lot of people making a huge fuss over a work of art or an event or a</v>

365
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:47.120
happening, you get curious.

366
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.440
The ring cycle is one of the biggest works of art ever created by one of the

367
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:55.190
most controversial artists to ever live. Over the next hour,

368
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:56.450
we'll explore the question,

369
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.330
just what is this thing and why does it continue to inspire? [inaudible]

370
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.020
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.180
<v 2>I'm Jack and Rob. This is the ring and I the passion, the myth, the mania.</v>

372
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.343
Stay with us.

373
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.693
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

374
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.280
<v 1>so what is the ring? If I had to describe it in one sentence,</v>

375
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.660
it would go something like this.

376
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.320
<v 0>The ring is a German romantic view of Norris and Teutonic myth,</v>

377
00:24:31.321 --> 00:24:33.990
influenced by a Greek tragedy and a Buddhist sense of destiny,

378
00:24:33.991 --> 00:24:37.140
told with the sociopolitical deconstruction of contemporary society a

379
00:24:37.141 --> 00:24:41.250
psychological study of motivation and action and a blueprint for a new approach

380
00:24:41.251 --> 00:24:43.860
to music and theater. But we'll get to all that.

381
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.600
The first thing to know about Wagner is ring is that it is an event,

382
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.290
productions of the ring. Siva will happen all over the world at different times,

383
00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:56.400
but here in New York seems to rule through about once every four years left the

384
00:24:56.401 --> 00:24:59.670
Olympics. When it does, the air changes,

385
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.060
people's eyes dilate in wind classes like this one,

386
00:25:03.061 --> 00:25:06.510
a Juilliard practically standing room only twins.

387
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.310
Arthur Wilbarger explains,

388
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:13.310
we have two lonely people who are these twin brother and sister parted at birth.

389
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.820
And there's always been a sense of something missing in their lives.

390
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.950
They've had rotten, miserable lives, both of them.

391
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:25.340
And then they meet and he says something that I think is so powerful.

392
00:25:25.501 --> 00:25:29.820
He says to best us, Bill, you are the image that I've kept hidden in myself.

393
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.833
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

394
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.940
<v 0>and that's why he loves her. And I think that's,</v>

395
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.800
that's a beautiful moment for anybody who's ever had any kind of a, um,

396
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.480
a coming out process coming out as anything coming out as a full human. Yeah.

397
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:56.360
<v 1>Being incest as self-discovery. Sound crazy. Hello</v>

398
00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.130
<v 0>Metaphor. If we're not capable of metaphor,</v>

399
00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:03.040
you're probably going to have a lot of trouble at the opera anyway.

400
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.790
Or the movies will says, just think of all the cinematic incest out there.

401
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.170
Princess Leia Skywalker, back to the future. Cruel intentions. House of yes.

402
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.770
Oedipus rex dangerously as well.

403
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.630
This is a myth that speaks to our primitive brains, says writer and commentator,

404
00:26:16.631 --> 00:26:17.464
John Rockwell,

405
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.240
the deepest archetypal needs and longings of a given culture.

406
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.240
And these are common across cultures.

407
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.750
And so almost every culture has an incest love story or a heroic hero who

408
00:26:32.681 --> 00:26:34.330
defeats a fearsome enemy.

409
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.283
<v 2>I'm selfless.</v>

410
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.380
<v 0>The heroic hero and fearsome enemy coming our next opera for now,</v>

411
00:26:41.381 --> 00:26:44.070
back to the family drama vote the head

412
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.110
<v 2>God and dad of this dysfunctional family has to figure out what to do about the</v>

413
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.710
ancestors. Twins. He does love the twins. They are his kids after all.

414
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.930
But what they are doing is illegal and immoral.

415
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.100
He tells his daughter Brunello to go get Sigmund and bring him to Valhalla.

416
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.600
In other words, kill him. She agrees and shows up at Sigmund's house,

417
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:08.190
but finds that he doesn't want to come as far as she's concerned. It's like, hi,

418
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:09.990
come on, let's go to Valhalla. It's really great,

419
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.940
which you can't understand why he wouldn't want to go.

420
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:13.530
But when he explained it to her,

421
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.530
she then starts to understand what he explains to her.

422
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.270
Such Jane is that he's in love.

423
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.930
He'd rather stay here on earth with his sweetheart than go up to Valhalla,

424
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:25.560
no matter how glorious it is up there. And that totally flips her.

425
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:29.010
She's never seen true love before and it makes her question everything.

426
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:34.280
Should she even kill this guy? Or God Forbid Disobey Her Dad. [inaudible]

427
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:38.710
<v 0>Arthur will Wilbert jury. So on the one hand we have these, um,</v>

428
00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.690
[inaudible] fairy tale, let's say fairy tale characters,

429
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.710
but I think what is really superb about the ring,

430
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.360
they're real people to real characters go through real emotions.

431
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.990
And the fact that they happened to be gods is kind of immaterial in a sense

432
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.890
because what you've got here says Jane is a story anyone can relate to a story

433
00:27:58.891 --> 00:28:01.080
about him growing up and becoming independent,

434
00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.260
and that's why she loves this role because of the development that you get.

435
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:08.040
And that comes through the music as well as through the character and the drama.

436
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.090
Speaking of the music in Wagner, the music knows everything,

437
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.170
even when the characters don't know what's going to happen. Music does this.

438
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:17.960
We found out from Jeffery Swan,

439
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:22.050
we're back in his small apartment with a giant piano for another demonstration.

440
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.520
He explains that Votan carries a giant spear wherever he goes.

441
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.230
The spear stands for vote on his power.

442
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.960
His legal power is his power to rule the world.

443
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.250
And the spirit he says has a musical motif. The whole opera of era is sort of,

444
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.070
could be,

445
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:41.070
could be experienced strictly as or policed as a exercise and what happens to

446
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:43.350
the spear motive? In other words,

447
00:28:43.351 --> 00:28:46.260
what happens to photons authority over his daughter.

448
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.910
He demonstrates starting with the original Motif, the spirit

449
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:06.883
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

450
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.960
<v 0>from that spear motive. You get something like [inaudible].</v>

451
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.653
<v 4>[inaudible],</v>

452

<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

453
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.020
<v 4>C. Yeah.</v>

454
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.900
<v 0>I can't hear the different there. Deconstruct it for you. You can.</v>

455
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.450
Can you give me like a 32nd deconstruct? Sure. The spirit motive,

456
00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:27.400
let's put it in there. Their convenience.

457
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.193
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

458
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.670
<v 0>scale rhythmic going down. Okay. First thing, let's put it in the major</v>

459
00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.313
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

460
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.260
<v 0>instead of continuing down, let's jump back on ourselves.</v>

461
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.083
<v 4>Slow it down.</v>

462
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.840
[inaudible]

463
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.673
<v 12>hi</v>

464
00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:52.603
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

465
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.833
[inaudible].

466
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.920
<v 2>This was an epiphany. The one thing anyone can hear in Wagner is rings flux.</v>

467
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.170
It's unstable music,

468
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.800
huge masses of sound swirling endlessly like waves and yet inside that flux

469
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.830
there is a center. You feel it.

470
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.800
Millions of musical cells multiplying, mutated,

471
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.010
make up the 18 hour organism that is doing cycle,

472
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.280
each cell attached to a character idea.

473
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.840
All these characters and ideas and constant states of change like what we're

474
00:30:33.841 --> 00:30:37.160
listening to now, just one of those cells, a spear. Meredith,

475
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.390
a symbol of photons, power and authority transform.

476
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.723
<v 4>[inaudible],</v>

477
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.673
[inaudible],

478
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.393
[inaudible], [inaudible]

479
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.463
<v 12>analyst, Laura Shapiro.</v>

480
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:49.570
The main conflict in the in the ring is love versus power.

481
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.690
Now it would be easy to say, well,

482
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:56.980
the power guys are the bad guys and the love guys are the good guys in the

483
00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:57.814
world,

484
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:03.510
but we all have inside of us a power drive and arrows.

485
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:09.760
Really the most important way of interpreting is to look at it psychologically

486
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:15.270
that all of these characters are part of the individual are parts of the

487
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:21.511
personality that are in conflict so that the deepest way to interpret this

488
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:28.120
conflict between love and power is to find it in one south.

489
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.550
<v 2>Brunhilda is often referred to as vote.</v>

490
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.060
Hahn's will is if there are two parts of the same person.

491
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.390
<v 0>Photon had ordered her to kill the boy twin because he felt bound to by law.</v>

492
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.160
He disobeyed his orders but fulfilled his true wishes.

493
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.190
They meet on a mountain top and he decides for punishment,

494
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.700
<v 6>which brings us back to Fred family.</v>

495
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.460
Rutan Hilda is photons favorite daughter and she shows up,

496
00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:08.970
does battle disagrees with her father who he loves and these are intolerant

497
00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:12.790
times and though he says, I love you, he says, have to put you to sleep.

498
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.750
And so he kisses your eyes shut in a very tender scene.

499
00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.870
Suddenly he creates a fire.

500
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.613
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

501
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.823
[inaudible], [inaudible]

502
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.103
[inaudible].

503
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.830
<v 6>It's kind of like the fires of the southwest.</v>

504
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.550
I know the president talks about his clean forest initiative when he should see

505
00:34:01.551 --> 00:34:06.551
this and then what you have is this incredible fire that protects Brunhilda.

506
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.530
It never burns her so that only a great hero can penetrate the fire to wake her

507
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:17.150
up and she's leaving for 18 years. So when she wakes up, boy is she hungry.

508
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.360
So I created rock shrimp,

509
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:24.370
<v 0>Colombia because she's many liters, seems in the ring, can seem hokey.</v>

510
00:34:24.371 --> 00:34:28.790
But this moment at the end of the Valkyrie where photon gently kisses Buena,

511
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:33.580
his eyes to sleep is one of the most famous and most widely loved the entire

512
00:34:33.581 --> 00:34:34.414
cycle

513
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.220
<v 11>soprano, Jane Eaglin. My father died very young.</v>

514
00:34:38.221 --> 00:34:42.060
So the whole sort of father domes relationship is something which is very much

515
00:34:42.061 --> 00:34:42.900
in my mind.

516
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.460
The idea of never seeing your father again is something that I can certainly

517
00:34:47.461 --> 00:34:48.294
relate to.

518
00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.380
Occasionally there have been times in a Valkyrie performance when I have

519
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:53.700
actually felt, you know,

520
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:57.450
tears welling up just because you get so into the moment. I mean,

521
00:34:57.451 --> 00:35:02.451
I do think that the Photon Front Hilda scene at the end of the Carrie is like

522
00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:07.050
the greatest father daughter scene ever written playwright Tony Kushner.

523
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.420
It's so mu, I mean it's so moving.

524
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.470
The music is so heartbreaking and the things that they say to each other,

525
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.590
deep stubborn and love that they have for each other kind of it,

526
00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.720
it's in dialectical tension to, to uh,

527
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.570
the way that everything else breaks under the spell of the goal.

528
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.200
That this is an this kind of connection that it simply cannot be severed.

529
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.943
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

530
00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.920
<v 0>you are listening to a special presentation from W NYC,</v>

531
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:55.450
New York public radio that ring and I, The Passion, the myth, the mania.

532
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.703

[inaudible] [inaudible],

535
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.760
<v 0>um, Jab and Ron, this is a special presentation from w NYC,</v>

536
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:04.620
New York public radio, the ring and I, The Passion, the myth, the mania.

537
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.800
There are certain facts about Wagner that get repeated over and over.

538
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.070
However unbelievable. Here's one.

539
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.640
There are more books on Wagner than anyone except Christ.

540
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:21.830
That was Dorothy Pepe, the American Wagner Association.

541
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.400
We called the library of Congress. They couldn't verify it, right? It is true,

542
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:27.890
and every week there's another book on Wagner.

543
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.360
One thing is for sure though, if Wagner is second to God,

544
00:37:32.361 --> 00:37:36.980
he wouldn't be pleased. He thought he was God and like it or not,

545
00:37:36.981 --> 00:37:40.520
he created a work in the ring cycle that is like the Bible.

546
00:37:40.521 --> 00:37:44.360
It's open to an infinity of interpretations, not all good.

547
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.480
<v 12>It would be very easy to interpret the ring in terms of politics,</v>

548
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:51.580
let's say analyst and historian,

549
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.280
Lori Shapira looking at different groups of people,

550
00:37:55.670 --> 00:38:00.670
the new belongs or the gods to sort of assign them to different ethnic groups.

551
00:38:02.001 --> 00:38:04.910
Perhaps Hitler was loved doing that.

552
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.840
<v 0>For instance, imagine how the third opera,</v>

553
00:38:07.841 --> 00:38:10.390
the ring cycle might look through the eyes of the Third Reich.

554
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.590
It's called Siegfried and it begins with an r

555
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:16.780
<v 4>[inaudible],</v>

556
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.970
<v 0>the one side Siegfried,</v>

557
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.020
the muscular blue eyed child of glory on the other Mima a sniffling,

558
00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:24.640
crafty dwarf. The dwarf is the boys of Guardian.

559
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.040
Lima found him abandoned in the forest, raised him, but now sick feed is dying

560
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:33.630
<v 4>to get away. [inaudible]</v>

561
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.250
<v 0>playwright Tony Kushner. I mean, Mimi</v>

562
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.450
<v 11>has sort of, you know,</v>

563
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:42.451
this repulsive whining fetch is on one level that you're supposed to sort of

564
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:44.920
sneer at him as this person who slept in prison.

565
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:48.460
Siegfried in this like false domesticity and that he has to be there.

566
00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:51.820
You have to throw off the chains of this terrible Jew who was like your neighbor

567
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.950
longer, whatever you want to call him. This wonder man,

568
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:56.980
she was like clinging to you so that you can go off and be the hero.

569
00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.410
But of course that isn't really the experience. I mean,

570
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:03.460
what's really great about Siegfried is that it's like a fantastic portrait of

571
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:06.550
this abs and you and you know, Wagner intended it.

572
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.380
It's like one of the most marvelous portraits of a teenage germ

573
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:16.520
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

574
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.520
<v 11>you know, those scenes between him and Mimi are just fantastic.</v>

575
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:23.180
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

576
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.630
<v 11>it's not to say that Wagner didn't hate Jews. He did in an early essay,</v>

577
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.910
he called Jews worms and freaks of nature.

578
00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.000
It's not that you're unaware of the fact that this is a great racial

579
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:32.931
nationalist,

580
00:39:32.931 --> 00:39:37.460
epic written by an antisemitic ego maniacal monster,

581
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:41.300
but it's just too great to leave alone.

582
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.530
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

583
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.610
<v 11>what we've got here is the most universal story known to man a hero's journey.</v>

584
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:51.520
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

585
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.920
<v 11>like star wars. You've got to sword much like a Lightsaber,</v>

586
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:56.170
a boy looking for his parents, interesting creatures,

587
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.060
some insects they're in for good measure.

588
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.210
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

589
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.240
<v 6>Siegfried, it turns out as the child of the twins from our last opera,</v>

590
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.930
<v 4>oh [inaudible]</v>

591
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.310
<v 6>and as writer Fred Block and explains back at fairway,</v>

592
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.620
our hero has got a lot of growing up to do.

593
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.150
And really Siegfried the opera is the education of Siegfried.

594
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.600
Sort of a coming of age story, right? Coming of age story. Uh,

595
00:40:21.601 --> 00:40:26.550
Ashton Kutcher would do it now it's probably option than writing I think.

596
00:40:26.551 --> 00:40:28.080
So Fred Parallels,

597
00:40:28.081 --> 00:40:31.980
sig frees ring journey with his own gastronomic one by ordering up a filet of

598
00:40:31.981 --> 00:40:36.390
swordfish. He goes from being a callow, you getting an education,

599
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.120
literally sort of trials by fire.

600
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.320
And the first fire is actually the forging of the soar,

601
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.430
which is wonderful music.

602
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.130
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

603
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.930
<v 6>Once he's created the sword,</v>

604
00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.610
he learns how to use it and he discovers that fastener.

605
00:41:01.611 --> 00:41:06.080
Remember factor the giant theft and the giant we met in the first opera,

606
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:09.170
he built the gods a castle and exchange for the Rheingold.

607
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.900
He's been holding onto the gold for all these hours.

608
00:41:11.901 --> 00:41:13.700
Now the gold includes the ring.

609
00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.800
Whoever has the ring is master of the universe, but the ring has a curse on it,

610
00:41:18.801 --> 00:41:23.801
so he who takes something that's not rightfully is like taking the Whitehouse

611
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.150
when you didn't win, pays the consequences. As you can see,

612
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.050
the story is so archetypal that anyone can see what they want. Well,

613
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.400
manages the giants as Republicans. Tony Cushner prefers the Marxist review.

614
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.270
I mean,

615
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.860
<v 0>it's essentially a socialist parable, which queens?</v>

616
00:41:40.861 --> 00:41:42.480
The giants with the working class.

617
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:47.460
It's gigantic in Kuwait forest that you know that's been promised a share in

618
00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:51.180
divinity. In any case, after the giant is no longer at giant.

619
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.270
When he got his hands on the ring, he turned himself into a dragon.

620
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.550
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

621
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.420
<v 0>he singing dragon, not your typical Lord of the Rings Dragon.</v>

622
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:03.650
He's sometimes depicted as a sad creature woozy. When the power of the ring

623
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.950
here again, interpretations vary.

624
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:15.080
<v 8>[inaudible] dragons are always in the ring. Cute. Speight Jenkins,</v>

625
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:19.340
the Seattle opera. So I said, I want to have a dragon that is truly scary.

626
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.870
Okay, fine. We thought, well let's have a dragon bigger than the opera house.

627
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:28.550
And so we only see his clothes. Well, a was a bad idea.

628
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.391
And B,

629
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:32.840
it was an idea that I didn't think through and nobody else did either because

630
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:34.430
Siegfried supposed to send him in the heart.

631
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:37.100
So how on earth do you stab him in the heart if you don't see a heart?

632
00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.750
We didn't. How did you not think of that? I don't know. But we didn't.

633
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:45.200
So then we moved on to dragon number two,

634
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.273
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

635
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.830
<v 8>Greg. And number two was a dragon seven feet tall.</v>

636
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.650
And this was a beautifully conceived dragon high-flow.

637
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:59.340
It was a old locomotive with a steam shovel for a face.

638
00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.161
Really?

639
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:05.161
It came on stage led by stage hands all dressed in black and it puffed steam and

640
00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:11.260
out of the steam shovel blew huge amounts of fire. Wow.

641
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.430
And the audience went totally crazy over it. When he was stabbed,

642
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.200
all of the smoke died,

643
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.920
all of the fire died and all of the stage hands who had a chance to be real

644
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.230
hands all fell to the stage dead at that moment.

645
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:36.270
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

646
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:40.440
<v 0>after the dragon six read has an even bigger challenge when Hilda remember her,</v>

647
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:44.100
she's been asleep for 18 years on a mountain surrounded by a ring of fire,

648
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.300
secrete comes along to wake her up sort of a snow white sleeping beauty

649
00:43:48.301 --> 00:43:49.134
situation.

650
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:50.060
<v 6>He was friend.</v>

651
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.360
We could also say that the whole progression of the cycle is not just the

652
00:43:53.361 --> 00:43:58.361
consequences of the ring but the growth of Brunhilda from a Sassy young woman,

653
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:04.571
a goddess full of Piss and vinegar to use a food term or ginger lets say when

654
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:08.600
she's been put to sleep for 18 years,

655
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:13.550
he is awakened as a mortal rice soprano.

656
00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.000
Jane Egan means it becomes more dramatic I think as the cycle goes on.

657
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.500
Really she's discovering her womanly qualities and falling in love.

658
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.480
She's no longer a goddess and doesn't have the power he had and therefore

659
00:44:26.481 --> 00:44:27.830
develops as a human.

660
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.100
And this is what is so fundamental to understanding the ring cycle

661
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.390
<v 3>that gods are not infallible.</v>

662
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:42.710
Mortals have great power and glory if they know how to use it and they become

663
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:44.970
the best that they can as human beings.

664
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.063
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

665
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.450
<v 0>is Wagner approached the end of the ring cycle,</v>

666
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:11.010
which took him 25 years to write a few things began to dawn on him. First,

667
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.730
the theater, no theater in the world would be able to stage this. A dragon,

668
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:19.620
a ring of fire. It was getting too big. What to do. Well,

669
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.650
first he tried to redesign the city of Munich around the ideal opera house that

670
00:45:25.021 --> 00:45:28.770
he would need in order to present this the right way. Okay.

671
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:32.490
Do you know any artists like this? It wasn't simple. Vanity driving and says,

672
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:33.324
well Berger,

673
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:37.830
Faulkner wanted the opera house to redeem the world and like Siegfried,

674
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.270
he thought it was up to him. Yes,

675
00:45:39.271 --> 00:45:42.780
it was very like the the artist as savior of humanity.

676
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.470
What he wanted to save humanity from was fragmentation. In today's world.

677
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:49.770
You've got art over here in politics over here in philosophy and religion over

678
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:54.720
there. Bob, you wanted them all together in one glorious mind, altering fusion,

679
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.030
a festival which would last for four days,

680
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.120
and then in this wonderful idea he had at the end of these four days,

681
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:06.090
you just burned the structure to the ground because you're burning man kind of

682
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.700
situation. Burning man, totally burning man.

683
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.240
Burning man incidentally is an annual art gathering in the Nevada desert that

684
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:14.580
ends with the burning of a giant wooden statue.

685
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.550
The entire community dancing around it in some way,

686
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.890
praising all the art that had gone into it.

687
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.140
That's symbolic renewal like burning man.

688
00:46:22.141 --> 00:46:24.630
It would have to be outside the bounds of civilization.

689
00:46:24.631 --> 00:46:28.680
You'd have to travel long distances to get there. Leave your life behind.

690
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:33.450
The place he chose was a small town in Germany called by Roy King built him a

691
00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:37.740
theater specifically to stage the ring cycle and that theater and the town

692
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:41.670
remained to Wagner divo teas. The promised land, the Hodge,

693
00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:47.260
<v 7>the most intense experience I've ever seen of real desperation was going to buy.</v>

694
00:46:47.261 --> 00:46:52.261
Right and seeing people try to get in right are in commentator John Rockwell

695
00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.230
some. It is so, so, so hopelessly, so loud.

696
00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:01.180
There's this desperate cadre of people holding up signs saying zero quit,

697
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.500
s, u, c, h, e,

698
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:07.420
which means looking for tickets and I was one of those people in the summer of

699
00:47:07.421 --> 00:47:12.421
1959 or 60 I really feel like it's just stepping into an alternate universe.

700
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:17.270
New Yorker, music critic, Alex Ross, you're, you're living in, in,

701
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:22.360
in Wagner's world. It's like a vacation inside a work of art.

702
00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:23.290
I don't know how to describe it.

703
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.950
It was only about these operas and so nothing else was going on.

704
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.280
And you sit around talking with these fanatics of which you are one

705
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.390
<v 2>about about Wagner and about the experience and about the performance and</v>

706
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:36.370
whether it was any good and it was good and it wasn't good.

707
00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.940
<v 5>I've just never experienced anything like that. I mean,</v>

708
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:43.310
when you go to the opera at the met, are there any other urban opera house?

709
00:47:43.311 --> 00:47:46.610
You Go, you're in its world for a few hours and then when you leave,

710
00:47:46.611 --> 00:47:50.290
you get subway, you'd go home. You know the bills are there.

711
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.730
<v 2>Now this is perhaps obsessive, but it is devotion. I mean,</v>

712
00:47:55.731 --> 00:47:56.564
you know,

713
00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:01.570
people make fun of the romantic image of the artist as kind of mad men who are

714
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:08.480
above the normal range of human experience and have some direct connection with

715
00:48:08.481 --> 00:48:10.340
the divine and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

716
00:48:10.341 --> 00:48:15.341
And it's very easy in our modern politically correct age to mock that all said,

717
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.250
Wagner wrote the book and I'm being a medic artist.

718
00:48:19.251 --> 00:48:23.360
I mean he was more brilliant and more talented and more close to divine

719
00:48:23.361 --> 00:48:26.420
inspiration than most other people. And when you hear his music, you hear that?

720
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.133
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

721
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:33.420
[inaudible]

722
00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.970
<v 5>we pick up the action with sick Freen Brunhilda on the mountain,</v>

723
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.750
right where we left him. Sick feet puts the ring of power on her finger.

724
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:44.760
They embrace. If we were to stop the story right here, we'd have a happy ending.

725
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:48.270
The ring of power becomes a wedding ring. Love conquers all.

726
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.980
And Wagner considered going this route but then scrapped it because somewhere

727
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:53.521
along the way,

728
00:48:53.521 --> 00:48:58.500
his outlook on life changed from Utopian to Dystopian and that's exactly what we

729
00:48:58.501 --> 00:49:01.920
get in this final opera. Very large doses of things falling

730
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:04.600
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

731
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.860
<v 2>That's why it's called the twilight of the gods.</v>

732
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.610
Brunhilda send Siegfried off on an adventure. Well, back at fairway.

733
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:14.380
Fred Plotkin

734
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.130
<v 6>grabs the package of rings off the shelf and explains the trouble that lies</v>

735
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:23.110
ahead. The one major character that we've not really spoken about yet is Haagen.

736
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:28.410
He's the son of Al Brick who put the curse on the ring a long time ago and

737
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.130
Haagen is the bad guy.

738
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:38.670
He's the one who plots to Duke Siegfried by taking him away from Brunhilda Hilda

739
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:43.300
and introducing him to a woman named good Taroona. Good Bitch.

740
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:47.080
I'm not kidding if Siegfried is dude, he's given drugs.

741
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.340
The classic love potion,

742
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.460
he forgets about his wife and falls in love with another woman.

743
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:55.210
He has betrayed when Hilda and she will betray him right back.

744
00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:00.560
He's just not swift and ultimately will be due by lots of people in.

745
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.533
That's his great cry.

746
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.110
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

747
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:14.070
<v 2>maybe being a heroic hero is as much about being stupid as being courageous.</v>

748
00:50:14.071 --> 00:50:16.140
In any case, sick freed is clueless.

749
00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:20.370
The only character or theme that has any clue in this world is the music.

750
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:23.820
Remember how Wagner created little musical themes for his characters and

751
00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:26.910
objects. We'll listen to how he uses them and just looking at this.

752
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.040
I see so many

753
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.100
<v 0>things. Look at so many references. We're back at pianos.</v>

754
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.690
Jeffrey Swan's Manhattan apartment.

755
00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:35.450
When we turned to a random page from the final opera, so we have,

756
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:42.200
<v 4>that interval has to do with Haagen and there's the smear.</v>

757
00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.960
Here's a new motive of the blood brotherhood.

758
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.000
It's related to the nibble on this.

759
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.290
Actually the torx dwarfs that and forging.

760
00:50:58.650 --> 00:50:59.550
<v 0>Would that have to stop a second?</v>

761
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:02.760
That was a Goo Truda and friendship and the fire.

762
00:51:02.761 --> 00:51:03.594
They're going to go [inaudible].

763
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:06.970
<v 4>This is back to the blood brotherhood again.</v>

764
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.000
It's going to get complicated in seconds.

765
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:15.490
That's friendship and that's Haagen. There's this sphere again,

766
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.600
<v 0>this is complicated. Definitely you have to follow any of this.</v>

767
00:51:21.601 --> 00:51:25.120
People like Jeffrey Swan have spent their lives trying to decode it all.

768
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.610
It still can vary because maybe Wagner didn't intend it to make literal sense.

769
00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.340
You might imagine it like this. I think,

770
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:33.360
I mean when you're walking down the street just live in your life.

771
00:51:33.361 --> 00:51:37.410
Your brain is firing off all of these thoughts. Half thoughts, really. Wow.

772
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.560
Cute dog and my fat. Hmm Relativity, what am I going to wear tonight?

773
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.240
I'd like that song. Who am I?

774
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:45.420
All of these things you're thinking but not conscious of thinking.

775
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.580
If everyone else on the street is doing that too.

776
00:51:47.581 --> 00:51:48.990
When you could somehow collected all,

777
00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:54.000
you'd have a gurgling churning pool of longings and yearnings.

778
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.660
Recruit would later give this a name, the collective unconscious,

779
00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:01.080
and that says Jeffrey Swan is what Wagner was doing with the instruments of his

780
00:52:01.081 --> 00:52:05.160
orchestra, trying to reflect the subconscious emotional life of his characters.

781
00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:08.610
Now how much does does, does a casual listener pick up of this?

782
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:13.020
I think he picks up some of it actually that could fairway,

783
00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.440
as Fred explains things with sick feet are about to take a turn for the

784
00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:17.363
[inaudible].

785
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:22.690
<v 6>He's taken on a hunting trip. All the guys are going out,</v>

786
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.580
you know, and there was swords and Siegfried has his sword,

787
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:31.300
but he's briefly described it in Hoggins tabs him in the back.

788
00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:34.690
This goes back to your Rome, if not before that,

789
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.400
but Siegfried is step. Siegfried is superhuman,

790
00:52:39.401 --> 00:52:41.830
but he has one weak spot on his back.

791
00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:45.490
And the real tragedy here is that it was brewed. Hilda told Haagen about it.

792
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:51.030
She was blinded with rage over secretes betrayal and they carry him back to the

793
00:52:51.731 --> 00:52:56.080
castle. And there's this gorgeous music. Gorgeous.

794
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.750
It's um, the funeral music,

795
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.930
the Ryan Kearney and funeral music is they take him back. His,

796
00:53:01.931 --> 00:53:04.000
some of the most glorious music ever written.

797
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:26.743
[inaudible]

798
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.160
<v 0>Brunhilda now in the land of humans,</v>

799
00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.250
sees the body and her anger turns to sadness.

800
00:53:43.251 --> 00:53:45.770
She realizes what brought about this treachery

801
00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:48.573
<v 7>Brando JD.</v>

802
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.250
<v 17>At one point she said that another wonderful life in the room, she says,</v>

803
00:53:51.251 --> 00:53:52.840
now I know everything.

804
00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.110
I know. I understand everything. I know everything.

805
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:11.570
She has to give the ring back to the Ryan Dye, but everything will be fine.

806
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:15.000
<v 0>Wow. It's almost like she becomes the hero then. Oh, totally.</v>

807
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:24.480
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

808
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.370
<v 0>six [inaudible] are tragic,</v>

809
00:54:25.371 --> 00:54:29.300
not so bright here out turned out to be a deacon all along a woman comes

810
00:54:29.301 --> 00:54:33.680
through. In the end, Carl Yoon saw this as Wagner critiquing patriarchal rule.

811
00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.910
What the audience sees are supposed to see something that has tortured technical

812
00:54:37.911 --> 00:54:39.890
directors like Joe Clark for a hundred years.

813
00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:41.853
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

814
00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.600
<v 7>a lot happens in a very short time. I'm listed as long.</v>

815
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.300
We're at the metropolitan opera again this time underneath the stage,

816
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.090
Joe explains his technique for destroying the world,

817
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:58.680
which involves setting an entire stage above us on elevators and then at the

818
00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:02.790
point of collapse, the elevators themselves are moving down at the same time,

819
00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:06.450
elements of that scene were coming upon a he, you can create this sort of,

820
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:08.760
no one would've ever thought to try this before Wagner,

821
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.680
which is why the is sometimes called Prodo cinema movies. However,

822
00:55:13.681 --> 00:55:15.030
the music supports the visual.

823
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:20.060
Here it says Joe and music is out front with the visuals hanging on for dear

824
00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:24.690
life. The way I often measure it or this does say I do it, does it?

825
00:55:24.691 --> 00:55:29.280
Does it look like it sounds and if you can get something in the ring to look

826
00:55:29.281 --> 00:55:30.420
like the ring sounds,

827
00:55:30.421 --> 00:55:34.680
it's sounding like one of the most remarkable things in the history of western

828
00:55:34.681 --> 00:55:37.740
art and you can get something to look like that sounds.

829
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.830
It's quite wonderful in the theater in Wagner, his head,

830
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:43.320
it all happens in one astonishing moment.

831
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:46.710
When Hilda light secretes funeral pyre throws herself in it,

832
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:51.360
flames sees the stage and ball Holla, the of the gods collapses

833
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:00.903
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

834
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:07.510
<v 0>then the Rhine River overflows its banks and the Rhine maidens come swimming by</v>

835
00:56:07.511 --> 00:56:08.500
to reclaim the ring

836
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.760
for the first time since the beginning of the cycle.

837
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:16.680
The balance in the universe is your store

838
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:21.040
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

839
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.490
<v 0>the ring cycle was Wagner trying to put his arms, the world and compass</v>

840
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:28.630
<v 2>everything. Thousands of years in mythology said to extraordinary music</v>

841
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:34.170
and yet at the center of all that huge, it's just us up there.

842
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:38.940
People trying to be knowable, joint possibility failing.

843
00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:42.630
That's the surprising thing from a guy who thought he was gone.

844
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.180
We get a story about how the gods must die,

845
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.470
and maybe this is what it means to say things about.

846
00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:50.990
And not just that you try to save everything,

847
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:54.170
but it will try even though you know you ultimately can't.

848
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.490
Thug nurse music can express more than any of us can.

849
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.630
It's perhaps the most important thing I can say to you. Now. Listen,
