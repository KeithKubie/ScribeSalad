00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.700
So we've talked about how it's
possible to have lines for

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.600
every single point has
the exact same x- value.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.395
And that corresponded
to a vertical line.

00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:12.190
But I want to know, is it possible
to draw a line where every point

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.500
has the same y -value?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.710
Just select yes or no.
