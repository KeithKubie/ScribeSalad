00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.720
Something kind of fun happened this morning. My channel rolled over all 7's 7, 777,777

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.060
I was not planning to make a video at all today today's supposed to be my day off,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.060
but I have something I want to show you.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.420
All of my countertops for the first time in years are almost completely clutter-free.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.920
This little table over here has had stuff sitting on

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700
It ever since I moved it down here from four years ago

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
And this entire area has been crammed packed with clutter ever since we finished the kitchen down here

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.689
This is the only clutter. I have left it will probably all be cleaned up in the next couple of weeks.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.000
So let's talk for a minute about the rice experiment from yesterday's video. The comments on that video are amazing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.200
So let me just start off by saying no, I wasn't high when I film that video it was not an april

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.780
Fool's prank it was not a social experiment although the kind of reaction to God might make it worthy of one it was not promoting

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.879
Pseudosciences and it was not scientifically conclusive, but I like you guys

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.899
And I really care about what you think so when there's such a strong reaction like there wasn't a video yesterday

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.599
I feel like I have an obligation to give you the rest of the story.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.759
First of all everything I said in the video was true

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.369
We did come across a book that people told the street like you most likely we were a little bit skeptical

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.249
But we thought we just read the book and see what I had to say, my wife

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.409
And I both read it it seemed interesting enough although. We weren't grasping on the concepts as truth instead

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.789
We thought it might be worth just having some fun and putting it to the test and see what happened

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.529
we'd seen on the internet the hundreds of people had tried taking cooked rice and putting them in different jars and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.650
Labeling them and speaking to them so for a fun family

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.420
Activity we decided to get the kids involved and we tried that ourselves now. This is about five years ago

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.590
We just moved in our new house

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.960
I just started producing my king of random videos things got crazy busy, my wife let me know that for about a month

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.919
She did try to keep up with the experiment by having the kids talk to the jars in the morning before school

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.709
But with the craziness of life they eventually just got brushed aside,

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.839
Tucked on the shelf and completely forgot about and that right there was pretty much the end of the story until about six months later

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.119
We had some people visiting and they asked us what these jars were on the shelf and at that time we noticed they were changing

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.169
Color which we found was interesting. We said they've changed colors and interestingly enough

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.780
They'd change colors to kind of match the labeling on the jars now [likee] we didn't draw any conclusions

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.099
We just thought it was interesting and then forgot about them for about number four and a half years two weeks ago

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.509
I was running around my basement cleaning up everything that I could possibly clean up donate to charity throwing in the garbage and

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.670
Decluttering when I came across these jars

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.439
I thought it'd be fun just to do a quick video and show you the results of the experiment that we tried

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.629
I saw so many comments from people concerned that this wasn't followed through the scientific process there should have been more

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.929
Samples the jars should have been sterilized there should have been in control guys

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.138
did not see that coming if the result of this video inspire other people to try the results for themselves and

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.629
Everybody comes back with the same results

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.968
Then maybe this idea is worthy of a more scientific study until then it was just a simple family experiment

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.309
Non-Scientific never claimed it was, go back and watch my video, and you'll find that my words were chosen very carefully

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.959
But apparently they may not have been chosen carefully enough because a lot of you got triggered so on that note

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.929
I really hope I've been able to satisfy your concerns and put a little context behind the video obviously this wasn't an mit

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.760
Sponsored Scientific event they're just some kind of interesting results to a simple household experiment

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.209
I wanted to show you before I threw those jars away see in the next video

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.089
One last thing apparently I forgot to put the instagram link in the video where I mixed aluminum with brass

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.780
I still am giving away this master sword as well as all these metal alloys

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.049
So follow me on Instagram watch the stories in the next couple of days

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.659
I'll post a link on how you could apply to get them. See you there!

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.660
