SPARKY RHODE: Good afternoon,
everybody.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.950
Welcome once again.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.860
It's Wednesday afternoon, and we
are the EMEA-based Android

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.596
Developer Relations Team at
Google TV-- team here to talk

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:15.320
to you about Android
Development.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.420
I'm Sparky, coming to you
from Munich, Germany.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.580
And we've got Matt and Nick
and Rich in London, UK.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.570
And who is this fourth
face that we see?

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.850
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.380
Hi, there.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.780
We have a guest with us in the
UK office again this week.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.130
This week it's Chris Banes.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.438
CHRIS BANES: Hi, guys.

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:31.254
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHS].

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:31.662
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.662 --> 00:00:32.900
RICH HYNDMAN: Just hi.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.000
CHRIS BANES: Hi.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.817
RICH HYNDMAN: Do you want to say
a little bit about Android

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:37.362
stuff that you've done
before, maybe?

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:38.600
Or--

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.480
CHRIS BANES: Besides stream
on over from--

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.872
RICH HYNDMAN: Spot total.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.050
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.150
So some of the stuff-- sort
of got pulled the refresh

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.310
library, wrote FriendCaster,
also it's a bit--

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.560
a lot, really--

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.290
that didn't quite
go with these.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.510
RICH HYNDMAN: Generally
awesome in the Android

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.680
community over here.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.863
So, hi.

00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:53.344
CHRIS BANES: Hi.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:54.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.088
CHRIS BANES: Hi to Richard.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.000
SPARKY RHODE: Welcome
to the Hangout.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.100
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
good Hangout.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.120
So we're hoping quite a lot
of you join in today--

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Because we only
have three questions in the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.400
Moderator for this week.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.950
If not, it'll be quite
a short session.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.030
So if you have Android
development questions, please

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.275
come along and join us
in the Hangout, or

00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:12.460
comment on the G+ thread.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.760
If you can't get in, then we'll
invite you in so you can

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.352
ask your questions live.

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:17.660
Else, add some more
questions into the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.860
Moderator to keep us going.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.640
SPARKY RHODE: Three questions.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.530
I'm impressed.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.430
That's a 50% improvement over
the last time I looked.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.150
RICH HYNDMAN: [LAUGHS].

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.200
Two questions, and one thing
that says, "This is not a

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.160
question, but enjoy
your Hangout.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.610
Thanks,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.960
Andrew Kelly." [LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.390
RICH HYNDMAN: One-man Moderator
machine when he's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.073
not adding questions into
the Moderator, still

00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:38.760
filling it up for us.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.950
NICK BUTCHER: Andrew Kelly, on
G+ the other day, was saying,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.720
when will Droidcon come
to Australia?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.400
And I was telling him
that Droidcon's not

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.380
organized by Google.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.910
It's a community-run event.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.000
Anyone could set up
a Droidcon, so--

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.680
I think.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.145
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:50.610
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, certainly.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.940
Right.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.320
NICK BUTCHER: So, I think
Andrew should

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.930
organize one in Australia.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.350
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.570
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.640
NICK BUTCHER: I will go.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.780
RICH HYNDMAN: We can introduce
you to the Droidcon organizers

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.800
if you want to get--

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.090
au.droidcon.com.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.520
NICK BUTCHER: I'm prepared
to go to Australia.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.060
RICH HYNDMAN: I believe they do
have to license the name.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.820
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.540
NICK BUTCHER: They
licensed the word

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.970
"Droid," yeah, they did.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.186
MATT GAUNT: See, I thought
Droidcon wasn't organized by a

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:07.774
central thing.

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:09.139
It was basically like ad-hoc
people could do it.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.000
And then, now they're discussing
that maybe they

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.130
should make it a slightly more
sort of collaborative effort

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.360
so that you have to kind of go
through them to then sell any

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.590
Droid components.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.630
RICH HYNDMAN: If any of the
Droidcon organizers are

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.750
watching this--

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.425
MATT GAUNT: They are
free, though.

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:20.240
RICH HYNDMAN: They
are free, yeah.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.770
If anyone knows, pop
in and tell us,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.100
actually, so we stop guessing.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.974
RICH HYNDMAN: Because that's
just dangerous.

00:02:27.974 --> 00:02:28.930
[LAUGHS].

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.480
Yossi.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.940
Hey there.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.780
Good to see you again.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.825
Thanks for joining.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:33.910
Do you have any questions
for us today?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.790
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Hi.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.860
Hope you can hear me now.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.040
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, we
can hear you fine.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.390
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.070
Just wanted to ask about
implementing or using Google

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.170
Hangouts API inside an Android
application, and what are the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.460
baseline guidelines for
that and so on?

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.440
RICH HYNDMAN: The Hangouts
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.770
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so
there aren't any.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.361
Because there isn't any.

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:00.740
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHS].

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.650
RICH HYNDMAN: To my knowledge,
that doesn't exist.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.400
Have you found something
we don't know about?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.300
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, we're
thinking to build an

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:18.140
application and try to see if
there is any API for Hangouts.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.950
Also for Android, not
only for web.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.650
RICH HYNDMAN: Uh-huh.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.700
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Didn't
find any.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.310
So I just wanted to ask if--

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.390
RICH HYNDMAN: No, I mean the
people-- you should head to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.220
the "Google+ Office Hours."
They host office hours as

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.745
well, at
developers.google.com/live,

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.140
and have a chat with them.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.412
They might be able to talk to
you about any APIs that there

00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:38.724
are for Hangouts.

00:03:38.724 --> 00:03:39.580
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.750
RICH HYNDMAN: At the moment,
I think the Hangouts APIs

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.260
revolve around adding
functionality

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.220
to Hangouts, not--

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.448
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:46.384
RICH HYNDMAN: Sites.

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:46.852
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:48.970
MALE SPEAKER: Their
applications.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.320
RICH HYNDMAN: Who's
that making noise?

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.085
That's almost muted.

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:53.430
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHS].

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.740
RICH HYNDMAN: I was gonna
say, where's Al Sutton

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.475
when you need him?

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:57.085
But of course, Al Sutton's
off playing with Booyah!

00:03:57.085 --> 00:04:00.660
He got his first Booyah!
hardware during the week.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.940
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.480
RICH HYNDMAN: So
he's probably--

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.550
CHRIS BANES: Swell.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.980
RICH HYNDMAN: --just
playing games.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.625
NICK BUTCHER: Just a ball.

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:05.720
RICH HYNDMAN: If you're
watching, Al, enjoy that.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.662
Right.

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:10.160
I'm just going to pull up the
comments thread as well, just

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.830
to make sure we don't
miss anything.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.060
NICK BUTCHER: One request
that I've seen.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.736
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:14.232
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:14.730
Are you there?

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.465
SPARKY RHODE: I notice that
we've been joined in the

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:17.640
Hangout by a couple
of newcomers.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.399
We've got Paul, and we've
got Stephano.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.100
Welcome, guys.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.250
Do you have anything on
your mind that you'd

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.090
like to bring up?

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.390
Any Android-related topics
that you'd like

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.920
to talk about now?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.450
PAUL: Hello?

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.710
Can you hear me OK?

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.976
MATT GAUNT: Hey, Paul.

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:31.430
PAUL: Hi.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.400
Good to meet you guys
a week ago.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.090
MATT GAUNT: You too.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.810
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, you too.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.460
Hey.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.530
PAUL: That was good fun, and
good to see what's going on

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.015
with Android.

00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:38.635
MALE SPEAKER: Mm-hmm.

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:41.975
PAUL: I do have one
quick question.

00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:42.720
I can't remember--

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.750
I spoke to somebody, I can't
remember who it was--

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.770
about submitting the
NFC fix as a patch.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.260
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.750
PAUL: Can someone tell
me where to go

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.540
or what to do, please?

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.970
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.603
If you go to
source.android.com--

00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:56.490
PAUL: Yep.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.030
NICK BUTCHER: There's a section
there about how to

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.450
submit a change.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.600
PAUL: Oh, OK.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.290
Cool.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.890
Sounds easy, then.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.890
NICK BUTCHER: Well, yeah.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.750
I guess so.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.832
You have to kind of create your
own [? garret ?] and all

00:05:09.832 --> 00:05:10.528
that stuff.

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:10.991
Yeah.

00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:11.454
PAUL: OK.

00:05:11.454 --> 00:05:14.160
Well, I'll have a look at
it anyway later on.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.100
Thank you very much.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.024
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:19.190
You're welcome.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.880
Any other questions?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.240
Who asked about-- who's
just joined us?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.075
MATT GAUNT: Stephano?

00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:22.400
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.890
Stephano.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.650
Welcome to the Hangout.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.980
What's on your mind?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.180
STEPHANO: Hello.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.490
I am an Italian student.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.980
I don't speak great English.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.350
[LAUGHS].

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.800
SPARKY RHODE: That's fine.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.090
STEPHANO: For money.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.523
I develop only an
app for Android.

00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:41.910
It's just a benchmark.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:42.600
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.670
What sort of a benchmark?

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.386
Like performance?

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:46.700
STEPHANO: Yeah.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.090
SPARKY RHODE: Are you doing
native code or like web

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.480
performance or Java VM?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.860
What are you--

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.480
STEPHANO: No, job performance.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.890
SPARKY RHODE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.820
OK.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.070
Cool.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.450
So how long have you
been working on it?

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.830
STEPHANO: About half a years.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.840
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.520
So what's your impression
of Android as

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.720
a development platform?

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.320
Do you have any favorite APIs,
or something that you wish

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.800
that we would fix?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.050
STEPHANO: Um--

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.550
sorry.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.550
I didn't understand.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.510
SPARKY RHODE: Oh.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.720
So what parts about Android
do you like working with?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.110
And what parts about Android do
you think maybe you would

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.200
like to see some changes in?

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.150
STEPHANO: For me, Android is
perfect at the moment.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.010
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGHS].

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.860
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah!

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.840
RICH HYNDMAN: I agree.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.960
STEPHANO: It's a very
good platform.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.880
SPARKY RHODE: OK.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.790
Very well said.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.060
I'll send you your money later.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.130
SPARKY RHODE: [LAUGHS].

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.400
Cool.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.105
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:57.130
Just updating a couple of the
threads to make sure everybody

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.470
knows where the Moderator
and where this

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.010
session's actually at today.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.510
NICK BUTCHER: Should we take a
look at some of the Moderator

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.350
questions, Sparky?

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.210
SPARKY RHODE: Sure.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.770
There's not a whole lot
here, as I had said.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.190
The first one's kind
of interesting.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.940
This one's from our friend
Johan in the Netherlands.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.220
Says he wants to create two
skins for the app, which he

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.250
equates to having different
resources.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.530
And he wants to basically know,
what are best practices

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.090
for doing this?

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.830
Should he create a library
project with, then, two

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.710
different sets of resources,
or sort of riff on that?

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.720
And just as an aside, he also
mentions that he's using Maven

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.940
to build it, in case that
makes a difference.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.040
Responses from Andrew
Kelly and Yossi

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.520
suggest using themes.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.380
But I'm thinking maybe--

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.670
I mean, what if he doesn't
want the assets for both

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.280
branches of the app in
the same binary?

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.100
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.780
SPARKY RHODE: In the same APK.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.980
Like maybe one is for a client
or something like that.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.270
NICK BUTCHER: Chris, FriendCast
is supporting

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.900
multiple themes.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.740
How did you go about that?

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.020
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.950
So all the graphics were
in the same APK.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.080
So it was all done on
Styles and Themes.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.570
Custom attributes.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.550
NICK BUTCHER: And then
how do you set it?

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.846
You just call setTheme?

00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:11.280
Or do you do it--

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.150
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, so in your
activity, before you call

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.315
super.onCreate, it's
copy before,

00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:17.810
but you call setStyle--

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.720
is it setStyle or setTheme?

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.160
NICK BUTCHER: SetTheme.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.850
RICH HYNDMAN: SetTheme, yeah.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.070
YOSSI ELKRIEF: SetTheme.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.530
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.320
So you call that with your--
the style you want.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.450
So you can call it-- so change
your other preference or

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.750
whatever you need to do.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.566
NICK BUTCHER: So, if you change
style, you have to

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:31.188
recreate the activity?

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:31.654
CHRIS BANES: No.

00:08:31.654 --> 00:08:32.400
It does it.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.809
So as long as you call setStyle
before you call

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:35.960
super.onCreate, it works.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.054
If you call it after,
bad things happen.

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:40.539
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:41.010
SPARKY RHODE: OK, so--

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.710
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.960
SPARKY RHODE: Dynamically--

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.560
you're dynamically switching
your theme--

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.800
basically, the drawable
resources that compose your

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.667
theme right at an
instantiation of

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:53.130
the activity, then?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.520
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.240
SPARKY RHODE: Wow.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.050
OK.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.210
MATT GAUNT: So you'd have to--

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:55.520
SPARKY RHODE: So this is--

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.320
CHRIS BANES: That's how I did.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.470
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.050
MATT GAUNT: So you'd have to
do that for each activity?

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.860
You couldn't do that on like
an application one table?

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.450
CHRIS BANES: Yes, but if you
create a base activity--

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:03.910
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.605
CHRIS BANES: And then
just extend from

00:09:04.605 --> 00:09:06.180
it all, it all works.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.280
RICH HYNDMAN: Good tip.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.935
So this is going to depend on
whether he wants to have an

00:09:09.935 --> 00:09:12.380
app which can change themes
on user request--

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.525
which you would restart your
activity and change it, and

00:09:14.525 --> 00:09:17.470
put both sets of themes in the
APK-- or whether-- yeah.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.570
You're trying to re-skin the
same application with multiple

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.830
clients, when you don't want all
the resources in both, in

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.098
which case the library project
would be a great way to go.

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:25.974
NICK BUTCHER: Mm.

00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:27.295
RICH HYNDMAN: And then
add the themes to--

00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:29.040
SPARKY RHODE: Have any of you
guys worked with apps that

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.010
have downloadable skins, like
Beautiful Widgets or

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.494
something like that?

00:09:33.494 --> 00:09:33.968
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:09:33.968 --> 00:09:35.390
What about them?

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.150
SPARKY RHODE: I just
would like--

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.670
do you know how they organize
their themes there?

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.735
Are they--

00:09:41.735 --> 00:09:42.585
NICK BUTCHER: It's
like a player.

00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:43.720
[INAUDIBLE] then.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.500
CHRIS BANES: Beautiful Widgets,
they download into

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.600
the SD card.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.590
And then they load the images
via FRED, and then just set

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.300
the drawables on each view
to sort them manually.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.710
SPARKY RHODE: Right.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.340
So they're not using the
resource framework?

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.150
They're just using drawables?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.320
CHRIS BANES: There are apps--
so all the apps where the

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.910
themes are done out
of a Google Play,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.620
they're done by resources.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.710
So I think you can access
external resources via

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.310
PackageManager, if I
remember rightly?

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.910
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.940
CHRIS BANES: But I've
not done it.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.150
So, can't comment.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.370
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:14.670
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.130
I know I've seen apps on other
platforms where it was-- you

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.170
could have these skins, and it
was very important that your

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.350
resources be numbered with
exactly the same identifiers

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.775
as in the base project,
and so--

00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:28.330
RICH HYNDMAN: It's one example
of where developers and

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.620
designers collide.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.180
For the latest updates, the
ultimates, [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:32.420
[? Marie ?]

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.790
wanted to change the
theme as he went

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.880
through to the countdown.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.390
But of course, that
would require--

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.920
it was in a ViewPager, so he
could swipe across the

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.360
countdown, but it required
restarting the activity to

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.700
change the theme, which I didn't
find a solution around,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.980
unfortunately.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.500
So we couldn't get--

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:45.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.050
NICK BUTCHER: And watch
them fake it out.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.502
RICH HYNDMAN: Action bar.

00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:47.954
Yeah.

00:10:47.954 --> 00:10:48.860
[LAUGHS].

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.656
But the Action bar had tabs in
it, and a drop-down overflow,

00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:52.148
and buttons.

00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:54.120
And I didn't really
want to go there.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.570
So it didn't happen.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.755
MATT GAUNT: The only kind of
thing that I've done remotely

00:10:56.755 --> 00:10:59.110
like this is the scenario
where you have multiple

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.890
clients wanting pretty
much the same app

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.210
with different themes.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.850
And yeah.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.050
The library route is probably
best way to go, because you

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.640
have to remember when you
publish into Play Store, you

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.560
need a different package name
from everyone else.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.350
So then, yeah.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.810
So you'd basically have to start
doing that about your

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.480
resources, so--

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.600
Yeah.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.942
That's the only sort
of comment I have.

00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:19.160
RICH HYNDMAN: [LAUGHS].

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.140
Nice.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.790
OK.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.540
Hopefully that's answered
your question, Johan.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.040
I know you're gonna watch
this a bit later on.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.041
Sorry, you've got some
comment on that?

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.530
Paul?

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.910
Were you just gonna--

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.920
jump in there?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.270
PAUL: Yeah, I was just gonna
say something on a sort of

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.010
different topic.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.250
But if you're talking
on this topic, I

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.050
can wait for a moment.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.510
NICK BUTCHER: No, go for it.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.493
I think we're done.

00:11:39.493 --> 00:11:40.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Go on, then.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.745
PAUL: On the 4.2, I'm quite
anxious in this ability to log

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:46.210
on to this tablet or device
for multiple users.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.240
RICH HYNDMAN: OK?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.980
PAUL: Can anyone shine a
bit more light on that?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.080
For example, I presume the apps
have their own data areas

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.780
for-- per user.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.300
Will things like Contacts
and other things be

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.430
user-specific as well?

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.890
The answer is yes.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.860
You--

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.530
it's very much like having your
own individual tablet.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.930
PAUL: So like, everything would
be working in the same

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.085
way as the Contacts and--?

00:12:11.085 --> 00:12:11.420
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.970
The only thing that's shared are
the application binaries

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.110
themselves.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.330
So--

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.870
PAUL: So if you download an app
under one user, the other

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.210
user would be able to
see that same app

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.520
downloaded into their--

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.210
no.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.425
RICH HYNDMAN: No, but if they go
to Google Play and then try

00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:28.840
and install that same app, it
will install instantly.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.420
It won't do the download
again.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:30.770
PAUL: OK.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.200
So it just copies
itself in the--

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.480
locally.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Locally, I don't
actually know if it's copying

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.870
itself or just setting
permissions or making it--

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.780
linking it or doing something.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.500
But it becomes--

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:39.930
PAUL: OK.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:40.360
RICH HYNDMAN: It'll
be available.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.480
The app binaries.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:41.820
Yeah.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.810
SPARKY RHODE: Hey, Rich, do you
know, what about apps that

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.720
download substantial amounts
of supplemental data?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.100
Say, like your game apps that
have 400 megs of resources?

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.010
RICH HYNDMAN: That's gonna
depend on the app itself and

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.660
how they've implemented that.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.130
So if they--

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.630
yeah.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.922
I haven't tried it.

00:13:01.922 --> 00:13:02.260
NICK BUTCHER: Hm.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.050
RICH HYNDMAN: Not quite sure.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.700
My guess is that it would have
to probably download that set

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.750
of resources again, but
I don't actually know.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.310
We'll try and dig out some
recommendations for you.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.160
PAUL: OK.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.530
RICH HYNDMAN: On the fly.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.780
YOSSI ELKRIEF: About
that issue?

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.100
RICH HYNDMAN: Sorry?

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.180
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Regarding
the storage.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.870
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm?

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.830
YOSSI ELKRIEF: If we were using
an external storage as

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.492
caching for images or so on.

00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:31.840
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.460
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Each user won't
see the folder we created for

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.594
the different users?

00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:42.730
SPARKY RHODE: I believe
that's correct.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.850
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Because basically
today we're creating

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:51.510
a folder on the SD card, get
external storage, and then

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.370
we're creating a folder
for lazy loading the

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.805
images and so on.

00:13:56.805 --> 00:13:57.230
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.550
So an example is the Gallery
and the Cameras.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.740
So if I go into one profile and
take a picture, it goes

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.350
into a slash SD card, DCIM,
whatever it is.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.170
Puts it in there.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.590
If I switch users, then I get a
completely different view of

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.990
that folder, and I can take--

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.900
I don't see the photos that
the original user took.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.860
SPARKY RHODE: Hmm.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.920
NICK BUTCHER: So each user
has a view of the

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.680
SD card, as it were.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.270
SPARKY RHODE: Is it mounting a
completely separate volume?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.410
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, this is--
all of our devices don't have

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.240
the external SD card,
of course.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.946
So that could be a different
matter of people releasing

00:14:29.946 --> 00:14:30.520
this with that.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.530
I don't know how it would
work at the moment.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.910
PAUL: Does anyone know
what security

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.350
implications this may have?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.910
Although they're in different
areas, is it completely secure

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.270
in terms of-- from one
user to another?

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.680
SPARKY RHODE: I think it's a--

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.160
Pass to Nigel at the moment,
because we haven't tested it

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.960
out on any devices that
do have SD cards.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.050
My guess is if you've actually
got an external SD card and

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.040
you're using this, then you can
still take it out and read

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.110
the space on it--

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.010
that you'd be able to see each
other's data on the SD card.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.320
But I don't actually know.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.176
There are no devices that
support that at the moment.

00:15:07.176 --> 00:15:07.642
PAUL: OK.

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:11.492
RICH HYNDMAN: For us
to try it out on.

00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:13.490
NICK BUTCHER: And what do you
mean by completely secure?

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.260
I mean, what is that?

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.150
PAUL: What I mean is, from--

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.925
I don't mean by external
SD cards.

00:15:18.925 --> 00:15:21.340
I mean from one user to
another, in terms of--

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.370
obviously, if they can't see the
data, they probably can't

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.850
read it in any other way
outside of the app.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.150
SPARKY RHODE: I believe the
intention is for the users to

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.290
be completely firewalled
from each other.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.540
PAUL: OK.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.400
SPARKY RHODE: Our sample use
case is an enterprise use

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:41.900
case, right?

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.810
Where you've got two enterprise
users sharing one

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.390
physical tablet and--

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.201
PAUL: Exactly.

00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:49.320
NICK BUTCHER: I call that sample
use case is the family.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.560
[LAUGHS].

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.460
You have a tablet--

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:50.910
RICH HYNDMAN: I agree, yeah.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.184
NICK BUTCHER: Coffee table.

00:15:53.184 --> 00:15:54.660
You don't want to hand it to
your kids when it's logged

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.120
into your Gmail and your
Twitter and everything.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.800
CHRIS BANES: But I'm sure if you
turn on the encryption--

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.690
it's gonna be turn on encrypt
storage or what

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.310
the option's called--

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.940
that at least encrypts
the SD image.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.375
I'm guessing.

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.240
I don't know.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.660
MATT GAUNT: It would
be interesting.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.070
If you were encrypting stuff on
the SD card, you'd have to

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.450
use a different key for each--

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:13.870
YOSSI ELKRIEF: User.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:14.600
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.165
MATT GAUNT: And then at that
point, it would be

00:16:16.165 --> 00:16:17.540
specific to that user.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.190
That might be quite a nice
way of doing it.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.570
SPARKY RHODE: I seem to recall
that the coffee table model

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:28.720
was explicitly not one of the
use cases that we tried to

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.070
optimize for this generation
of the feature.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.330
Because that implies things like
an administrative user,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.850
aka a parent, who is controlling
the tablet usage

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.250
experience of another
user, aka the child.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.860
And that sort of management

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.238
infrastructure is not included.

00:16:47.238 --> 00:16:48.700
NICK BUTCHER: Huh.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.700
RICH HYNDMAN: [SIGH].

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.630
Interesting.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.550
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.470
Hm.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.930
RICH HYNDMAN: [LAUGHS].

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.815
Yeah.

00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:58.234
That's certainly my use
case for it, anyway.

00:16:58.234 --> 00:16:59.110
MATT GAUNT: Hm.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.700
RICH HYNDMAN: To keep my own
profile secure, and while the

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.585
kids still get to play
their games.

00:17:01.585 --> 00:17:03.690
And it's very easy just to
switch between the profiles.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.609
Just tap on the Power button.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:06.240
And hand it over.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.706
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:17:06.706 --> 00:17:08.570
You've had a recent use case
of that haven't you?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.036
[LAUGHS].

00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:09.502
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:17:09.502 --> 00:17:12.300
I have.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.154
MATT GAUNT: So we've been joined
by some new people.

00:17:14.154 --> 00:17:16.370
RICH HYNDMAN: Let's have a look
who's in here with us.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:21.220
SPARKY RHODE: I have to say, I
was stunned the other day to

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.190
walk into the living room
and discover that the

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:28.200
three-year-old had found my
Galaxy Tab, taken it down,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.510
unlocked it, started a game, and
actually been playing the

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.790
game all without any adult
assistance whatsoever.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.850
Nobody told her how
to play this game.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.810
She just started doing it.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:38.970
PAUL: There you go.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.590
RICH HYNDMAN: Their
skills these days.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.000
MATT GAUNT: [LAUGHS].

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.273
RICH HYNDMAN: Welcome to the new
guys who have just joined

00:17:43.273 --> 00:17:43.730
us in the Hangout--

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.260
Leslie, I think it's
Christian--

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:46.500
LESLIE: Hi.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.400
RICH HYNDMAN: Nice
to see you guys.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.940
Do any of you have any
questions for us?

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.320
LESLIE: Yeah.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.790
Do you guys know how to take
a snapshot in code?

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.670
I found this screen shot code.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.390
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.870
LESLIE: I actually want to do it
and send the image across a

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.120
connection.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.610
MATT GAUNT: So, do you mean take
a screen shot from code,

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.680
is that basically it?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.100
LESLIE: Yes.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.666
MATT GAUNT: Of the whole
device, or just do

00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:08.760
it within your app?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.990
LESLIE: The whole device,
the whole screen.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.570
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, no.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:11.765
That's not possible.

00:18:11.765 --> 00:18:14.180
That would be a security hazard
if you had a service

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.600
running in the background
that could take screen

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.110
shots of the device.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.704
You can take screen shots
of your application.

00:18:18.704 --> 00:18:21.430
LESLIE: Yeah.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.730
RICH HYNDMAN: Anything
else isn't available

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.072
to the average product.

00:18:25.072 --> 00:18:25.480
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, right.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.326
RICH HYNDMAN: It's all
in a secure product.

00:18:26.326 --> 00:18:27.158
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHS].

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.320
LESLIE: OK.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.160
RICH HYNDMAN: There's nothing.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.490
CHRIS BANES: DDMS isn't?

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:30.820
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:33.070
LESLIE: Yeah.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.540
I found the DDMS solution,
but it's quite untidy.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:36.885
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:18:36.885 --> 00:18:38.975
LESLIE: And we want to put this
on thousands of devices,

00:18:38.975 --> 00:18:41.006
so we kept [INAUDIBLE]
want to do that.

00:18:41.006 --> 00:18:41.440
Mm-hmm.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:41.610
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.290
MATT GAUNT: Is this purely
for testing?

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.710
LESLIE: It's more for
road support.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.055
MALE SPEAKER: Shall I go?

00:18:46.055 --> 00:18:48.520
LESLIE: It's a matter of showing
us what the user has

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:48.940
on the other side.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.246
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:49.246 --> 00:18:49.847
It's a dog show.

00:18:49.847 --> 00:18:51.340
Yeah, I think it will be fine.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:51.940
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.700
You'd either have to guide them
through taking the screen

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.390

he will not go.

LESLIE: OK.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.250
Well, I tossed.

LESLIE: Ah, no.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.355
We're putting it on Samsung
devices now, so we can't get

00:19:05.355 --> 00:19:06.670
the app signed.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.981
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:08.420
Fair enough.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.370
No, in which case I don't
know of a way.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.950
Samsung do have a Screen Shot
button of their own, so maybe

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.684
if you're talking to them, you
can ask them about that.

00:19:14.684 --> 00:19:15.131
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
that's actually--

00:19:15.131 --> 00:19:18.002
RICH HYNDMAN: And if they have
any APIs for it for apps that

00:19:18.002 --> 00:19:19.290
they're assigned, you shouldn't
have problems.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:19.690
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.460

00:19:22.146 --> 00:19:22.550
LESLIE: Yeah.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.760
The signature's not a
problem with you.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.250
We can get that done.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:24.595
MALE SPEAKER: Traditional
what?

00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:25.100
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.750
LESLIE: They used, I think,
called [? Sortie, ?]

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.850
and it's all built
into their API.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.900
And we don't especially want
to use [? Sortie, ?] but it

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.155
costs a fortune.

00:19:34.155 --> 00:19:34.650
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.400
He's heard of that.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.140

what our teachers--

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.250
RICH HYNDMAN: But
we're back now.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.580
OK?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.710
Cheers, Leslie for
that question.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:39.290
LESLIE: Yep.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.970
RICH HYNDMAN: Do you
have any others?

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.915

else who has joined us

got a question?

from--?

with her hand up.

Hey.

can just speak.

have been watching on quite or

see your name on the screen.

RICH HYNDMAN: Thanks
for joining.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.720
And what's your question?

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.690
MAXIM: So I had an application
on the Market which uses phone

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.580
states and then-- well,
obviously I have--

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.980
it won't set permission.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.670
And I'm importing the
new updates--

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.250
just yesterday.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.100
Tried to upload the new update
and somehow Market tells me

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.900
that it's now targeting less
devices than it's used to.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.380
And apparently it's because
it has edits and

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.430
new permissions there.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.280
Well, it's not [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.400
manifest, but the Market
shows that I have--

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.070
it's called low permission.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.670
And it's saying it's got
a severe situation.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.270
In fact, I don't want to--

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.260
NICK BUTCHER: So you're sure--
you're definitely asking for

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.044
any new permissions
in the new APK?

00:21:15.044 --> 00:21:16.480
MAXIM: I'm not asking
for a permission

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.970
which has been added.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.150
It seems that it has
been added somehow.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.720
NICK BUTCHER: So the source
of truth there is to do--

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.435
use aapt.

00:21:23.435 --> 00:21:26.262
So if you do aapt
dump badging--

00:21:26.262 --> 00:21:27.026
MAXIM: Mm-hmm.

00:21:27.026 --> 00:21:29.710
NICK BUTCHER: And then, in
the path to your APK,

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.450
that will tell you--

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.610
that will export all
the permissions.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.870
Because that will show you even
the implied permissions,

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.285
like some permissions are
implied by others.

00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:40.255
So it will explicitly list out
all the permissions you are

00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:40.980
asking for.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.320
So that's the source of truth.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.170
So if you can do that, and if
it doesn't match up to what

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.170
you're seeing when you upload
it to the Play Store, then

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.220
that sounds like a bug.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.665
So let us know if that
doesn't match up.

00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:53.660
MAXIM: I see.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.320
I see.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.440
OK, I will try it using that.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.550
So actually the secret--

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:02.610
if I understand correctly, the
situation is that some of the

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.440
libraries that I may be using
may be requesting for that

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.040
permission.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.580
Is that correct?

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.830
NICK BUTCHER: It could
well be, yeah.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.070
Well, that would have to be
in your manifest, right?

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.365
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:12.150
NICK BUTCHER: They can't
just imply them.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:12.700
MAXIM: Oh no.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.800
It was not under the
installation to me, because I

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.020
don't see it anywhere,
and it's there.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:18.370
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:18.720
MAXIM: Oh.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.650
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.600
Check your manifest and use

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.400
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.840
NICK BUTCHER: Is the way to
get to the bottom of this.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.020
MAXIM: All right.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.100
Thanks.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.500
No, thanks for the
question again.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.750

NICK BUTCHER: Lucas--

00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:28.100
I guess it's Lucas Rutger-- asks
a question about themes,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.490
and that certain OEMs have
changed the default themes

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.640
that apps ship with.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.880

the Options menu is black

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.860

So, yeah, this is problematic.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.820
And I guess this is why we
introduced Holo styles which

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.970
OEMs can't modify, so that you
can extend those styles and

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.100
know what you're gonna get.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.870
The best advice is
really to use the

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.090
built-in Styles and Themes.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.330
So you can use the
things like--

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.200
the text styles like inverse
and color primary--

00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.790
color inverse--

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.832
I think that's who it is?

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:01.230
CHRIS BANES: That's correct.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.000
NICK BUTCHER: Styles
that you can use.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.580
So, using those styles,
hopefully if they've modified

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.840
one of the values, they should
have modified the other value,

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.381
is really the best you can do
in those circumstances.

stay with that if you're

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.435

builder only does one set,

about doing two panes, where

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.570
the right pane needs to have
tabs in it, like the one in

00:26:45.815 --> 00:26:46.600
RICH HYNDMAN: So, Chris?

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:46.820
You want to--

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.690
CHRIS BANES: I actually
went for this pane

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:48.370
every day when I was--

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.130
I've done enough of mine.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.620
I decided not to go with
tabs, and I went

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.580
with dialogs instead.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.560
So we set it on the
right pane.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.480
I'd just open a dialog.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.290
The other way to do it is
via a library called

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.360
ViewPageIndicator.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.090
So I'm guessing that the right
pane is in a ViewPager.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.150
So you can use the Indicator
to actually

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.100
show where you are.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.240
It's not quite Tab, but
it's near enough that

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:10.890
you could use it.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.650
So you replicate the Tab
function in the right pane.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.412
And that's the way I'd
probably go with it.

00:27:17.412 --> 00:27:19.694
RICH HYNDMAN: Sounds good.

00:27:19.694 --> 00:27:22.955
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, I think
that's a good answer.

00:27:22.955 --> 00:27:25.825
If I was doing it myself, I
would probably cop out and

00:27:25.825 --> 00:27:26.310
just use a ListView.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.115

00:27:28.115 --> 00:27:29.770

tabs in the Action bar,

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.220
way to find the country.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.400
I think your best bet is
probably to create a locale of

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.900
the device.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.810
SPARKY RHODE: Right.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.390
And that's a user setting, not

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.900
necessarily a physical presence.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.270
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, but you
can check the IP address.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.510
RICH HYNDMAN: You could
do a Google--

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.700
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Know it's
your IP or something.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.300
RICH HYNDMAN: Who knows
where that runs?

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.570
NICK BUTCHER: No, well,
actually where the

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.880
device is, not the--

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.790
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.990
The Google Play Store knows
where you are, but that's all

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.050
server-side detection.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.400
That's not your device.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.760
RICH HYNDMAN: You could check
the SIM country as well.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.060
NICK BUTCHER: So my advice
would be not

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.520
to do any of this.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.440
It would be to respect the
locale of the user's cell--

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.530
the device.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.080
Because the user has control
over these things.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.460
Like currencies, how
they're displayed,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.330
dates, how they're displayed.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:21.640
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh--

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.470
NICK BUTCHER: If you try and get
a bit too clever, then it

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.310
can be annoying.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.140
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, but they're
probably trying to

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.890
implement our recommendation of
putting the cost of their

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.340
inner items into their
application.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:32.740
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah--

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.420
RICH HYNDMAN: Maybe
it's just--

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.065
SPARKY RHODE: The Location
Manager's your best bet.

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:35.720
RICH HYNDMAN: That would be--

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.430
NICK BUTCHER: Just respect
his locale, then.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.695
RICH HYNDMAN: Like--

00:29:37.695 --> 00:29:37.960
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.640
RICH HYNDMAN: Google respect--

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.260
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Basically, the
locale is the best option.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.290
MATT GAUNT: I was over
in Mountain View--

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.270
RICH HYNDMAN: No, no.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.155
The locale is you-- if you've
got yours set to UK--

00:29:46.155 --> 00:29:46.580
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.760
SPARKY RHODE: I think the best
bet for home country is just

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.710
to create a locale.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.080
RICH HYNDMAN: So how
did you find out?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.450
MATT GAUNT: Where--

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.923
RICH HYNDMAN: Where the Play
Store's gonna return.

00:29:53.923 --> 00:29:54.394
MATT GAUNT: Oh.

00:29:54.394 --> 00:29:55.340
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.116
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:29:57.116 --> 00:29:58.095
RICH HYNDMAN: Or maybe
that's not the case

00:29:58.095 --> 00:29:59.925
they're asking about.

00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:00.795
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:30:00.795 --> 00:30:01.670
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.670
My suggestion would be to
stick with the locale.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.890
And then, if that's not their
actual home place, as in,

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.170
let's say they are
from Germany, but

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.510
they switch to English--

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.950
British for some reason--

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.120
that's what they're more
comfortable with--

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.210
then give them the option
to change it

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.270
within Settings somewhere.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:16.660
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.730
MATT GAUNT: So it will
essentially override it.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.600
Just use it as a default,
essentially.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.850
NICK BUTCHER: (WHISPERING)
Just make it a Setting?

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.280
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, that
they need to choose.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.630
MATT GAUNT: Just try and be
clever once, and then after

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:27.880
that, let the user change it.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.450
YOSSI ELKRIEF: [LAUGHS].

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.220
RICH HYNDMAN: Try and
be clever, and

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.236
when you get it wrong--

00:30:31.236 --> 00:30:31.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:32.660
MATT GAUNT: Let the
user take over.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.520
RICH HYNDMAN: Let them
override it.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:33.663
Yeah.

00:30:33.663 --> 00:30:34.380
That could work.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.220
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, but
basically the Play Store holds

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.470
and checks the locale and
also checks the IP.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.270
No?

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.080
From where the device
is checking the--

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.384
MATT GAUNT: The Play Store
does all sorts of stuff.

00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:45.510
RICH HYNDMAN: The Play Store
does get quite a

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.900
few different checks.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.290
CHRIS BANES: Right.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.900
SPARKY RHODE: I mean, there's
a couple of models.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.330
Like, if you're offering--

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.200
like they said--

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.220
recommendations, restaurants,
shopping, something like that,

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.990
then use the Location Manager.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.860
If you're offering content
that's kind of spaceless,

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.900
like, say, you want to watch a
video and you want to know

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.960
what language to play
the soundtrack in,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.210
then use the locale.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.580
MATT GAUNT: See, the weird thing
that I've found since

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.420
talking to people in different
countries, is that, quite

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:20.360
often, they don't necessarily
want to consume content in

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.290
their native tongue.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.680
They quite often don't want
the dubbed version.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.830
Just a brief side point.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:25.600
Anyway.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:25.900
So, yeah.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.630
[LAUGHS].

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.620
SPARKY RHODE: I've talked
about people about that.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.190
Because Germany is a
country that's big

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:36.950
enough where Western--

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.140
the entertainment content is
almost always dubbed into the

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.540
local language.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:45.140
And the consensus that I've
found among the people that

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.020
I've talked to here is that,
in fact, while there is a

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.700
small cadre of people who always
prefer it in original

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.150
version, overwhelmingly, most
consumers do want it dubbed

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.296
into their language.

00:31:58.296 --> 00:31:58.710
NICK BUTCHER: Hmm.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.440
SPARKY RHODE: Or at
least, that's the

00:31:59.440 --> 00:31:59.860
case here in Germany.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.140
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think
we probably deal

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.280
with a selection bias.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.480
And people we're talking to
probably speak English.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.810
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, true.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.260
True.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.990
NICK BUTCHER: Next question on
the Moderator asks "if there's

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.460
any general tips for finding
and resolving an annoying,

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.310
unknown source of battery
drain." So, I'm gonna guess

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.570
it's a developer question like
you've got a drain in your

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.055
app, not just generally my
device is running low on

00:32:21.055 --> 00:32:23.710
battery, or anything
like that.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:24.210
SPARKY RHODE: Right.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.920
I would say, look at Trevor's
talk from Google I/O, where

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.660
he's giving the run-down
on the--

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.310
was it TraceView?

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.520
Is that what it's called?

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.712
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, if you'd--

00:32:35.712 --> 00:32:36.960
find out.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.430
NICK BUTCHER: So my general
advice is a couple of vendor

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.250
tools out there from some of the
Silicon vendors that will

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.930
help you do this.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.680
So I think ARM has a tool which
will help you track the

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.850
power usage and so on, depending
on which chips that

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.120
your device is running.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.900
But generally my advice on
these issues is, you're

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.520
running on power if you're
powering something up.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.480
So if you're keeping the screen
on, if you're holding a

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.480
wait clock, or if you're
doing network,

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.280
essentially, are the biggies.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.730
So make sure you understand
your usage of those,

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.240
especially the wait clock.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.720
Probably the wait clock--

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.030
CHRIS BANES: Location is on.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:03.430
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.750
RICH HYNDMAN: There was a
presentation down at Droidcon

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.430
UK on Dr Power.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.173
It's one of the apps in the
Play Store that can

00:33:09.173 --> 00:33:09.750
help you with this.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.260
And it does something similar
to the battery stats, but it

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.240
does break it down in
a lot more detail.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.490
So I was just looking
at that now.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:17.890
SPARKY RHODE: Right.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:22.960
There's some good sort of best
practices, like don't use--

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.460
say, if you're doing networking,
don't do polling

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.050
if you don't have to.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.840
If your data is coming at sort
of unpredictable times, then

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.535
have a server-side component
that can send you a Google

00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:39.490
Cloud message
quasi-asynchronously.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.960
Or, if you are going
to do polling,

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.120
don't use exact alarms.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.320
Use something like inexact
repeating alarms that will

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.730
sort of converge your
wake-up times onto a

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.520
few selected intervals.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.120
And then all of your apps,
who are all using inexact

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.050
repeating alarms together, can
all be woken up at the same

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.950
time, do the network, and
shut back down again.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:00.225
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:34:00.225 --> 00:34:02.450
A lot of this boils down to
don't do any work you don't

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.950
have to do as well.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.320
So things like listening to the
state of the battery and

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.560
the network and adjusting your
behavior accordingly.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.770
So if the user's battery is
under 20%, then maybe you back

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.620
off the polling behavior, and
don't call so aggressively.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.000
Or maybe you shut down
a certain receiver if

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.179
you don't need it.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.600
It's just do as little
work as possible.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.510
So one of the things I quite
often see is people will use

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:29.046
the boot completed listener to
schedule any alarms that they

00:34:29.046 --> 00:34:30.590
might need to reset,
like, say, for

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.830
some polling behavior.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.290
Put a [INAUDIBLE] the boot
receiver is checked wherever

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:34.969
something should happen.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.139
And if not, just return.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:39.350
Whereas you're much better off
actually just using the Patch

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.500
Manager to disable your boot
receiver if it's not going to

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.770
do anything when you boot,
rather than causing an extra

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.140
piece of work to be done at
quite a strenuous time when

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.780
the system's still starting
up and there's loads and

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.810
stuff's going on.

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:52.810
So it's just like part of being
a good citizen, really.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.800
Just don't do any work
you don't have to do.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.700
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.902
Any more questions from
inside the Hangout?

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.882
MATT GAUNT: Jeff Gosling would
like to be added to the

00:35:06.882 --> 00:35:08.760
Hangout, and he has
a question.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.100
RICH HYNDMAN: Ooh.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.020
OK.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.030
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.070
He's not gonna get
in, [LAUGHS]

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.380
but I will add him in anyway,
and hopefully--

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.150
NICK BUTCHER: We've got some new
live participants as well.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.950
Any questions from people
in the Hangout?

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:23.640
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey--

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.360
NICK BUTCHER: Giuseppe.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:24.920
RICH HYNDMAN: Giuseppe from--

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.740
NICK BUTCHER: I recognize
Giuseppe's art.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.970
RICH HYNDMAN: [FINGER SNAP]

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:27.730
--Voice Pro last week.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:28.470
NICK BUTCHER: Aye then.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.075
RICH HYNDMAN: Yep.

00:35:30.075 --> 00:35:31.640
NICK BUTCHER: Hey, Giuseppe,
any questions?

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.086
Or are you just hanging out?

00:35:34.086 --> 00:35:36.011
Oh, we can't hear you,
I think you're muted.

00:35:36.011 --> 00:35:37.815
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:37.815 --> 00:35:38.270
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.070
If you're in a position where
you can't or don't want to

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.890
talk, then feel free to
type your questions

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.140
into the Chat window.

00:35:48.303 --> 00:35:51.360
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, we do
have some questions.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.800
CHRIS BANES: That's
not questions.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.200
SPARKY RHODE: Oh.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.660
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE] asks,
is the home country--

00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.620
CHRIS BANES: Sorry I took
my [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.160
SPARKY RHODE: Question
incoming from--

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.140
how do we say this name?

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.390
Marijn?

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.830
Is that your name?

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:04.530
RICH HYNDMAN: Marjin, maybe?

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:05.835
I don't know.

00:36:05.835 --> 00:36:06.340
CHRIS BANES: Marian?

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.240
SPARKY RHODE: I-J-N.
That's Dutch.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.390
Looks like Mahr-ein.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.040
RICH HYNDMAN: Please,
I am trying to--

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.514
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Mahr-een?

00:36:11.514 --> 00:36:12.462
RICH HYNDMAN: --clarify
my problem.

00:36:12.462 --> 00:36:12.936
It'll work.

00:36:12.936 --> 00:36:16.260
We can guess his name later.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.618
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Mahrleen.

00:36:18.618 --> 00:36:20.610
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.586
SPARKY RHODE: [LAUGHS].

00:36:21.586 --> 00:36:23.964
MATT GAUNT: So, no questions
from Google+.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.890
[INDISTINCT MALE VOICE]

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.140
MATT GAUNT: No?

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.450
SPARKY RHODE: It is a slow
Wednesday afternoon.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.641
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:42.833
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK, I'll ask
a question, if you want.

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:45.000
MALE SPEAKER: Go on, Yossi.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.810
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Basically, when
you do a search on the Play

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.430
Store for a specific developer,
you can see all the

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.070
apps [ECHO]

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:53.982
the developer [ECHO]

00:36:53.982 --> 00:36:55.232
on Play Store.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.470
Is it a good convention to
show a WebView on my app

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.980
showing all the apps I have
on the Play Store?

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.750
Maybe like a cover flow or
something like that?

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.050
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:13.230
No, I don't see any
reason why not.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.510
Quite often people will just
link out to their Publisher

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.540
page on Play Store.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.240
But if you wanted to have more
control over the presentation,

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.850
then that's not a
bad thing to do.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:24.240
I'd just say, do it courteously
to your users.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.270
Like maybe put it under--

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.353
if you have an About screen,
perhaps you can have a "Get

00:37:28.353 --> 00:37:30.895
More Apps From Us" or
something like that?

00:37:30.895 --> 00:37:31.330
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.700
I personally just, yeah, from
the Settings menu, from the

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.477
Overflow menu I have in my Apps
button, take you straight

00:37:36.477 --> 00:37:37.625
into the Play Store.

00:37:37.625 --> 00:37:41.630
But if you want to put the
effort into designing a--

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.880
I guess it's one extra level.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.460
SPARKY RHODE: There's one
publisher I'm thinking of who

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.500
seems to like to put up a splash
screen where they show

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.000
you several ads of other titles
of their apps, and

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.030
then, off to the side, a button
that says, "Click here

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.670
to play the game that you've
just launched."

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.870
MATT GAUNT: That sounds handy.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.910
SPARKY RHODE: That kind of--

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:01.500
I don't know.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.770
It bugs me a little bit.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:08.640
Like, I at least want the title
that I selected to be

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.270
very prominently displayed.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.350
And it would be nice if I didn't
have to have one extra

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.980
click to confirm the title that
I just selected amongst.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.910
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
that sounds overly

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:18.470
aggressive to me.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.980
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:23.840
Basically what I wanted was
to show a selector on the

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.810
Settings or something, and show
a My Apps option, and

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:35.230
then show all the related
apps to that developer.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.520
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.560
I mean, if you want it as like
an About Us, and had a nice

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.926
marquee with all of your apps
on About Us, I think that

00:38:41.926 --> 00:38:43.336
would be a great way to go.

00:38:43.336 --> 00:38:45.240
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.200
NICK BUTCHER: I think
someone like LevelUp

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:47.480
do this, don't they?

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.504
And Beautiful Widgets.

00:38:48.504 --> 00:38:51.198
I think they do a quite
decent job of that.

00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:52.970
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Oh,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:55.020
RICH HYNDMAN: So, Marjin's
come back again, and he's

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.880
drawn us a picture of
the layout that he

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.970
was trying to build.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.190
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, this
is the tabs in--

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.920
RICH HYNDMAN: This was
the tabs layout

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:01.970
in multi-pane, yeah.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:02.305
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:39:02.305 --> 00:39:03.190
RICH HYNDMAN: That
you just saw.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.710
I'll just show the picture
to people inside.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.450
So we've got a ListView
on the left-hand side.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.260
On the right-hand side, there's
a Fragment with a

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.395
ListView inside it, and some
tabs across the top, which is,

00:39:13.395 --> 00:39:15.100
I think, what we were
expecting to see.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.090
NICK BUTCHER: Mm-hmm.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.990
RICH HYNDMAN: And he has
commented to say--

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.740
would you mind, Chris?

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:22.960
I'm getting a bit old for this.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.210
CHRIS BANES: "Made a quick
drawing of my question.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.250
I had the question about
multi-pane view

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.270
and tabs that link.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:31.310
I'm using Fragments.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.210
I need tabs in with detail
Fragments, just like the Play

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.500
Store, but it doesn't show."

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:36.910
NICK BUTCHER: Oh.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.472
So his question is, Fragments
within Fragments.

00:39:39.472 --> 00:39:40.440
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:40.956
RICH HYNDMAN: All right.

00:39:40.956 --> 00:39:42.294
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:39:42.294 --> 00:39:43.190
RICH HYNDMAN: Um--

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:45.400
CHRIS BANES: "Or I cannot edit
the title of the tabs or read

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.020
the IDs."

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.270
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.950
MATT GAUNT: Could you use
ViewPager with just views?

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.420
Don't you do something on
that in your blog posts?

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.210
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes, certainly you
can have ViewPagers with

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.570
ListViews inside them without
having Fragments.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.200
And then the second Fragment
would have tabs at the top,

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.330
which page between a--

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:05.550
NICK BUTCHER: Not just ListView,
but he adds views.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.660
RICH HYNDMAN: I was gonna
say with ViewPager.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.661
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so he
thinks you can use views

00:40:08.661 --> 00:40:09.255
rather than Fragments.

00:40:09.255 --> 00:40:09.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.590
MATT GAUNT: So would
that work?

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.550
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, it would
work if it was simple enough.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.060
CHRIS BANES: And why
do the tabs need

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.075
to be in the Fragment?

00:40:14.075 --> 00:40:15.286
I would question that.

00:40:15.286 --> 00:40:16.180
Why can't it be--

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.170
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that's
what I'm saying, yeah.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.620
CHRIS BANES: Why can't it just
be in the activity map?

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.250
MATT GAUNT: Because
then it would

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.010
cover the entire surface.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.842
So you'd have the
Fragment that--

00:40:24.842 --> 00:40:25.190
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.450
You want to see them only on
the right pane and not all

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.330
over the screen.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:29.830
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, but
you can do that

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.930
with includes anyway.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:31.260
Like--

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.320
I don't think it's--

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.070
any reason it has to
be a Fragment.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:34.570
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.875
You could fight the tabs
by copying the last--

00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:38.580
RICH HYNDMAN: So what
you're saying--

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.680
CHRIS BANES: ActionBarSherlock
call.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:39.980
RICH HYNDMAN: So instead
of having--

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.940
NICK BUTCHER: So the left thing
would be a Fragment.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.830
RICH HYNDMAN: Left the ListView
would be a Fragment--

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:43.273
sorry, the--

00:40:43.273 --> 00:40:44.370
NICK BUTCHER: Left pane
would be a Fragment.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:44.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Yep.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.540
NICK BUTCHER: And it's just
a view holding the--

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.280
CHRIS BANES: The
linear layout.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.310
Top would be your tabs--

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:50.610
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:51.880
CHRIS BANES: And under that,
with a layout weight of one,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.810
would be your Fragment.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:53.400
RICH HYNDMAN: Fragment
on this side--

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.380
NICK BUTCHER: And a View Pager
which holds [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.460
RICH HYNDMAN: Linear layout
on this side.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:56.890
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.570
Then tabs in the
linear layout--

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.760
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:59.760 --> 00:40:59.960
RICH HYNDMAN: So--

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.680
CHRIS BANES: ViewPager all.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.970
RICH HYNDMAN: ViewPager that.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.810
MARIJN: So my mike is working
again, thankfully.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.510
RICH HYNDMAN: Yay!

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:11.090
MARIJN: So what I meant was, is
that on the left side eye

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:17.772
of this menu which displays
a couple of data types.

00:41:17.772 --> 00:41:18.230
RICH HYNDMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.520
MARIJN: And on the
right side you

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.795
have a couple of ListViews.

00:41:20.795 --> 00:41:24.800
In this particular case,
I have three ListViews.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.224
And because I need
to target both--

00:41:28.224 --> 00:41:28.718
oh.

00:41:28.718 --> 00:41:29.706
There you are.

00:41:29.706 --> 00:41:30.200
[LAUGHS].

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.200
Because I need to target both
mobile phones and tablets--

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.400
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.290
MARIJN: It wasn't natural enough
to put those ListViews

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.740
just on top of each other.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:47.470
So I was looking for a tabbed
solution with a tab top--

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:50.605
Tab bar in the top.

00:41:50.605 --> 00:41:51.020
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.330
MARIJN: But somehow
the TabHost isn't

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:58.102
showing in my app, so--

00:41:58.102 --> 00:41:58.540
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.220
Don't use TabHost.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.290
MARIJN: "Don't use TabHost."
And what's the alternative?

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.810
NICK BUTCHER: So that's been
deprecated now to use the

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:07.485
Action bar star tabs.

00:42:07.485 --> 00:42:08.410
So, yeah.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:10.916
Using Action bar or
ActionBarSherlock.

00:42:10.916 --> 00:42:15.450
MARIJN: But isn't the Action
bar just used for--

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:15.910
NICK BUTCHER: So,
yeah, it has--

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.030
MARIJN: The apps?

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.735
NICK BUTCHER: --its own cache
system, but it won't-- it'll

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:21.440
do tabs in the Action bar on
tablets rather than in line.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.520
So basically you can use
a thing called the

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:29.630
PagerStripTitle, which is in
the compatibility library.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.240
See, because that would get
it within your key pager.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.040
MARIJN: Could you tag that
in PageViewTitle?

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.110
Or--

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:36.520
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.560
If you use Eclipse templates,
if you just generate a new

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.240
project, and generate one with
swipeable tabs, it'll generate

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:44.950
all the code you need.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.305
And that's the best way
to kind of, like, look

00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:48.320
at how to do it.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:48.790
MARIJN: OK.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:52.332
So the layout's covered for
the swipeable tabs?

00:42:52.332 --> 00:42:57.570
I could just copy and paste, in
this case, to the friends?

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.295
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, it will show
you how to do it, yeah.

00:42:59.295 --> 00:43:01.200
You just [INAUDIBLE]
your own adapter.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.390
MARIJN: Thanks very much.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.228
NICK BUTCHER: Welcome.

00:43:05.228 --> 00:43:06.180
OK.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.620
RICH HYNDMAN: [SIGHS].

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:07.900
KRISTAN UCCELLO: All right.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.510
I got a question for you guys.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:10.860
NICK BUTCHER: Hey.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.495
KRISTAN UCELLO: Hey.

00:43:11.495 --> 00:43:12.650
MATT GAUNT: Hey.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:13.300
KRISTAN UCELLO: How's
it going?

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:13.762
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, right.

00:43:13.762 --> 00:43:14.686
I was gonna say.

00:43:14.686 --> 00:43:15.148
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:15.148 --> 00:43:17.200
KRISTAN UCELLO: Yeah, you guys
should recognize me, maybe.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.140
At least Matt does.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.510
SPARKY RHODE: Oh.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.770
I'm loving the hat.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:20.540
KRISTAN UCELLO: Ah.

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:24.400
Well, we got DevRel booth
stuff going on

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.320
in Charlie's today.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.530
So--

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.100
but I do have an Android
question.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.920
I'm building an app, and I'm
trying to use a service to

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.620
collect JSON data from a web
service, mung that data, stick

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.310
it into a database, and then
make that data available via a

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:45.230
content provider to my
main activities.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:49.140
What I've noticed is, I'm able
to fetch the data without

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.890
issue, I'm able to parse
it, standard JSON,

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.720
dump it in the database.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.720
The moment I try and access
the data from the content

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.290
provider later-- and I'm using
the content provider from the

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.020
service as well to
inject the data.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.530
When I try and use the content
provider from the activity, I

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.640
get nothing back from
my cursors.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.480
They're always empty.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:10.965
SPARKY RHODE: Hmm.

00:44:10.965 --> 00:44:12.000
That doesn't sound right.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:12.468
NICK BUTCHER: Sounds like--

00:44:12.468 --> 00:44:13.404
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:13.404 --> 00:44:16.820
NICK BUTCHER: Sounds like a
problem with your projection.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.790
KRISTAN UCELLO: I thought
that at first.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.350
But these are very,
very simple.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.170
Like, I'm basically doing
it on one key.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.850
It's like, I have a YouTube ID,
and it's just like, give

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.680
me the first result that
matches this ID.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.030
And I'll move the--

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.490
RICH HYNDMAN: Have you tried--

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.940
SPARKY RHODE: Maybe you're--
like, if you're not calling

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.370
swapCursor in your
onLoadComplete, or something

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.420
simple like that.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.250
KRISTAN UCELLO: SwapCursor.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.390
I don't know about that one.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:41.816
Explain a little bit more?

00:44:41.816 --> 00:44:42.302
SPARKY RHODE: Um--

00:44:42.302 --> 00:44:44.830
NICK BUTCHER: Are you
using loaders?

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.530
KRISTAN UCELLO: Sorry?

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:48.142
NICK BUTCHER: Are you
using loaders?

00:44:48.142 --> 00:44:49.810
KRISTAN UCELLO: I don't
think so [LAUGHS].

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.592
CHRIS BANES: No, that--

00:44:51.592 --> 00:44:54.820
NICK BUTCHER: So you're just
doing a ContentResolver.query?

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.820
KRISTAN UCELLO: Yeah.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.830
CHRIS BANES: Have you checked
that the data is actually

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:58.450
hitting the database?

00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:59.170
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that would
be my next question.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.406
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah,
can the service--

00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:00.860
KRISTAN UCELLO: Yeah.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.260
The data is in the database.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:07.030
What I did was, I pulled the
MySQL data right from the

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.660
device onto my system
and checked it out.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.120
And it's all there.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.630
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.630
RICH HYNDMAN: Can the service
read it back out of the

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.540
content provider again after
it's written it in?

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.280
KRISTAN UCELLO: No.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:16.650
That's--

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.020
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.830
So it's--

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.120
KRISTAN UCELLO: That's
the weird part.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.810
Once it goes in, it doesn't
want to come out.

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:25.460
But when I try and do inserts of
the same data again, I get

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.800
database exceptions
stating that the--

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.900
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, definitely
servers.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.850
RICH HYNDMAN: Probably dodgy
on the reading of

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.220
the data back out.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.530
If the data's in there, and the
content provider's just

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.880
saying there isn't any.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.160
Maybe just mail through
the [LAUGHS]

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.510
comment?

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.200
KRISTAN UCELLO: All right.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.180
I'll send it to Matt today.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.300
And you guys maybe
can take a look.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.820
Because I've been stuck on it
for a day or two, and I've got

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.050
to get past this.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:50.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.000
RICH HYNDMAN: Right.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.390
NICK BUTCHER: Sounds like
your projection to me.

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.920
Have you got--

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.170
KRISTAN UCELLO: OK.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.380
NICK BUTCHER: --an ID column,
like an underscore ID column?

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.690
KRISTAN UCELLO: What did I do?

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.940
I don't think I did.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.950
Maybe that is the problem.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:03.950
Although I thought--

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:04.270
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:05.280
KRISTAN UCELLO: I thought there
was an implied one.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.930
SPARKY RHODE: Hold on, base-- is
it implements BaseColumns?

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.180
Or is it extends BaseColumns?

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.580
Do you remember, Nick?

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.720
CHRIS BANES: Implements.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.160
SPARKY RHODE: Implements
BaseColumns.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.350
CHRIS BANES: I think the
variable is on there.

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:16.480
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:16.690
NICK BUTCHER: I don't
remember.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.796
I always use copy IE shared
and extend it.

00:46:18.796 --> 00:46:20.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:23.390
KRISTAN UCELLO: The only problem
with that is the YT

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.770
Player has stopped working.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:27.656
MATT GAUNT: Oh, yeah.

00:46:27.656 --> 00:46:30.363
That's because the certificates
probably expired

00:46:30.363 --> 00:46:31.086
for the API.

00:46:31.086 --> 00:46:31.446
KRISTAN UCELLO: Yeah.

00:46:31.446 --> 00:46:33.020
Yeah.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:33.720
SPARKY RHODE: Oh, right.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.390
Every year we have to regenerate
our developer

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.910
certificates, don't we?

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.295
KRISTAN UCELLO: This is the
YouTube player API.

00:46:41.295 --> 00:46:44.240
It's set to expire every two
weeks after release, because

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.860
it's not launched yet, so--

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh god, yeah.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:47.440
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.560
At the moment, the API is
changing slightly, because

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.430
we're doing [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.890
getting feedback.

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.350
So the YouTube team are spending
a lot of time kind of

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:55.880
tweaking it, but
they're also--

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.515
it's kind of a fail-safe way,
and a really awful way of

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.280
being sure no one publishes
it to the Play Store.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:00.687
Because then it--

00:47:00.687 --> 00:47:01.094
KRISTAN UCELLO: [LAUGHS].

00:47:01.094 --> 00:47:02.220
MATT GAUNT: --it's live,
and then they change

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.260
it, it starts breaking.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:03.830
So--

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:04.220
KRISTAN UCELLO: Yeah.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:04.571
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:07.020
I think it's just their way
of just making sure that

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.392
everything is kind
of gonna tick

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.307
along without any problems.

00:47:10.307 --> 00:47:11.740
RICH HYNDMAN: It's been
a while now [LAUGHS].

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.560
MATT GAUNT: It's coming.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.610
Like, I think they are literally
trying to get to

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.050
that last final step.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.410
It's coming.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.534
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:47:18.534 --> 00:47:19.360
NICK BUTCHER: Like Google
Play Store.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.420
KRISTAN UCELLO: Thanks, guys.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:20.650
All right.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.030
RICH HYNDMAN: Google
Play Store.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.410
It's coming.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.490
KRISTAN UCELLO: I've got to
go catch my bus, so--

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.260
RICH HYNDMAN: All
right, Crispy.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:24.470
Cheers.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:26.180
KRISTAN UCELLO: I will
see you guys later.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:26.570
Ciao.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:27.242
RICH HYNDMAN: Get out of here.

00:47:27.242 --> 00:47:27.580
NICK BUTCHER: No worries.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.830
RICH HYNDMAN: Great.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.450
[SIGHS].

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:33.075
MAXIM: Hey, guys?

00:47:33.075 --> 00:47:33.950
MATT GAUNT: Hi.

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:34.420
RICH HYNDMAN: Hey.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.795
MAXIM: It's just me again.

00:47:35.795 --> 00:47:36.170
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:41.010
MAXIM: So have you checked
the APQ, the APG 2.1?

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.512
Well, it returns the list of
permission that I would expect

00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:44.680
it to return.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.210
It returns all the permissions
defined in the manifest, and

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:51.380
the Market still shows
different lists.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.870
And I'm sure it's a safe file.

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:55.280
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.334
Can you host the APK somewhere,
like put it on

00:47:57.334 --> 00:47:58.300
Drive and send us
a link to it?

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.740
And we can take a look.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:47:59.870
MAXIM: Yeah, definitely.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:00.430
Definitely.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.510
So what should I use to--

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.800
oh.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.580
There's a Chat I use.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.590
Should use a Chat to
send it to you.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.330
NICK BUTCHER: Can you put it
in a comment to the Hangout

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:10.880
announcement on G+, not in the
Chat comments, because they

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.920
all go away.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.020
RICH HYNDMAN: If you don't
mind distributing

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:13.580
your APK to the world.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.200
[LAUGHS].

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:14.480
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.500
Or you could just share
it with us personally.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.490
Post it on G+.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.760
RICH HYNDMAN: What was the
name of the application?

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.860
MAXIM: I would prefer so,
because it's, well--

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:21.200
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.330
MAXIM: It's private.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.493
So where could I send?

00:48:24.493 --> 00:48:27.302
RICH HYNDMAN: What's the name
of the application?

00:48:27.302 --> 00:48:27.788
MAXIM: Uber.

00:48:27.788 --> 00:48:28.760
[LAUGHS].

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.218
RICH HYNDMAN: Can
you spell that?

00:48:30.218 --> 00:48:32.460
MAXIM: U-B-E-R.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:32.890
RICH HYNDMAN: Uber?

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:33.880
NICK BUTCHER: Oh,
like the taxi.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.086
MAXIM: Yeah.

00:48:35.086 --> 00:48:36.680
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, cool.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.930
RICH HYNDMAN: Nice.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:43.590
MAXIM: Actually, it's
on the Market now.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:43.980
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.850
It was in the Market
before now.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:45.845
So you've uploaded--

00:48:45.845 --> 00:48:46.890
NICK BUTCHER: But you've
updated it?

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:47.353
Despite the--

00:48:47.353 --> 00:48:48.279
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:48:48.279 --> 00:48:49.205
NICK BUTCHER: --permission
thing.

00:48:49.205 --> 00:48:50.610
MAXIM: Yeah, I did.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:50.980
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.090
Well, we can grab
it from there.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:52.585
That's cool.

00:48:52.585 --> 00:48:54.496
Was that clear?

00:48:54.496 --> 00:48:55.982
MAXIM: Yeah, thanks.

00:48:55.982 --> 00:48:56.340
NICK BUTCHER: All right.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:00.400
MAXIM: So should I come back,
like, to the next "Office

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.190
Hours," or to the next
15 minutes, or--

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.780
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.230
NICK BUTCHER: Always
come back to the

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.870
"Office Hours." [LAUGHTER]

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:09.750
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes!

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.530
Our next "Office Hours"
will be from Devoxx.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:14.220
So it's going to be a slightly
different format.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.450
There'll be a lot of Googlers
speaking at Devoxx [LAUGHS]

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:21.460
next week, the very nice
developer conference.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.420
So it may be taking a slightly
different format next week.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.600
But it should be at about
the same time.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.710
MAXIM: I see.

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:28.420
RICH HYNDMAN: We'll try and get
back to you on the Uber

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.460
thing slightly separately.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.206
Outside of the "Office Hours."

00:49:31.206 --> 00:49:31.689
MAXIM: All right.

00:49:31.689 --> 00:49:33.621
RICH HYNDMAN: Questions?

00:49:33.621 --> 00:49:36.150
MAXIM: Just in case, I'll type
my email in the Chat.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.070
Thanks.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:37.530
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.580
The problem with the Chat is
we lose it as soon as the

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.775
"Office Hours" goes off air.

00:49:40.775 --> 00:49:42.563
MAXIM: So, in the
Moderator, then.

00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:43.290
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:44.080
Somewhere like that.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.500
In the thread or the
Moderator is fine.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.120
OK.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.880
NICK BUTCHER: First chat
in the sidebar.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.790
CHRIS BANES: "Are you
attending Droidcon

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.720
Netherlands?

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.060
ALL UK DEVELOPERS: Yes.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.530
RICH HYNDMAN: Marijn, we will be
at Droidcon Netherlands on

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.750
the 23rd and 24th, maybe?

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.100
Maybe 24th and 25th.

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.000
NICK BUTCHER: See you there.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.520
RICH HYNDMAN: See you there.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.680
Excellent.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.110
Do we have any more questions
coming through the Moderator?

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:09.850
Sparky?

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:10.760
SPARKY RHODE: Mm.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.050
Let's take a quick look.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.910
RICH HYNDMAN: Thanks, dude.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.380
SPARKY RHODE: I'm only counting
eight, and there were

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.120
eight last time we
answered one.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:17.740
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.770
I agree.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.300
NICK BUTCHER: Through
the thread.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:21.740
SPARKY RHODE: Let's see.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.070
Yeah.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.060
Still only eight.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.580
I think we've hit them all.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:26.056
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.306
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.820
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Is it possible
to use the YouTube API?

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.966
You already talked about the--

00:50:34.966 --> 00:50:36.120
SPARKY RHODE: [LAUGHS].

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.310
NICK BUTCHER: So it's
coming soon.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:37.700
Yeah.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.390
They were taking beta testing,
but I'm not convinced that's

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.730
going on anymore, because, like
I said, they are kind of

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.338
getting to their final stages.

00:50:45.338 --> 00:50:47.983
So at the moment I'm not aware
of any more developers getting

00:50:47.983 --> 00:50:50.060
on board at the moment.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:50.909
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:50:50.909 --> 00:50:52.159
NICK BUTCHER: Yet.

00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:55.380
RICH HYNDMAN: All right.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.925
Well, if there's no other
questions today, you want me

00:50:57.925 --> 00:50:59.585
to wrap it up a little
bit early?

00:50:59.585 --> 00:51:00.920
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.800
GIUSEPPE: Sorry, but there must
be one of my questions.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.700
GIUSEPPE: Yay.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.072
[ECHO]

00:51:10.072 --> 00:51:11.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Go on, go ahead.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.630
GIUSEPPE: Can I go?

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:14.960
Please.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.010
Yes.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:23.150
I would like to know if there
is any guideline for what is

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.880
permitted and what not?

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.915
Let's suppose, for example, that
we would like to import

00:51:29.915 --> 00:51:33.380
the view from another
application, OK?

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:37.460
That has been done with another
application, into the

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:43.610
own application and extract the
algo from vis-a-vis view.

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.760
What is permitted
from the policy?

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:51.590
And if there is any policy
about what or not is

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.323
permitted, where
can I find it?

00:51:53.323 --> 00:51:56.800
RICH HYNDMAN: So that would
very much depend on the

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.533
guidelines for that
application.

00:51:58.533 --> 00:51:59.660
[ECHO].

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.370
So it's a bit of a
strange use case.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.650
But if they're going to allow
the Share intent--

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.470
send intent to share their video
to other applications--

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:10.840
then they're expecting to send
the video to social networks--

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.230
G+, Facebook, et cetera.

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:15.870
And then it shares to your
application, and your

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.550
application then pulls the
soundtrack off it.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:22.070
The use of that soundtrack will
be under the guidelines

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:23.100
of the application that
shared it in the

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.380
first place, I guess.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:26.660
Certainly--

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.820
MATT GAUNT: There is stuff
in the content

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:28.310
policy, isn't there?

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:31.570
About not interfering with
another app's data?

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:32.050
RICH HYNDMAN: There is.

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:32.550
It's true.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:33.966
NICK BUTCHER: Don't see
anyone I know of.

00:52:33.966 --> 00:52:35.040
RICH HYNDMAN: App functionality
of data.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.100
NICK BUTCHER: You've
got to be--

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.942
RICH HYNDMAN: It does sound--

00:52:37.942 --> 00:52:40.870
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think
which is the right here is to

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:43.602
make it easy for people to send
their content to your

00:52:43.602 --> 00:52:49.210
app, rather than going out and
scanning for other content.

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:49.922
Sounds like the right way to--

00:52:49.922 --> 00:52:54.120
GIUSEPPE: Yeah, but the problem
is that the data will

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.540
not be like it was sent.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.505
It would be managed, it
would be changed.

00:52:58.505 --> 00:53:01.110
It would be extract something
from inside.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:03.310
So this is the question.

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:06.940
The video application share
with me the video.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.120
That is it.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.840
But I'm extracting something
from inside.

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.240
I'm doing something wrong?

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.260
Or can I do this?

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:18.200
Or I can do this?

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.373
SPARKY RHODE: This begins
to sound like more

00:53:19.373 --> 00:53:22.051
like a legal question.

00:53:22.051 --> 00:53:22.502
GIUSEPPE: Yes.

00:53:22.502 --> 00:53:23.404
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, I agree.

00:53:23.404 --> 00:53:24.306
[ECHO].

00:53:24.306 --> 00:53:28.570
I actually know in some respects
what it's related to.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:33.670
GIUSEPPE: The problem is that
the content that was shared

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:39.150
with my app, it's not owned by
the other app, but it's owned

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:40.440
by the user.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:44.490
So if there is some legal
action will be

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.830
against me and the user.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:50.520
But if the user want a legal
action against me, why he

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.600
share the subject with me?

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.970
I don't know if it's clear,
the question.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.150
But probably we need a lawyer.

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.648
SPARKY RHODE: Hm.

00:54:01.648 --> 00:54:04.880
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, it may be
something that YouTube's

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.000
referring to.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.790
[ECHO]

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.450
GIUSEPPE: YouTube content is a
little bit different, because

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:13.990
we know that YouTube
don't want that we

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:16.750
manage the files, probably.

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.510
This isn't their policy.

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:23.250
But I'm talking about a
standalone file that is on the

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:26.680
device, and not imported
from outside or

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.780
downloaded from YouTube.

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:35.110
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, so there's
certain [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:38.396
good application playing
files from device.

00:54:38.396 --> 00:54:38.869
Limited files.

00:54:38.869 --> 00:54:42.230
These files, these apps will be
on video players and such

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.180
from Google Play Store.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.141
It's just it's--

00:54:45.141 --> 00:54:46.063
well, [LAUGHS]

00:54:46.063 --> 00:54:49.910
what the users actually extract
from it afterwards can

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:50.860
be questionable.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:51.341
[ECHO]

00:54:51.341 --> 00:54:55.189
RICH HYNDMAN: As long as
you're not [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:55.189 --> 00:54:59.040
Don't you think this
might be OK?

00:54:59.040 --> 00:54:59.886
Sounds like a legal question.

00:54:59.886 --> 00:55:01.630
[ECHO AND BACKGROUND NOISE]

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:03.000
MATT GAUNT: None of
us are lawyers.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.912
Thought we were.

00:55:03.912 --> 00:55:05.162
[LAUGHS].

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:08.750
NICK BUTCHER: High
anal lawyers.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:09.050
CHRIS BANES: [LAUGHS].

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:09.310
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, you
might be able to

00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:12.084
get around it with--

00:55:12.084 --> 00:55:12.516
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:12.516 --> 00:55:12.950
[LAUGHS].

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:14.060
RICH HYNDMAN: Dialogs,
things like that.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.742
Just warning the user
not to use it for

00:55:15.742 --> 00:55:16.700
any appdevs as well.

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.510
Make sure you only load up your
own content or you're

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:20.715
only-- you're not breaking any
copyright terms and conditions

00:55:20.715 --> 00:55:23.460
by using this product to XYZ.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.480
[ECHO]

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.536
GIUSEPPE: Something like, "Are
you sure you want to--

00:55:29.536 --> 00:55:33.670
want that we extracted the
algo from your video?"

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:34.980
Something like that?

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.465
RICH HYNDMAN: No, it just-- why
don't you just walk down

00:55:36.465 --> 00:55:38.220
the guidelines and only extract
audios from videos

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.720
that you own the rights to.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:41.930
NICK BUTCHER: So what?

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:42.580
Just showing you--

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.120
[ECHO]

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.110
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:44.630
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, maybe.

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:46.640
[ECHO]

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.640
RICH HYNDMAN: All right.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.432
GIUSEPPE: OK, thank you.

00:55:51.432 --> 00:55:53.430
RICH HYNDMAN: Cheers,
Giuseppe.

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:56.040
So I think we had some other
people bouncing in and out

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.290
during that.

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:58.640
Does anyone else have
a question?

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.704
What did Sparky just do?

00:56:01.704 --> 00:56:03.006
CHRIS BANES: That's all.

00:56:03.006 --> 00:56:03.402
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:56:03.402 --> 00:56:04.530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.160
If there's no other questions,
then we will wrap it up.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.068
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGHS].

00:56:09.068 --> 00:56:09.976
What's going on, Yossi?

00:56:09.976 --> 00:56:11.610
SPARKY RHODE: Thanks for
coming, everyone.

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.210
RICH HYNDMAN: Yossi's
being crazy.

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:15.470
Android says "Bye!" [LAUGHS].

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:16.350
Thanks for coming, everyone.

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:18.980
And as I say, next week
we'll be at Droidcon.

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.525
We hope very much to run--

00:56:20.525 --> 00:56:21.235
NICK BUTCHER: Pickles.

00:56:21.235 --> 00:56:21.740
RICH HYNDMAN: Excuse me?

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:22.200
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:22.410
[LAUGHTER].

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:23.230
RICH HYNDMAN: Because we've
enjoyed your screen.

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:25.310
Next week we'll be at Devoxx.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:26.540
Very much want to--

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.830
NICK BUTCHER: Watch out for a
special edition of various

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:28.260
"Office Hours."

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:29.830
RICH HYNDMAN: They are at the
normal time, normal place.

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:31.605
But you do double check
on developers.googl

00:56:31.605 --> 00:56:38.370
e.com/live/android just in case
we have to shift the time

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:41.490
to match some of the
Devoxx scheduling.

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:43.220
Thank you all very much,
and see you next week.

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:43.750
[ECHO]

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:46.492

the link of Droidcon?

[LAUGHTER]

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.482
NICK BUTCHER: Droidcon.com

00:56:51.482 --> 00:56:53.470

00:56:54.961 --> 00:56:55.955
I will Google, I will Google.
