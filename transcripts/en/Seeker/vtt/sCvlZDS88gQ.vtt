00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.080
Outside our solar system, there are enormous,
extremely hot, alien-worlds.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.929
These mysterious exoplanets were originally
thought to be the misfits of the cosmos, but

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.599
it turns out, there are hundreds of them and
they’re the source of a lot of speculation.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.390
Astronomers call these exoplanets, hot-Jupiters
because they have a similar mass and composition

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.429
as our solar system’s largest planet.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.230
They are, however, for the most part, much
larger and have a greater volume and as the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.370
name suggests they are hot...like really really
hot.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.670
The first hot Jupiter was discovered in 1995.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.730
Astronomers spotted the exoplanet orbiting
extremely close to its parent star - so close

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.170
that it caused the star to wobble.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.079
This observation inspired a new process of
exoplanetary discovery called the radial-velocity

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.320
method aka the ‘wobble method’.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.359
It works like this… scientists use the light
spectrum to measure the movement of a star.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.739
If the star’s light waves compress together
and then stretch out, it’s color signature

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.160
will change indicating that the star is in
fact, wobbling.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.190
And this is a sign that a hot-Jupiter may
be close by.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.900
Astronomers still use the wobble method today
and it’s contributed to the discovery of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350
hundreds of hot Jupiters.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.670
These exotic extrasolar gas giants have a
few characteristics in common.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.520
Like we mentioned earlier, hot Jupiters are
located feverishly close to their parent stars.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.900
Take, OGLE-TR-56b for example.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.390
Astronomers discovered this hot Jupiter clinging
to its parent star at a distance of about

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.390
0.02 AU.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.520
AU stands for astronomical unit and 1 AU represents
the average distance from Earth to the Sun.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.860
To put that into perspective, Mercury orbits
the sun at 0.39 AU.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.720
So OGLE-TR-56b is about fourteen times closer
to its parent star than Mercury is to the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.740
Sun.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.950
Because of this close proximity, hot Jupiters
have scorching surface temperatures.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.439
Since they are tidally locked, only one side
of these exoplanets faces its parent star.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.520
While, both sides reach extreme temperatures,
the dayside is much hotter.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.250
KELT-9b is the hottest gas giant on record
with a dayside temperature of more than 7,800

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.450
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.730
That’s about nine times hotter than the
average temperature on Venus - the hottest

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.050
planet in our solar system.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.580
The temperatures of hot Jupiters fluctuate
as they orbit their parent star at a rapid

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.660
pace.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.810
Their orbital periods are typically shorter
than 10 Earth days.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.410
WASP-18b has one of the shortest orbits ever
discovered.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.260
It takes this massive exoplanet just 23 hours
to rotate around its star in an almost perfectly

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.390
circular orbit.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.400
But the orbital paths of younger hot Jupiters
are thought to be more unconventional, because

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.700
they’re further away from their parent stars.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.030
HD 80606b for example, has a particularly
unusual route.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.120
During its elliptical orbit the hot Jupiter
swings close to its star at speed and then

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.350
shoots back out at a great distance.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.650
Scientists believe this exoplanet is in the
process of migrating towards its star, and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.220
it’s path could help explain how hot Jupiters
are formed.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.610
One of the leading hot Jupiter formation theories
holds that these gas giants were born farther

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.780
away from their stars, but over hundreds of
millions of years, are driven inward by the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.510
gravitational influences from nearby stars
or planets.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.570
And as a hot Jupiter migrates closer to its
star, its orbital path becomes more circular.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.870
But when a hot Jupiter’s orbit becomes too
close, it will enter a death spiral.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.520
The tidal forces from its much larger parent
star, will ultimately destroy the gas giant.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.370
It’s a bittersweet ending for these beautiful
bizarre worlds.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.370
While it’s sad to see them go, with every
hot Jupiter death, we will learn more about

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:51.840
the mysterious objects that inhabit 
the cosmos.
