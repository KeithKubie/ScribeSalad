00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.620
Leprosy is one of those things from movies
and stories, except when it's not and you

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.620
get it.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.910
Like if you lick and armadillo.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.000
Seriously.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.190
True story.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.839
Hey guys, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.070
Most of us have heard of leprosy.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.710
You probably associate it with colonies of
lepers with missing limbs that haven’t been

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.110
seen since the time of Jesus, but in reality
it’s still around today.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.660
More than 200,000 cases appear every year
around the world, yet few of us know much

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.600
about the disease beyond its dramatic history.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.980
So sit tight, because we’re about to clear
a few things up.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.300
First off, its official name is Hansen’s
Disease, after the scientist who discovered

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.720
its causative agent, Mycobacterium leprae.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.899
This bacteria spreads mostly through direct
contact with saliva or mucus.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.560
But also through certain animals, such as
armadillos, which have an ideal body temperature

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.280
to keep the bacteria alive.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.110
So, contrary to widespread belief, leprosy
is actually not very infectious.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.290
And those who are unlucky enough to contract
the disease often go years before seeking

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.220
treatment, as the bacteria reproduces very
slowly, and symptoms can take anywhere from

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100
five to 20 years to develop.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.570
That means you could have leprosy right now
and not even know it!

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.630
But you probably don’t have leprosy.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.030
In fact, about 95 percent of the population
is immune to it.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.920
And in the unlikely event that you do contract
the disease, there’s still hope.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.490
Scientists discovered a cure in the 1940’s,
and since 1995, a multi-drug treatment has

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.070
been provided to leprosy patients around the
world free of cost.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.640
After treatment begins, the disease is usually
gone within 6 to 12 months.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.170
And in the last two decades more than 16 million
people have been cured this way.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.869
Still, hundreds of thousands of new cases
pop up every year, mostly in subtropical regions

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.800
of Africa, Asia, Central and South America.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.310
The poor are particularly susceptible, as
lack of nutritious food, sanitation and medical

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.630
care leads to the spread of disease.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.979
As a result, leprosy is much more common in
developing nations, such as India, which is

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.799
home to at least 60 percent of all infected
people.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.579
Here in the United States, leprosy is extremely
rare, with less than 200 cases a year.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.850
Although the disease is not deadly, it can
have serious implications, especially for

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.060
the victim’s appearance.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.280
Left untreated, the bacteria spreads through
the skin and the peripheral nerves, manifesting

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.050
in pale or red lesions and sores as well as
numbness in the extremities.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.010
Because they can no longer feel pain in their
hands and feet, people with leprosy are much

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.960
more prone disabling injuries or secondary
infections, which would often require amputation.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.310
This would explain leprosy’s inaccurate
reputation as being ‘flesh eating’, causing

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.700
one’s body parts to simply fall off.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.069
Because of their appearance, people with leprosy
have been stigmatized.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.730
From biblical times all the way up to the
end of the 20th century, most people suspected

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.750
of having leprosy were forced into exile,
resulting in thousands of so-called leper

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.850
colonies.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.800
Although governments stopped this practice
by the beginning of the 20th century, many

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.379
leprosy patients, particularly those who do
not have access to treatment, continue to

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.920
quarantine themselves, fearing ostracism from
their community.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.720
This is one of the reasons leprosy continues
to plague certain countries.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.959
Discrimination and stigma leads to shame,
and this actually prevents people from seeking

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.069
treatment -- which of course, leads to further
spread of the disease.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.370
So perhaps the best way to eradicate leprosy
is actually just to get rid of the stigmas

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.370
around it.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.430
Seriously, ask yourself: What Would Jesus
Do?

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.000
Now you know more about leprosy you should
check out this video from her sister show

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:34.170
seeker daily where they explore what happens
to people who 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.170
HAVE leprosy.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.860
You might think leper colonies are a thing
of the past…

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.180
Watch that video here.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.900
What do you guys think about all this?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.540
Did it change you mind on what leprosy really
is?

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.390
