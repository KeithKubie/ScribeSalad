Vsauce. Michael here with a new
episode of "Up All Knight."

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.100
Vsauce.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.889
Michael here today with a new episode
of "Up All Knight," a show where I cover cool, geeky

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.630
trick things.
For instance, we all know Yahoo.com,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
but do you know what happens when you click
on the dot in the exclamation point

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.470
after "Yahoo!" ?

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.360
"YAHOOOOO!"

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.650
Next, let's talk video.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.789
VLC is a free media player that
lets you do some cool

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.859
things.
Open up VLC, go to Preferences,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.450
Video, select all, click on Video,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.840
Output modules and choose color ASCII art

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.649
video output.
Now, my episode of Bill Nye is made out of

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.350
text.
I can also make my wallpaper my desktop wallpaper

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.539
animated and move.
Go to preferences, video,

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.050
all, and under an output module you'll find
"Use as desktop background." Ta-da!

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.230
Now I can work right on top of Bill.
For my final trick,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.890
let's download some YouTube videos.
Just copy your YouTube URL

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.979
and open it as "network."
Then go to window, media information,

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.100
and boom!
That is its secret location.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.500
Depending on your browser it will either
take you to a full-screen version that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.290
you could download

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.770
or immediately start downloading the
video at full quality.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.110
Google can be a lot like old-school
Napster. Use code number one in this video's

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.170
description to search for downloadable

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.670
audio files. Just put the keyword you
want between the double quotes

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.790
and sweet, look what I found.
Not big enough?

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.869
Well, try to add "admir7656's" recommendation of

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.710
epic Google. It just keeps growing and
growing and growing

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.880
until you search.
You can also try Weenie Google.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.380
It shrinks and shrinks so fast.
Mac users,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.540
did you know that the application icon
for Text Edit has a message

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.869
on it that you can read if you zoom in
enough? And Windows users,

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.079
paste code number two in the notepad,
save it as a ".bat" file,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.119
open it and play tic-tac-toe.
If you have not yet seen

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.420
every episode of "Up All Knight,"
make today the day you do it.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.490
You can click any of these to watch previous
episodes,to learn stuff like how to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.649
reveal passwords

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.780
and a couple, well, way more than a couple, pranks.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.560
Subscribe to Vsauce for more and get
excited for Saturday,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.760
