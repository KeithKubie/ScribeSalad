00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:01.510
MALE SPEAKER: So
at Google, I feel

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.700
like we're a bunch of
software engineers,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.680
and sales, and so on.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.300
And many of us engineers
are frustrated physicists.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.060
We would have loved to be
experimental and theoretical

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.900
physicists as we grew up, but
we had to settle for Google.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.860
So we all take a
pretty strong interest

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.540
in things going on, especially
with the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.385
I think you've probably
all seen the doodle

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:27.760
we did a couple of years ago
when everybody was concerned

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.926
that you would create a
black hole that we would all

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:30.710
get sucked into.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.720
So we have a bit of
fun with it as well.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.894
And we've also done Street
View inside the LHC,

00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:39.300
So people can get
a sense of what

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.970
it's like to be inside the LHC
by kind of walking around it

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.520
virtually.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.670
From the Google side, do we
have any physics undergrads

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.040
in the group?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.430
Oh, only one.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.130
Fine.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.260
You're definitely on
for asking a question.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.150
But many of us are fascinated
by what's been going on,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.690
and have been incredibly
excited to live through,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.930
vicariously, this
historical event

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.110
that's happened in the
past couple of years.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.680
But with that, I'd like
to turn things over

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.450
to Mark Levinson, who's
the director of this movie,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.550
to introduce the
other panelists.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.350
MARK LEVINSON: So just I'll give
a little bit of an introduction

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.970
to what's going on here.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.260
I don't know how many
people know about this film.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.390
We've been working
on it for years.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.280
David Kaplan first had an idea
to do something like this.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.664
He is a theorist, and
saw that something

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:37.580
was happening that was
going to be monumental.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.130
And was a unique situation
in the history of science,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.790
where something was
going to turn on.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.665
Do you want to just get
a little intro, Dave,

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:46.730
before Savas gets back?

00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:50.085
DAVID KAPLAN: Hello.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.500
About in 2006, I
did a calculation

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.720
that any theorist
could do and discovered

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.600
that somebody needed to
make a documentary film.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.630
And I was the only
one in my field

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.530
willing to do
something like that.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.620
And so I started.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.039
I bought a camera, I
started doing interviews,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.780
and discovered I didn't know
how to operate a camera.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.940
And then had to figure out how
this film was going to be made.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.890
I didn't really have a
desire to make a movie,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.070
I had a desire for
this movie to be made.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.550
But I understood it had
to be made from somebody

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.841
who was deep inside the
world, and sort of living it.

00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:31.340
Somebody who was not going to
be intimidated by the physics,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.290
but understood that
this was a human drama

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.470
and that this is a side of
science that I never see

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.800
captured in any other way.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.841
So I wanted to see it.

00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:40.840
And I wanted to feel it.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.450
And I wanted my
friends to be known,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.006
because these are my favorite
people in the universe.

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:48.380
I didn't understand
why everybody

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.650
didn't know about them.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.610
And I didn't understand why
this amazing event was going

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.210
to happen and nobody was
going to know about it.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.960
I ended up being
wrong about that.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.300
It was all over the papers.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.410
But that was the
original motivation.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.690
And then mark discovered
some crazy physicist

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.360
wanted to make a movie.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.370
And Mark's training is a
PhD in particle theory,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.290
and then went on to
make movies, which

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.415
is the natural progression.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.020
He is the only one in
that Hollywood gang

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.742
who would really
understand immediately

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:21.450
that there was an
incredible story there.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.880
That the humans that are doing
it are amazing and interesting,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.760
and that you can create
something dramatic out

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.790
of something that sounds
incredibly technical.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.290
MARK LEVINSON: And here
we are many years later,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.280
with an incredible cast.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.560
And so actually, I'm going to
roll, as just an introduction,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.470
we have the trailer
that we have released.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.750
And so why don't we roll
the theatrical trailer?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.364
Clip one.

00:03:50.364 --> 00:03:51.030
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.840
-Thank you all.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.860
Thank you for your attention.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.780
Thanks to everybody
on the panel.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.060
If I could just ask
you all to remain

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.507
seated just for a few minutes.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.890
-In exploration
there needs to be

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.320
the set of people
who have no rules.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.670
And they are going
into the frontier.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.250
-I've never heard of
a moment in history

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.600
where an entire field is
hinging on a single event.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.750
The Large Hadron Collider, the
biggest machine ever built,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.000
is finally going to turn on.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.610
-You take two things and
you smash them together.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.360
You get a lot of stuff
out that collision,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.760
and you try to
understand that stuff.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.860
-It could be nothing other than
just understanding everything.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.480
-Little did I know
when I started

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.070
that the experiments
would take 30 years.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.490
And here I am still not knowing.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.730
I really want to know the truth.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.570
-The first time I ever saw it,
I remember walking in and just

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.640
being stunned.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.470
Like five stories
completely filled

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.870
with custom-designed,
hand-soldered microelectronics.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.420
-There are 10,000 people,
over 100 nationalities.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.550
-Ciao ciao.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.170
-100,000 computers
deal with the data.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.790
In fact, the World Wide
Web was invented at CERN

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.520
so that physicists
could share the data.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.300
-This is really my
generation's only shot.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.590
-Let's get started everybody.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.912
Now comes the day of reckoning.

00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:18.916
-Given the complexity, we're
already about a week or two

00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:19.415
behind.

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:21.486
-They're saying hat all
their tools are breaking.

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:23.235
-It begs the question,
what are the risks?

00:05:23.235 --> 00:05:25.720
-It would be a
catastrophe for physics.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.435
-This helium leak,
really frustrating.

00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:29.850
-We've got magnets sheared
off their [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.420
-Completely catastrophic.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.710
-We're at a fork in
the road, and it's

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.540
cranking up the suspense
as much as it possibly can.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.520
-We may discover
additional space dimension.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.500
The mystery and the
origin of the universe.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.000
-We may be at the
end of the road.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.505
-The entire control
room is like a group

00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:47.000
of six-year-olds whose
birthday is next week.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.140
-It's incredible that it's
happened in my lifetime.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.740
-Whatever we learn
is going to have

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.041
a dramatic impact on
the way human beings

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:58.415
think about the
universe forever.

00:06:01.646 --> 00:06:03.570
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.580
MARK LEVINSON: So this
is a very unique moment.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.720
I think it may never happen
again, and hasn't happened,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.010
where actually everybody
is here at one time.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.830
And we have a very
interesting distribution here.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.110
These are the experimentalists,
and these are the theorists.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:37.670
And yes, well, OK, Mike sort
of straddled things, actually.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.980
But I'm putting him in the
experimental side anyways.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.530
But this separation is something
that people outside of physics

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.170
don't really
understand that much.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.240
That really it's a
completely different culture.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.110
And one of the things
that comes out in the film

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.660
is that they have really
different perspectives,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.250
and different attitudes.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.410
And I think that one
of the great things

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.320
about the LHC and
the film is possibly

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.250
that it brought them
together in a way that

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.560
has not been as
pronounced before.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.620
But I want to just look at
a couple of clips from early

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.420
on where we hear a little bit
about the different attitudes

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.260
that the two camps had
towards each other.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.150
And then think about how
that may have changed.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.524
Next clip.

00:07:33.524 --> 00:07:34.190
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.580
-I always get the
impression that theorists

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.870
think that experimentalists
are failed theorists.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.570
Which is not, I
would like to say,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.490
what experimentalists
think about themselves.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.190
I remember once I
was a grad student,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.430
and a fellow grad
student of mine

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.690
was lamenting about how
challenging theoretical physics

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.190
was.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.814
And he says to me,
oh, I think I'm just

00:07:52.814 --> 00:07:55.200
going to join
experimental physics.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.500
It's so much easier.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.190
And he says to me,
what do you guys do?

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.132
Just bang around with
a hammer all day?

00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:04.760
And I was thinking,
God, I don't think

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.650
I've used a hammer
in my entire career

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.907
as an experimental physicist.

00:08:08.907 --> 00:08:10.740
Is that really what you
guys think about us?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.120
That we're just like,
knock, knock, knock,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.450
like some sort of cave people?

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:20.330
Every time I go into
the theory coffee room,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.430
it's like either a,
they're drinking coffee,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.750
or they're just kind of
writing something randomly

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:32.520
on the board, or they're
reading magazines.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.240
Physics magazines,
I'll give them that.

00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:40.210
It does seem like
a life of leisure,

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.679
actually, in some ways.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.437
It's kind of nice.

00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:46.060
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.309
MARK LEVINSON: And on
the other hand, some

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:50.600
of the theorists, actually,
because this experiment was

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.690
going on, they thought,
maybe I should actually

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.390
get closer to the experiment
and actually try to help them,

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.440
because they need a
little bit of guidance.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.980
And so we have a
Nima's perspective.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.612
Roll it.

00:09:03.612 --> 00:09:04.104
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:04.104 --> 00:09:05.520
-The experimental
community's like

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.580
a big, huge, multi-headed hydra.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.580
There's no one single boss.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.240
There's no one who
runs the whole show.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.070
So it's complicated to
know who to talk to,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.700
how to make sure things get
done, how to even approach

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.940
broaching the subject
of having theorists

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.520
and experimentalists
collaborate more closely.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.000
I used to say that for a
while, in the beginning,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.040
it was like being in
a David Lynch movie.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.600
You would wander
around and just keep

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.058
getting strange
characters, and you

00:09:37.058 --> 00:09:40.520
have no idea where they fit
into the grand scheme of things.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.960
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.620
MARK LEVINSON: So
I'm just curious.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.527
You people have finally met.

00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:53.110
Have your perspectives
changed at all?

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.068
Well, Nima just said his
hasn't changed at all.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.490
NIMA ARKANI-HAMED: It's still
like a David Lynch movie,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.660
but it's one of the
David Lynch movies

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.400
that makes a little more
sense than the others.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.420
You eventually realize that
Fabiola's extremely important,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.950
and it's important to
be on her good side.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.280
MARK LEVINSON: OK.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.277
Experimentalists.

00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:21.860
FABIOLA GIANOTTI:
Can I say something?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.170
OK, so I agree with
what Monica said.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.600
That sounds right.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.770
However, I never use
a hammer in my career,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.330
but I'm very good at
soldering and welding.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.990
And actually, I learned
several practical things.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.390
No, jokes aside, I think
we are very good friends.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.110
I think that it's very nice
that we have the opportunity

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.900
to discuss very often, and
to give them the impression

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.240
that the give us guidance,
which is not true.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.950
And to tell them what
the truth actually

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.561
is, because sometimes they're
a bit, say, disoriented.

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:04.310
NIMA ARKANI-HAMED:
Actually, if I can also

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.610
make a slightly serious
comment, the issues

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.220
that I was talking
about back then

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:16.220
really had specifically to do
with the ways in which searches

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.170
for a new phenomenon
would be carried out.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.530
And that's something which,
in the intervening time,

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.190
exactly this kind
of collaboration

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.596
between experimentalists
and theorists, much

00:11:30.596 --> 00:11:31.970
closer collaboration
than existed

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.470
in the 10, 15 years
previous to that

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.969
has really made a significant
impact on how these things are

00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:36.500
done.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.740
And I really wouldn't make
the same comment today.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.480
Things are in much
smoother and better shape.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.390
MARK LEVINSON: Savas,
has your attitude

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.180
towards experimentalists
changed?

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.800
SAVAS DIMOPOULOS: Actualy,
I always felt close to them,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.070
and I've been talking to
them throughout my career.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.280
So I don't feel this
dichotomy to the same degree

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.980
that was reflected
in these clips.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.980
Maybe they were chosen
because they were extreme,

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.750
just for fun.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.470
But I think we are much closer.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.870
Without them we
wouldn't know the truth,

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.830
and without us, they wouldn't
be able to organize the truth

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.300
into a structure, a
coherent, logical structure.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.740
MARK LEVINSON: Do you think
the LHC represented something

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.865
different in terms of
bringing you closer together?

00:12:22.865 --> 00:12:25.180
That there was closer
collaboration than possibly

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.609
in past experiments?

00:12:26.609 --> 00:12:28.150
MONICA DUNFORD: Well
I think that one

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.530
of the things with the
LHC is that it basically,

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.210
before the LHC
turned on, we really

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.617
didn't have a significant
amount of data.

00:12:34.617 --> 00:12:36.700
And so I think there was,
sort of, naturally then,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.908
in this waiting period-- I
mean the LHC took 20 years

00:12:38.908 --> 00:12:41.970
to build-- that in this waiting
period of these 20 years,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.810
there was really nothing
for us experimentalists

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.370
to talk to the theorists about.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.520
So now I think, and
just in the last couple

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.490
of years, that has just
been revolutionized.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.850
We have terabytes of data.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.014
And so now we can
go and say, well

00:12:56.014 --> 00:12:58.180
this is what we found, or,
this isn't what we found.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.304
And what do you guys think?

00:12:59.304 --> 00:13:02.360
And there's a lot of
back and forth now.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.474
So I think the data sort
of has changed everything.

00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:07.640
MARK LEVINSON: I mean,
Martin and Mike actually both

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.360
started in theory.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.300
You said you originally thought
you were interested in theory,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.200
and Mike, you've got a degree
in lattice gauge field, right?

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.830
So you started in
theory, you've moved more

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.990
towards the experimental side.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.880
Totally, in Martin's case.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.670
Did you make the right decision?

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.520
Yes, I never regretted
this decision.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.570
I mean I started in theory.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.420
During my studies, I
spent a year or so deeply

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.620
going into theory, and quantum
field theory, and so on.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.870
But I think it was just
natural [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.110
for a particle
physicist afterwards.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.550
And then the choice
actually came.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.710
It was really CERN, I mean
this opportunity at CERN

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.290
to work there, and to work
on these big experiments.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.829
And that happened to be
as an experimentalist.

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:02.870
And that's why I signed
up as an experimentalist.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.560
But it's true.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.500
I mean, if this would have
been possible as a theorist,

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.750
maybe I would have done a
totally different career.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.970
But anyway, for me
already at that point,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.090
it was clear that this
is a close collaboration.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.410
It's clear that one cannot
exist without the other.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.550
I mean, theory
without experiments,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.450
they would just develop
ideas, ideas, ideas,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.650
and they would diverge.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.730
And experimentalists
without theorists is a bit,

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.350
you measure, but afterwards
you need an interpretation.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.234
And very often the measurement
itself can't tell you so much,

00:14:35.234 --> 00:14:36.900
but of course the
interpretation and how

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.220
it fits into the theory, this
can explain you many things.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.380
And that's why
[INAUDIBLE] the LHC

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.240
has impact on theories of
a big bang, on dark matter,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.060
and so on.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.893
This is because there's
this interpretation.

00:14:54.795 --> 00:14:56.420
SAVAS DIMOPOULOS:
Having theory develop

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.730
before the experiments
actually happen

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.770
is also very useful,
because that pinpoints

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.020
the type of signatures
that experimentalists

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.850
should look for.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.490
So it's very important.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.620
For example, the missing energy
signature of supersymmetry.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.170
I don't think it's
something that's

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.440
obvious before you
have some theories that

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.060
have this as a signature.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.340
And many other things.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.330
There is a famous
saying which says

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.070
that, you have to
believe it to see it.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.420
You have to know ahead of
time what you're looking for

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.050
to be able to see it.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.750
MARK LEVINSON: So
just going back

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.350
to what people thought
they were going

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.647
to see at the
beginning of this, I

00:15:34.647 --> 00:15:36.230
want to just look
at a couple of clips

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.900
from some first interviews
of what people up here were

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.230
thinking before it
actually turned on.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.014
Next clip.

00:15:45.014 --> 00:15:45.680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.450
-I think that we
are not in a crisis,

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.830
but we are really in front of
a brick wall at the moment.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.680
We need, absolutely, some input
from experimental physics,

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.200
from the collision
[INAUDIBLE] energy to move on.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.830
-The worst possibility
is they discover

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.010
the Higgs, nothing else.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.420
The new deep physics, dark
matter, supersymmetry,

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.950
[INAUDIBLE], it's just
around the corner.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.207
But the LHC can't quite do it.

00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:15.290
And there's no way we're
going to convince anybody

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.150
that it may be just
around the corner

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.280
and it's worth
building other machine.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.130
So the field ends
because of that.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.510
A miscalculation.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.820
-You really begin to doubt
whether we can actually

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.110
make this thing work.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.040
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.880
MARK LEVINSON: So before.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.714
Where are we now, actually?

00:16:35.714 --> 00:16:36.505
What would you say?

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.310
DAVID KAPLAN: Mine was the most
dramatic statement, I guess.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.730
Part of the motivation
for the movie

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.340
was that when we
were up at night,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.480
I remember a conversation
with Nima at 3 o'clock

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.400
in the morning at
CERN, thinking what

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.970
if we, as in theorists
thinking about physics

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.810
at these energies, were
just on the wrong track.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.150
And that what would
be revealed would

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.900
be that this program, at
least what we had dedicated

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.240
our theoretical careers
to, or most of them,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.839
just happened to
be a wrong turn.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.680
And we had to go
some other direction.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.240
And that emotional
drama made me think

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.920
somebody has got to record this.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.859
But that sort of drama
is a very human drama.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.250
It's a generational drama.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:32.700
It's that we people may
be affected negatively.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.670
You could look back and say, the
career didn't amount to much,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.370
because you didn't move in
the direction that brought us

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.920
real progress, or at
least visible progress.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.630
But all those dead ends
are incredibly important

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.330
regardless.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.990
We need to explore
all directions.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.690
And it doesn't matter--
this is actually

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.830
something Nima said in
one of the interviews--

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.750
it doesn't matter
what happens to you.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.990
It's not about you.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.110
It's not a personal thing.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.860
It's necessary
for so many people

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.390
to be pushing in all directions,
because we don't really

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.450
know what the big
answer will be,

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:09.600
or the next piece of
information will be.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.970
Now the LHC has seen the Higgs.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.420
I felt much more emotional about
that than I expected to feel.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.850
Because one thing about the
distinction between theorists

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.260
an experimentalists, theorists
might read a blog rumor

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.460
and decide they know
what's going on.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.590
And experimentalists will
wait until the probability

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.250
that they've seen an
accident is one in trillion,

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.610
and then they'll say
publicly that they've

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.100
discovered something.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.290
So that distinction
means that we're

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.250
speculating in many
possible futures.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.000
And so when you hear me
talking a few years ago,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.800
you're listening to
me speculating down

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.010
one path or another.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.732
And I know Jerry,
who's here, told me

00:18:54.732 --> 00:18:56.190
that the problem
with the theorists

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.430
is we talk way too long.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.100
But I'm going to
say one more thing

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.510
and then I'll shut
up, which is I think,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.420
especially Americans,
particle physicists suffer

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.540
from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:14.050
Because in 1993, while building
the biggest experiment ever

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.300
in Texas, a factor
of three times larger

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.250
than the one in
Geneva, that Congress

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.130
decided to cancel it
after spending $2 billion

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.480
and digging 14 miles of tunnel.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.672
And that shook the field in
the United States to a degree

00:19:31.672 --> 00:19:33.880
where we stopped thinking
about physics all the time,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.565
and we started thinking a
little bit sociologically.

00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:38.250
Like, will they allow us?

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.460
Can we keep going?

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.770
Can we push in the direction
for pure knowledge,

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.720
and pure science,
and basic research?

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.560
There was a mistrust in the
people who, up to that point,

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.600
were supporting
this kind of thing.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:57.890
And so that added to the drama,
especially before the machine

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.090
turned on and a beautiful
discovery was made.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.970
NIMA ARKANI-HAMED:
So you should know

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.530
that the Higgs is
a crazy particle.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.160
And it holds a really
enigmatic place

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.550
in our understanding
of the world.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.950
On the one hand, it's
been, as you all know,

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.030
it's been anticipated
for almost 50 years.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.211
Maybe you didn't know,
but it's been hypothesized

00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:29.210
and people have been
expecting something like it

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.980
for a long time.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.660
So from the point of view
of a theoretical physicist,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.070
it's in the canon of
things which is allowed.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.180
We understand it very well.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.930
And it's the simplest
possible solution

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.810
to a very fundamental
problem, which

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.960
I won't explain now in detail.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.980
But anyway, it's the
simplest possible solution.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.910
On the other hand, it's
absolutely shocking

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.810
that something so simple is
actually realized in nature.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.470
And I think that
shock is something

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.650
which even us theorists-- I
mean we've known all of this

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:12.480
in principle for a long
time-- but if you asked David

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.410
many years ago when
he made that comment,

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.930
I think it was commonplace
amongst theorists to think,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.800
well yeah, we know
the Higgs is there.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.162
It's about what's coming next.

00:21:23.162 --> 00:21:25.370
And I think something which
has happened to all of us

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:31.290
in the interim, is as the actual
reality of this damn particle

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.540
came into existence--
and, in fact,

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:40.800
the particular strange mass that
it has also became evident--

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.200
is we're all appreciating much
more deeply how utterly bizarre

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.580
it actually is that something
so simple does describe nature.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.560
We've never seen anything
like it before anywhere.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.950
Anywhere in physics.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.270
There are all kinds
of different systems

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.470
that people can engineer
in the laboratory that

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.489
have qualitative
aspects of the physics

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:07.030
very much like all the rest of
the particles, and the forces,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:11.360
and interactions that we're
familiar with in the vacuum

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.450
of our universe.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.850
But never a Higgs.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.750
Never something that
looks like a Higgs.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.380
So the fact that,
on the one hand,

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.500
the simplest possibility
is what's realized,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.499
but on the other hand,
that simplest possibility

00:22:21.499 --> 00:22:23.240
we've never seen
realized anywhere else,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.470
is absolutely bizarre.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.570
And I think we're all
appreciating how bizarre it is,

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.210
and taking a step back.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.080
What's transpired
at the LHC so far

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.957
is not exactly what
some of us expected.

00:22:36.957 --> 00:22:39.040
On the other hand, it's
not so different than what

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.980
some others of us expected.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.680
And we're left in
a strange quandary.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.434
The idea that the experimental
high energy physicists,

00:22:50.434 --> 00:22:51.850
especially in this
country, suffer

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.520
from the post-traumatic stress
disorder of the Superconducting

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.980
Super Collider is
absolutely correct.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.460
And it's as David said, it
colored a lot how we even

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.290
think about justifying
what we want to do.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.740
But in fact, the
real justification

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.430
for doing what we're doing is
to keep pushing the frontier

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.680
And seeing what's there.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.550
And in particular,
since we've never

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.330
seen anything like
the Higgs before,

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.420
it's very important to study
its properties in detail,

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.890
and to go to even
higher energies,

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.300
and see what its quantum
mechanical properties look

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.450
like.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.660
And while that might be
difficult to convince people

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.810
in this country to do it,
Europe is showing some ambition

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.599
to do something like
this, and also China

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:33.890
may be showing some ambition
to do something like this.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.750
Build the next accelerator.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.120
Three times bigger
than the LHC, even.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.940
In 20 or 30 years, this
is something people

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.776
are starting to
take this seriously.

00:23:41.776 --> 00:23:44.110
MARK LEVINSON: Experimentalists
are chomping at the bit.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.692
FABIOLA GIANOTTI:
OK, so first of all,

00:23:45.692 --> 00:23:47.120
following on what
David said, you

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.440
have perhaps picked
up another difference

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.630
between theorists
and experimentalists.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.490
They work overnight,
we work on daytime.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:59.470
We sleep overnight so that
we are lucid on day time.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:06.330
Seriously, as an
experimentalist, first of all,

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.240
we have just discovered
a new particle.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.590
It's a very special one.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.750
It's completely different from
the other elementary particles

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.440
that we have observed until now.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.800
There were 16
elementary particles

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.210
before the 4th of July.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.860
The Higgs boson is
the 17th particle.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.640
It's completely different
from the others.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.760
It's a very special
one for reasons

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.455
that will be a bit
difficult to explain,

00:24:28.455 --> 00:24:30.380
a bit technical reasons.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.610
But I consider the Higgs
boson as a new friend.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.270
And as a new friend, you want
to know him, her, it, better.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:44.220
So we have to measure its
properties in more detail.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.040
For that we need more data, and
Mike will give us more data.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.182
Right?

00:24:49.182 --> 00:24:52.050
He said yes.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.410
So first of all, this is
really a very nice thing to do.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.695
To measure the Higgs boson
in all possible details,

00:24:58.695 --> 00:25:02.490
because it can be a
door to new physics.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.770
And into a better understanding,
also, of the universe,

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.150
and many things that we
don't understand today.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.220
And the second thing
is that the LHC just

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.170
started the exploration
of the new energy scale.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.920
We've been operating
at an energy which

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.200
is a factor 1.7
lower than the design

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.420
energy of the accelerator.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:26.140
So in one year from now, we will
get close to the design energy.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.410
And we have been
collecting an amount

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:37.620
of data which is a factor of
10 less than the design value.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.330
And a factor of
100 less of what we

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.150
can go by pushing the
machine to the extreme.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.370
To its extreme possibilities.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.740
So we're just starting.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.610
So for me, it's
like opening a door.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.400
And the expectation
is still very high

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.110
to find new physics
in one year from now.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.510
It's like opening a door and
being in front of a nice garden

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.900
with a lot of flowers.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.100
MARK LEVINSON: Mike,
you expressed concern.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.280
Are we ever going to
get this thing to work?

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.050
You're responsible
for delivering beams

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.880
to these people and
worrying about it

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.930
damaging their detectors.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.860
Do you feel an ease now?

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.415
The machine, for everybody
who hasn't seen the film

00:26:16.415 --> 00:26:19.500
and doesn't know, the
machine was turned off.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.800
They're doing major
renovations and upgrades.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.160
They will start again
at the end of next year

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.910
at essentially
double the energy.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.450
And what's your
feeling now, Mike?

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.230
Are you confident now that the
next one is going to go well?

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.730
Easy?

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.030
MIKE LAMONT: Yes.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.655
MARK LEVINSON: This
is for their benefits.

00:26:41.655 --> 00:26:42.780
MIKE LAMONT: We were lucky.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.070
I mean, the LHC was
initially conceived in '84.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.680
It took a long time to develop
the ideas, develop the magnets,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.180
the technology required.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.590
It was late, it was over budget.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.330
We turned it on,
and we blew it up.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.150
And we were off for over a
year picking up the pieces.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:06.650
So we started back
up at the end of 2009

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.480
and we've just came about
halfway through a long shutdown

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.410
of about two years to
consolidate the machine so we

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.930
can take up to design energy
at the beginning of 2015.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.750
So I think it's fair to say an
awful lot of lessons have been

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.150
learnt about the process,
about what went wrong,

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.160
about the technology.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.980
And those lessons have been
applied during this shutdown.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.470
So I think the results
that are coming through

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:36.590
give us some confidence that
we can go to 6 and 1/2 TeV

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.107
without too many problems.

00:27:38.107 --> 00:27:40.190
MARK LEVINSON: I'm sure
they're all very comforted

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.810
to hear that.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:45.990
So I want to actually look at
another side As David said,

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.920
the film really shows the
human side of these characters.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.690
And I think you
already get a sense,

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.107
they have more dimensions than
just what typically people

00:27:59.107 --> 00:28:00.190
think of us as physicists.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.710
And one of the
interesting things

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.580
is that several of our
characters play the piano

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.900
and talk about certain parallels
between art and physics.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.315
And I want to just show
the next clip, actually.

00:28:13.315 --> 00:28:14.976
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:12.010
MARK LEVINSON: So what is
the role, for you, in music?

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.070
And do you think there
is an overlap between art

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.400
and science?

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.358
Do you think artists can
learn from scientists?

00:29:16.358 --> 00:29:18.762
Do you think scientists
can learn from artists?

00:29:18.762 --> 00:29:20.803
FABIOLA GIANOTTI: I don't
want to speak too much,

00:29:20.803 --> 00:29:25.920
but for me music is a very
important component of my life.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.860
I think I am a
modestly good physicist

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.350
because I've been
studying music.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.600
And music and physics are
really very close to each other.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.780
They both require
rules, mathematics.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.750
Music is based on a harmony,
which is the physics of sounds,

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.700
essentially.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.090
And a Bach cantata,
for instance,

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.830
is a piece of mathematics.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.690
Because Bach was really
following the rules

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.230
in a very strict way.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.200
On top of which, Bach
has put all of his heart.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.250
So music is rules, and
a lot of creativity,

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.190
and fantasy, as much as physics.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.170
So for me, hey are really
two different expressions

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.870
of the same human [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:13.880
SAVAS DIMOPOULOS: Well, I was
the last child in a family,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.500
so my parents were
sick and tired

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.250
of teaching music to their
kids by that time I was born.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.650
So unfortunately, even
though I love music,

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.490
I don't play an instrument.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.920
On the other hand,
it seems to me

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.050
that the creative
process the sciences

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.010
and the arts must have
some similarities.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:44.930
One of the things they share is
that they appear that they are

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:53.360
not very practical
endeavours to start with.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.970
They don't have an
obvious utilitarian value,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.280
either the arts or the
sciences, to start with.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:04.480
Yet they are very
important for human beings.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.740
And that, for example,
is a similarity

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.580
that comes out that at
the very end of the movie.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:20.950
That they seem to be not needed
from the evolutionary point

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.440
of view, yet they are there.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.100
And it's a mystery for
why we do art and science,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.230
and why we don't
satisfy ourselves

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.080
from much more mundane
activities that

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.165
are more directly
essential for our survival.

00:31:38.007 --> 00:31:39.840
MARK LEVINSON: Do you
want to say something?

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.340
NIMA ARKANI-HAMED:
I mean, that this

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.687
is a big subject about which
many platitudes are said,

00:31:44.687 --> 00:31:46.520
of the relationship
between art and science.

00:31:51.682 --> 00:31:53.390
I don't think it's
true for all the arts,

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.223
but there are certain
parts of the arts that

00:31:55.223 --> 00:32:04.410
are extremely similar,
I think, psychologically

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.814
to what we do in physics.

00:32:06.814 --> 00:32:08.980
Very particularly what we
do in theoretical physics.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:14.570
I think certain kinds of
novelists and composers

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.320
go through a very
similar process

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.680
we do as theoretical physicists.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.300
Because there's a
structure, and there

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.970
is an external notion
of right and wrong.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.120
Now, of course we have
an external notion

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.680
of right and wrong which is
almost literally God-given,

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.640
out there in the universe.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.430
But really great music
and really great novels

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:41.720
also have a sense that
there's some perfect structure

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.160
that you constantly
fail to live up to.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.310
And you keep chipping away at
it until finally some jewel

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.420
emerges, which was sitting there
all along, sort of inevitably

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.520
there to be discovered.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.770
But which takes an enormous
amount of time and persistence

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.780
to actually find.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:08.350
So I think that's a fundamental
psychological difference

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:12.010
that-- I've talked
to Mark about this--

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:16.190
I had a conversation with
Ian McEwan back in November

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.450
at the London Science Museum.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.670
We had a wonderful
conversation, and had

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.810
a very interesting
dinner afterwards.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.990
And it's very, very similar.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.890
The basic psychology
is very similar.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.310
As far as things like
playing the piano goes,

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.860
I don't know how you
guys feel about it,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.680
but it's sort in the
opposite direction.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.240
And it's the difference between
playing and composition.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.350
I find that things
like playing the piano

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:52.810
are a wonderful antidote to
the frustrations of research.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:57.940
The hardest part of our
job is that you wake up

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.050
in the morning, and you
work very, very hard,

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.860
and you have nothing to show
for it at the end of the day.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.910
And you fail miserably over
and over and over again.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.830
And we're not idiots.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.651
We're trying.

00:34:10.651 --> 00:34:12.400
We're trying this,
were trying that, we're

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.590
trying the other thing.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.800
And maybe you take a
little bit of solace

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.460
you failed a little less badly
today than you did yesterday.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.070
But mostly you fail.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.159
And every now and
then, if you're

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:29.290
Savas it happens more often
than for some of the rest of us,

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.679
you have a big peak.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.280
And you're maybe excited
for two or three days.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.139
And that's it.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.040
And then you're
back to the misery.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.070
So that's life.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.864
And that's what you have
to get used o if you

00:34:41.864 --> 00:34:43.030
want to be in this business.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:46.929
When Monica was complaining
about us drinking espresso

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.310
and just chilling
all the time, it's

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:53.250
hiding the suffering underneath.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.800
But playing the
piano, by contrast,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.661
is something that you
practice, you get better.

00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:00.410
And it feels good.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.626
It feels good because it's not
true for anything else we do.

00:35:03.626 --> 00:35:05.750
MARK LEVINSON: Actually,
that may be a nice lead-in

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:10.720
to-- don't do the very next
clip, but the clip after.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.906
Yep.

00:35:12.906 --> 00:35:14.176
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:14.176 --> 00:35:16.170
-Coffee is a very
serious business

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.630
in the life of a theorist.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.370
It's not like physics research
where you can wait for 30 years

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:27.365
before you know
if you are right.

00:35:27.365 --> 00:35:31.010
Within a few
minutes it pays off.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:35.170
If you succeed, it's great.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:40.170
If you fail, you get to try
another one in another minute.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:44.100
In particle physics,
you construct the theory

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.940
20 years ago, and it
may take that long

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.410
before you know if you're
on the right track.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:56.140
Jumping from failure to failure
with undiminished enthusiasm

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.561
is the big secret to success.

00:35:59.561 --> 00:36:03.330
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.340
MARK LEVINSON: So
I think that really

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.620
is sort of the key in many
ways to continuing in this.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.560
And the life of a
physicist, though,

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.580
is a very particular
mode in either case.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.350
And I think before we
open it to questions,

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.160
I just want to end
with a-- now go back

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:30.765
to the penultimate clip--
in terms of Monica.

everyone's like,
wow, that's awesome.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.086
You work for Google?

00:36:39.086 --> 00:36:41.520
And I'm on a plane and
I say, I'm a physicist.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.813
And people are like, yeah,
where's my reading material?

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.530
But thing is that I essentially
do, on a day to day basis,

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.960
the same thing that
people do at Google.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.650
I mean, I write huge
optimization algorithms,

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.550
you know?

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.146
I write programs.

00:37:01.146 --> 00:37:03.270
Actually, many physicists,
when they leave physics,

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.900
go to Google.

00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:08.140
On one hand, people
are like, Google, cool.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.478

you're just like, geek.

MARK LEVINSON: So I hope you
get a different appreciation

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.740
for people here.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.680
But I think at this point we'll
open it up to any questions

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.100
that anybody may have.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for coming in today.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.450
I had a comment on
the sociological issue

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.000
that you mentioned before.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.340
I would say that I'm of the
minority in that I would

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.920
appreciate tax
dollars being spent

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.060
on the pursuit of
pure knowledge,

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.660
and I would read up
on what you find,

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.620
and I would be in
that part of society.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.120
But the majority
would probably want

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.746
to see what's the
practical benefit that's

00:37:55.746 --> 00:37:56.870
going to come out all this?

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.310
So I wanted to ask you all
what are your thoughts on that.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.976
If we were going to
call our congressman

00:38:00.976 --> 00:38:03.250
and ask for more dollars to
be spent on your research,

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.875
what should we say?

00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:07.000
NIMA ARKANI-HAMED: Can I
say something about that.?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.410
So just so you have an idea
of the scale of the projects

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:14.400
that we're talking about, when
we say big accelerators cost

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:20.140
$10 billion, that's one part
in 10,000 of our GDP over 20

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.580
years.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.390
So it's a lot on the scale
of scientific projects,

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:31.450
but it's not back-breaking by
any stretch of the imagination.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.130
Now normally when this kind
of discussion comes up,

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:41.590
we talk very appropriately about
the completely unanticipated

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.520
consequences of
curiosity-driven basic research.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.240
Faraday, when he was famously
doing his experiments

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.510
on electromagnetism, some
minister came to see him

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.390
and asked exactly your
question, what is this good for.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.150
And he famously responded,
I don't know sir,

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.570
but someday you will tax it.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.370
And that was correct.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:06.420
It was 20, 30 years before
people knew about radio waves.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.320
Our entire technological
life is driven by that.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.470
People in the 1930s
were doing experiments

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.560
to try and understand
the detailed

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.540
properties of the hydrogen atom,
and strange mysteries about how

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.400
atoms can even work that led
to the development of quantum

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:20.980
mechanics.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.850
Now quantum mechanics,
in the year 1927,

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.877
was perhaps the most
esoteric branch of science.

00:39:27.877 --> 00:39:29.960
And relatively speaking,
the most esoteric branch,

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.043
probably, we've ever seen.

00:39:31.043 --> 00:39:34.180
There were maybe six people on
the planet who understood it.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.470
And yet, no one could have
foreseen that 30 years

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.770
after that our detailed
understanding of the quantum

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.720
properties of matter
would lead to revolutions

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.670
like the transistor.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.050
And again, by some
measures, 2/3 of our GDP

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.627
is directly consequence
of quantum mechanics.

00:39:49.627 --> 00:39:50.710
So people talk about that.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.418
It's very appropriate
to talk about that.

00:39:52.418 --> 00:39:54.930
And that's the most
fundamental reason to do this.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.340
We push boundaries,
and particularly

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.640
technological boundaries,
and in the process

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.900
of doing that,
inevitably you have

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.240
to bring so many people
together to solve

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.020
such difficult problems,
especially technical problems,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.250
that great things are
bound to come from it.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.820
Again, famously the World Wide
Web was developed at CERN.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.900
Originally as a method
to allow physicists

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.210
to share information
efficiently.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.650
And something
about scientists is

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:25.650
that we don't care about money.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.082
I mean, it may be
strange, but we really

00:40:28.082 --> 00:40:29.040
don't care about money.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.770
Anything we discover,
as part of our culture,

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.390
is something for the world.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.040
So all those things are true.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.130
If you want to be a super
hard-nosed, pragmatic,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.720
practical guy and
say, but come on,

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.620
in actual, quantifiable
dollars and cents,

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:49.030
what do I actually
get from investing

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.320
in literally your accelerator?

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.480
There was an interesting
study that was done.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.780
Not a study, but
sort of a half-study,

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.770
but I think fairly
plausible, that was

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:06.880
done about the impact of the big
accelerator we have in the US

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.240
outside Chicago that was
ultimately shut down.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.375
That's the sad end of
US high energy physics.

00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:19.430
At least our leadership in
this particular frontier.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:25.410
That accelerator cost around
$5 billion over its lifetime.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:33.090
And if you actually
look at, concretely,

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:37.220
the number of highly
trained PhD's,

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.150
for example, that
were trained by this.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.130
The US Census Bureau
gives dollar figure

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.400
to how much a PhD is worth.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.290
It's worth $2 million.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.870
So just the number of PhD's
that were trained already

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.180
made up for the
$5 billion spent.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:57.620
And then on top of that, the
infrastructure that was there

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.822
for developing
magnet technology,

00:41:59.822 --> 00:42:01.280
for developing
things that ended up

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.740
being useful for cloud
computing and so on.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.650
And those industries would
have succeeded anyway,

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.540
but even if you're very
conservative about just even

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.450
a mild speed-up to the
development of those

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:15.040
industries, you're
talking about $50 billion.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.460
It's a 10 to one return
on investment, easily.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.800
So by any measure, it's
one part in 10,000 of GDP,

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.740
it's a 400-year
tradition of pushing

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.000
the technical
boundaries of the world,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.290
and giving a
template for how you

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.760
go about solving seemingly
impossible problems.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:38.272
And even very directly, with
the technologies involved,

00:42:38.272 --> 00:42:40.600
a large return on investment.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.870
I think it's a no-brainer.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.777
But given that the
scale of money is large,

00:42:47.777 --> 00:42:49.360
this argument needs
to be made, and it

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.510
needs to be made clearly.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.259
MARK LEVINSON: And
everybody on this panel

00:42:52.259 --> 00:42:55.217
will be happy to elaborate
on it even further.

00:42:55.217 --> 00:42:55.800
Next question?

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.380
AUDIENCE: Over here, Mark.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.717
MARK LEVINSON: Oh, Jerry.

00:43:03.717 --> 00:43:05.300
AUDIENCE: A couple
questions if I may.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.580
Well, first of all,
was Enrico Fermi

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.290
unique as a highly accomplished
theorist as well as

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:17.290
experimentalist?

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:22.100
And if so, why don't we
have more such today?

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.830
And when theorists hang
out and talk shop together,

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.310
are they talking concepts?

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:34.230
Are they talking math
in a semi-pure sense?

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:38.180
Or are they just, I don't know,
bullshitting, brainstorming?

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.670
MARK LEVINSON: Well, let's
let the experimentalists talk

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.420
about Fermi.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.680
MONICA DUNFORD: So I'm a
huge admirer of Enrico Fermi.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.221
He was a great physicist, and
he was a great experimentalist,

00:43:47.221 --> 00:43:48.446
and a great theorist.

00:43:48.446 --> 00:43:50.820
MARK LEVINSON: Let me just
say Monica had an Enrico Fermi

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.810
scholarship.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:52.935
MONICA DUNFORD: Fellowship.

00:43:52.935 --> 00:43:54.647
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:54.647 --> 00:43:56.980
AUDIENCE: I had the privilege
of visiting a friend there

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.775
about 35 years ago.

00:43:58.775 --> 00:44:01.320
MONICA DUNFORD: OK.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.790
And I think the times
have changed a little.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:09.310
In Enrico Fermi's time, he could
do an experiment on the time

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.160
scale a few months to a year.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.710
And the difference
between the LHC

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.560
is that in order to reach
these energies that we need

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.690
to reach-- we're talking about
starting an accelerator in 1984

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.280
and having a turn on a 2009.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.990
And so this is kind
of, in that way,

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.430
forced specialization
into the experimental side

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.340
versus the theory side.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.420
But I think that this has really
been changing a lot now that we

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.600
do have data, and
we will have data

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.340
now for the next
couple of years.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.290
As the machine will continue
to deliver more and more data,

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.460
I think it will go back
more towards the sense

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.870
that experimentalists
and theorists will

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:51.210
be talking with each
other, and figuring out

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:55.140
what we should look for next,
how what we found or haven't

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.260
found fits into
theories, and so forth.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.970
So I think it's working
more towards how

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.400
it was in Enrico Fermi's time.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.560
But there's a phrase always
use in my group, which

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.250
is that if it was easy, it
would have been done already.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.240
So essentially, all
the things that you

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.230
could have done in two
months have been done.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.230
And now you've got to do
everything in 20 years.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.035
MARK LEVINSON: Savas?

00:45:19.035 --> 00:45:22.870
SAVAS DIMOPOULOS: So as
far as what we talk about,

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.240
we talk about all of the
things that you mentioned.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.500
But most of the time we talk
concepts, and equations,

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.410
and pictures.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:38.410
We mostly think-- at least
from my circle of friends

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.660
and myself-- in
terms of pictures

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.830
when it comes to solving
specific problems.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.010
Most of us rarely
think at the level

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.860
of equations, which is what the
public seems to think about.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.210
It's mostly in terms of
pictures and concepts.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:57.410
And the equations come near the
end to justify the pictures.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.520
And often they
justify, sometimes

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.180
they contradict the picture.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.500
But it's the final test.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.514
AUDIENCE: If I may, I've
just a punchline of a joke

00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:08.930
that I like that
no one else does.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.499
But I bet you guys will.

00:46:10.499 --> 00:46:11.790
And I'll just do the punchline.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.660
So a string theorist
is explaining

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.500
to is artist friend how
he understands things.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.910
And he says, I
just visualize it.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.690
And the artist says, how do you
visualize 11 dimensional space?

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:22.970
He says, simple.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.510
First I visualize n
dimensional space,

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.390
and then I let n be equal to 11.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:36.000
AUDIENCE: So the Higgs
boson was postulated

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.220
in the early-mid
'60s, and it took us

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.060
until a couple of years ago
to actually track it down.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.090
So why was that?

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.680
I can think of a
bunch of reasons

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.820
like money, like theory,
like building magnets,

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.230
the computation.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.546
And you're not allowed
to say all of the above.

00:46:53.546 --> 00:46:56.060
What were the long poles
and the constraints

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.780
in getting from there to here?

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.910
MARTIN ALESKA: Well, I
think the main reason was

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:08.200
that the Higgs has
its mass which it has.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.745
And that was not known, by the
way, when it was postulated.

00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:15.420
One would have thought that the
next generation of accelerators

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.640
might see the Higgs already.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.975
I mean, there are papers
where it's even below a GeV,

00:47:18.975 --> 00:47:19.520
and so on.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.230
It turns out to be 125 GeV.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:26.540
So it was clear that
such a heavy Higgs

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:31.160
boson needs a big machine,
which can actually be created.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.980
And we were a bit,
if you want, unlucky

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.130
because the LEP was
just on the edge.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.510
The previous
accelerator at CERN,

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:41.970
actually, was just on the edge.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:46.170
Or the Tevatron was just
a little bit too little.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.484
And then LHC got it.

00:47:47.484 --> 00:47:48.900
NIMA ARKANI-HAMED:
But we've known

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.100
something is going on
at roughly these energy

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.190
scales, or distance scales,
depending on how you count,

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.400
since 1895.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.950
So in 1895, people
discovered radioactivity.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.820
And you think about it, this
is a completely insane thing.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.900
You have a nucleus
that's sitting there--

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:09.960
or let's make it simple.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.980
You have a neutron.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.430
Take a neutron an empty space.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.320
It sits there for
15 minutes and then

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.670
it disintegrates into
a proton, an electron,

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:18.920
and something called an
antielectron neutrino.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:23.090
But anyway, 15 minutes is a
gargantuan, long, long, long,

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:27.040
long time scale compared to all
the time and distance scales

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.720
of atomic and nuclear physics.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.140
And we now understand
why it takes

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.750
so long is because
the physics that's

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:38.440
ultimately responsible for
making the neutron disintegrate

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.890
operates at distances there
are, in turn, 100 times

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.880
smaller than the nucleus itself.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:50.850
And so people indirectly
knew about this scale,

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:52.800
as I said, even in 1895.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.320
But we properly
understood the way

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.060
to conceptualize it already
by the '50s and '60s.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.090
And it wasn't until the
1980s that we actually

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:01.220
discovered the particles
responsible directly

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.640
for radioactivity.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.280
And then the fact that it's
another 20, 25 years after that

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:11.620
before we go another factor
of 1 and 1/2 higher in energy.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.534
Had the Higgs been down
there just a factor of two

00:49:14.534 --> 00:49:15.950
lighter than it
was, it would have

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.870
been discovered in the 1980s.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.960
But this is a
difficult business.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:28.670
And so every time you need
the next generation machine

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:31.260
to just push the energy
frontier a little bit,

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.090
you're talking about another
20 years' investment.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.880
So it actually makes perfect
sense that it took so long.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.870
AUDIENCE: I want to
argue that you shouldn't

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.340
stop at Particle Fever One.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.910
Where's Particle Fever Two?

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.475
The story is not over.

00:49:45.475 --> 00:49:47.440
Dark matter is not discovered.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.490
And there's the continuation
of the human story as well.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.320
The whole conversation about
the accreditation of Higgs.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.710
The dual award of
the Nobel Prize.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:00.586
More movies like this is good.

00:50:00.586 --> 00:50:02.460
MARK LEVINSON: Well
that's very good to hear.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:05.050
And just a commercial
plug, the film

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.220
opens today at the Film Forum.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:11.570
And so you can express your
enthusiasm for the film

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:12.960
and for future films.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.970
It's playful at the Film
Forum for a couple of weeks.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.480
It's opening in LA, it's
opening across the country.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.410
And obviously, I think
the greatest thing

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:27.710
is that people come out of the
film and they do want to know.

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:29.470
And I hope people
will follow it.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.330
Whether it turns
out to be a film,

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.530
and has all the drama
that this one had

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:37.380
is going to depend a lot of
these people sitting to my left

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.530
and what they find.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.960
But we will certainly be
keeping people updated.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:47.520
And I hope people come out of
the film, they want to know.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.010
After many of our screenings,
one of the first questions

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.450
is, have they found
anything else,

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:52.500
are they going to
find something else,

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.560
when are they going to
find something else,

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.680
and when's the sequel.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.050
And all of those are
very interrelated.

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.270
And we will see.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:03.340
And I think we're all extremely
pleased to have just tapped

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.060
into an audience that
really does want to know.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.926
And hopefully we'll be able
to provide the answers when

00:51:09.926 --> 00:51:11.050
the machine turns on again.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:15.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Jeff.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.090
I'm a fashion designer
and a creative director.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:20.980
So I couldn't be more layman
than anyone else in this room,

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.480
probably.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.850
But I'm very interested in
what you guys are doing.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:27.930
You mentioned that the current
LHC is under construction

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.760
and is being renovated
for double the power

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.390
in a couple of years.

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:36.550
Can you explain when that opens,
at best case scenario, if all

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:40.180
your dream scenarios came
true, when that thing reopened

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.640
what does that mean?

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.120
What could you compare
it to in world history?

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.830
Is it like
discovering the wheel,

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:51.270
or is it time travel, or
is it the World Wide Web?

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.020
What can you compare it to
that has happened in history

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:56.500
that this will be the outcome?

00:51:59.786 --> 00:52:01.910
SAVAS DIMOPOULOS: Since
I'm a professional dreamer,

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:06.640
I'll tell you my
best case scenario is

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.830
we discover new
dimensions of space.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.700
Instead of three
dimensions, maybe that

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.280
are 10 extra dimensions.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.790
Ten total dimensions
of space and time.

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:21.340
And we find that
these dimensions

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.830
are relatively large.

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:25.530
By large, I mean
a little smaller

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:29.200
than a millimeter, which is
really macros-- really big,

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.560
from the point of view
of the atomic nucleus.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:39.180
And this corresponds to finding
inside these new dimensions

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.590
there could be parallel
universes similar to ours,

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.770
or maybe with different
laws of nature.

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.860
Maybe there are
parallel universes

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.510
where the electron mass
is different than what

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.550
it is in our universe.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:56.320
And somehow this
can give us access.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.360
Finding these extra
dimensions creates

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.880
the space inside which
you can have new worlds.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.640
AUDIENCE: When is the last time
we discovered a new dimension?

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:13.300
SAVAS DIMOPOULOS: Well, in a
sense, time has been adopted.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.380
The most fruitful way to
think of time, it turns out,

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:20.880
is in a way that's democratic
with space and time.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.550
That there is some
close interconnection.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.520
And that was, in the early
part of last century,

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.920
early part of the 20th century,
this realization was made.

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.700
And it, in fact, stemmed
from Einstein's theory

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.040
of special relativity.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.360
That's the best way to
understand the theory.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.830
So that is the last time.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:41.640
What they would
draw a parallel with

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.300
is, perhaps, the discovery
of new continents.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.450
But this is a very
vague parallel.

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:48.400
It's really new worlds.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.440
You can fit many,
many parallel worlds

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.900
with even different
physical properties.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:59.430
And some particles, like what we
call the graviton, the particle

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.010
that is the cause
of gravity, can

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.230
travel inside these
extra dimensions

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:08.270
and somehow access these worlds.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:11.030
This is a theory
that, in fact, exists.

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:14.380
it's a theory that
Nima, Gia Dvali,

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.410
and I-- so there is
mathematics behind this.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:20.510
It's not just discussion.

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:22.260
DAVID KAPLAN: It could
be science fiction.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.426
Its rigorous, that's all.

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:25.634
NIMA ARKANI-HAMED: It's
(SHOUTED) science (WHISPERED)

00:54:25.634 --> 00:54:26.317
fiction.

00:54:26.317 --> 00:54:27.650
SAVAS DIMOPOULOS: There is math.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:33.020
So somewhere in the Platonic
world of mathematics,

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.100
this structure exists.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.390
Whether it is realized
in nature or not,

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:42.480
that's what people on the left
will decide, hopefully soon.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.680
And so that is probably
the wildest dream.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:50.010
And in fact, to underline
that it is science,

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:53.440
there have been tremendous
experimental constraints

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.510
that have already been set from
the first round off the LHC

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:01.290
on the size of these dimensions.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:02.510
That is the wildest thing.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.720
There are somewhat more
spectacular discoveries

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.680
that involve a theory
that's called supersymmetry.

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.700
That is a bit
harder to visualize,

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.630
but you can perhaps think of
it as a new dimension that

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:17.430
has weird properties.

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:21.980
So that would be my
number two scenario.

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.790
But I'm sure other
theoretical friends have--

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.864
DAVID KAPLAN: I think we should
let the experimentalists speak.

00:55:27.864 --> 00:55:29.280
FABIOLA GIANOTTI:
Well, going back

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.590
to the initial theme of
this discussion, difference

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:33.900
between theorists
and experimentalists,

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.050
you also realize the
theorists talk a lot,

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:38.960
and they're not shy at all.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:43.430
And we are much more
quiet, and more shy.

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:47.080
No seriously, I think what Savas
said is very nice, very good.

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:50.240
And for me, already to
discover the Higgs boson

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.320
was something quite special,
and really revolutionary.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.220
And I like to compare it
to the man on the moon.

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.650
Not only because of the
big jump in some sense,

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:06.770
in the kind of big jump
in our achievement,

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:08.160
accomplishment of mankind.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.570
But also because of all the
technology that is behind.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:13.480
The man on the moon is
not just going there

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.880
and putting a flag on the moon.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.090
It's all the technologies
that has required,

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:20.380
that has been developed
to achieve this step.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:25.959
And going back to the
discussion about why

00:56:25.959 --> 00:56:28.250
we are spending so much money
on fundamental knowledge,

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.360
of course there is
an important aspect

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.050
that in order, today,
to make step forward

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:35.960
in fundamental
knowledge, in some cases

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.500
you need a lot of technology.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:44.340
So we need technology to
advance fundamental knowledge,

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.050
and fundamental
knowledge, in turn,

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.960
allows you to improve
your technology.

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.170
So it's kind of
virtual and positive--

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:58.195
this draws a nice loop
between knowledge and science.

00:56:58.195 --> 00:57:01.660
MARK LEVINSON: Did we ever
get that last clip converted?

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:02.830
Excuse me?

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:03.850
No?

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.690
OK.

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:05.947
So you want to wrap it up.

00:57:05.947 --> 00:57:07.530
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
we should probably

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:09.300
wrap up, but thank you
so much for coming.

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.841
This was just
absolutely fascinating.

00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:12.808
And we're thrilled
that you came along.

00:57:12.808 --> 00:57:15.930
All the best for the premiere
tonight, and thank you.

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:17.890
MARK LEVINSON: Thank you.
