 all right 

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.150
 [Music] 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.950
 free brand is the platform of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 Largest e-commerce in Latin America 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.679
 with solutions for shipping payments 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.639
 credits and classified for all 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.000
 that operate through our 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.380
 platform we increased 75% the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.600
 downloads in the last year 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.300
 mainly for two reasons a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.220
 because we were adding many features 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 but I think the most important is that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
 we put a lot of effort into it and we put ourselves 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.750
 as an objective to reduce the weight of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.630
 our apps and recover the performance 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.880
 We have 65% of users with less than 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.610
 2 gigabytes of ram memory and approximately 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.750
 20% with less than 1 giga therefore 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.120
 our user base has 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.010
 very low range devices in your 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 majority and therefore we have to 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.050
 program our applications thinking 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.940
 in them that are the majority we launch the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.410
 Android version go first what 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.060
 we did was focus on the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.739
 tools that the 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.600
 Android platform being clicked on 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.360
 density and for architecture and try 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.759
 check what we do is eliminate 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.700
 all the code that is not needed to 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.619
 the app 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.420
 then we focus on the resources 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.820
 and the images the images the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.399
 we converted all to web and where we could 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.579
 and the code we took out all the bookstores 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.829
 externally that we did not need 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.649
 we managed to reduce 70% of the size of 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.829
 our app from 38 megs to 10 megabytes 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.450
 although this size is dynamic the low 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.880
 of weight of our application had 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.340
 incredible and immediate effects as well 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.399
 we upload this new version to the store in 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.380
 our facilities grew by 43 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.039
 hundred and our links all put 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.170
 18% which gave us 25 percent 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.569
 of growth in our are repeated are 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.640
 rate for us the experience of 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.590
 user is the most important when 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.270
 some user has a crash is not only 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.159
 one less operation but that is a 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.140
 user who is not happy with his 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.849
 experience with free market that's why it's 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.739
 that we look very closely at the information 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.390
 that provides us with white android als in what 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.939
 related to thanks to be able 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.289
 attack them by taking pictures throughout the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.539
 information that you provide us by such 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.789
 we can improve the god or ride retention 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.069
 lower them to Nestor lower the amount 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.850
 negative reviews and climb incredibly 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.010
 the positive ones 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.510
 the day we started to see android 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.700
 whitense in the app we detect that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.990
 we had a wake bloc that affects 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.750
 directly to the battery of the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.430
 quite high users and thanks to this 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.500
 we could solve it and in one case 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 particular that affected many 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.840
 users and we managed to lower the crash raid 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.760
 from point 3 percent to point 15% with 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.400
 Android white als we have a vision 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.620
 of the quality of the app in all 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.540
 moment the advice I would give to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.540
 any developer that is 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.180
 thinking about making some application for the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.950
 market as latin america that lends 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.710
 attention mainly to the weight of 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.200
 for download and installed and the 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.250
 app performance today android 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.440
 It has a lot of tools 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.210
 to be able to do that in a very 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.970
 easier and simple so it's at 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.489
 reach of all 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.489
