00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:08.540
What's a MacGuffin in Films and Why is It
Called That

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:17.029
In the last scene of the 1941 film classic,
The Maltese Falcon, Sam Spade (played by Humphrey

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.119
Bogart) hands over a murderer (played by Mary
Astor) and a black falcon statuette to authorities.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.569
When asked what the statuette was exactly,
Spade looks off in the distance and rather

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.839
unsatisfactorily explains, “It’s stuff
that dreams are made of.”

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.730
This black falcon statuette – the so-called
“Maltese Falcon” – is a perfect example

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:45.719
of what film connoisseurs call the “MacGuffin”
(or “McGuffin”), an important and oddly-named

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.829
plot device that appears in many movies.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.100
For the uninitiated, in a nutshell a “MacGuffin”
is an object, event, or person that the characters

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.060
in a story value greatly- so much so that
nearly the whole plot revolves around it,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.480
despite that the thing itself isn’t actually
terribly important to the actual unfolding

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.480
story.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.160
In the end, it really doesn’t matter what
the “thing” – or “MacGuffin” – is,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.410
only that it provides motivation for the characters
to push the actual story forward.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.800
As famed filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock explained
in an interview for the 1967 book Hitchcock

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.060
The main thing I’ve learned over the years
is that the MacGuffin is nothing.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.050
I’m convinced of this, but I find it very
difficult to prove it to others.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.850
My best MacGuffin, and by that I mean emptiest,
the most nonexistent, and the most absurd,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.380
is the one we used in North by Northwest.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.810
The picture is about espionage, and the only
question that’s raised in the story is to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.160
find out what the spies are after.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.520
Well, during the scene at the Chicago airport,
the Central Intelligence man explains the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.570
whole situation to Cary Grant, and Grant,
referring to the James Mason character, asks,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.110
‘What does he do?’

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.670
The counterintelligence man replies, “Let’s
just say that he’s an importer and exporter.”

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.620
“But what does he sell” “Oh, just government
secrets!” is the answer.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.580
Here you see the MacGuffin has been boiled
down to its purest expression: nothing at

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.580
all!

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.010
(It should be noted here that while Hitchcock
and in more modern times the likes of J.J.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.250
Abrams who frequently uses this “it doesn’t
matter what it is or what it does / nothing

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.780
at all” approach to MacGuffins in most of
his works- e.g. Rambaldi and his artifacts

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.150
in Alias or the Rabbit’s foot in Mission
Impossible III- other directors, such as George

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.950
Lucas, go the other way and feel that the
MacGuffin should be more defined and something

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.420
“the audience should care about… almost
as much as the dueling heroes and villains

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
on screen.”)

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.640
While the word “MacGuffin” comes from
relatively modern times (which we will get

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.250
into in a moment), the concept of it dates
back to some of the earliest masterpieces

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.410
of the written word.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.130
In Homer’s Iliad, which was first composed
almost 3,000 years ago, the MacGuffin was

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.830
Helen of Troy and her great beauty.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.120
Again, it could have been Helen of Troy’s
great sweet potato pie that led to the launching

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.480
of a thousand ships, as long as the story
made it clear why the characters were so intent

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.900
on having that pie.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.550
(Perhaps with the characters intrigued over
what exactly this then unknown food item of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.380
“potato” was, or maybe if the composer
wanted to be more explicit about its importance,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.450
stating it was made from a recipe given to
her by the gods, with those eating it said

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.060
to become immortal.)

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.020
This all brings us around to why the MacGuffin
is called that.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.490
Hitchcock, who is often credited as coining
the term though never claimed such himself,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.070
once explained he thought it may have come
from a common humorous story, with this particular

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.830
instance of his telling the story appearing
in the February 22, 1950 edition of the El

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.550
Paso Herald-Post:

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.770
There is a bloke on a train He sees a package,
and asked what it is.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.540
Man says it’s a McGuffin.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.510
Other man asks what is a McGuffin?

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.250
Other cove says a McGuffin is an apparatus
for trapping lions in the Adirondacks.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.610
‘But there are no lions in the Adirondacks,’
other bloke says.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.860
‘Then this thing is no McGuffin,’ second
lad says.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.590
This is a variant of similar stories with
a common message, such as this one published

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.600
in 1884 in Henry Irving’s Impressions of
America by Joseph Hatton (with the moral of

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.180
the story being the age old quip, “Ask me
no questions, and I’ll tell you no lies!”):

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.000
“Excuse me, sir; but would you mind telling
me what is in that extraordinary bundle?”

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.630
“Certainly, a mongoose,” replied the man.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.120
“Ah, indeed!” ejaculated the broker, with
unslacked curiosity.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.410
“But what is a mongoose, pray?”

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.290
“Something to kill snakes with.”

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.900
“But why do you wish to kill snakes with
a mongoose?” asked the broker.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.609
“My brother has the delirum tremens and
sees snakes all the time.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.150
I am going to fix ’em.”

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.479
“But, my dear sir, the snakes which your
brother sees in his delirium are not real

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.540
snakes, but the figments of his diseased imagination,
— not real snakes sir!”

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.419
“Well! this is not a real mongoose.”

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.500
As for who actually coined the term “MacGuffin,”
writer Angus MacPhail is often given credit

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.500
here.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.240
For instance, filmmaker Ivor Montagu worked
with Hitchock and MacPhail around the time

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.219
the term first started popping up; he claimed
in an article he wrote in 1980 on what it

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:50.909
was like to work with Hitchcock:

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.499
…sometimes the scenario editor Angus MacPhail,
my old schoolmate [would be there].

00:04:55.499 --> 00:05:00.259
It was Angus who established the term ‘MacGuffin’
for the unknown plot objective which you did

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.189
not need to choose until the story planning
was complete.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.979
(This convenient word Hitch gleefully adopted
and used to the end of his career.)

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.069
MacPhail was a studio writer, meaning he was
hired to “fix” scripts and most of the

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.819
time did not get the credit he deserved for
the task.

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:20.410
However, he became widely trusted by Hitchcock
(because he specialized in “scenario editing”)

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.810
and was often hired to help on the director’s
films, such as one of Hitchcock’s early

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.039
greats, The Thirty-Nine Steps, where it is
generally claimed MacPhail first came up with

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.050
the term.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.909
In the 1967 book Hitchcock, by Francois Truffaut,
Hitchcock explained the interesting evolution

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.309
of that particular MacGuffin and particularly
how it inspired them to go from something

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:45.159
important to “nothing at all,” which became
a hallmark of his MacGuffins:

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.610
in The Thirty-nine Steps, what are the spies
after?

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.819
The man with the missing finger?

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.150
And that woman at the beginning, was she on
to some big secret?

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.969
Is it because she was getting close to the
truth that it became necessary to stab her

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:56.970
in the back?

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.110
In the early stages of the construction, we
felt, and we were all wrong, that since life

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.289
and death were involved, the pretext had to
be a very important one.

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.180
In our first draft, when Robert Donat arrives
in Scotland, he picks up some additional information

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.599
on his way to the spy’s house, possibly
by following the spy.

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.689
He rides to the top of the hill, and looking
down, he sees underground plane hangars carved

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.280
into the side of the mountain, secret hangars,
which made the planes safe from bombings.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.699
Our original idea was that this MacGuffin
should be something big and pictorially striking.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.889
Then we went on to work it out in our minds:
What does Donat do upon discovering these

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:33.889
secret hangars?

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.040
Will he send off a message to report their
locations?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.580
And in that case, what counter steps would
the spies take?

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.439
[One option was to blow it up].

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.969
But how were we going to have them blow up
a whole mountain?

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.710
Anyway, whenever we found ourselves getting
terribly involved in this way, we would drop

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.639
the idea for something very simple…

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.389
If MacPhail did indeed coin the term, it’s
unclear today how he came up with it.

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.969
According to some sources, MacPhail himself
used to say he borrowed it from the aforementioned

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:02.839
story of the two men on the train, but I could
not track down any such instance of MacPhail

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:07.389
ever stating anything of the sort, and none
of the sources who claim this back up the

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.050
claim with any primary text.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.409
Some have alternatively speculated it alludes
to that the word “guff,” which is defined

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:13.550
as meaning “nonsense.”

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.300
It also once meant “stupid” or “clumsy”
person.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.839
So, perhaps MacPhail took the first part of
his last name and put the word “guff”

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:23.259
behind it, creating a whole new term (that
was named loosely after him) for story telling

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:24.259
nonsense or a “stupid” element of the
story.

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.970
(It should also be noted that in 1926, almost
a decade before The Thirty-Nine Steps, one

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.860
Robert Haven Schauffler states in the journal,
The Writer, that “McGuffin” is a word

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.469
for a gift that is not opened until Christmas.

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:40.330
However, this is the only known time this
word/name was applied to such and it’s unclear

00:07:40.330 --> 00:08:15.019
whether there is any connection here or not.)
