now a lot of you shows like gravity

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:58.460
now a lot of you shows like gravity
 

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.190

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840
now because they're big hit they're
 

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.440
now because they're big hit they're
starting off having those simple designs

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:05.450
starting off having those simple designs
 

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.870
starting off having those simple designs
but putting more focus in like kind of a

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880
but putting more focus in like kind of a
 

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.000
but putting more focus in like kind of a
color and the stories and the characters

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.190
simple designs are not you know what is
 

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.250
simple designs are not you know what is
not very strong yeah it's a stylistic

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:15.260
not very strong yeah it's a stylistic
 

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.890
not very strong yeah it's a stylistic
choice but but it always is money

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:17.900
choice but but it always is money
 

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.730
choice but but it always is money
yeah well it's funny because it reminds

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:21.740
yeah well it's funny because it reminds
 

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.529
yeah well it's funny because it reminds
me of some of the stuff we grew up with

00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:23.539
me of some of the stuff we grew up with
 

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:26.919
me of some of the stuff we grew up with
as little kids like ones but yeah like

00:27:26.919 --> 00:27:26.929
as little kids like ones but yeah like
 

00:27:26.929 --> 00:27:28.840
as little kids like ones but yeah like
the old hanna-barbera stuff for the

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:28.850
the old hanna-barbera stuff for the
 

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.500
the old hanna-barbera stuff for the
laff-a-lympics you know but it it's so

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:32.510
laff-a-lympics you know but it it's so
 

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.210
laff-a-lympics you know but it it's so
much cleaner and Chris I mean you can

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:34.220
much cleaner and Chris I mean you can
 

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.029
much cleaner and Chris I mean you can
tell there's actual money behind it

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039
tell there's actual money behind it
 

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:38.249
tell there's actual money behind it
literally a stylistic choice well but it

00:27:38.249 --> 00:27:38.259
literally a stylistic choice well but it
 

00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:42.269
literally a stylistic choice well but it
I think there is also saving like on set

00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279
I think there is also saving like on set
 

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:44.099
I think there is also saving like on set
you know it's like some shortcuts with

00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:44.109
you know it's like some shortcuts with
 

00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:46.499
you know it's like some shortcuts with
that too oh I agree you know cuz it's

00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:46.509
that too oh I agree you know cuz it's
 

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:47.879
that too oh I agree you know cuz it's
like hey if we can draw these characters

00:27:47.879 --> 00:27:47.889
like hey if we can draw these characters
 

00:27:47.889 --> 00:27:50.310
like hey if we can draw these characters
really and easily agree but you'll go at

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320
really and easily agree but you'll go at
 

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.649
really and easily agree but you'll go at
something like the cartoons we grew up

00:27:52.649 --> 00:27:52.659
something like the cartoons we grew up
 

00:27:52.659 --> 00:27:55.259
something like the cartoons we grew up
with where you know you can see the

00:27:55.259 --> 00:27:55.269
with where you know you can see the
 

00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:57.840
with where you know you can see the
sketch lines you can they're their

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:57.850
sketch lines you can they're their
 

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.460
sketch lines you can they're their
mistakes left and right I mean someone

00:27:59.460 --> 00:27:59.470
mistakes left and right I mean someone
 

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.019
mistakes left and right I mean someone
is cuz everything's gone to digital now

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:01.029
is cuz everything's gone to digital now
 

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:03.869
is cuz everything's gone to digital now
so but when you look at the difference

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:03.879
so but when you look at the difference
 

00:28:03.879 --> 00:28:05.249
so but when you look at the difference
between the grittiness of what we grew

00:28:05.249 --> 00:28:05.259
between the grittiness of what we grew
 

00:28:05.259 --> 00:28:06.690
between the grittiness of what we grew
up with versus what you have now I mean

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:06.700
up with versus what you have now I mean
 

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.919
up with versus what you have now I mean
what you've got now even when they're

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:07.929
what you've got now even when they're
 

00:28:07.929 --> 00:28:10.229
what you've got now even when they're
saving money is still a thousand times

00:28:10.229 --> 00:28:10.239
saving money is still a thousand times
 

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:12.450
saving money is still a thousand times
cleaner crisper and one and what's we

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:12.460
cleaner crisper and one and what's we
 

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.460
cleaner crisper and one and what's we
ever had growing up what's so funny

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:14.470
ever had growing up what's so funny
 

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.109
ever had growing up what's so funny
though is that I think back then they

00:28:16.109 --> 00:28:16.119
though is that I think back then they
 

00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:17.339
though is that I think back then they
had to design you because they were

00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:17.349
had to design you because they were
 

00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:18.930
had to design you because they were
coming off of like Bugs Bunny and Mickey

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:18.940
coming off of like Bugs Bunny and Mickey
 

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.879
coming off of like Bugs Bunny and Mickey
Mouse and so so when they're doing you

00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:20.889
Mouse and so so when they're doing you
 

00:28:20.889 --> 00:28:22.049
Mouse and so so when they're doing you
know and even Tom and Jerry so well

00:28:22.049 --> 00:28:22.059
know and even Tom and Jerry so well
 

00:28:22.059 --> 00:28:23.549
know and even Tom and Jerry so well
they're doing something like Jetsons or

00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559
they're doing something like Jetsons or
 

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:24.810
they're doing something like Jetsons or
Flintstones are these shows they're

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:24.820
Flintstones are these shows they're
 

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.580

trying to save money by cutting corners

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:26.590
trying to save money by cutting corners
 

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.979
trying to save money by cutting corners
and back then very cleverly but they

00:28:28.979 --> 00:28:28.989
and back then very cleverly but they
 

00:28:28.989 --> 00:28:30.389
and back then very cleverly but they
still had to have really good designs

00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399
still had to have really good designs
 

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:32.159
still had to have really good designs
and those designs take a while to draw

00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:32.169
and those designs take a while to draw
 

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:33.989
and those designs take a while to draw
you know and it's still for a lot of

00:28:33.989 --> 00:28:33.999
you know and it's still for a lot of
 

00:28:33.999 --> 00:28:35.430
you know and it's still for a lot of
people it's hard to draw you know Fred

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440
people it's hard to draw you know Fred
 

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.839

because it just shows this is a way to
 

00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:51.239
because it just shows this is a way to
work around it to dance around it but

00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:51.249
work around it to dance around it but
 

00:28:51.249 --> 00:28:54.149
