00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.940
Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.530
I'm Donna Griffit and I'm
a corporate storyteller,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.800
which basically means
that for the past decade,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.170
I've roamed the globe helping
people get their story straight

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.730
and sound great telling
it, taking boring data

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.200
and kind of turning it
into exciting presentations

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.360
and documents that really
people understand and get

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.220
the results you're driving for.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.884
I've helped startups raise
tens of millions of dollars,

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:30.550
and there's nothing
more exciting for me

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.890
than helping them get to
the core of their story

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.210
and really get their results.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.880
Today, we're going to talk
about a demo day pitch.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.390
Now, there's a big difference
between an investor

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.020
pitch and a demo day pitch.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.330
When it's demo day, you
have about five minutes,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.310
give or take, to really wow
your audience, put on a show,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.364
and be a rock star.

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.030
You're up against a
lot of other people,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.660
and you want to be memorable.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.470
So we're going to talk about
the content and the delivery

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.660
of a demo day pitch to kind of
get you ready for your big day.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.370
We're not attempting to tell
the entire story of our startup.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.180
There's just no way to
do that in five minutes.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.400
We want to intrigue them.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.770
We want to kind of get into
their mind, get them excited,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.105
and get the next meeting.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:12.980
So where do we start?

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.020
Well, obviously, you want
to introduce yourself.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.540
But there's really no need
to go too long into that.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.000
So say who you are.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.100
And if you had any
big achievements

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.754
or any big traction-- you
already have customers,

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:26.420
you have downloads,
something exciting--

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.090
you've won a prize maybe--
you can go ahead and say that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.040
at the beginning.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.640
Quickly as possible, you
want to get to the pain.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.300
You want people to
actually feel, ouch,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.000
there's a real problem out there
that you're going to solve.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.100
But before you can talk
about your solution,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.350
you need to get them very
clear on the fact that there

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.980
is a problem.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.350
There is a gap.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.370
So talk about the need.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.510
Talk about the challenge.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.410
Talk about the gap out there,
the missed opportunity.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.610
So it could either be
pain, or it can be, ah!

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.610
Hallelujah!

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.660
We've seen the light!

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.700
There's something that your
audience is like, oh gosh,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.325
I can't believe I
didn't think of that.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:01.420
We want that right now.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.310
And either one of those
gets them excited.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.080
It's kind of at the beginning
of an action adventure film

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.620
where you meet the villain at
the beginning or a villainous

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.282
act-- an explosion, a
kidnapping, a murder-- and it

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:13.740
keeps you on the
edge of your seat.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.680
That's what you want.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.100
So less than a minute
is devoted to that.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.290
Then you can talk
about your solution.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.190
Now, this is not
the place to get

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.380
too technical and
too detail-oriented.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.250
You want to be
able to say what it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.940
is that you do in
very simple language.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.320
We do X for Y by Z-- so
as simple as you can.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.480
And then as quickly as possible,
move on to an impressive demo.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.630
You can stand talking about
your solution for an hour,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.720
or you can show a
minute long demo.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.100
And what do you think is
going to be more impressive?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.350
Obviously the demo.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.764
So prepare a little short film,
some screenshots, even reenact

00:02:55.764 --> 00:02:57.180
something there--
anything that it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.670
takes to really get them to see.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.500
And remember, do your demo
from a first-time user's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.050
perspective.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.870
They've never seen
your product before.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.800
So they want to understand what
the process of going through it

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.820
is.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.180
So really give them-- get
them excited about that.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.790
Let them see how
good it'll look.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.270
Now that they know
about the problem

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.410
you're solving and
about your solution,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.410
it's time to talk a little
bit about the market.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.207
Now, in a five
minute presentation,

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:24.790
there's no way that
you're going to be

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.400
able to hit what you would
in an entire business

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.170
presentation to an investor.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.410
So there's three main things
that I'd like you to hit.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.630
One, differentiation.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.460
How do you really stand
out from your competitors?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.960
Now, it's fine to
have competitors.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.300
It's good to have competitors.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.580
It means that somebody
has recognized the need

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.440
and they have users.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.365
And we never, ever want
to say something bad

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:47.740
about our competitors
because you

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.380
don't know who might be in the
room that's invested in them

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.830
or that knows
somebody on the team.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.160
So we always will say, like,
my competitors are doing X

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.100
and what we do is X,
Y, and Z. How cool!

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.216
So you're adding to
it and you're really

00:04:02.216 --> 00:04:03.840
showing that you've
done your homework,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.550
you know your
competitive landscape,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.080
and you know what sets
you apart from the noise.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.920
Then we want to talk about
how we're going to make money.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.720
You're not just here
to impress people.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.550
You're here to show them
that if they invest in you,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.258
they will definitely
make a return on it.

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:19.269
So you want to talk
about the business model.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.570
Now, people at this point
of an early stage startup

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.519
don't necessarily know
the business model

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:26.060
that they're going
to eventually use.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.582
So it's OK not to be 100% sure.

00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:30.290
But you could do a
little bit of homework

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.030
and see what the best fit is.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.220
Is it freemium?

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.860
Is it ad based?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.260
Is it a marketplace?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.920
Is it a rev share?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.980
Whenever you think
fits your product most.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.520
And you can kind of talk
about a subscription,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.090
how much you'd be charging.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.565
No need to go into
big projections

00:04:45.565 --> 00:04:47.190
of how much money
you're going to make.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.040
It sounds a little bit
silly at this point

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.450
to start going off on that.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.850
So just keep it very simple.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.779
Finally, we want to touch
on the opportunitization.

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.195
It sounds better
with monetization

00:04:57.195 --> 00:04:58.840
and differentiation.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.700
So go with me on this.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.500
We want to touch on the market.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.320
What is the market
you're addressing?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.370
Now, it's not just the
addressable market.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.980
It's not just, oh my gosh,
this is a billion market

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.780
with billions of users.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.580
We want to talk about
what's really unique here.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.940
What's happening now?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.170
What's the opportunity?

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.420
What's shifted in
the technologies?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.320
What's shifted in the economy?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.840
What's shifted with users that
really makes you something

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.610
that they need?

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.150
Have there been any mergers
or acquisitions in your field?

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.680
Have people been invested
in your competitors?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.510
Something that really proves,
hey, there's a need for this.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.630
We need to jump
on this bandwagon

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.490
and you need to invest
in us to help us do it.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.180
So there you go.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.055
There's the business.

00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:42.700
Now it's time to circle back.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.780
And you can talk about the team.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.240
Now, this is not
the time where you

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.827
want to read everybody's CVs.

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:50.410
It's really nice that you want
to give your team their credit.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.250
But again, you only
have five minutes.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.770
Keep reminding yourself of that.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.220
So you can just say,
our team is made up

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.710
of technical and business
and marketing and design.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.136
And we all have what it takes
to really make this happen.

00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:05.010
And if you have somebody
with special skills,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.250
you can point that out.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.830
But you're trying to establish
credibility and likeability so

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.810
that they see a team that really
has the chops and someone that

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.060
looks like a really nice
bunch of people to work with.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.290
Because remember, once
they've invested in you,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.850
it's kind of like a marriage.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.910
They're going to come to
all your family events

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.860
and they're going
to kind of be there

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.780
in the background,
the kind of rich uncle

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.120
that's sitting there
making the calls.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.585
So they want to know that you're
a good person to be married to.

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:31.820
All right, now that we've
got the content down,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.960
let's talk about your slides.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.070
It's impossible for you to have
a really great looking product

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.470
and shoddy looking slides.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.230
There's just absolutely
no excuse for that.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.010
Your slides are
your business card.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.926
It's the first thing
that they're going to see

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:46.800
and you want them to
look as great as you do

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.090
and your product does.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.369
There's a lot of
online products that'll

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:51.910
help you make your
slides look better

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.590
that don't cost a lot of money.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.170
If you have a
designer on your team,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.250
hey, let them take the slides
and work some magic on them.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.650
Now, your delivery
itself-- this is not

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.020
the time to be a wallflower.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.450
This is not the time to
say, well, I'm not an actor.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.920
I'm a little bit shy.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.390
That has to go away.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.290
You need to be at your best.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.580
You need to be memorable.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.520
You need to really
make this happen.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.850
And if you yourself are not
the best presenter, then

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.280
maybe you want to think about
asking one of the team members

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.861
that are really great presenter
that has great presence onstage

00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:24.110
and really make them remember.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.318
You have to sound passionate.

00:07:25.318 --> 00:07:27.090
You can't stand there
saying, oh, well, we

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.840
have a great product
and then expect

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.150
people to get excited about it.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.480
That doesn't exactly work.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.880
So get up there and
give it your all.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.670
And as a last point
for today, you

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.200
want to walk in the
room at your best.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.950
This is the first time
they're seeing you.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.207
As far as they're concerned,
what they see is what they get.

00:07:44.207 --> 00:07:46.540
They don't know that you only
slept two hours last night

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.170
because you had a big bug
that you were solving.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.320
And they don't know that you
sat in traffic for two hours.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.695
And they don't
know that you just

00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:53.320
had a big fight
with your partner.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.590
All they see is you.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.560
And you want to be at your best.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.950
You want to be at your
friendliest, at your perkiest.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.770
You want them to
see, this is a person

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.690
that I want to invest
in for the long run.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.206
Good luck to everybody.

00:08:05.206 --> 00:08:07.080

I can do to help you,

meet in the future.

Thanks.
