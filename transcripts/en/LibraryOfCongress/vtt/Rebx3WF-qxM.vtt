&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon ladies and
gentlemen and welcome to the African

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.670
and Middle East Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.610
Today's lecture on Muslimism
and Turkey and Beyond,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.110
Religion in the Modern World
by Neslihan Cevik is sponsored

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.020
by the near East section of the
African and Middle East division.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.010
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the near East section.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.820
On behalf of all my colleagues

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.600
and in particular Dr. Mary Jane
Deech, chief of the division.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.350
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.620
Before we start today's program I'd
like to give you a brief overview

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.600
of the division and its resources
in the hopes that you'll come back

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.810
and use our collections
for your research.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.330
This division is comprised
of three sections that build

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.430
and serve collections to the
researchers from around the world.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.190
We cover over 78 countries
for more than 35 languages.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.740
The African section
includes the countries

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.630
in all of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.290 position:56%
The Hebraic section is responsible
for tuderica and Hebraica worldwide.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.280
And the near East section covers
all of the Arab countries,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.650
including North Africa, Turkey,
Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.360
the Muslims in western China,
Russia, and the Balkans,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.300
and the people of the Caucasus.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.750
So you can see we're very busy.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.080
After the program we like to invite
you to fill in the evaluation forms

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.590
that we've left in your
seats and leave them

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.790
at the information desk
at the back of the room.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.610 position:56%
And we are videotaping and recording
this presentation, so we invite you

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.650
to ask questions, but please know

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.130
that you're providing your
permission to be recorded.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.150
Now, I would like to introduce
our speaker, Dr. Neslihan Cevik.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.020
She is an associate fellow at the
Institute for Advanced Studies

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.970

of Virginia.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.400
Currently Dr. Cevik is leading the
project on the deradicalization

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.690
and fight against violent
extremism at the organization

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.380
of Islamic cooperation, the OIC.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.490

into Arabic, French, and Turkish.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.010 position:56%
Dr. Cevik helped found the first
postcolonial studies research center

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.670

Please help welcome Dr.
Cevik to the podium.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.050
[ Clapping ]

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you Dawn for this lovely
introduction and thank you Mary Jane

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.080
and John for inviting me here.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.640
This is a mesmerizing,
very beautiful building,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.690
so and thank you each and every
one of you for coming here today.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.020
So I should put my
presentation up, okay.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.770
Slide show, okay, so
I'm going to start --

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.190
I will start by raising
a very old question.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.300
A question that was actually
central to the development

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.110
of sociology and social theory.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.920
So what happens to religion
in the modern world?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.760
How do religions response
to modernity?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.440
And for centuries the answer
read along a very binary track,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.270
so in their responses to
modernity religions were expected

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.680
to either reject it, and that's
what we call fundamentalism,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.990
to preserve the tradition or they
would secularize the tradition

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.680 position:56%
and accommodate modernity and that's
what we call liberal religion.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.250
And even though this binary
track was mostly based

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.840
on the Christian experience,
it's also applied to Islam,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.510
but when it's applied to Islam it's
a little bit modified given the

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.960
perception of Islam as a
special religion, which is --

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.340
that Islam is intrinsically
anti-modern

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.100
and intrinsically secularization
resistant.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.600
So given this the divide
and modifies into the idea

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.540
that Islam gears towards
rejection of modernity

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.000
and Islamic fundamentalism
or Islamic rejection

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.530
of modernity itself is geared
towards politically takeover

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.000
of the state.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.260
So accordingly then if Islam is

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.530
to engage modernity it
must loosen orthodoxy more

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.440
than any other religion while
also making a cultural turn.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.940
So that also created yet another
divide, cultural versus political.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.680
And this kind of framework,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.680
this kind of abstract framework
crystallized into the concept

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.050
of moderate Islam more
recently and turkey is picked

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.440
as the most prominent
candidates for it.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.000
And the concept has been helpful
to some extent in communicating

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.150
that Islam needs not
to reject modernity,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.010
but actually can engage it.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.850
But there are various problems
with the concept moderate Islam.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.630
First of all, it reinforces
the divide of fundamentalist

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.210
versus a liberal religion, because
radical moderation of Islam happens

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.760
through the pacification
of its radical aspects.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.040
So meaning that the practice of
moderate is something less Islamic

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.290
and more liberal than the norm.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.410
So apparently this marginalizes
any deeply held religion

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.110
and it simply has religion
actually must be fundamentalist.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.370
Also another problem with the
term is that the conditions

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.630
for moderate Islam
is constantly being

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.480
or at least mostly is being looked

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.900
out from outside, rather
than from within.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.870
And most interpretations
rely on political expediency

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.140
and political actors in trying to
understand how moderation happens.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.920
But there's a serious
problem with that

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.110
because party failure is
then seen as Islam's failure

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.170 position:56%
in engaging modernity and the Arab
spring was probably the epic example

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.470
of that.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.290
The cultural sentiments
that could not translate

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.880
into political change were
that interpreted again,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.640
yet again as Islam's failure

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.830
into engaging modern
life and institutions.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.200
But most importantly the concept
of moderate Islam prevents us

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.290
from seeing the empirical
complexities of religion in Turkey,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:41.030
but also about more broadly
Islam's engagements of modernity.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.320
So in my book, "Looking at Post
80's Islamic Transformation

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.610
of Islamic Identity in
Turkey," I argued that's rather

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.190
than normatively or
generically defining what's going

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.390
on as moderate Islam, what
we're witnessing is the rise

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.300
of any religious form, indeed
in your religious orthodoxy.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.060
And when I say "in orthodoxy,"
I don't mean the separation

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.580
between orthodoxy of an
orthopractic religions.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.690
I simply denote a commitment
to the super empirical,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.520
but this orthodoxy is new

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.240
because it's neither fundamentalist
rejection of modernity,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.840
nor liberal submission to it.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.010
Indeed within the Turkish context
I call this new form Muslimism

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.170
and I argue that this new form
embraces aspects of modern life,

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.820
while submitting that life to
a sacred moral order generating

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.090
as such hybrid institutions,
discourses and lifestyles

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.640
and we will kind of
unpack these as we go.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.670
Now, why the term "Muslimism"?

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.760
First of all, this new form looking

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.840
at a liberal nor fundamentalist
required a new category.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.590
Normally, you know, Islamism
is used as a term is used

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.590
as an umbrella term to define
any Islamic movement that kind

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.100
of promotes Islam,
whether in public policy

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.440
or true politics or
in everyday life.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.210
But even if it's being used

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.990
as an umbrella term,
it's not a neutral term.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.490
I mean, it has a very
specific [inaudible] baggage

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.860
that it brings with it.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.130
So and other scholars too looking
at the world has recognized

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:18.820
that since the 1990's and
'80s Islamic movements started

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.540
to look not like the
typical Islamism.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.620
And so they looked for
alternative concepts.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.880 position:56%
Moderate Islam was one of them plus
Islamism, Muslim hood, neo-Islamism,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.810
but I think what we find in
Turkey requires a very clear break

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.500
from the concept of Islamism,
so that's the first reason

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.600
that I wanted to term
this with a new label.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.110
Also I wanted this term

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.410
to communicate the
content of this new form.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.350
Now, so one key element of
this new form that its hybrid.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.790
It doesn't reject nor submits,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.460
but it creates hybrid
institutions and practices.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.730
And the other key element is
that it's individual orientation.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.870
So basically the question
Muslims must ask is,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.580
"How do I conduct a pious life
while taking part in modernity?"

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.210
And so there neither state
oriented nor society oriented.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.750
The goal isn't Islamization
of the state from top-down

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.270
or nor it is Islamization
of the community bottom

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.220
up to eventually create
an Islamic state.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.050
And this is not individualism.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.350
I found something even more
interesting in the field

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.210
that this was actually filtered
through geological concepts,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.890
particularly Iman and Tahqiq.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.400
We're going to talk about those
in detail later, but it's suffice

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.110
for now just to quickly define,
Iman simply means to volunteer

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.930
in a heartfelt choice
its religious conviction.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.250
And Tahqiq is a conscious choice .

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.710
Again, I'll unpack these later.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.090
So even though Muslimism
is not a formal movement,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.910
and it's not ideological,
it still is an ism.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.550 position:56%
For one, it capitalizes and promotes
a particular reading of Islam

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.780
and it promotes this
reading again Islamism

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.130
and against liberal conceptions

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.660
and against actually
traditional conceptions.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.070
And although it's not state
centered, its politically engaged.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.410
It gets linked to party politics

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.230
and it has created a very
certain political ethos.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.890
So before I detail the
content of this new form,

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.490
I want to briefly talk about the
conditions and open questions.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.790
We can unpack these.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.230
I'm going to go through
this kinda quickly.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.570
So this new form is rooted in the
1980s neo-liberalizing policies.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.510 position:56%
This was a neo-liberalization in
Turkey was more than economic shift,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.050
it actually created a favorable
atmosphere for religious change

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.500
and for the emergence of
alternative religious expressions.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.160
First of all, it undermined
statism across spheres of society,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.730
so an economy and culture
in social reproduction.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.820
And this allowed for a new economic
and political opportunity spaces

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.380
for Muslim mobilization and
those segments he [inaudible]

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.940
to until the 1980's
were marginalized,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.740
both from economic production and
social and political production.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.950
And other scholars
have recognized this,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.200 position:56%
but what's kinda often overlooked is
that new liberalization also brought

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.070
with it a new social
accounting of modernity.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.120
With the secular state
modernity so far

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.830
until the 1980s were defined
along secularist conceptions,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.690
whether your hijab or not,
whether you're religious or not,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.750
corporatism, statism, but with the
new liberal order new conceptions

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.270
started to enter into social
accounting of modernity,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:29.390
like individual rights, pluralism,
globalization, entrepreneurship.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.960 position:56%
And so these two kinda like low
modernity and high modernity started

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.500
to compete with each other
and that was very important

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.980
because it seriously taunt down the
anti Islam concept of or rhetorical

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.900
for modernity that was generated
by the camelists, the secular state

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.030
and it allowed the Muslim
populations, the devout populations

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.700
to reconsider aspects of modernity
and to reconsider engagements,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.330
their engagements with modernity.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.450
And all of that also worked to
weaken Islamists establishments,

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.960
because in Turkey Islamism has
emerged in the mirror image

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.290
of the secularist state
that defined modernity,

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.290
that define national progress,
that defined individual progress

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.590
in the opposite of Islam.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.230
So basically it created
a sound forbidden modern,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.670
but with the new liberalization
the conditions

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.010 position:56%
that generated Islamism got weakened

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.770 position:56%
and as a result Islamism is a
discourse started to lose its appeal

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.390
and economic and cultural
and political relevance.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.880
And the international
aspects are also conducive

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.140
for derisive Muslimism.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.230
They were coupled with
the domestic conditions.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.080
Let's go through this.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.970
So new liberalization also
created the agents of Muslimism

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.250
and it created more
specifically a Muslim city group

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.300
and this group is composed of
people coming from, you know,

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.430
spheres of society, veiled
university students, professionals,

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.970
technocrats, entrepreneurs,
civil activists and so forth.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.550
And they're educated,
urbanized and upwardly mobile

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.100
and they used the universal
language of rights

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.640
than globalization and so forth.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.280
So they're not marginal to
modern life, but they were all

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.780
of the integrated into modern life
while seeking a higher control

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.080
over it.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.510
And this new Muslim city group
engaged modern contemporary life

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:22.270
by using Islam creating what I call
the cultural sites of hybridity,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.560
which is where, you know,
the Muslims form emerges.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.690
Now the Muslims -- the cultural
size of hybridity first emerged

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.120
in the markets in the form
of business situations

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.020
that engaged aspect of capitalism
while trying to inject moral codes

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.670
or morally regulate capitalism,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.220
but it also included some
really controversial sides,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.750
such as Islamic passion.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.080
Although, rather than fashion I
prefer to call it personalization

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.180
of aesthetics of the
hijab, but we're going

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.740
to talk about that later.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.320
They're also emerge Islamic
vacations and hotels.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.420
The picture to my right probably
is to your left all the way

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.810
to the left, it's a picture
from the first Islamic hotel

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.250
that was open in Turkey
back in 1990.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:12.990
It's a pool for women only, so
but beyond markets the sites

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.890
of hybridity also included
character education schools

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.830
that emphasized inner discipline
and character over orthopraxy.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.270
It included human rights
associations who defined rights

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.180
in reference to both
to UN convention

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.060 position:56%
and the Medina Certificate the
farewell speech of Prophet Mohammed.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.760 position:56%
It included women's rights
organizations who claim at religious

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.550
and Islamic identity, but
also a democrat identity.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.080
And it wasn't only the
cultural arena that we

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.640
so decides emerging the Muslim
city group is also articulated

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.450
in the political ethos, which
sees Islamic and modern values not

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.320
to be incommensurable, but actually
complementing towards each other.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.760 position:56%
And in particular again, we're going
to talk about this, but the concepts

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.780
of Iman and Tahqiq within the
Muslimists discourse leads the

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.100
Muslim is to define the state
with a liberal framework

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.100
and we're going to
talk about that more.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.900
And in addition to the political
ethos Muslimists get linked

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.920
to party politics to
bring about this ethos,

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.680
so this isn't just
the cultural movement.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.970
I mean, it engages politics and
it has political consequences.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.250
But for markets to the political
era now, what we see happening

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.020
in cultural sites of hybridity is

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.850
that these are sites
of identity production.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.660
They resist the hegemony of the
secular state on defining modernity

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.690
and how to be modern, and they
resist the hegemony of Islamism

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.960
on defining true religion
and who is a good Muslim.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.950
More broadly they defined
modernity to be guilt free,

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.130
so modernity is no
longer reduced to some

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.630
of evil effects destroying
the Muslim consignees

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.310
and Islamic sensibilities.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.670
For example, you can have a
pluralistic public sphere,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.380
but you can still have
faithful individuals.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.340
And they also redefined
Islam to be on --

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.740
not redefined, but revitalized
faith to be unapologetic.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.950
One can be faithful and still
promote a pluralistic public sphere

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.080
or dress like Grace Kelly
as long as you know she is

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.940
within the boundaries
of the orthodoxy.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.120
So here is some info
on my field research.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.640
I'm kinda going, you know,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.840
to past this if there are
questions we can go back,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.630
but basically I interviewed
the leaders of --

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:29.620
I picked up political area,
human rights organizations,

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.290
business organizations, and
woman's rights organizations,

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.120
and I interviewed and ethnography
observations with the leaders

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.260
from the congressman
and woman to sectortures

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:46.520
of the business associations to
leaders of human rights activists.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:52.760
So to precisely understand what the
Muslimists discourse is I used the

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:58.000 position:56%
infamous treaties, which DIN, DUNYA,
DEVLET religion world and state.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.150
And I further looked
at reality orientations

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.200
in [inaudible] ontology,
agency, and action.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.030 position:56%
For example, how do I read religion?

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.360
What does religion mean to me?

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.480 position:56%
What does the good state mean to me?

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.770
And who am I assigning
agency to establish

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.660
that view and to maintain it?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.870
And what kind of action I think
is appropriate for us to maintain

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.170
that kind of [inaudible]?.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.750
So I compared Islam is the
Muslims elements with each other

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:29.070 position:56%
to basically communicate the newness
and innovation of Muslims form,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.760
but I'm not redefining Islamism
is basically coming from the work

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.300
that was previously done on it.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.320
So normally what I do in my talks
is I go through different cells,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.070
but today given today's
importance is woman's day I wanted

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.810
to do something different.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.510
First of all, I will introduce
data about how Muslims formulate

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.810
to self and the community.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.630
The Muslim ulma, and I want
to talk about our focus

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.370
on the particular role played
by women in formulation

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.580
of the conceptions of
self and community.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.580
And I'm going to use fashion
as a side of [inaudible]

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.960
to kinda demonstrate how
these transformations happen.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.470
Now, there a lot of stigmas about
Islam out there and one of them is

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.210
that Islamic theology is marked by
authoritarian communal attitudes.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.240
It's a communitarian
authoritarian religion

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.240
that violates the individual
and her or his self-expression.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.720
Now, indeed this isn't necessarily
interesting to Islam, but the two

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.200
but this is something that's
formulated by Islamist movements

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.050
and Islamist intellectual thought.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.760
And in fact, within itself it's
quite coherent and quite rational.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.500
Now, Islamists are focused on
preserving the pristine religion,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.200
however they define it

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.420
and to preserve pristine
religion they define an

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.720
authoritarian community.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.070
Basically the community
has authoritative harbor

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.620
over the individuals and that is

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.790
so that the community
can keep individuals

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.040
with incorrect moral action and
pristine codes, because without

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.930
that control individuals may reach
moral boundaries so individual

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.800
and the self-expression is seen
as threats to the shared purity

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.480
of Islam and social cohesion.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.820
And in order to keep individuals

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.720
within the correct moral action
Islamists also focus on orthoproxy,

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.940
meaning the ritualistic aspects
of religion, especially the ones

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.020
by which one can be
recognized as a Muslim.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.270
And the first thing that
comes to mind is the hijab.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.900
So for Islamists the Islamists try

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.030
to prescribe how the
hijab should be worn.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.040
It's not only that you
have to wear the hijab,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.970
but also the ways you're
supposed to wear the hijab

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.130
and those prescriptions tend
to be determined by men,

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.150
so that also means at the local
level, whether it's community

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:52.390
or family man policies and
limits women's moral agency.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.190
So then you look at Muslimism,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.920
you see a radically
different formulation

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.220
of the self and community.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.920
We see that these traditional
conceptions are being transformed

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.220
and the direction

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.800
of this transformation is towards
the sharpening of the individual

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.100
and the undermining

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.540
of a authoritarian
communal religious codes.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.970
And fashion I know when I say
"fashion," it constantly, you know,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.910
brings those images about
[inaudible] and about consumerism

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.970
and about markets is as if
it's a [inaudible] place,

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.160
but bear with me it's
going to surprise you.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.090
So hijab and fashion
is a very proper angle

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:29.770
to kinda trace have those
changes are happening.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:35.300
So when I was talking to women
in the field about various things

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.220
from liberal state and
theology to fashion,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.850
overwhelmingly they were talking,
they were really reactionary

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.810
against Islamist and
traditional conceptions.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.760
Most of them said looking
back at their college years,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.160
so these women were in their
maybe late 30's or early 40's

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.230
and looking back to college years,
they were saying back in the 80s'

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.600
and 90's we were not able to cover
an expression of who we were,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.420
because the colors, you
know, dark brown, black,

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.150
dark black or dark green.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:07.180
And in terms of styles too it was
very monotype, so they weren't able

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.920
to cover an expression
of who they were.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.650
See, it wasn't about, oh,
yeah, we couldn't be trendy.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.110
We wanted to look more fashionable.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.410
It wasn't about that.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.060
It was about expressing
who they were.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.770
And so they would criticize both
the traditional establishments

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.750
and the Islamists for
trying to format the veil.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.600
In fact, they had a name for
this era of 80's and early 90's.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.080
They called it the Uniform
Era, where the hijab was seen

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.470
as a uniform, but they were saying,
but look, women are not uniformed.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.770
We're different from each other.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.070
How are we different
from each other?

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.030
Well, some of us are
15, some of us are 50's,

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.900
some of us are tall,
some of us are short.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.910
Some of us have outgoing
personalities,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.060
some of us like black,
some of us don't.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.780
Some of us are married,
some of us are single,

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.190
so and we have different tastes and
we have different personalities.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.670
And so they wanted to
cover an expression of all

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.950 position:56%
of those unique individual features.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.820
So, for example, this female
from [inaudible] Platform said,

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.050
"Initially the tessettur attire,
tessettur means Islamic covering

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.820
or some clothing was a
uniform and now we sort

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.330
of got out of the uniform era.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.730
But in Turkey the veiling
styles are still monotype.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.140
Plus there is the age factor.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.100
Why would a 60-year-old
woman and a 15-year-old girl

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.960 position:56%
where the same things, tie their
scarf similarly or use same colors?"

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.100
Another woman was saying, "How many
veiled woman we have is how many

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.400
types of veil we have.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.720
I believe that veiling style
is just like dressing style.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.560
Some women believe that veiled
people represent each other

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.380
and Muslims with colorful outfits
misrepresent other veiled women.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.400
This totalization comes both
from inside and outside.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.450
They try to stigmatize
us and confine us

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.310
within a political discourse."

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.450
So, but why is it important
that these women want

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.710
to cover an expression
of who they are?

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.460
I mean, what is that tell us?

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.320
Well, it portends those changes
that I was talking about.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.700
First, the self has
found the new legitimacy

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.400
and interest among the Muslimists

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.270
and that challenges the
Islamist homogenity,

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.310
the idea of the community
being authoritarian

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.700
and self being illegitimate
and self being a threat.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.670
Second, self-styled replace
prescriptions, and again,

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:15.500
those prescriptions are on mostly
defined by men, so buy self styling

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.660
or personalizing there hijab the
colors or whatever the styles,

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.820
they're actually exercising moral
agency on their body because it's,

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.120
you know, it's how you dress.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.850
And then now we have moral agency
in defining what's appropriate,

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.470
so what's the moral
boundaries that I have to abide

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.750
by as I, you know, cover myself?

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.490
And what's also the limits
about me expressing myself?

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.290
So that challenge patriachal codes.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:45.340
Now for many this will be seen as,
you know, the explanation for this,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.680
how did this happen it
probably will follow

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.460
if there's stereotypical
[inaudible].

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.340
Okay, this is market expansion,
its individualism via consumerism,

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.270
but what I found and that
was even more interesting was

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:02.290
that this process was neither
related to individualism,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.780
nor it was freed from God.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.770
Now, we're going to delve
a little bit into theology

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.430
and you will see why I think
fashion is a fascinating phenomena

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:13.350
or aspect of our lives.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:19.310
So this legitimacy of the self was
indeed filtered through the grammar

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.560
of faith and core theological
concepts,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.140
Iman and Tahqiq, particularly.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.930
So linguistically Iman means being
sure of something, certainty,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.710
being in a state of security.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:35.200
In the chronic usage it means
unshakable convention binding one's

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.540
heart to Allah and it's
a heartfelt submission.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:42.100
So it's this voluntary heartfelt
submission or love of God.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.510
And the locus of Iman
then is the heart

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.550
and this wasn't only the
Muslimists discourse,

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.400
I mean it's not an
innovation by Muslimists.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.740
It's the illusions early
theologians and scholars coming

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.770
from different theological
streams, which at time conflict

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.410
with each other, such as Maturidi,
Taftanzani, Ibn hazm, Al-Ghazali,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.790
all of those scholars also so
Iman's location to be the heart.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.640
Now this is important, focus
on Iman is very important.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.440
Think about it this way.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.180
If I was an Islamist, if I
had a [inaudible] with me

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.090 position:56%
and if I raise the [inaudible] and I
told all the women in the audience,

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.920
"You got to cover your
hair right now."

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.200
Or from the reverse I
may be a secularists

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.270
and [inaudible] extremely
annoyed by the veil

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.780
and I may take the
[inaudible] and say,

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.070
"All of you take your
hijabs off right now."

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.410
And I could've even require
you for my public policy to not

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.250
to come school, to not to work
because you're wearing a hijab.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:39.330
But as a state or as any authority
I cannot and actual law asking all

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.020
of the [inaudible]
to love God by heart

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.540
or I cannot enact a law
telling the citizens from now

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.400
on you stop loving God, because
heart cannot be controlled

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.220
by external sources of authority.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.070
And that's where the
legitimacy of the self

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.450
within the Muslims discourse comes.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:59.320
It's rooted in theological
retrieval of the concept of Iman.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.320
Now there's more.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:06.820 position:56%
When religion is a voluntary choice,
it also becomes a conscious choice,

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.240
and overwhelmingly both men
and women in my interviews

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.710
as they define true piety and said

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:17.220
that it's true piety Iman they
were also talking about tahqiq

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.890
and tahqiq basically
means investigation.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.650
So basically one needs to ask
what is it that I believe and why?

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.640
So religion isn't something or
mature faith isn't something

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.750
that just happens to you
by virtue of, you know,

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.430
borning in a community,

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.440
in a religious community
doesn't make your faith mature.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.310
Instead you have to
deliberate infer rather

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.030
than blindly submitting
to inherited knowledge.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.610
And tahqiq is a means centered
concept as much as ends directed.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.150
It's about what tahqiq questions,

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.090
but it's also the tact
of tahqiq itself.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:56.590
Now, all of that within the
Muslimists discourse then presents

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.950
us with a self with potent
agency and that absolutely goes

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.570
against Islamism and if you think

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.820
about Isis today, it
makes so much sense.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.100
So moral action should flow
within the Muslims discourse

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.710
from the heartfelt and
conscious submission and choice.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.790
So moral agency and autonomy
it gives the self moral agency

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.460
and autonomy vis-à-vis
external authority.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.630
And this is not rejection
of communal experience.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.050
It's not individualization.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.660
It's not rejection of
communal experience,

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.600
but it's simply individuation.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.250
So marking one's difference.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.880
Self actualization, an expression
self-expression in rejection

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.470
of oppressive communities
that see the self as a threat.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:45.050
So Muslims then transform
the Muslim umma or the idea

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.640
of community conservatively
into a type of sodality

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.760
where there's still
strongly committed

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.630
to a moral community a common
good and a shared identity,

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:57.910
but they at the same time
require that community

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.230
to acknowledge the self, to
acknowledge the unique traits

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:06.730
of the self and the individual
choice preference and difference.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:11.140
So another woman in relation to
what I've just argued was saying,

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.890 position:56%
talking about the cemaats, you know,
the informal religious networks,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.580
that were commensurate with an
authoritarian style of community.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.450
Throughout the 1980's the
religious scene was dominated

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.000
by cemaats and tricots.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.140
People couldn't even take one
step independent of the cemaats.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.920
They would follow whatever
the head of the cemaats says.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.490
By then also if you were religious
or veiled people would expect you

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.520
to have or accept certain
rules and ideas.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.570
By the 1990's she continues this
change then people became more

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.860
individualized in terms
of being able to act

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.710
and decide independently.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.230
This is how I view
the CBPA platform,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.130 position:56%
so this woman quits the cemaats and
then joins this woman's association.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.050
And then she says "Here woman
are not tied to anywhere.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.540
This is why I decided
to become a member.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.450
Woman here are women who are able
to realize this individualization.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.040
They have different and creative
ideas they can express these

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.790
different before you couldn't
even think about that."

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.200
So going back to self styling
and fashion, so the importance

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.360 position:56%
of covering an expression of who
one is and that's basically based on

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.800
or filtered through this,
you know, broader movements

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.430
where within theology Aql
and tahqiq, meaning reason

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:23.960
and investigation and Iman start to
compete with traditional knowledge

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.100
and conformity to community.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.950
So that also gives us cues about
how the Muslimists view the self.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.250
Now let me make a [inaudible].

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.210
For the Islamists, both are
Muslimists and Islamists.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.120
The self is something
tricky because, you know,

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.300
the self is always
vulnerable to the seductions

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.960
of the [inaudible] of the devil.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.410
For Islamists, however,
the self is so weak

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.010
that it requires an external
authority to keep him within,

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.600
you know, correct moral actions,

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.360
whether that be the
state or the community.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.430
So in order to create a
religiously defined society

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:01.510
and faithful individuals that
needs to be an external authority.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.180
And sin according to Islamists, is
not necessarily a personal choice.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:10.470
It's the seduction of the devil,
seduction of the [inaudible].

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.510
Now for Muslimists this
is a little different.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.380
For Muslimists, remember
that, you know,

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.230
concentration on Iman you are
responsible as an individual

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.970
to choose between permissible
and impermissible deeds

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.600
and indeed that's how
you're going to be judged.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.620
The self is still vulnerable
to [inaudible]

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.390
but the self [inaudible] fight
it's the personal hijab to fight

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:32.690
against the [inaudible] and then

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:36.610
to keep itself away
from the impermissible.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.820 position:56%
And you got to do that whether
there's a [inaudible] that's telling

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.750
you that or not.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:44.110
So in another aspect of this
is that for the Muslimists,

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.320
the Islamic self is someone
who's a critical thinker,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.000
intellectually curious
and she's creative.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.400
It questions established
codes and receive knowledge

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.960
in a conservative hierarchy.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.750
And she or he is not seeing
the adult image of community,

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.280
but has its own differences unique
assets and traits and, you know,

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.400
self styling of hijab is just
one practical example of that.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.140
There's a long [laughs] codes.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.050
I'm not going to read all of it,
but basically this course speaks

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:13.600
into what I just described.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.510
A human rights activist female
says, "When I was confronted

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.910
for the first time with the
ban on veil in college."

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:21.550
So she was wearing
a hijab in Turkey.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.850
There was a ban on hijab.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.590
You couldn't go to university.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.820
" I realize that traditional
religiosity didn't mean anything.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.930
I had a faith that come
from tradition by then.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.500
Then I stopped all of my readings
and started reading Kuran.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.390
What I believe in and why.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.430
Is the veil really an order
of Allah or is it nonsense?

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.530
Allah has given us aql, reason
and intellect and the skills

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.410
and capacity for reasoning.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.410
It says in the Kuran
are you not thinking?

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.530
Are you not using your aql?"

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:52.960
So as you can see this kind of
speaks into the ideal conception

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.570
of the self within Muslimist
community, being, you know,

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.870
someone who questions,
someone who goes back

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.940
to the original resources
and think for herself.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.310
Kind of like try to
dig out the truth.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.270
Now, fashion isn't the only area

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.910
where we find this changing
conception of self and community.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.450
Another area we find it
is religious learning

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.660
and sources of religious authority.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.880
What we find in Turkey is that
increasingly there's a shift from,

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.090
you know, the charismatic the
[inaudible] elite to the Alim.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.430
The Alim is basically
the religious scholar,

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.750
so our people are increasingly
turning towards the Alim

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.610
for their religious learning

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:32.750
and because this is something
we find very clearly am

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:38.300
on the Muslimists and they think of
Alim as they kind of cherish Alim

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.890 position:56%
because they say that he establishes
his vocational relationship

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.690
through formal education
through studio's work.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.130
And he is an intellectual
he's an autonomous thinker,

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.730
he is almost comparable
to a scientist.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.270
And as you can see this kind

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:55.710
of embodies the most ideal
version of the Muslimist itself.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.340
And importantly Alim is not
someone to be followed blindly,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.330
so when you're reading a book
or when you're discussing

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.850
with a scholar you're not expect
to politely submit to this person

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.300
as opposed to, you know,
a head of a cemaat.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.550 position:56%
You still have the critical distance
between yourself and the author as

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.890
or the guide and the mentor and
then you still have to like decide

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:19.350
for your own and then dig
the truth of for yourself.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:23.910
And as this women rights of
female activist speaks into that

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.540
and she says "Not everybody can
be a doctor or a sociologist.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.490
We must have Alims we trust
and we learn from, however,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.750
this must not be in
the form of being tied

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.480 position:56%
to one person or following a cemaat.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.860
You read the books and works of
these Alim and you evaluate these

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.060
through your aql, your
reason, and your evaluation."

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:47.090
Another area we see the rising
of the self and the undermining

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.650
of the community is
traditional family.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:53.590
And this is kind of where it
gets tricky because the quest

00:33:53.590 --> 00:34:00.100
for the self and self autonomy
goes both for men and women,

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:06.790 position:56%
but when it comes to family, I found
that there were some gendered lines.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:11.320
Basically, within the family women
had to pick an additional battle

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.840
in their quest for self autonomy.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.990
I mean, this is, you know,
kind of very typical,

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:18.440
not just Islam and Turkey.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.620
We have it, you know, maybe
every part of the world,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.670
so basically women were
talking about how the definition

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.280
of womanhood around motherhood
and wifehood is a problem,

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.290
because this doesn't allow them
to discover who they really are.

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:36.240
Again, in parentheses this is
the legitimacy of the self.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.420
It's legitimate to be interested in
the self to discover who you are.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.560
I mean, within the
Islamist perception

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.070 position:56%
of community, this is an irrelevant.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:47.930
And so basically those patriarchal
codes and relations worked

00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:51.590 position:56%
as barriers in the eyes of the woman
to develop their self-identity.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.040
And I asked him a question.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.860
I was like "So do you mind your
daughter to live, you know,

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.620
before she gets married to
live by herself for some time?"

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:07.240
And women, maybe like one or
two, except one or two women ,

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.960
ike 30 woman said, "Absolutely."

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.820
And the reason why they said
because they were like, okay,

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:17.290
so the father's house and the
husband's house are places where,

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.070
you know, woman cannot really
develop their self-identity

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.200
and develop life strategies and,
you know, get to know themselves

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.540
and establish their independency.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.130
So this doesn't mean that
they're like feminists.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.630
I mean, they're still, you know,
promote this idea of, you know,

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.990
marriage and that's still a
very important institution.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.020
They're not against obviously,
I mean they're, you know,

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.720
sacrilegious people, but may
be, I mean it's interesting,

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.470
maybe this is living by
themselves before going

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.290
into the husband's house, I mean,
maybe that's just a temporary place

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.770
for them to kinda like
strengthen themselves

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.330
and then go into the marriage.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.050
For men the answer was also
yes, but man was more practical.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.420
They were saying well, you know,
if she want a good university

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.640
and that college was out
of town, then she can go.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.520
So it was more like practical
based on practical reasoning rather

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.830
than this discourse about
the discovering herself

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.580
through developing life
strategies and support.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:13.500
So this also shows us that woman's
role in creating and disseminating

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.890
and shaping the future of Muslimism
is quite important because they had

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.820
to catch on this, you
know, gendered issues

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.860
and their progressive
from that perspective.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.730
So going back to fashion
a little bit before we,

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.070
you know, pack things up.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.570
So fashion also works it's
one area to look at, you know,

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.310
one aspect of it we can look at the
changes that's going to in terms

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.370
of conceptions of self
and community,

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:43.090
but there's also another aspect
that brings into this, you know,

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.220
hybridity back to our attention.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.170
So this is a picture of
the Hashema swimsuits.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.220
The Hashema swimsuit
emerged back in the 1990's.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.140
Basically, you can swim in this.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:00.220 position:56%
I actually wore it, took pictures
with it and I met the first producer

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.440
of the Hashemas and he's called,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.900
I mean there's an epithet
to define him.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.480
He's called the man who
made Muslim woman swim.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:11.590
Now, swimming [laughs] may
sound like a very thin exercise,

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.410
natural has nothing
to do with politics.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.710
But not really.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.350
I mean, in Turkey swimming
is [inaudible]

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.590
at the public beaches are
associated with this, you know,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.950
secular, [inaudible] identity.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.130
Even if you look at the world,
when you say "swimming,"

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.740
you know we constantly think
about bikinis and uncovering,

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.050
so it's like you can't swim
if you're not uncovered.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:36.210 position:56%
But this guy basically rejected
those divides and said you can swing

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:40.900 position:56%
with you're a Muslim, here, where
my Hashema, and it may not look nice

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.220
and it may offend the secular
conscience, because the normality

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.180
of swimming is uncovering.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.140 position:56%
Although, I would like to remind you
that a song about the Polka dots,

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.930
Itsy-Bitsy Teeny-Weeny [laughs].

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:57.040
I mean, you know, that emerged
when bikini was first introduced

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.120
to the American audience after
friends and one of the magazines

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.460
by then defined it no
decent girl would wear this.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.350
But later on few weeks
later, you know,

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.200
along with the feminist
moments, you know,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.210
emergence it became the
only way, you know, to swim.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.320
So what's the size of
hybridity and fashion, you know,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.770
in this example does is
that it's kind of turns back

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.520
at your face normality
standards we so abide by.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.230
I mean, you don't have
to wear a bikini to swim

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.300
and we have many more examples
of this emerging, like,

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.350
so I own a hijab conservative
company

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:33.080 position:56%
and then throughout the company work
I met a lot of interesting people.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:38.310
For example, this girl she is
one of the first Olympic lifters

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.440
and she's a hijab girl
and she was having a lot

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.730
of difficulty finding clothing
because when you lift you have

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.960
to like put it on your leg
and when you take it up,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.980
it raises whatever you're wearing.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.740
So they were wearing
like really tight sweats,

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.030
and that was just not our
purpose for her, so she was like,

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.170 position:56%
well I'm going to go to all
[inaudible] what am I going to wear?

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:57.600 position:56%
So that's the other thing like we
look at the Muslim world and we say,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.030
yeah, we need more education.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.160
You know, these women need to know
their rights, but honestly even

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.420
if they want to go to do,
you know, all them pics,

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.720
they don't have clothing for it.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.020
They want to play basketball.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.320
What am I going to wear?

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.260
You know, that's quite
important question,

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.920
so basically by creating the
Hashema, what this guy has gone was

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.710
to create new public
agencies and new possibilities

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.620
for Muslims to engage modernity.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.890
So apparently they're
not fundamentalist,

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.740
because for an Islamist, you know,

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.040
they would say "What
are you talking about?

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.030
What swimming, you know,
there's jihad people are dying."

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.270
Even actually there was an author
who wrote about the [inaudible]

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:35.400
and he said, "Can you see people
who die in Chechen and Islam

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.970
from the beautiful windows
of the [inaudible] hotel?"

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.730 position:56%
So you're going to offers have
these tensions but that doesn't mean

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.500
that Muslimist aren't aware of that

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.270
or they aren't actively
engaged in that debate.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.360
They are actively engaged
in the public debate.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.730
They are actively politically
engaged.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.230
They get linked to
political parties,

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.240
but that's also living life.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.390
So and one last thing.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:05.180
This also kind of pushes back their
secular and Islamist totalization

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.730
of Muslim woman, especially
hijab woman expected

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:13.370
to dress the same way, to walk the
same way, to love the same way,

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:14.760
to live the life the same way.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.090
So it kind of brings out the
diversity of woman and speaks back

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.050
into what I was just discussing
earlier about the legitimacy

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.770
of the self and the changing
conceptions about the community.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.600
Now this is also an
issue of identity.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.660 position:56%
This is, first of all, Muslimism is
not unique to Turkey and I will come

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:38.180
to that slide unpack it a little
bit more, but for now I think

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.260
into US we find a very
similar process.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:45.220 position:56%
The Muslim Mipster moment,
basically of hipster coming together

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.640
with Muslim and then you
have the mipster [laughs].

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:52.510
So the mipster is considered
as the third place.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.960
It's where, you know, the house

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.800
and the host is blended
towards each other and I think

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.000
that third place really
resembles what I called

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.390
in Turkey the cultural
sides of hybridity.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.250
You know, it's where you don't
reject modernity, you don't submit

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.900
to it, but you kind of
like create this hybridity.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.910
And hipster is someone obviously
nonconformist, politically liberal

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:13.380
and it cherishes the
authenticity of the self.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.300
I mean, that's the main element
and if you look at hijab, you know,

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.360
the global stigmas about
it is that it's conformity

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.380
to a patriarchal community,
it kills the self,

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.370
it colonizes the self
through the community.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.590
So how does a hipster
and a hijab come together

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.990
and then this could be a mipster
fashion amidst the culture?

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:35.410
Well, that puzzle is what
the mipster capitalizes,

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:39.380
because they now introduce
the mipster in the US.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.210
They reintroduce themselves as
passionately religious actors,

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:48.230
passionately Muslim people, but
at the very same time already

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.690
and rightfully modern and American.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:54.380
They cherish self authenticity
and naturalness that also

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.530
within religious submission
and that also speaks

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.300
into my previous discussion
on self becoming legitimate,

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.500
the individual becoming legitimate.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.200
And the mipster challenges the
[inaudible] the minds of modernity

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:13.220
versus religion, Islam versus
best or Muslim versus American.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:18.710
So just I'm going to pack it up.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.740
So why is it important
to understand --

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.660
well, take us -- let
me take a step back.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.730
So when we say "Islam
or any religion,"

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.660
obviously religions are Orthodoxial
and they have an objective truth

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.420 position:56%
for the faithful and it's not like
as the world changes and the essence

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.420
of religion changes,
that's not the case.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.670
But different actors articulate
different expressions of religion.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.400
I mean, you have Islamism,
you have Muslimism,

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.750
you have liberal of theology.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:50.900 position:56%
It's kind of like a range, and in
the post-80's turkey conditions were

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.880
such that this new form
of Muslimism has emerged

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:59.240
and this new form importantly
challenged the divides of modernity

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.380
versus religion and
political versus cultural.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.290
And again, as a reminder about
the political versus cultural,

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.450
the Muslimists are not
oriented to the state.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.870
They're not after establishing
an Islamic state,

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:16.030
but they have produced a political
efface, so the Iman and tahqiq,

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:21.530
while they push for a community
that recognizes individual agency,

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.490
they also push for a
state model that's framed

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.450
on the basis of individual rights.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.930
The example I gave about
enacting, you know,

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.040
a law that would control
the party can't

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.450
and Iman mind is something
that's located in the heart.

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:38.500
So for Muslimists the
tension between moral freedoms

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.190
and a secular state should be
resolved through a liberal state

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.510
that kinda recognizes
those individual rights.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.630
And again, they get linked
to party politics then

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.580
and they're politically engaged.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.960
Now why is it important to
recognize this and inform?

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.320 position:56%
I mean, what good does it do for us?

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.130 position:56%
Obviously, there is intellectual
curiosity, but that's not just that.

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:05.840 position:56%
Muslimism and in Turkey is probably
the most prominent or eligible actor

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.580
to promote a democratic secularism
that can balance tensions

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.130
between moral freedoms
and the secular state.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.380
I mean, the secular state
historically had a tendency

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.290
to violate the rights of the
moral rights and moral freedoms,

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.860 position:56%
but on the other hand, you know, you
don't want religion to [inaudible],

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.160
you know, the state either.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.160
And, in fact, both enforcement
of religion and prevention

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.490
of religious rights is something

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:34.910
that Muslims are equally
burdened and offended with.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.080
Also Muslimists are, you know,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.840
if the religious expression can
promote a more progressive agenda

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.310
relation, and maybe most
importantly the rights of Muslimism

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:54.100
in Turkey is an alive example
of a counter narrative,

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.330
a living counter narrative
culture, alternative

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.890
and a counter narrative
to radical religion.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.190
And it's coming from within.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.210
It's not coming from, you
know, political strategies,

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.230
[inaudible] expediency
or market expansion.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.890
I mean, it's theologically rooted,

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.980
so it's a very polite,
it's very powerful.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.930
And Muslimistic impulses do not --

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.290
Muslimist is not only
unique to Turkey.

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:17.190
I could call it Muslimism
in the context of Turkey,

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.280
but we find impulses
of it in the region.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.390
Even if for now they're politically
co-opted and haven't been able

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:29.600
to translate into political change,
those cultural sentiments exist,

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.430
they continue, and they in large
part explained the Arab attraction

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.730
to Turkey.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.400
I don't think it was
simply because, you know,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.800
they like the Prime Minister by
then, who's now the president,

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.250
but it was, you know,
the ability of Turkey

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:47.710 position:56%
to live this hybrid life where, you
know, you have your Muslim identity.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.390
You don't have to sacrifice from
it, but you can still, you know,

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:54.750
swim or engage a liberal state or,
you know, engage public debate.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:46:00.200
So what of the future of Muslimism?

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.880
Of course it's historically
contingent.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.320
I mean, when you say religion
as culture that also means look,

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.300
you know, different
conditions are going to result

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.260 position:56%
in I mean it's a very simple formula
in different religious expressions.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.560
And it's possible at any point
it may turn into Islamnism

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.860
or become liberal religion.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.870
It's quite vulnerable actually
to turn into liberal religion,

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.480
but maybe through questions
we'll talk about that.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.170
So domestically party
politics will be effective,

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:30.350
turn to an authoritarian state or
an Islamist state will bode ill

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.640
for the Muslims form Kurds.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.170
Economy and middle-class how is
Turkey going to handle and from now

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.140 position:56%
on the peace process with the Kurds.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.300
Economy and middle-class,
and external conditions,

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.880
security threats, Syrian
immigration, Islam severe relations

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.630
with the West because
when you look back

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:49.890
at the 80's the international
contacts are very conducive

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.430
for this type of religious
expression to emerge,

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.730 position:56%
but it seems right now that it's the
international context is actually

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.600
promoting the otherwise.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.860
So one last thing, again,

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.420
I said that Muslimism was
not only unique to Turkey.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:08.280
In fact, it's not only unique
to Islam, which is the concept

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.370
of new religious orthodoxy
is actually more global.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.660
It's the potential
general type of engagement.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.420
In particular it may be
helpful to categorize US

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.670
and evangelicals after 1980's.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:24.790 position:56%
Christian Smith, for example, a very
prominent scholar on evangelicalism,

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.100
what differentiates evangelicals
is their ability, unlike liberal

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.810
and fundamentalist movements
to maintain both difference

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.700
from an engagements
with American society.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.250
This is actually what we have
discussed Muslimism, you know,

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.090
of doing like it doesn't reject
modernity, it doesn't submit to it,

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:43.630
but it create some
verticalar model maybe.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.420
So I want to finish
with this picture.

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.910
So the girl on my left.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.630
I think it's to your right, the
one's taking the photograph.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.560
I met her very recently again
through the company work

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.300
and she is the only word
journalists that is a hijab

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.110
and she's a Turkish female.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:04.780
And she took this picture in Syria
when she was there recently going

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.130
through the, you know,
Isis regions and so.

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:12.960 position:56%
And so she's wearing a hijab, as you
can see, and we don't even have many

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.540
like female or journalists and
this girl is a devout Muslim.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.400
She's wearing the jihab and
she's a word journalist.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.650
And she's taking a picture
of this other female.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:24.520
I like you to look at her shoes.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.230
I mean, this picture to me was
very moving, because you have,

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:31.110
you know very clearly you can
see that hijab doesn't have

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.750
to meet one thing, right .

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.970 position:56%
I mean, in one case you have a word
journalist, I mean, more progressive

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.260
than most secular woman that I
know, right, that goes to war.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.380
By the way, she is
married and she has a kid.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.480
Like, her kid is four years old
and she's going to Iraq next month.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:51.140
And you see this other woman
also hijab, but I mean,

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.420
I know from the story that
this other girl doesn't want

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.380
to cover her face, but she has
to because that's, you know,

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.990
the external authority
wants her to do that.

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:01.490
So I think I'm done here [laughs].

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.510
That's it.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:09.430
[ Applause ]

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.560
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Neslihan

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.920
for illuminating this
very fascinating sights

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.150
of hybridity in Turkey and beyond.

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.890
I think we have a few
minutes for questions.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:25.860 position:56%
And again, I just like to state
that if you can limit your questions

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.810
to just a few thoughts
on the program itself.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:33.410
And also know that since
we're videotaping this,

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:36.070
you're giving your
permission to be recorded.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.960
So will entertain a few questions.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.400
Eve, I see your hand.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.620
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I wanted to
make a very quick comment

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.670
about seeing these very young women
these days are very stylish hijabs.

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:49.030
There seem to be a
whole range of styles

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:52.450
of now wearing a really cool hijab.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.780
But yesterday I saw a family in
which the father was in a T-shirt

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.310
and jeans and, you know,
looked like a hipster

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:03.500
and the wife was in a full hijab

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.770
They were putting the baby in a
car and I'm wondering is it easier

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:11.620
for those types of hybrid families
[inaudible] very traditional

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:19.560
[inaudible] to exist in less
or is it accepted in Turkey

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.270
and other countries
beyond to have [inaudible]?

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:26.780
&gt;&gt; I mean it's not a
matter of maybe exception,

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.880
it's a matter of them practicing.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.790
I suppose what they think
they should be doing.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.210
In Turkey I can tell
you this though.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:35.310
In Turkey you don't
have the abaya [phonic].

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:37.180
Like the abaya has never --

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.920
I mean we have people who are
wearing the pecha [phonic],

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:42.770
you know, like the face thing
and that, you know, black.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.610
But they're mostly belong to a
certain camaat or a certain tahqiq.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:52.090
In Turkey since the '70s, since the
'60s Islamic textile industry has

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:56.440
been a bit more diversified
than what we find in Gulf region

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:00.850
and Turks don't cover their
face, most of them don't.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:04.090
In terms of the veils, you have a
lot of different immigrants right,

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:08.830
so it may be a family
that is more adherence

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:12.540
like that has a more traditional
conception of what the hijab is

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.910
and who the self is and how
the community should work.

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:18.440
And I should mention I was
having a conversation with one

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.800
of the previous congressmen
of the Welfare Party,

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.190
which is more [inaudible] with,
you know, I suppose they had more

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:27.100
of an Islamist discourse
than Muslimists.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:30.780
And then for him the hijab was
something that defined the limits

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:35.630
of the community, so it wasn't and
that's this is really problematic

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:40.070
because you wear hijab because, you
know, you think that it's God's,

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:44.510
you know, requirement of you
that you think it's farce.

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:47.780
But for the man it also
had an ideological purpose.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:53.090 position:56%
It had the purpose of separating all
sources them Muslims from others,

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.440
so maybe that's family
comes from that type

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.070
of theological rating
whereas the other one comes

00:51:58.070 --> 00:51:59.530 position:56%
from a different theological rating.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.360
so that's the main thing, though.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.230
Like, you know, religion
is articulated differently

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:05.530
by different ages.

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.170
That doesn't mean that
there is a variety of Islam.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:10.470
I mean, there is one Islam
and Muslims are Orthodoxial.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:13.870
Yeah. I hope that that helped.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:17.420
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for your time.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:22.510
Could you give us the
names of some leaders --

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:29.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.340
&gt;&gt; Right. So, okay.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.990
The one thing Muslimists
are not a formal movement.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:35.880 position:56%
They don't have, you know, bulletins
or newsletters and so forth,

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.930
but it's more of a
cultural movement.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.690
And when they meet with each other
they recognize on those movements,

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.450
but the sights that I studied

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:48.590
for example included Capital
Woman's Platform, Muslim Dash,

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:51.600
a human rights organization.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:56.530
Misiat, one of the biggest Muslim
economic business [inaudible]

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:01.540
in Turkey and Justice
and Development Party,

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.780
but that was when I interviewed
them that was in their second term

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.470
and things kind of have
changed since 2010.

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:15.100
So, yeah. I can write down
those names for you after.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.180
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.060
&gt;&gt; So we have some more questions?

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.290
Well, I just had one [inaudible]
I was thinking through it.

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:28.830
I know in Turkey for so
many times there was kind

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:33.610
of if you ask somebody can you go
ahead and do this commit to this,

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:39.670 position:56%
there was always kind of the
[inaudible] I hope for it, you know,

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:46.980
kind of self predetermined whether
you would be able to do it or not.

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:51.810
And how would you think free
will is emerging kind of concept

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.710
of critical thinking
about how you're going

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:56.310
to do things would work out?

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.140
&gt;&gt; I mean, that's one
of the central questions

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:03.410
that had Islamic theologians fight
with each other and even, you know,

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.310
accuse of each other for
being [inaudible] try

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:10.470
to detect their meaning, you know,
taking someone out of religion.

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:15.310
It's a tricky question, but so the
thing is but what I mean when I say

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:19.430
"agency," it's not the agency.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:22.930
It's not, you know, opposed to
this idea of predestination,

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:26.490
plus even when there is
predestination you still have

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:27.790
a choice.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:31.130
I mean and [inaudible] for examples
our prophet is doing [inaudible]

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:36.580
and he has an abaya on him and this
poor man is standing there like,

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.940
you know, really poor, whatever.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:42.290
And then he looks at the prophet
and he thinks within himself, oh,

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:44.580
I should sell that because now
he's going to do [inaudible]

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.660
and he can't move so
I should steal it.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.820
Meanwhile the prophet is
thinking I should give my abaya

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:54.950
to this poor man, so I think
I mean, I'm not a theologian.

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:57.580
I mean, I read theology,
but I'm not a theologian,

00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:02.340
so the idea is the predestination
here is that the guy is going

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.650 position:56%
to get the abaya, whether he can get
it through stealing it or through,

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:11.380
you know, prophet's
blessing that's his agency.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.690 position:56%
Now when it comes to another example

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:16.400
that I've encountered
throughout my, you know, research.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:21.190
I was talking to the guy who
owns, he was the sector chair

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:23.350
of automobile industry
at [inaudible]

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:25.510
and then he was telling
me this, you know,

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.890
one time this camaat had
took the and the mom comes in

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:29.190
and he wants to buy a car.

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:31.830
And I tell him, "Well, if you're
buying the car buy insurance."

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:33.900
He was like, "No, I had insurance.

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.720
I can't like it's the faith.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.210
I can't buy insurance."

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:41.470
Then he makes an accident and
then he comes back and say, "Okay,

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.430 position:56%
well can you give me insurance now?"

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:47.140
[Laughs] So, I mean, the thing is
like all those concepts are being

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:51.350
so misunderstood too like the
whole Koran, like you have to have

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:54.900
as an individual you're responsible
to choose between good and bad

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:59.620
and that doesn't mean that you
like you have agency there.

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.300
You have to have agency.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:05.150 position:56%
So also it's important to
differentiate the agency I'm talking

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:07.300
about isn't towards God himself.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.350
I mean, it's not preached from God,
it's the agency towards the head

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.650
of a camaat or towards a
state, whether Islamist

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:19.920
or secular state I think.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.540
&gt;&gt; Anybody else, question?

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.510
Okay. Mohammed.

00:56:23.510 --> 00:57:06.150
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:07.610
&gt;&gt; Yes, no, that's very true and so

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:11.410 position:56%
when I was doing my this what you're
suggesting, like what you're saying

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.130
in terms of like, you know,
this is becoming recently --

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:17.160
I mean, this is a very
recent development.

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.910
Back in when I was doing this
research this is not the case.

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:27.290
I mean, today Dolce and Gabbana and
Tommy Hilfiger, Mongo, all of them,

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:28.770
Donna Karan, did I say that?

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:30.780
All of them has invested
in the Islamic markets.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:34.890
Why? Because the markets are
calculated to be $469 billion

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:38.520
in 2020, so there's a
lot of money to be made.

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:43.310
And so, but this is
actually precisely the moment

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:46.160
where we should talk
about how the emergence

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.720
of hijab fashion has been filtered
through theological concepts,

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.910
because now everybody looks at
there's consumers and it's just,

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:57.460
you know, Muslims are being
engulfed by capitalist markets.

00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:01.240
So markets are finally
converting Islam into vanity,

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.650
into consumerism, secular
as orthodoxy.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:09.550
But what I found with the
early adopters, let's just say,

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:14.130
because those women were in their
40's and they were the first ones

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:17.500
in Turkey by then kind of like to
adopt this kind of like discourse

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.290
about fashion and personalization
of the aesthetics of hijab.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:24.750
And there's was not simply
about looking more trendy.

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:27.510
It was about being able to.

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:38.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.440
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.490
&gt;&gt; I mean another thing,
like the one

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:45.170
who covers the Saudi Arabia
wears a bikini in Miami,

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:48.460
so I mean it's about your rights.

00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:51.810
Many reasons for women
some of them do jihab

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:55.550
because in their community it's
easier to find a husband that way.

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:56.850
&gt;&gt; Or a job [inaudible].

00:58:56.850 --> 00:59:01.270
&gt;&gt; Or a job, but that's not about,
I mean, this question is kind

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:05.010
of like it brings back the state
and community and organizations

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.180
and the society back
into our plates, right?

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:09.960
So if you're not allowed
to [inaudible] job

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.990
in a country you're going to
wear is whether you want it

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:16.380 position:56%
or whether you don't, but that
doesn't take out of the authenticity

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:20.950
of the job or itself or why our
people now or the legitimacy

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:23.000
of the question and the
interest of the question

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.630
of what is the hijab fashion mean?

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:26.930
You know what I mean?

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.190
So that's different, but,
yeah, I mean people do that.

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:33.590
Some do hijab because they
think that that's partisan

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:38.090
and they're more, you know,
knowledgeable on it and they see it

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.020
as a partisan part of the orthodoxy

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:41.960

traditional reasons.
