Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So we're talking about Nmr spectroscopy and today we'll talk about that. Tools that you use to identify are the aspects of Nmr Nmr spectroscopy that allow you to assign structures to molecules. Uh, so the chemical shift, which involves diamagnetic, anti Satrapi, the word that you will impress your friends with and spin, spin coupling. And maybe at the end we'll get to dynamics if not next time. So as we said last time there, the, the precession frequency of the protons in a molecule, a depends on the magnetic field they see, which is mostly this enormous applied magnetic field. But there's also a little fields in the molecule that make a difference to give this effective field in particular, the orbiting of electrons, the net orbiting of electrons, because they orbit both ways and mostly cancel. But a little bit of net orbiting gives rise to what's called the chemical shift, which can change the field by 12 parts per million in roughly for protons, sometimes a little more 200 parts per million for carbon because they're more electrons around carbon.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Right? But there's another effect, another magnet to bear in mind that the magnetic aspect of nuclei is not influenced by electric stuff, right? So that that a, a proton, the nucleus of a in a molecule is held in position in x, Y, z by the electron density around it. Okay? That's the bonds we talk about. But the orientation of the magnet, right, is not, is not at all or is rarely effected by that, right? It's affected only by magnetic things, not by electric charges. Okay. Just moving electric charges that generate magnetism does it so that it's as if the, the Proton is on a, is on a perfect, uh, uh, ball bearing or something. If this is the molecule and the Ma and the, and the molecule rotates the, the, the spin keeps pointing to the same way, right? It doesn't rotate with the molecule.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Okay. We'll talk about that a little more on just a second. Uh, okay. But, but so the things that are magnetic or the circulation of electrons and nearby magnetic nuclei, they're obviously magnetic too. So if there's more than one magnetic nucleus, then you get what's called spins. Been splitting as we'll discuss and notice that the units are different from that. We talk about the units of spins, been splitting in terms of hurts. That is frequency, that is energy, not parts per million, not a fractional unit. And you'll see why. So first the chemical shift, which is due to this electron orbiting and involves diamagnetic can I Satrapi. Hey, we saw last time this idea that when you have higher, uh, electron density around the Proton, you get more of this diamagnetic shielding and the peaks are shifted to the right. And when you have less electron density is in the carboxylic acid there shifted to the left.

Speaker 1:          03:20          And that made some sense. But there were things that didn't make sense, like a settling where you'd think that the sp hybridization of the carbon would withdraw electrons from the hydrogens and shifted down field compared to the double bond. It shifts it up field. Right? And furthermore, as you'll see, the same thing applies to benzene. It's shifted downfield compared to other hydrogens on carbon, carbon double bonds. And the reason is this thing called diamagnetic anti Satrapi, which we will now discuss. So you get Daya magnetism from orbiting electrons. So suppose that, uh, that red.is the nucleus and we're in an applied field and there are electrons that are circulating around the nucleus and they create the name Daya magnetism means that opposes the applied field. So they reduce the field that seen by the, by the nucleus. And that's the source of these splittings. We were these shifts that we were talking about.

Speaker 1:          04:17          Okay, but now we're talking here about electrons orbiting around this nucleus. The one we're looking at, there are lots of other electrons in the molecule orbiting other nuclei. What effect do they have? Okay, so suppose we're interested in the field at the red nucleus, but there's some other nucleus, the blue one and electrons are circulating around it too. Now, what effect is that going to have on the field seeing at the red nucleus? Okay, well we can look at the lines of force and see it has the same kind of effect but not as strong because it depends on one over r cubed. So as you move away, the effect gets smaller. That's not surprising that you can see the lines of force get further away as you move further up, okay? So the effect is weaker from the same number of orbiting electrons on another nucleus.

Speaker 1:          05:08          That's fine. But suppose that the nucleus were studied is fixed relative to the other nuclei by bonds buy a bond like that or other bonds. It could be connected in a complicated way to the blue nucleus, okay? And suppose that the molecule rotates, right? So it's not always in the same field. So we can look at it like this. Here's the, uh, can you see this here? Okay, so here's the, here's the nucleus we're interested in, and here's the other nucleus about which things are spinning or are orbiting, right? And as we go like this, right? Sometimes we're in a region where the field is pointing up, sometimes in a region pointing down. In fact, I have it the wrong way here because I'm wanting to use this same diagram for another purpose later, okay? But you can see that, that we're going to have to average, if the molecule is tumbling rapidly to see what the influence of electrons here are when we're over here.

Speaker 2:          06:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:15          So let's try to do the average. Okay. When it was up, when it was, when the bond was pointing up, we saw that the field pointed down. How about here? When the bond is down, which way does the field point from the blue circulation?

Speaker 2:          06:29          Debbie,

Speaker 1:          06:31          look at the lines of force. Which way are they pointing down road? Where? Where the red nucleuses down. Okay. So it's the same. Good. That's going to reinforce it. But suppose it's turned at 90 degrees there. Keep us going, Debbie. Now, which direction to those lines points. Oh, okay. And how about if we rotate to the other side? And how about a four at 45, or actually some a little bit less than 45 degrees there.

Speaker 1:          07:03          Oh, they're pointing sort of down to the, uh, down to the right. Okay. And if we're over there, they're pointed down to the left and if they're down here, down at the bottom there, pointing down to the right or the left, depending on where we are. So we have to average all of these. Some of them are bigger than others. There are pointing in different directions. But notice that if we average over a whole circle of rotation, then the ones that are at the top and at the bottom, within the scope of those double headed yellow arrows, those are all net down, right? Some are down very strongly, some are down very weakly and the right and the left one's cancel one another, right? And the right to left. So it's net down at the top, net down at the bottom also. But on the sides it's net up. Everybody with me now which one's gonna win?

Speaker 2:          07:56          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:56          the ups and the downs. Why do you say the downs first? They're more of them, right? And second, they can be stronger. In fact, if this turns out up at the top to be twice the lines of force are twice as close together here as they are out here, there's a factor of two. So clearly the downs have it right. So if you average around the circle, you're going to get net down. However, that's not the way you average. Can everybody see why you don't average around a circle? When I look at the effect of this, the fields over here on this, why don't I just average around a circle?

Speaker 1:          08:38          Because the molecule is not held in a plane. It can go this way too. Okay? So we have to average over a sphere, not around a circle, right? And notice that when you average over a sphere, you get much more area around the equator than you do up at the polls going around the sphere. So now that's going to be an advantage for the ones that are pointing up a much heavier weight and the averaging, right? And it turns out that the net average over a sphere is zero. And that's great because it means you don't have to worry about it, right? You can't get an effect from someplace, the circulation someplace else. If you're only interested in the ones that are circulating about you. Right. That obviously simplifies our life greatly except for diamagnetic anti Satrapi. Okay, so let's see what that is. So we can ignore the electrons on other atoms.

Speaker 1:          09:41          Good News. Unless orbit, unless the amount of orbiting depends on the orientation of the molecule and then they aren't all that or not. That's not always the same orbiting for different orientations. Okay, so let's just suppose that were up there and suppose when the molecule is oriented vertically, that way when our nucleus is above these circulating the electrons, suppose there's less orbiting for some reason in that orientation. So we're going to make that a pink things thinner and that will have the effect of making the magnetic field less. The lines of forests are now further apart and that means we don't have as big a field up on the up on top. Everybody see? So if it Everage to zero before it will average up. Now everybody with me because we've cut down on the amounts that are going up. When the molecule is in this orientation, if when it's down in the other orientation, you have the full compliment of circulation, then the DA, then the, the ups are going to win.

Speaker 1:          10:46          Okay, so that, and this is what's called diamagnetic and I saw atrophy diamagnetic as this circulation that causes a field opposed to the applied field and is driven by the applied field. Right. The reason it's there is because you put the applied field on and if you put more applied field on you get more of it. But in a, in a stay, in a fixed field, right? You have this diode magnetism, but it's not isotropic isotropic means the same in all directions if it's different in different directions than it doesn't cancel anymore. So diamagnetic anisotropy means that you're in trouble, that you have to consider the electrons on other nuclei as well. So let's consider that in the case of benzene. So we have these Pi orbitals overlapping in benzene. And then when you put a magnetic field on in that direction, you can cause circulation of those electrons.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Net circulation. Okay. Now that creates the field that's, that's opposed to the applied field in the middle of the ring. But reinforcing the applied field out on the, where the protons are. Everybody with me on that. So it's reinforcing the applied field however. So it's like that. But if you turn the molecule edge edge on, then you don't have the path anymore where they can circulate because they're driven by the big field. They circulate around the big field and now the path isn't there to go on. So it turns it off or at least reduces it when you turn the molecule that way. So this is exactly a situation of diamagnetic anti Satrapi where you have the effect for some orientations and not others. And now there'll be a net average field due to the circulation in these p orbitals of carbon as seen by the hydrogens, which is what you're looking at in your NMR spectroscopy.

Speaker 1:          12:39          So it's a net d shielding. The orientation shown here is the one that dominates, where the field is big, where the circulation is big, it's not big when you turn it the other way. So this, this one wins and this one, notice this one reinforces the applied field at the position of the nuclei were interested in. So that means that they get shifted down field. So that's why in benzene, the protons are further down field that way than you would have expected just from their being in an sp squared bond. Okay. Now this then provided, once this was appreciated, Nmr came along. It came along at the same time that people were interested in hookah. Lara meticisly four n plus two and it was a happy coincidence because in a molecule like this one here, which has 14 Pi electrons, is that four n plus two right?

Speaker 1:          13:38          It's four times three plus two. So this is like Ben should be like benzene, right? Four Times three plus two and this is, this is the Nmr spectrum in the normal region of that compound. However, what comes at zero? Remember what comes at zero. That's tms, our reference peak. And what comes at 7.2 that turns out to be the solvent flora form, right? So tms and chloroform, there are no peaks for our compound, right? The reason is we have to look out of the normal range, right? So if you look for those protons, you find them way down there further down from where benzene usually comes, which is in the seven to eight region. Okay. And that's exactly the same region that they're out beside the plain of this thing that Molly, the electrons are circulating around that loop. When the molecule is flat like this, and it feels exactly the same kind of effect as in benzene, except more so. Okay. Now, but there are methyl groups there too. Where are they? Do we have to go still further down field?

Speaker 1:          14:50          Where are the methyl groups? Right? So there's a picture of the molecule taken from an x ray crystal structure and you see the circulation would be around this path. Where are the methyl groups? The methyl groups are in the middle, right where the lines of force are going the other direction and you find them up here. Right? So that's a really dramatic example of this diamagnetic and I Satrapi hey now, uh, there, there, uh, once people got this particular bit in their mouth, they started looking a lot of other cases. For example, this molecule that we talked about, which member had that ch two bridge across the middle and then 10 Pi electrons four times two plus two, right? And again, you see them shifted downfield when they're outside and upfield when they're inside, okay, now they're not shifted as far. Why not shifted as far?

Speaker 1:          15:56          There's not as much ring current. They're not as many electrons. But the other reason is that that was distorted. So the overlap isn't as good and you don't get as much circulation right? But still you can see that it is, uh, it is benzine like it is in this context. Aromatics aromatic because the ch two is shifted up above tms. Very unusual. Okay. Now that's 14 Pi electrons. Suppose you treat it with potassium. Potassium easily gives up electrons. It reduces the compound. In fact, it put, you can put two electrons into it. And for this purpose, we're going to condense the scale. Same spectrum, but I just squeezed the scale. And for reasons that will be obvious. Okay, that, so they're the sort of super aromatic hydrogens shifted downfield to about nine parts per million and the ones on the inside shifted way up. But if you put two more electrons in and make the dye, and I on like that, now it's not aromatic anymore.

Speaker 1:          17:00          It's four n instead of foreign plus two. And look at its Nmr spectrum. They exactly shift, right? So aromatic goes one way. Hocal antiemetic goes the other way, right? So this was, so there were lots and lots of examples done like this during the 1960s and early seventies okay. So the ch three signal shift downfield by 26 parts per million, despite adding member that the electric, they're more electrons. Now we've put two more electrons into the system. They should shield it, but in fact it's de shielded by 26 parts per million. Really dramatic. Okay, so it's an anti aromatic dance, Diane Ion. Now, how about a settling right now, a settling has these p orbitals that it's were written at vertical here. There are two p orbitals. And remember about when we talked about what the electrons look like. If you have p orbitals equally occupied, if you have three p orbitals each with two electrons in it and look at the total electron density, what does it look like?

Speaker 1:          18:08          It's a sphere, right? It's not lumpy. And to give a cylinder, right? So this, this thing has a cylinder around. It's around the carbon carbon triple bond, right? So there's a path in which electrons can circulate. Okay, so we get a this diamagnetic current, when we put a field on that and get these fields, how is this different from the case in Aram? Anticipate? Do you see when it was benzene, it could circulate when the molecule was flat, right? And the hydrogens are out here. Now it circulates when the molecule is oriented this way and the hydrogens are above the middle. So the lines of force go exactly the opposite direction. But as in benzene, when you turn the molecule, you don't have the path for circulation. So it's Daya magnetically and isotropic. It goes one way and not the other. This is the way that wins.

Speaker 1:          19:06          And the nuclei of acetylene lie above the orbiting path where there is ringed current. So the applied field is diminished in the signal shifts up field rather than downfield. So that's why when you made it sp rather than sp squared, it didn't go downfield because of the electro negativity. It went up field because of diamagnetic and I sought therapy and it's just the opposite of what you see in Benzie and where the protons are beside the circulating path rather than on its axis. But here's a warning. This is a handy picture and has been taught for for 50 years now, I guess close to, uh, but it might be nonsense. And Professor Weiberg has done calculations and observations that show that it doesn't work for c 13, whether it works for Protons, uh, I'm not sure, but at any rate, it's a really handy picture to remember who shifts which direction.

Speaker 1:          20:07          And it has sort of the ring of truth about it, but it might not be supported by really careful calculations of the kind of Professor Weinberg does. Okay. So that's, that's the idea of diamagnetic anti Satrapi. And what gives rise to chemical shifts. These things we talk about pulling electrons away. Mostly it's the electrons on the nucleus in question that are important. And as you pull the electrons away, you get a shift, uh, downfield right? Apartment downfield downfield set direction for you. Okay, good. Okay. But, but you, but in special circumstances you have this diamagnetic anisotropy then you have to think about it in the terms we just talked about. But there's also the local fields that are due to other nuclei. And this is called spin spin splitting. For example. This is a, this has taken, and again, I will recommend to you this chem two 20 website, which has NMR problems.

Speaker 1:          21:07          They give you a spectrum and say, what is it? And then the nice thing is you can show a spectrum like this. They allow you to go in and look in detail at the peaks and see what they're integral is our and uh, and, and also gives a detailed explanation. So there's an answer key. So that's a handy place to go. But this is, this is the first problem in that set. Now you can see there are three kinds of protons in this. It turns out, I'll give you the answer first, that it's ethyl acetate. Okay? So there's, there'll be two groups of three protons and one group of two protons. So obviously these are the three and that's the two. Okay. But let's look at, let's zoom in. As this program allows you to do, has that website allows you to do, and when you look at that triplet, you see that it's the, when you look at that peak, you see it's in fact three peaks and they're in the ratio one to two to one in their intensity.

Speaker 1:          22:06          Now why is that? Those are the ch three groups of the methyl group, ch three protons of the, of the a methyl group, right? But adjacent to it, there are two other protons in the vicinity, right? And you can have those oriented, each of those can be oriented either with or against the field. So there are two of them. Each can be with or against the field. So there are four different ways to do it. Okay. To to the two. Okay. So they're different molecules which have different orientations of next door. Protons. Okay. Of those protons. Now let's think about those. They could both be down, they could both be against the field and then we get this peak. Okay. Or they could both be with the field and then we get this peak. Okay. So that you have it when you think you have just one kind of molecule there.

Speaker 1:          23:07          In fact, you have what you might call, nobody calls them that I think spin isomers. Right. They differ only in how these neighboring protons have their spin oriented, but they're different molecules in there. Okay. So there, but they are so similar and energy. The magnetic interaction of the protons with the field is so small and energy that the Boltzmann constant is one equal amounts of the two. I mean there's a tiny, tiny difference, but not that you could measure by the intensity of the lines. So they're equally abundance. So the yellow peak is just as big as the peak or agreeing. Okay. Now what's that?

Speaker 1:          23:52          That's when one of them is up and the other is down and it's just as likely as the others. So it's one to one to one, but you can also have one down in the other up right, the opposite direction and that fit. So that's why it's one to two to one because they're all four of those are equally likely. And to have them come in the middle where they cancel each other in their effect. Okay, so that's a triplet. Now how about this thing here? That's a core tet and we can figure out how that works too. That's the Cah twos. They're shit. Why are they shifted? Downfield why did they come farther to the left from where the methyl group was? The chemical shifts there because the oxygen's withdrawing electrons. Okay, so are shifted down there. They're integrates for two. That's how many protons are being involved.

Speaker 1:          24:44          So it's that. It's that the ch two group, but it's a quartet. Why? Well, let's look at the name now. There are three hydrogens on the next door, carbon. So they're going to be eight different spin isomers uh, uh, differ in the spins. Then of the adjacent a hydrogen nuclei. So let's think about it. There's the ones that were, they all oppose the field. They'll be up at the right, the one where they're all with the field, that'll be at the left, and then you can have one down or two down, or our second one down or a third one down. But they're all the same, right? All have one down. So they come to that peak and then there's one of them up, a different one up, a different one up. So it's one to three to three to one. Okay. So if we have three neighbors, we get one to three, to three to one.

Speaker 1:          25:35          If we have two neighbors, we get one to two to one. What if you have only one neighbor? What patterns should you see? Probably if he had just won neighboring proton. And you're looking at this one here, what will it, what will the signal of this when you're looking at look like, right. There'll be a peak like one. Some molecules will be like that. Others will be like that. It'll be one to one. Okay. So if it's just one, it'll be one to one. Now what if it's for anybody know what that one's going to be? Yeah. One, four, six, four, one. How did you get that? Right? It's Pascal's triangle, the binomial coefficients. So it looks like we can do this for anything, right? We're in good shape. Okay. Now, how, how big is this splitting? It's measured in energy units in Hertz, and that's called Jay.

Speaker 1:          26:28          And they're, they're equal. You expect those to be equal because both of them involve the same change in the neighbor, right? Flipping one proton. Okay. And at the same time, those are all the same too. But this is exactly what you could say we should say, because the influence of this magnet on this magnet has gotta be the same as the influence of this magnet on this magnet. If they're the same kind of magnet, all protons. Right? So that's great. They're, uh, and notice it won't depend on how big the magnetic field is because this is just the interaction between two magnets, which have fixed magnitudes. It was different for the orbiting because the orbiting was created by the magnetic field. When you had more magnetic fields, you've got more orbiting, right? So the chemical shift is measured in fractional units. What fraction of the big field does it shift at? Some parts per million. But this is measured in Hertz and energy because it doesn't depend on the applied field. So it's independent of Bz zero versus the chemical shift, which as we know does depend on be zero. The orbiting is driven by be zero. Okay, now let's look at another one. This is ethanol. A spectrum measured over the break by Phil for us. Okay. Now, uh, so we had o, h, c h two and ch three. Uh, let's see if we can figure out all these peaks. Which one is that furthest to the right?

Speaker 1:          28:01          Which, which of the protons in ethanol is that peak? That's furthest to the right, which turns out to be a triple what it's on the methyl group, cause the other ones have oxygen withdrawing. So it's the further it has the highest chemical shift or the lowest number of chemical shifts least shifted down from zero. Right? And it's a triplet. Is that makes sense to you? That it should be three lines. Okay. What do you say?

Speaker 2:          28:27          Why?

Speaker 1:          28:30          No, th th th th it's three protons, right? But the signal is not a single peak. Three times as big as the others. It's three peaks. One to two to one. What causes that splitting? You remember it's not chemical shift. It's called spins. Been splitting. What's the other spin? That splitting years signal. It's the protons on the adjacent carbon and there are two of them and you can orient it in, in uh, uh, in this, uh, two to the three to two to the two ways. Four ways. One bomb bump. Okay. That's what we just talked about. So it's a triple if that's what you expect. Okay, so that's the splitting of the ch three by the ch two protons. Okay. Now let's look down at the other end. And incidentally, the chemical shift positions is measured on the spectrometer or that, but actually we should measure it not in parts per million where the difference is 0.018 parts per million. We should measure it in Hertz. So the, so the Hertz units are at 7.2 hertz. We by the frequency of the spectrometer, which it says here is 400 megahertz. Okay? So it's 7.2 hertz. Okay, now we looked down there and we see a triplet. What's that do to

Speaker 1:          30:01          Alex? Yeah. Why? Why is it, why is it the, Ooh, so it's got two neighbors, right? Okay. So that's, and it's shifted all the way down field because of the oxygen electron withdrawing. It would appear. Okay, so there, that's the ch two splitting the other direction. Now let's compare those two. They're not the same size. The interaction between the Oah and the Cah two is smaller than the interaction between the ch three and the Cah two. Right? That one is 5.1 hertz. Okay. Now what's this thing here? What's that do to that? So that's the ch two and what's it split by? The age of the O, h and h is, okay, so how many H's all together and what do you expect the Intensity v one four, six, four one. So let's blow it up. Okay. Is it a one, four, six, four, one quintet?

Speaker 1:          31:09          Not Quite. Now what is going on? Notice that those two interactions are not the same, right? One is 7.2 hertz and the others 5.1. So if we look at those there, we see a quartet that split by how many? That's foot by three. That's the ch three splitting. But in fact there are two quartets, right? So that's the smaller splitting Dubai to the Oah. Now had they been the same then the separation of the three on the sh, the separation of the, of the two quartets would have been, uh, let's see. Would it been instead of being like this, it would be like this and then it would be one, four, six, four, one right? But that doesn't look like that. It's actually what we call a doublet of quartets or a quartet of doublets. Okay. So that's a little bit different. Okay. Now there's some other tiny peaks here. What's this one do to? Any thoughts? What a good idea could be water, but it's not. The solvent is dms o d six but unless you would spend an absolute fortune, you have some dms o d five in there that has one proton, right? So those few molecules of the solvent that have hydrogen on them look like that, right? So you'll see a signal from that, okay, that's fine. And that's what the signal looks like. Now, there are no other hydrogens in there. What's causing spins been splitting?

Speaker 1:          32:49          Deuterium is also magnetic. It's not very strong magnet. So it doesn't have a very big splitting. These splittings are very small, right? And furthermore, not only is it a weaker magnet than a proton, but so that it's only 1.8 hertz, right? It could be oriented three ways in the field. Remember, Proton can be with or against, but to do tiering them can be with, against, or across. So now there are three ways of putting it. So if you have two of them with three ways, it turns out what you get instead is a one, two, three, two, one quintet. And you can work that out for yourself if you, if, if a single would splits at one to one to one because there are three orientations, right? What did to do so you can work that out. If you figure that out, then you'll understand the math we've been doing here. Okay. Now here's another peak. Matt, what's this peak? Why did I ask you? Is that water? That's water. Yeah. Okay, good. Okay. But look over here

Speaker 2:          33:59          just to go to this.

Speaker 1:          34:05          What are those?

Speaker 2:          34:07          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          34:08          blow it up. This bit here. These little ones are due to an artifact of the instrument. Don't worry about those, but these are real here and there. So they both look like they're triplets, right? Like what's in the middle of them is a triplet, right? And there's a 7.2 7.2 hertz splitting, which is exactly what you had here, right? So it looks like it's being split by the CIA, by the ch two next door. That's the splitting here. We're looking at something that has to do the ch three, it's been split by that, but there's something else that's splitting at what else could be splitting it.

Speaker 2:          34:46          Okay,

Speaker 1:          34:47          there's another magnetic nucleus. It can't be this h out here because that's so far away. It would have a minuscule effect. This is an enormous effect. This doublet splitting and the ideas, it's sort of related to this one actually. There's another nucleus there that's magnetic, but only 1% of the time. These are only half a percent as big as this is, right? So the total of this, and this is just 1%, there's 1% of some other magnetic nucleus in their carbon. It's carbon 13 right? And that has an enormous interaction with the protons. I did a 125 hertz. That's much closer to the protons. Okay? That's one per one point. 1% of carbon and natural abundance. And notice one other thing that we're going to address later, uh, probably we won't get to it today, which is that these are slightly asymmetric. This one's just slightly bigger than that one, right? And the green ones here are slightly bigger than the pink ones. Right. And this one is slightly bigger than that one. And we'll get to that too. So we've looked at this in pretty much detail now. What determines the strength of the spins, spins, splitting, how many hertz it's going to be. Uh, and so we're going to talk about isotropic, uh, j coupling between protons.

Speaker 2:          36:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:20          And it's not a through space magnetic interaction. It's mediated by bonding electrons. Uh, because that's what this was actually made for here are the, here are the lines of force created by this nucleus and we're looking at this one. So it can be like this or it can be like that. Okay. So we get a doublet of when we're looking at this proton over here, because this one can be either this way or this way, but that if we follow it's lines of force, they can either oppose the applied field or they can help the applied field. And what do we get if the molecule is tumbling in three dimensional space for the average of that? Zero. Because now you're not going to get diamagnetic anti Satrapi because this magnet has nothing to do with the circulation of electrons and where the pants are. It's just the the nucleus itself and they're on perfect ball bearings, right? So there's no nos special stuff going on, so it'll absolutely canceled to zero. But then how in the world do we get interaction between the two? How do we get splitting if the through space interaction of magnets won't do the trick?

Speaker 2:          37:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:35          Okay. It goes through bonds and let's look at this. So let's look at the magnitude of some of these coupling constants is that are called Jay. Okay. So in for adjacent positions in benzene at six to eight hertz for next adjacent positions is one to three hertz. And for remote positions it's zero to one hertz. So what does it look like? It depends on,

Speaker 2:          38:00          yeah,

Speaker 1:          38:00          any thoughts?

Speaker 2:          38:03          The position of agents?

Speaker 1:          38:04          Yeah. It depends on position obviously, but in what way?

Speaker 2:          38:09          Closer.

Speaker 1:          38:10          The closer they are, the bigger the interaction. Can I see the hands of those who are surprised?

Speaker 2:          38:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:17          Okay. Now let's look at these. That's 1.85 this is 2.38 that's 3.07 on strums and here are their coupling constants. What do you think your theory, Derek, it's not holding up right here. It's exactly wrong. The close, the closest ones have the smallest splitting and the farthest ones have the biggest splitting, but we know that it shouldn't be distance because we've just seen that at averages to zero. So it must be something else, okay? It's not spatial proximity. The through space interaction, the dipoles average to zero on tumbling. Okay? Now let's look it up. Faa in here and look at those two protons, top and bottom, top right and bottom left. And look at this particular molecular orbital, which turns out to be homo minus three. There are lots of others we could look at, but this one is good to look at for reasons.

Speaker 1:          39:17          You'll see now when this, when this, uh, when there are two electrons that are going to be in this orbital, right? And when one of them is on this nucleus, the one, let's say the electron, remember it's magnet too. When it's pointing up, there's going to be in that orbital, there's going to be one electron pointing up, one electron pointing down. Okay? So suppose the up one happens to be here, then the down one can't be up there. Only the down one. The downwind can only be over here. That is only the down electron is available to be here. It can't be the blue one when the blue one is up there. Okay. So the electrons provide a way to communicate between the nuclei, like suppose that that, that this electron likes to interact with that nucleus. When that nucleus is up, let's say. Okay, then in those particular molecules where this nucleus is up, this nucleus prefers to be down.

Speaker 1:          40:26          Okay. And vice versa, the nuclei would be lower in energy when they're anti parallel than when they're parallel. So it's as if the nuclei were interacting with one another. But in fact one is interacting with one electron and the other is interacting with the other electron, but the two electrons are in the same orbital. So they interact with each other. One has to be up in the other down. So it's this indirect interaction through the bonds. Now that has an interesting implication. So in tumbling molecules, nuclear spins, communicate not through space, but through paired electrons on the nuclei. Because if that other electron wasn't right on the nuclei on the nucleus, then as it orbits, it'll cancel. There's only one place that electron can be where rotating the molecule won't cause it to cancel. What's that place on the nucleus when the electron is on the nucleus? Tumbling won't average it, right? So what orbital does it have to be in to be on the nucleus?

Speaker 1:          41:34          It has to be an SR, but all right, so it's only the s orbital electrons that allow this communication to take place, right? So the j the magnitude depends on the s orbital content of the various molecular orbitals, not just the one I showed, but others as well. Now you weren't. Why is, why is this one, the Auntie are trans. Why is that bigger than this one? Could it be that you have more overlap here than you do here? So the molecular orbital is better for communicating between these two then for communicating between these two. So we have to decide which of these orbital overlaps looks better to you. The one on the right or the one on the left. If you had to guess which one is better overlap, what would you guess or you wouldn't guess. Suppose I asked it on an exam and you had a 50 50 chance of getting some credit then, or maybe maybe it's 60 40 if your intuition is good, which one is better overlap, this or this, right or left.

Speaker 1:          42:39          How many say right? How many say left? There are no lefts. You think this one's better overlap? Okay, well, let's see. Okay, so which gives better overlap? Now the way we can tell is to dissect it into the atomic orbitals that are part of those orbitals, right? So we examined the overlap of the components. So notice that this, this one is a combination of a p orbital here and an sp hybrid pointing that way. This is a combination of a p orbital here and an sp hybrid pointed that way and corresponding over there and let's take them apart so we can consider them separately. Okay. So notice that these are the same on both sides, so we can forget that that's going to be the same overlap. But now the question is, which is the better overlap? This or that?

Speaker 1:          43:31          Let's vote again. Partial credit here. You chance to redeem yourself. How many think this one is better overlap? Notice that means that this, if it's true, that means this is better overlap if this cause these are the same. Okay. And how many think that's better overlap? Okay. Not many people think that and for obvious reasons, right? But let's dissect that a little more. Okay? So let's just look at this one where the difference lies. Okay? And this you notice as a combination of these p orbitals and these s orbitals and this is a combination of these p orbitals and these s orbitals. Everybody with me now let's see which, which one? Which ones have better overlap? Okay, so this is good. SS overlap. Okay. And that one's bad. Anti-Bonding and the P orbitals good and bad. Shall we vote again? How many people think this one's better? Good. Okay. You're thinking. Okay. What haven't you thought about though? This s can overlap with this p and this asks can overlap with that p and the same thing over there. So here are two bad overlaps between s and p. Okay. And here are two good overlaps between s and p. So now the question is, which is more important s with p four s with s and p with p.

Speaker 1:          45:10          And if you had a photographic memory, you would hark back to lecture 12 where we talked about the overlap of carbon hybrids and saw that curiously, the s p overlap is bigger than either s s or p p. So in fact, this is the dominant one, right? And that one has better overlap. Isn't that cute? So the backside overlap is really counter intuitive that this is better overlap than that. They don't really doesn't look like it in simple pictures. I absolutely agree with you. Yeah. Okay. And here's that thing from lecture 12 last semester, right? There's s with us at the distance of a carbon carbon single double, triple bond. Here's p with p and the sigma overlap. And here's s with P, right? So asks with p Wins.

Speaker 2:          46:05          Good.

Speaker 1:          46:07          Okay. So now let's look at something else here. This is a table that you can find in the book and in many, many books say this kind of thing, but there's some errors here, which is what I want to show you. I mean overall it's worthwhile, but there are a couple of areas. It says identical hydrogens do not couple. That is absolutely not true. They do interact with one another, but the coupling is invisible. Okay, so in fact the magnitude of the coupling is not zero. It's 10 to 20 hertz. Right? But you can't see it because there's no handle for the radio frequency. The light can't cause a transition between the peaks. That would show that splitting and frame 26 that we won't get to until next time. We'll show that. Okay, one other one here. This one, it says that the coupling is six to eight and that's fine, but it depends on this angle because remember the overlap of this bond with this bond, which is what we just talked about, is going to be bigger one. It's anti than when it's that one. That's a clips, right, and something different. When it's like this. So it's going to depend on this angle, right? And in fact, it can be between two and 13 hertz, depending on the con formation. Now, of course, if it's spinning around rapidly, it'll average spinning around the internal bond.

Speaker 1:          47:26          Okay. So it's, it's 13 when it's like that, it's two hertz when they're perpendicular and it's 11 hurts when their sin. That's just like what we saw last time, bigger like this than like this. Okay. When it's, when they're Gauche, which is one of the more likely ways to be, then it's seven hertz, which is that. And that's also the average of all these others. Okay. And notice that this, if you have a torsional angle that's spit, if it's spinning, then you average to six to eight, right? But if it's fixed in some molecule, then you can measure the angle by measuring j. So that's another way to get structure. Okay. Uh, let's see what time we got here. Uh, let me do this one last. Uh, no, we'll do this next time. Okay.
