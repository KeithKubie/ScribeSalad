second part of this is also we should
 

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:03.710
second part of this is also we should
also invite and collect and assume that

01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:03.720
also invite and collect and assume that
 

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.330

only respond maybe the polls go up with

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:12.790
only respond maybe the polls go up with
 

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:14.460
only respond maybe the polls go up with
athletes in terms of when they're

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:14.470
athletes in terms of when they're
 

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.140
athletes in terms of when they're
winning and when they're losing and all

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:16.150
winning and when they're losing and all
 

01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:17.910
winning and when they're losing and all
but we also know people follow their

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920
but we also know people follow their
 

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.400
but we also know people follow their
tweaks and then bury these ways in which

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:20.410
tweaks and then bury these ways in which
 

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:22.890
tweaks and then bury these ways in which
we need to begin to make sure that as we

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:22.900
we need to begin to make sure that as we
 

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.500
we need to begin to make sure that as we
collect we collect for 21st century

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:25.510
collect we collect for 21st century
 

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:27.750
collect we collect for 21st century
environment and not just for 20th

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760
environment and not just for 20th
 

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.120
environment and not just for 20th
century one and that we are sort of

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:30.130
century one and that we are sort of

setting up the archives in such a way to

01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:32.980
setting up the archives in such a way to
 

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:35.700
setting up the archives in such a way to
accommodate things they may have for me

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:35.710
accommodate things they may have for me
 

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:37.080
accommodate things they may have for me
if you think of technology to having a

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.090
if you think of technology to having a
 

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:40.020
if you think of technology to having a
life cycle every 18 months and so by the

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:40.030
life cycle every 18 months and so by the
 

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.580
life cycle every 18 months and so by the
time we get it how many generations

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:41.590
time we get it how many generations
 

01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:44.550
time we get it how many generations
later and so we have to actually ask the

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560
later and so we have to actually ask the
 

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.320
later and so we have to actually ask the
question if we collect it can we

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:46.330
question if we collect it can we
 

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:48.060
question if we collect it can we
actually retrieve it and how do we

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:48.070
actually retrieve it and how do we
 

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:49.800
actually retrieve it and how do we
retrieve it but more than that how we

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:49.810
retrieve it but more than that how we
 

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:52.350
retrieve it but more than that how we
retrieve it preserve it and then make it

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360
retrieve it preserve it and then make it
 

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.590
retrieve it preserve it and then make it
possible for others to use I mean those

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600
possible for others to use I mean those
 

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.680
possible for others to use I mean those
are the kinds of questions I think we

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:58.690
are the kinds of questions I think we
 

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.630
are the kinds of questions I think we
need to help because it's then going

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640
need to help because it's then going
 

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.910
need to help because it's then going

about that and then in a more modern

01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:10.790
about that and then in a more modern
 

01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:13.560

some of the line scrimmage or the ball
this hike think of that as the brain of

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:34.230
this hike think of that as the brain of
 

01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:36.950
this hike think of that as the brain of
the football of the football field so

01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960
the football of the football field so
 

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:39.410
the football of the football field so
then the next level was then you started

01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420
then the next level was then you started
 

01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.120
then the next level was then you started
to get some full backs and you started

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:41.130
to get some full backs and you started
 

01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:43.700
to get some full backs and you started
to get some may be offensive tackles and

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:43.710
to get some may be offensive tackles and
 

01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:45.320
to get some may be offensive tackles and
you started to get some defensive

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:45.330
you started to get some defensive
 

01:40:45.330 --> 01:40:47.919
you started to get some defensive
linemen you know and the outside outside

01:40:47.919 --> 01:40:47.929
linemen you know and the outside outside
 

01:40:47.929 --> 01:40:52.300

linebacker but the last group put two
 

01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:54.589
linebacker but the last group put two
last-place positions for there to be

01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599
last-place positions for there to be
 

01:40:54.599 --> 01:40:57.950
last-place positions for there to be
blacks we're on our quarterbacks but

01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960
blacks we're on our quarterbacks but
 

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.930
blacks we're on our quarterbacks but
even probably at some point there

01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940
even probably at some point there
 

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.729
even probably at some point there
probably were fewer offensive centers

01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739
probably were fewer offensive centers
 

01:41:01.739 --> 01:41:03.859
probably were fewer offensive centers
and then another one was middle

01:41:03.859 --> 01:41:03.869
and then another one was middle
 

01:41:03.869 --> 01:41:04.669
and then another one was middle

remember Willie Lanier is one of the

01:41:06.169 --> 01:41:06.179
remember Willie Lanier is one of the
 

01:41:06.179 --> 01:41:08.270
remember Willie Lanier is one of the
first middle linebackers so those are

01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280
first middle linebackers so those are
 

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.339
first middle linebackers so those are
the core thinking positions in football

01:41:10.339 --> 01:41:10.349
the core thinking positions in football
 

01:41:10.349 --> 01:41:11.750
the core thinking positions in football
middle linebackers Center and

01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760
middle linebackers Center and
 

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.580
middle linebackers Center and
quarterback and those are all the

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:13.590
quarterback and those are all the
 

01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:15.290
quarterback and those are all the
positions that were last for blacks to

01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300
positions that were last for blacks to
 

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.750
positions that were last for blacks to
get integrated into so to me it's just

01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760
get integrated into so to me it's just
 

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.259
get integrated into so to me it's just
fascinating that that it just speaks to

01:41:21.259 --> 01:41:21.269
fascinating that that it just speaks to
 

01:41:21.269 --> 01:41:23.779
fascinating that that it just speaks to
the fact that our intellectual ability

01:41:23.779 --> 01:41:23.789
the fact that our intellectual ability
 

01:41:23.789 --> 01:41:26.209
the fact that our intellectual ability
in sports still is diminished and even

01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219
in sports still is diminished and even
 

01:41:26.219 --> 01:41:28.040
in sports still is diminished and even
if it's not diminished now that took a

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:28.050
if it's not diminished now that took a
 

01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:31.310
if it's not diminished now that took a
way too long for it to be recognized we

01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320
way too long for it to be recognized we
 

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:32.419
way too long for it to be recognized we
have one more question on this side of

01:41:32.419 --> 01:41:32.429
have one more question on this side of
 

01:41:32.429 --> 01:41:43.189
have one more question on this side of
the room if you accept the notion that

01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199
the room if you accept the notion that
 

01:41:43.199 --> 01:41:46.149
the room if you accept the notion that
drugs are a bad thing in the locker room

01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159
drugs are a bad thing in the locker room
 

01:41:46.159 --> 01:41:49.279

cares if Barry Bonds uses steroids I was

01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:56.780
cares if Barry Bonds uses steroids I was
 

01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:58.790
cares if Barry Bonds uses steroids I was
taken aback a little bit about the

01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800
taken aback a little bit about the
 

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.279
taken aback a little bit about the
amount of effort to from the judicial

01:42:01.279 --> 01:42:01.289
amount of effort to from the judicial
 

01:42:01.289 --> 01:42:02.870

system the kind of involving Barry Bonds
 

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.029
system the kind of involving Barry Bonds
and even at the Congressional level

01:42:05.029 --> 01:42:05.039
and even at the Congressional level
 

01:42:05.039 --> 01:42:08.149
and even at the Congressional level
panels so I'm curious what do you guys

01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159
panels so I'm curious what do you guys
 

01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:10.330
panels so I'm curious what do you guys
think about the role of Congress in

01:42:10.330 --> 01:42:10.340
think about the role of Congress in
 

01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:13.219
think about the role of Congress in
getting involved in regulating drugs in

01:42:13.219 --> 01:42:13.229
getting involved in regulating drugs in
 

01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:15.290
getting involved in regulating drugs in
sports don't they have better things to

01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.300
sports don't they have better things to
 

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:26.060
sports don't they have better things to
do yeah I do think Congress does have

01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:26.070
do yeah I do think Congress does have
 

01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:30.259
do yeah I do think Congress does have
better things to do and I was at least

01:42:30.259 --> 01:42:30.269
better things to do and I was at least
 

01:42:30.269 --> 01:42:32.540
better things to do and I was at least
we hope yes yes at least we hope they

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:32.550
we hope yes yes at least we hope they
 

01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:35.810
we hope yes yes at least we hope they
they they certainly I believe do have

01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820
they they certainly I believe do have
 

01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:38.149
they they certainly I believe do have
better things to do and I was a bit

01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159
better things to do and I was a bit
 

01:42:38.159 --> 01:42:44.750
better things to do and I was a bit
surprised by their intervention into

01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760
surprised by their intervention into
 

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:53.149
surprised by their intervention into
this area I believe that it's it's

01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159
this area I believe that it's it's
 

01:42:53.159 --> 01:42:55.879
this area I believe that it's it's
debated among some people about how much

01:42:55.879 --> 01:42:55.889
debated among some people about how much
 

01:42:55.889 --> 01:42:58.189
debated among some people about how much
of an effect performance-enhancing drugs

01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199
of an effect performance-enhancing drugs
 

01:42:58.199 --> 01:43:00.859
of an effect performance-enhancing drugs
actually have that's that's been kind of

01:43:00.859 --> 01:43:00.869
actually have that's that's been kind of
 

01:43:00.869 --> 01:43:04.100
actually have that's that's been kind of
debated and so there's some people who

01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:04.110
debated and so there's some people who
 

01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:07.699
debated and so there's some people who
will tell you that the effect is not as

01:43:07.699 --> 01:43:07.709
will tell you that the effect is not as
 

01:43:07.709 --> 01:43:11.169
will tell you that the effect is not as
big as as as some people would suggest

01:43:11.169 --> 01:43:11.179
big as as as some people would suggest
 

01:43:11.179 --> 01:43:16.189
big as as as some people would suggest
so you know that's a you know that's

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199
so you know that's a you know that's
 

01:43:16.199 --> 01:43:18.080
so you know that's a you know that's
that that's one issue

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:18.090
that that's one issue
 

01:43:18.090 --> 01:43:19.520
that that's one issue
the other issue what you think is

01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:19.530
the other issue what you think is
 

01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:23.510
the other issue what you think is
probably more germane has always been if

01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520
probably more germane has always been if
 

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.510
probably more germane has always been if
these athletes do this would it affect

01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520
these athletes do this would it affect
 

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.760
these athletes do this would it affect
young athletes kids and things like that

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:28.770
young athletes kids and things like that
 

01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:30.440
young athletes kids and things like that
and they're taking these drugs and that

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:30.450
and they're taking these drugs and that
 

01:43:30.450 --> 01:43:32.690
and they're taking these drugs and that
would be certainly a great concern about

01:43:32.690 --> 01:43:32.700
would be certainly a great concern about
 

01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:35.390
would be certainly a great concern about
having young kids and so forth taking

01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400
having young kids and so forth taking
 

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.080
having young kids and so forth taking
the drugs but I don't see where any kind

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:39.090
the drugs but I don't see where any kind
 

01:43:39.090 --> 01:43:43.430
the drugs but I don't see where any kind
of federal intervention in this really

01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440
of federal intervention in this really
 

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.870
of federal intervention in this really
makes a difference I think the most

01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880
makes a difference I think the most
 

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.300
makes a difference I think the most
effective way that would probably be

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:47.310
effective way that would probably be
 

01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:49.400
effective way that would probably be
policed if they're going to get these

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:49.410
policed if they're going to get these
 

01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:53.300
policed if they're going to get these
drugs out of out of sport would be for

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:53.310
drugs out of out of sport would be for
 

01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:56.420
drugs out of out of sport would be for
the sports themselves to to police what

01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:56.430
the sports themselves to to police what
 

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:58.940
the sports themselves to to police what
they're doing and I believe that that

01:43:58.940 --> 01:43:58.950
they're doing and I believe that that
 

01:43:58.950 --> 01:44:02.240
they're doing and I believe that that
was very you know that's that's that's

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:02.250
was very you know that's that's that's
 

01:44:02.250 --> 01:44:04.550
was very you know that's that's that's
quite possible and I think it should and

01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560
quite possible and I think it should and
 

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:15.070
quite possible and I think it should and
it can be done beyond that it's really

01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:15.080
 

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.570
nothing more I have to say about it i

01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580
nothing more I have to say about it i
 

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.330
nothing more I have to say about it i
think it's i think it's no longer such a

01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340
think it's i think it's no longer such a
 

01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.160
think it's i think it's no longer such a
big issue in baseball it's interesting

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:22.170
big issue in baseball it's interesting
 

01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:24.890
big issue in baseball it's interesting
that when Congress focused on it they

01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:24.900
that when Congress focused on it they
 

01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:28.550
that when Congress focused on it they
mostly focused on the big publicity was

01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560
mostly focused on the big publicity was
 

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.350
mostly focused on the big publicity was
with baseball players it was very was

01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360
with baseball players it was very was
 

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.910
with baseball players it was very was
very interesting that they did there was

01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920
very interesting that they did there was
 

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.370
very interesting that they did there was
not very much focused on athletes many

01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380
not very much focused on athletes many
 

01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.230
not very much focused on athletes many
other sport it was just baseball

01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:36.240
other sport it was just baseball
 

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:37.910
other sport it was just baseball
although we know in track and field with

01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920
although we know in track and field with
 

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.710
although we know in track and field with
Marion Jones and we we know about you

01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:39.720
Marion Jones and we we know about you
 

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:44.450
Marion Jones and we we know about you
know in yeah we know about in another's

01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460
know in yeah we know about in another's
 

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:46.190
know in yeah we know about in another's
board so it was interesting that it only

01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:46.200
board so it was interesting that it only
 

01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:49.180
board so it was interesting that it only
got it was only a focus in baseball

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:49.190
got it was only a focus in baseball
 

01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:51.410
got it was only a focus in baseball
which may have something to say about

01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420
which may have something to say about
 

01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:54.350
which may have something to say about
the status a baseball in American life

01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360
the status a baseball in American life
 

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.750
the status a baseball in American life
or you know whatever but it's

01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760
or you know whatever but it's
 

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.190
or you know whatever but it's

started referring to earlier I would
dare say if someone would spend a little

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:13.410
dare say if someone would spend a little
 

01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:16.190
dare say if someone would spend a little
time I my guess is they're quite a few

01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:16.200
time I my guess is they're quite a few
 

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.780
time I my guess is they're quite a few
congressional offices and where they too

01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:17.790
congressional offices and where they too
 

01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:19.640
congressional offices and where they too
were reading the pulse yeah and to

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:19.650
were reading the pulse yeah and to
 

01:46:19.650 --> 01:46:22.370
were reading the pulse yeah and to
actually have your congressperson on

01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380

advantages with your constituents and so
 

01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:30.410

that may sound cynical but it's politics
 

01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:34.250
that may sound cynical but it's politics
and so you realize that the day your

01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:34.260
and so you realize that the day your
 

01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:36.320
and so you realize that the day your
left that you're running again and you

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:36.330
left that you're running again and you
 

01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:37.880

parts of the new cycle that your name is
 

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:45.200
parts of the new cycle that your name is
out front and so if you go back and plot

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:45.210
out front and so if you go back and plot
 

01:46:45.210 --> 01:46:47.870
out front and so if you go back and plot
it and figure out when these occurred

01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880
it and figure out when these occurred
 

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:50.090
it and figure out when these occurred
what time of the new cycle what part of

01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100
what time of the new cycle what part of
 

01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.820
what time of the new cycle what part of
the year when be interesting to see if

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:52.830
the year when be interesting to see if
 

01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:54.890
the year when be interesting to see if
there's any direct correlation between

the attempt to actually keep some
 

01:46:56.730 --> 01:46:59.930
the attempt to actually keep some
stories alive and then you layer on that

01:46:59.930 --> 01:46:59.940
stories alive and then you layer on that
 

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.520
stories alive and then you layer on that
the more complicated story both about

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:01.530
the more complicated story both about
 

01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:05.840
the more complicated story both about
baseball and about race and and then you

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:05.850
baseball and about race and and then you
 

01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:09.110
baseball and about race and and then you
end up with a story where no matter how

01:47:09.110 --> 01:47:09.120
end up with a story where no matter how
 

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.150
end up with a story where no matter how
many times you cut the legs up it comes

it mean that story had helped to produce

01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:18.540
it mean that story had helped to produce

it mean that story had helped to produce
any additional jobs in the US has helped

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:23.490
any additional jobs in the US has helped

important to the body politic writ large
 

01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:33.190
important to the body politic writ large
and so in the scheme of things

01:47:33.190 --> 01:47:33.200
and so in the scheme of things
