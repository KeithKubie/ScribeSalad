00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.813
Can I help you
find something?

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.415
Um, yeah.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.116
Do you have this
in a larger size?

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:19.318
Have what?
In what?

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:23.222
Uh, this shirt in--
in a larger size?

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:24.590
Have you checked
under the table?

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:27.027
No.
Good luck.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.799
So?

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.834
I-- I just got
down here.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.235
Oh.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.503
Any luck?

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:38.771
Um, no, these--

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.273
These are even smaller.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.108
Could you keep
your voice down?

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.743
You're scaring
the thinner customers.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:45.078
Oh, sorry.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.212
Can I help you find
something else?

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.447
Maybe some jewelry.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.416
No.
I just need a--

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.785
Just, just this
in a size 12.

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.555
Like, a UK 12?

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.657
Which is a U.S. 8.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.125
Or like a Japanese 12?

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.827
Which is an American
toddler 3.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.429
Is that true--
No, no, I just--

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:06.332
Just this in a...

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:07.834
12, a U.S. 12.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:11.671
I could call the Midwest
for you?

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.206
(distant cowbell)

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.641
(sighs)
Oh, where is my head?

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:19.512
We have a whole section
for your... situation.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:20.814
Follow me.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.552
Please don't touch
that anymore.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:32.659
What?

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.361
Where the (bleep) am I?

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:36.562
Amy?

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:37.630
Lena?

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.265
Hi!

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.134
It's so good to see you.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.136
Okay, so I asked
for a turtleneck,

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.303
they brought me here.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:45.505
That was, like,
three months ago.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:46.572
What? Wha--

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.474
What is a cow
doing here?

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:49.609
Oh, she's shopping.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.210
It's her daughter's
bat mitzvah.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.446
Is that the AIDS quilt?

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.348
Mm-hmm,
Mindy Kaling returned it

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.682
after she wore it
to the Golden Globes.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.584 line:85%
Oh, she looked so warm.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.584
Mm-hmm.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.486
(woman)
Ma'am?

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.421
Do you wanna try this on?

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.457
That is a tarp
for wood.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.758
Yeah.

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:08.194
It's perfect for covering
your pool or...

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.695
your problem areas.

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:11.697 line:85%
Here.

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:11.697
Oh, okay.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.432
It looks good, Amy.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:14.534
Really?
Yeah.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.435
Mm-hmm.
I'll--
I'll take it.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:17.569
Great.

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:19.606
Let's get you to the register
before the storm comes.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.408
Bye.
Bye.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.147
Twister is a-comin'.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.750
Daisy?!

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.687
Thanks.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.391
Why is there a mall pretzel
in the bag?

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.960
Oh, we assume that's where
you'd be going next.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:44.630
That is really offensive.

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.365
I can take it out
if you want.
No.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:47.767
But just for the future,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.436
just, like, know that
that is offensive.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.272 line:85%
Do you want dipping sauce?

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.272
Yeah.
