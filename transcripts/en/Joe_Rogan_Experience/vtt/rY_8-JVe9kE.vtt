WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.870
And they think it's great.
Oh,
this is awesome.
We have greater Matt here.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.530
I speed over live.
Yeah.
When they,

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:09.990
when I got the high speed Internet here that let you have high speed,

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.140
high speed Internet,

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.140
while you have the highest DSL you can get the highest DSL can suck it right as

6
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:19.950
I narrowed it really hurts me.
Like I'm just like,
oh,

7
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.460
this is not the product that I wanted to give out this week.

8
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.350
So the Internet is weak.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.570
However the audio is the same and why you want to look at me so closely anyway?

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.240
You Bet.
Freaking bitch.
Um,

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.260
but it will all be fixed.
Well this is a work in progress we should do,

12
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:42.060
we should probably get a recorder so I could record a high quality version of

13
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:46.850
what the mixer is outputting the name.
Yeah.
And then we could upload like a,

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.720
almost like an HD version.
What do we have to do?
Just tell me.
Amazon inertia.

15
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.430
Okay.
What's Amazon?
The shit out of that.

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.820
Did your organ experience podcast is brought to you by ting?
Why?

17
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.300
What is Tim Bert Kreischer tings.
A cell phone service.
Yes.

18
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.640
It's cell phone service.
He used to sprint backbone.

19
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
And the way they have it set up is you don't have any contracts.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.940
They have awesome phones.
If you use,
uh,
the URL,

21
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:12.450
rogan.ting.com you'll save yourself 50 bucks,

22
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.150
all of any other android devices.

23
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:19.190
And it's all from a non evil cell phone company.
That's the,
the,

24
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:21.990
the reason why we like what they're doing though,
the way they have it set up.

25
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.890
I mean Brian explained like what they did with,
with your uh,
your minutes.
Oh,

26
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.670
it's so cool man.

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840
Like I've been using it for maybe two weeks now and it's pretty much,

28
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:34.200
you're using everything sprint like [inaudible] like do your voicemail,

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.500
it's sprint.
Like Hey,
welcome to spray.
And he put it in your pass code.

30
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.450
So like the network is solid.
It's fuck like I have you both at and t and sprint.

31
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:46.440
Well,
pretty much ting now and I always have service throughout Los Angeles.

32
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:49.290
I'll almost always full full bars and stuff.
So it's been,

33
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.350
the service has been great.
But the coolest thing is,
is that if you,

34
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:56.220
once you log into your account,
it shows you how much you've used.
So like,

35
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.930
like it said,
like [inaudible] seven minutes,
you know,
this,
uh,

36
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.790
week so far you've used 20 texts,

37
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.270
you've used this much data and so it tells you how much you've spent already.

38
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.270
So what I'm guessing,
I haven't done a full billing cycle yet,

39
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.104
but this one I'm guessing,

40
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.260
I'm guessing it just takes like if you're on a $50 a month plan,

41
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.680
say or $40 a month plan and you only use $12 of it,

42
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.370
then I guess it would just subtract it from your bill every month.

43
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.690
So it's really interesting.
But yeah,
it's,
it's very ethical.
Yeah,
it's perfect.

44
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.110
It seems like why doesn't every cell phone company do this?
It's like,
yeah,

45
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.680
it's creepy that they don't,
right.
It's really creepy.
Gross.

46
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.800
The idea is so fucking gross that you have to sign up and what's really going on

47
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:40.590
though folks,
and this is a,
in the interest of full disclosure,

48
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.680
what's really going on?
And so when you get a contract for a phone,

49
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.180
you see like an iPhone contract,

50
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.390
it'll say like x amount of dollars with a two year contract.

51
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.130
Well that over the two year contract you're paying off that phone.

52
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.050
The reason why it's only $299 as opposed to $699,

53
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.980
what are full retail would be,

54
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.660
<v 1>that's sort of rolled into the bill.
Okay.
With,
with Ting,
they do not have that.</v>

55
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:08.800
When you're paying for a device,
it's,
it's yours and you're getting it at,

56
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.850
you know,
it's,
that is exactly what it costs.
If you want to quit at anytime,

57
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.200
you don't owe them money.

58
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.000
So the reason why contracts are exists and they're hard to break besides that,

59
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.420
it's,
you know,

60
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.260
financially it's good for them to make it hard to break so that you could pay

61
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:27.670
off that phone.
They don't have that with Ting.
So with Ting,
um,
when you're,

62
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.490
when you're buying one of these phones,
that's what it costs.
It's 180 bucks.

63
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.163
That's what it costs.

64
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.460
<v 2>I just remembered something.
The galaxy s three I have,
uh,</v>

65
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.721
I,

66
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:41.030
I can't figure out certain things about it cause I'm so used to the iPhone and I

67
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:43.130
can't figure out how to turn off the notification.

68
00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:46.040
Every time I get an email it goes like that.

69
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.230
So I'm like at the olive garden or something like that,

70
00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:49.190
just walking around and selling it goes,

71
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.070
and it sounds so realistic that people are looking at me like,

72
00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:53.450
did that guy just whistle at me?

73
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.750
<v 1>One noise became like a universal sign for,
hey,
you look sexy.</v>

74
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.700
<v 2>Yeah.
How did that come out?
That's weird.
You know?</v>

75
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.530
Tinging ting is embarrassing me though.

76
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:08.820
I think that at restaurants and public places with that,
that's the Android,

77
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.310
you got to figure out the android operating system.

78
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.070
I would think if anybody would've figured it out by now,
be you.

79
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.700
You're a fucking Dork.
Complicated is a really,
yeah,
it really is.

80
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:20.010
But I think it's one of those things,
once you figure it out,
you're like,
oh dude,

81
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.200
you're just,
you know,
it's just like any other operating stuff.

82
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.670
<v 1>Yeah.
It seems like it was pretty easy.
I didn't really have any problems.</v>

83
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.370
It's just like you could find the,
Huh,
I haven't spent it.

84
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.920
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm not spending that time trying to turn off that fucking whistle.</v>

85
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.950
Which one is that just changed my wife's cause it went and it was an obnoxious,

86
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.780
you'd be out to fucking eat and she was like,

87
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.620
I'm offended by people's songs except Limo drive is the best ones.

88
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.660
Horrible,
horrible,

89
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.370
<v 1>top 40 pop love nonsense song and you're happy when it goes,</v>

90
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.580
<v 2>oh fuck.
Who was just at my house?
I think it was half.</v>

91
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.140
Ron Has the worst song on his,
I think it might be half frons hit him singing.

92
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.120
<v 1>Yeah,
fraud.
However,
I'm going to try to get half run in next week.
Yeah.
Anyway,</v>

93
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:12.750
go to rogan.ting.com that's the name of the cell phone company and everything

94
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:15.390
else has explained there.
All the plans are explaining there and they,

95
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:16.800
like I said,
we had,
like we said,

96
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.170
rather they have the top of the line android phones,

97
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.550
including the the galaxy s three that Brian can't figure out.

98
00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:27.551
And the note which gives me like full on screen envy.

99
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.710
Have you seen the note?
No,
it's fucking,
it's like a tablet phone.

100
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.520
<v 2>It's pretty much like the iPads 70 like I just saw it last night.</v>

101
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.151
I'm just looking at it.

102
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:38.770
I don't know if I have you tried to put it in your pocket?
Joe
wanted to run.

103
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.030
I want to steal it and run away.
I have a fucking boner for that phone.

104
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.870
We'd all start wearing old navy painter pants.
Let's go with purses.
Fuck it.

105
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.870
Fuck it Brock.
A fanny pack.
This is ridiculous.

106
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.510
I would love somebody fucking purses.
Men to more backpacks.

107
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.170
You were but haven't declared a backpacks.

108
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.360
<v 3>I got this new one for travel channel.
This is essentially a purse.</v>

109
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.140
I'm ready to get a flight in woman's bag there,
so

110
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.050
my bag that I carry my computer around and that might well be a purse at looking

111
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:13.040
back.
He got recently.
Yeah,
it was a curse.
That was a purse.
I got one.

112
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:14.810
I was trying to be interesting for a couple of weeks.

113
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.000
I just thought it would be cool to have like one made out of saddle leather told

114
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.010
phase.
Where else?
They're like a leather,
padded saddle of the,

115
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.770
you would smell the horse and feel good when you're carrying around.
Oh,

116
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:31.400
it's so stupid.
This no zippers.
I'm like,
where's this day?
But Oh my God,

117
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:33.920
I used to have to use a buckle.
That's so dumb.

118
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.800
I was going so far back in technology.

119
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.030
Looks like George Clooney who would also wear it as a hat.
It was so heavy to,

120
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.940
where's the hat?
It's just,
it looks like the style of like a Gq,

121
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:48.500
like cleaning Brad Pitt also own this nice leather boots unnecessarily.

122
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.640
Tevye to,
they're completely unnecessarily have it.
Like it was fucking heavy.

123
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.870
Like my regular computer bag.
It's pretty light.
Throw it on my shoulders.

124
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.700
It's like this thick ass leather fucking show.
What's the course?

125
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.350
I don't look at it.
Don't remember.
Hold on.
I'll look through my,

126
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:05.720
Amazon got a leather backpack when I first moved to New York,

127
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:10.721
so I thought it'd be like an artist and I put it over my shoulder and it would,

128
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:11.391
it could,

129
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:14.440
it was a leather strap and it could never stay on my shoulder would always slide

130
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:18.260
down my wrist.
Like you're saying,
you put it on one shoulder just from course,

131
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:20.750
of course.
Fucking horrible.
Whenever you trying too hard,

132
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:23.540
it fucking blows up in your face.
God dammit.
Oh,

133
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.250
I got to see what this Sacho Sacho but in the meanwhile we were also brought to

134
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:28.320
you

135
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.400
<v 1>by on it and we were just talking about about bulletproof coffee before the
show.</v>

136
00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:34.930
We were talking about,
um,
there's a,

137
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.720
there's mold apparently on a lot of coffee and this is something that has to do

138
00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:43.140
with how the coffee is taken care of once it's picked.
You know,
what,
uh,

139
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.010
in what environment it's stored.
I guess all that shit is really important.

140
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.440
I had never even heard about it until Dave Asprey came on the podcast and uh,

141
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.420
Dave Asprey blew my fucking mind and a lot of ways,
very,
very smart cat,
but um,

142
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.030
very knowledgeable when it comes to certain areas of nutrition that I was

143
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:02.760
completely ignorant on.
That make a lot of sense.

144
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.350
<v 3>The bulletproof coffee sounds fucking awesome.
Sounds like you don't,</v>

145
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.190
you're not hungry or we feel alert.
You're not jittery.
It's like,

146
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.070
it's like a speedy sort of

147
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.800
<v 1>like all day buzz.
It's crazy.
Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.070
I've had friends who had compare it to Adderall.
I have never,

149
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.630
<v 3>oh are you are I fucking love Adderall.
Adderall.</v>

150
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.410
So my dad was on speed for awhile.
Whoa.
Yeah.
I think I might've told you this.

151
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.580
He was just eating speed.

152
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:30.430
He didn't know the doctor prescribed me cause he lose weight.

153
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:33.820
My Dad's is like losing weight.
He's like fucking pacing around hotel rooms,

154
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.970
pulling out pistols and put them on the table.
Like a speed freak.

155
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.170
Well they used to do that

156
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.950
<v 1>man.
They used to give you a phen phen do you remember the fender?</v>

157
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.040
<v 3>The two?
The first fan was a,</v>

158
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.070
I just research just cause my dad was on the second fence.
The first fan was a,

159
00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:50.400
a serotonin booster.
So it was,
yeah,
it was like,
it was like a,

160
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.380
it was like Zoloft or something like that.

161
00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:54.480
So you boosted your serotonin and the other one was speed.

162
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.130
They mixed two together.
Wow.

163
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.340
<v 0>You're like a future person.
Oh my God.
That sounds awesome.</v>

164
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.660
Happy how we all should be.
If we can maintain it.
That's what I'm saying,
right?

165
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:07.740
We've got to maintain it.
Dude.
[inaudible] hard to read line or shitty brains.

166
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.910
That's the real problem.

167
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.140
If we could just flood our brains with like opium and Mtma all day,

168
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.920
we would be so loving and care,

169
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.510
but we just cannot hang in that state and build buildings.

170
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.190
We just can't get a lot of shit done in that little things I'd have to do during

171
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:25.570
the day and I can't get through.
We got sidetracked to busy person,

172
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.030
but upgraded coffee is Dave Asprey's own personal bulletproof coffee.

173
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.870
Diane's birth.
And we started knowing this.
He sleep.
That's not colored version.

174
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.130
That is not it.
Fuck you.
Fuck your mother.

175
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.170
Leave me.
You're so silly.
You've had that up there for 10 minutes to people.

176
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.080
People watching.
They used to them like,
what the fuck is he doing?

177
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.520
Or they weren't singing.
Oh,
that's right.

178
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.410
Upgraded coffee is a Dave Asprey's coffee.
It's mold free.
And uh,

179
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:54.810
it's,
it's,
it's really interesting.
He had some really,

180
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.380
really interesting points of view that I really,
to be quite honest,

181
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:02.700
I haven't completely,
um,
looked into it 100%.
There's,

182
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.380
there's a lot of,
uh,

183
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.100
like I've always heard that like coffee was bad for like your adrenals,

184
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.810
but his,

185
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.900
his take on it is that a lot of what it is is this toxic mold that people are

186
00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:15.991
drinking,

187
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:19.800
which is firing up your adrenals because your adrenals realize it's fighting off

188
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:22.290
a poison.
I don't know if he's right about that,

189
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:25.940
but it makes a lot of fucking sense.
I told you I heard it on dangerous grounds.

190
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.950
Guy was saying majority of like 80% of coffee has mold on it and they grow it

191
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:31.350
still great coffee,
but they already harvested.

192
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.220
They're not going to not sell it because it's there.

193
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.940
It's a crop harvesting coffee.

194
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.090
It's like fucking a Peruvian dude and his wife and his kids and he just gets up

195
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:43.820
barrel it takes it into the city,
sells it like he doesn't,

196
00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:46.350
he's not going to get a fucking bit of mold on it.
Yeah,
they're just selling it.

197
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.580
If they can still sell it,
he's not going to be conscientious,
conscientious.

198
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.410
I don't think he's come down to his mind.
Moldy is shit,

199
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:53.490
you probably won't give me half price.

200
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.440
We have a bunch of other cool things at uh,

201
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.950
at [inaudible] dot com we have stuff for kids that we just started chewable

202
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:02.880
vitamin.
We have chewable Omega three Jelly Jelly candies,

203
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.820
so like gummy bear type thing or gummy worms and uh,

204
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.870
they actually have a fish oil in them.
They taste a little fishy.

205
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:13.430
I'm not gonna lie to you,
but my two year old does not mine.

206
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.810
My four year old almost fucking threw up on it,

207
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.970
but she hates everything.
But the two year old young them down man,

208
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.630
all the tastes.
That's the,

209
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.220
was a little bit of fishiness to them but it doesn't mind.
I like fishy.

210
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.990
I liked that it tastes,
but it's odd to have like fish and sugary taste,

211
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.780
but a,
they're super healthy and if you can get your kid to eat them,

212
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:38.781
I'm not guaranteeing you can [inaudible] you can't eat them.

213
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.630
They're the shit.
I got two for one for two in my house.

214
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.060
One of them loves it,
the other one can't be bothered.

215
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.710
We have but green vibrance.
It's a drink for kids.
It was great.
And we also have

216
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.120
<v 1>killer bee honey.
This is some new shit that we got.
Why killer bee honey?</v>

217
00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.530
Because it's gangster.

218
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.690
There's nothing more gangster than Dank in the fucking honey from a bunch of

219
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:08.080
savage evil bees.
That's a fucking gangster ass job.

220
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.330
Killer bee honey keeper.
Yeah.

221
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.360
That guy was a beekeeper and you have to have a big deck to pull that job off.

222
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.010
Cheapos you have to be a bold motherfucker to try to keep all those sliding

223
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:21.200
monsters in line with is figuring out a way through your nets.

224
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.750
Get to you while you're in that stupid suit and just fucking one after the
other.

225
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.800
Fly right up your nose and staying your brain and then they sent up here and

226
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:31.600
that's when they start coming and you try to run,
jump in the pool.

227
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:32.800
I don't understand killer bees.

228
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:36.700
I guess there's like bees that we used to have that didn't,

229
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.910
that weren't as aggressive and that these killer bees are more aggressive.

230
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.650
It was,
I think they filled them out.
They're from Africa.

231
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.430
But do you remember like when everybody was afraid of bees,

232
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.860
like we know we can't make up her mind.

233
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.780
There was like a period in the 90s where everybody was terrified of killer bees

234
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.640
and you would Africanize killer bees.
So you picture these bees,
these big decks,

235
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.600
decks with wigs on and on and fucking yeah,

236
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.780
and like a Michael Jordan Jersey with a fucking machete.
Yeah.

237
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.360
And everybody was terrified of these Africanized killer beans.

238
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.170
And then it became,
everybody was terrified cause there's no bs.
My,

239
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.950
that's what's going on now there's a us to my backyard.

240
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:14.770
My wife and I went to go get rid of it cause of the girls.
And my wife's like,
no,

241
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:15.700
no,
no,
you can't do that.

242
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.900
Then I realized she planted fucking all the bushes around our house to attract

243
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:24.370
bees.
Your wife did on purpose.
Yeah.
She wants to be.
Yeah.
It's just crazy.
Well,

244
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.660
listen,
bees can sting you,

245
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:29.470
but they perform a great service as far as pollinating plants and stuff.

246
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:33.370
It's not crazy die after they sting you.
Oh,
the kind of country,
you know,

247
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:36.190
there's all kinds of animals.
Not only did they die,
when they sting you,

248
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:40.120
they die when they fuck when male honeybees.
Fuck their dicks explode.
Yeah.

249
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:42.850
The Dick dislodges until the woman and they bleed out.

250
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.920
That's nature telling you to go fuck yourself.

251
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.900
That's nature telling you that it does not like it.
It made a mistake.
This,

252
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.260
this be is just like,
we just threw a little bit too much aggression into this.

253
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:55.210
Be Crazy.

254
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:58.180
How is that even on the phone possible while every other animal can defend

255
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:01.390
itself,
like a B is the only animal that when it,

256
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:04.420
when it sinks into you once that's a wrap.
Yeah.
Yeah.

257
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.930
You'd never think you think they hear about that and they'd stop.
Yeah.

258
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:10.420
Nature didn't really like them that much.

259
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.990
Nature didn't give him a good design like s like a spider spider stings unit.

260
00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:18.850
It's fine.
Be Fine.
The spider doesn't,
it doesn't bother the spider.

261
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.190
I mean that's what he's supposed to do.

262
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.080
Staying the fuck out of you hosting a couple of more times to,
that's,

263
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.240
that's these fighters do.
Bees are kind of like,

264
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:27.520
they're just trying to hold it together.
They're like Bobbi Brown.

265
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:30.670
Like Donald want to get too fucking crazy.
You think so?
Yeah.

266
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:33.190
Cause there's like if you're the we Fokker we fight and we're dead.

267
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.660
Just keep it on the DL.
Yeah,
you got to really walk a line man.

268
00:14:37.661 --> 00:14:42.610
You got to balance on a fucking rope rope.
If you're a battle rope,

269
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.180
if you're a B,
we have battle ropes as well.
What a battle ropes.

270
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:49.420
Better ropes is first of all manly as fuck.
Okay.
And when you get your weight,

271
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.400
your workout in from hurling ropes around back and forth,

272
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.680
that's a mail man strength that you can use a tussle.
Okay.

273
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.510
<v 4>You should sell slack lines too.</v>

274
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.950
What's a slackline mother fucking great to throw up in my backyard for my kids.

275
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.410
What is it?
It's like a,
it's like a tie down.
You know there's,

276
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.240
there's crank crank,
crank tiedowns are like this.
It's a tie down a,

277
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.840
it's like a strap that you tie down on the truck.
You've seen her in the truck.

278
00:15:10.841 --> 00:15:12.500
Okay.
Yeah.
And it's about like this wide,

279
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:16.230
two inches wide and it's yellow and it's just the strap and you strap the strap

280
00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:21.060
to two trees and then let it hang off the ground like a foot.
And it,
it sways,

281
00:15:21.061 --> 00:15:22.710
it's got like a swing and a bounce to it.

282
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.720
And I let my kids get up there and try to walk on it.

283
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.260
And they've gotten so fucking good at it that now they get on and they can like

284
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.710
move their body and swing.
I was like,
where does that pay off?
Well,

285
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.280
my wife takes my girls ice skating for the first time and everyone's got the old

286
00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:38.460
lady walkers when they ice skate until the ice skate now with like an old lady

287
00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:41.750
Walker.
Right.
So they don't fall.
Now my kids fucking threw that shit to the side,

288
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.580
started ice skating because they're fucking balances gangster.
Wow.

289
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.070
Fucking skiing.
If you type in like dudes slacklining it's,

290
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.920
and it's huge in Colorado.
Dude,
I got,
let me tell you something.

291
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.590
I am powerful Burke Christ and drop and fitness knowledge.
I'm fucking to paddle.

292
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:58.530
Boarding's hardy shit.

293
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.140
I've tried to paddle board like four or five times it every single time on PR

294
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.850
broke my foot last time.
Like he was,
it was when we shot that episode in La.

295
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.400
We went paddle boarding also.
Wow.
And,
and I fucking,
I ain't shit so hard.

296
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.760
Yeah.
Paddleboarding looks like it'd be difficult.
I'll tell you another funny,

297
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.340
<v 1>I'm going to try that slack line thing though.
I gotta I gotta look that up.</v>

298
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.620
But uh,
anyway,
on a.com go there,
buy some kettle bells and battle ropes,

299
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.950
all kinds of other things.
You dirty fucks,
fish gummies,

300
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.580
fish gummies and uh,
and that's it.

301
00:16:30.581 --> 00:16:34.090
Use a codename Rogan and you'll save 10% off any and all supplements that

302
00:16:34.091 --> 00:16:38.350
includes,
um,
uh,
Alpha brain and includes shroom tech sport,

303
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.170
which is a must.
If you work out,
you're,
you're,
you're,

304
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.040
you're fucking yourself if you don't use it.
It's true.
Tech Sports,

305
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.130
amazing for like really intense workouts were that you did two or kickboxing or

306
00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:50.830
something.
There's like a noticeable difference when I don't take that.

307
00:16:50.831 --> 00:16:53.680
So you take it before.
Yeah,
I take it about an hour before I work out.

308
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.060
<v 4>I take medicine,
I take the,
the fucking new mood that really works.</v>

309
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.280
Like that is one of those things where I was actually kind of shocked at how

310
00:17:03.281 --> 00:17:04.100
fucking little work.

311
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.210
<v 1>Well,
it's been proven that five HTP can boost your serotonin levels been proven.</v>

312
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:12.350
So there's that.
And there's also,
the new mood has a l trip to fan,

313
00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:13.850
which converts to five HCP.

314
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.050
So l trip to fan converts to five HTP converts and Serotonin and you're,

315
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:21.770
you know,
it's like the,
the idea is that it's a slow release.

316
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:25.220
A fact was fucking awesome.
So it's an effective blend of the,
you know,

317
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:30.140
the two different like mechanisms to get Serotonin,
but it's,
uh,
you know,

318
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.610
everybody should eat healthy.

319
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.030
And if you can take vitamins that can make you feel better,

320
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.730
why wouldn't you do it?
I don't understand why people,

321
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.970
I know that it feels good to eat shitty food and it

322
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.930
<v 4>feels good to fuck off.
It doesn't anymore.
I lost 30 pounds and I'm fucking,
I,</v>

323
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:50.100
anytime I eat shitty,
I feel sick.
I feel physically fucking ill.
I

324
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.590
<v 3>like it.
I like cheeseburgers and shit.
I love cheese.
When she got to do,</v>

325
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.720
you've got to earn that shit.
You gotta earn that Shit.
No,
that's what I think.

326
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.560
Even still,
my stomach gets fucked up.
I had a,
I had a cheeseburger the other day,

327
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:04.560
first cheeseburger and like in like four months.
What have you been in?

328
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:06.390
You've been going Vegan on me,
so no,
no.
I did the,

329
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:07.920
I did that clean program cleanse,

330
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.890
lost like lost like 20 pounds and then kept losing weight.

331
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:13.660
I got down to about two oh five right now.
That's awesome.
Yeah,

332
00:18:13.661 --> 00:18:16.030
and that's amazing.
My blood pressure is perfect.
My Hell.

333
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.810
Like everything's fucking perfect.
That's fantastic dude.

334
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.350
[inaudible] but now they're like,
I go get like a cheeseburger like,

335
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.370
like because in their clean program you take everything out of your fucking
diet.

336
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.490
Like no cheese,
no booze,
no nothing,
no caffeine.

337
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.060
And then you start putting it in slowly and you realize what gets you sick man.

338
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:35.040
Fucking cheeseburgers make me sick to my stomach.

339
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.240
<v 5>That's so ridiculous.
That goddamn delicious.</v>

340
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.040
You sound like an American right now.

341
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.450
I don't know who the fuck is pulling your strings.
Puppet.
This is bullshit.

342
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.870
I'm down with cheeseburgers folks.
But I say you got to earn him.

343
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:51.070
That's what I say.
And the majority of your meals should be spent eating healthy,

344
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.780
nutrient rich and dense.
Just each Kale shakes all day.

345
00:18:55.781 --> 00:18:59.260
Bitch are you want to be super healthy?
It doesn't taste the best,

346
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.300
but if you ate kale shakes all day,
you'd be healthy as fuck.
You'd be vibrant.

347
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.080
And there's a ton of protein and Kale too.
We make uh,
we we'd sell rather,

348
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.520
we do make a hemp force,
which is a,
um,
a hemp based protein,

349
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.350
but we also sell with the Blendtec blenders that are the best blenders for

350
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.000
making those kinds of like vegetable shakes.

351
00:19:19.001 --> 00:19:21.820
It really makes it like super liquid.
I do it every day.

352
00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:23.560
It's fucking fantastic for you.

353
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.850
I throw some Kale in there and Rog garlic and Roger

354
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.170
<v 3>did yours by the way.
Yours tastes like shit.
My majors one time.</v>

355
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.540
It's not fucking Ms. So aggresses yeah,
it's very aggressive.

356
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.790
It's not necessarily taste good.

357
00:19:37.791 --> 00:19:41.510
It's to make you feel like a fucking viking and the ship works.

358
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.390
Go get yourself something days.
Just hands back on Joe.

359

It's time to get freaky.

364
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.270
<v 6>Let's try five day Joe Rogan podcast all day.</v>

365
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.850
<v 3>Dude,
this is a conspiracy afoot.
You have to put the Rory Macdonald,</v>

366
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.240
<v 5>uh,

<v 3>There you go.</v>

369
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.060
<v 6>Well,
good experience Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

370
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.150
<v 3>He's just very disrespectful to remove a dude's call out.</v>

371
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.920
I was just pushing the wrong button on the wrong thing to camera roll that dude.

372
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:33.220
Shout out if someone had asked me about it.
Like is it,

373
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.740
did I did that the last couple of years?
Currently I don't pay attention.

374
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.920
You know,
I,
I it's,
it's right now we've heard it so many times.

375
00:20:39.921 --> 00:20:43.190
It's sort of like actually think we need somebody else to add to it.
So,
oh,

376
00:20:43.191 --> 00:20:46.890
don't say that.
Yeah.
He can't request those though.
Dude,
I'm making a request,

377
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.343
request

378
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.100
<v 2>request and planning mind when I do it,
it's gonna be on a big,</v>

379
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:52.900
it's going to be like on Rachael Ray and I'm going to,

380
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.740
I'm going to make her say it on accident and I'm just going to get her to sign

381
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:59.890
it in.
I had a dream about her last night.
Why you love her,
Huh?
No,
I don't.

382
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.720
God Damn it.
I'm trying to do a long can start up the gates.
No,
I don't love.

383
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.960
I do love her.
I love her.
I love this woman that I love,
that aren't,

384
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.810
I'm not in love with them,
but I love him.
She's just really cool.

385
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.750
<v 5>What's that?
Oh,
John out from the UFC is a woman who works for the UFC.</v>

386
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:21.070
She's the nicest lady of all time.
I love the shit out of her.
Yeah.
I love Oprah.

387
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:21.904
I kind of love him.

388
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.890
<v 2>Yeah,
you live.
How far would you fuck,
bro,
Bro?
No,
I don't love thinking about it.</v>

389
00:21:25.891 --> 00:21:28.640
Think about it.
Think about it.
Oh No,
hold on.
Nope,
let's back it up.
Like,

390
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.820
I fucked a dude if you left me in prison.
Let's be realistic.

391
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.420
I'll probably fuck over.
Yeah,
for sure.

392
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.960
But I would like me.
You're asking me

393
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.030
<v 5>fucking ridiculous questions.
I can.</v>

394
00:21:42.031 --> 00:21:44.730
I used to have a whole bit about for as a hole in the wall in my house,

395
00:21:44.731 --> 00:21:45.590
I think I would fuck it.

396
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.810
It was warm and I came home drunk and I stuck my finger in there and be like,

397
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.700
wow,
Jesus.
No,
I can't believe I fucked my house again.

398
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.150
It was like a stupid bed.
A little bit about fucking my house.

399
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.400
I'd fuck up,
bro.
Yeah.
Well I just love her.

400
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.620
I love what she does.
It sounds ridiculous,
but just every time I look at Oprah,

401
00:22:07.621 --> 00:22:10.800
she's always promoting positivity.
Like every,
everything is positive.

402
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.060
Everything is.
Let's go to Africa and started school.
You know,

403
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.590
let's help these people.
Let's tell you how to eat right.

404
00:22:16.591 --> 00:22:19.350
Let's tell you how to be healthier.
Let's tell you how to,
you know,

405
00:22:19.351 --> 00:22:22.500
make your house more eco friendly.
It's like everything's positive.

406
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.910
She's such a positive person.
I bet she did improve.

407
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.350
She should improve your life a little bit.
It's like a weird thing with people.

408
00:22:28.351 --> 00:22:32.460
It's like if you say that you like Oprah,
like someone will say like,

409
00:22:32.461 --> 00:22:35.610
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like how would you like Oprah?

410
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.590
She was like this woman show or a bunch of fucking caddy wenches.

411
00:22:40.591 --> 00:22:44.490
Sit around and talk nonsense.
How groovy man go on there.

412
00:22:44.491 --> 00:22:48.510
And essentially uncle Tom it,
I wouldn't pretend to agree with her.
And she,
he

413
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.770
<v 2>did you see the pan across the audience and uh,</v>

414
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.480
when she does my favorite things episode and it stops on Joe,

415
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:56.350
just really excited.

416
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.590
She's always
struck

417
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:07.590
<v 5>me as being a person who is like legitimately used all of our stardom in a good</v>

418
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:08.950
way.
Yeah.

419
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:14.220
Like there's just no like crazy like stories of extravagance that you hear about

420
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:17.080
her,
you know,
like doing crazy things.

421
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.760
She's always like being positive and doing nice things like for someone is that

422
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:25.040
successful?
That's pretty fucking rare.
You know?
I think that's,

423
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.630
that's to be commended,
you know?
And if that makes me some sort of a girly man,

424
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.610
okay,
fine,
I'm to fucking girly man,
fuck her.
Or Ellen,

425
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.020
I don't think I'd like to fuck either one of them.
I respect those ladies.

426
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.040
I don't think that they need me inside of them.
If you had to choose one,

427
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.500
if I had to choose one or that,
that dude,
I found it,

428
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.160
I would have interview the both be

429
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.820
<v 0>valid.
But you're each year it would be the one who's the end it the most.</v>

430
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.850
The one who wanted to give it a shot,
you know,
I would do,
I would say,
listen,

431
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.580
the the,
the aliens are going to make us fuck.
Okay.

432
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:56.930
It would be like a star trek episode.

433
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.580
Remember where it wasn't that part of the crooked a fuck that green chick.

434
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.950
I don't know if they follow through with the photo.

435
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.390
Maybe I'm missing my plot lines off my mind.
My point is if you,
you know,

436
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.590
you were alone with them and said,
listen ladies,
the aliens have intervened.

437
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:17.210
So I got fuck one of you.
Okay.
To save the world,
we're gonna have to fuck.
So,
uh,

438
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.930
who's into it?
Who wants to give it a shot to let them pick?
Fuck yeah.

439
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.580
Whoever is the boy.
I'd go,
listen,
one of you is going to have to sacrifice.
Okay,

440
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:28.400
we're going to have to do this.
Yeah,
so whoever it is,

441
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:30.710
I'm fine with either one of you.
I definitely wouldn't Oprah.

442
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.780
I would want it to be the one who wants it the most.

443
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.810
I want to just see the curtain come down.
If Alan was like,

444
00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:39.200
I've been thinking I'm more attracted to Ellen,
maybe I'm not lesbian.

445
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.390
What if she was thinking like Berta bds just fucked me correctly once I didn't

446
00:24:44.391 --> 00:24:46.070
push her right back over the fence,

447
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.540
carry me to the bed and make sweet love to her.

448
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.970
That's what every guy believes right in the back of his mind.

449
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.470
Can't change someone's sexuality.

450
00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:59.471
Every guy believes that lesbians are only lesbians because they ain't got up

451
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.040
pizza this week.

452
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.090
<v 2>What I'm saying,
fuck.</v>

453
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.210
I'd make him wear a wig and I would eat her out for like an hour and then fuck

454
00:25:06.211 --> 00:25:09.000
the shit out of her and she would be like,
what the fuck?
She'd be like,
Jesus,

455
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.330
I live with two lesbians in New York for Awhile at that felt so much better.

456
00:25:12.331 --> 00:25:17.280
Yeah.
Ellen don't get fucked.
Yeah.
It was be like,
oh my God,
I felt so much better.

457
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.160
<v 0>What she wants is probably a man that behaves like a woman</v>

458
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.760
<v 2>and she can be the man.
Why do you think he bought Justin beaver?
That car?</v>

459
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.430
I put Justin Bieber hit that shit.
Who bought that car?

460
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.430
Ellen bought Justin Bieber like this really expensive shiny robot car that's

461
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.030
shiny home.
The fifth one.
Yeah.

462
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.610
Ellen bought that for her after he fucked the shit out of your,
probably.

463
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.000
You think so?
Maybe so.

464
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.030
<v 0>He's,
he's too young to know.
What the fuck did you do a as well.</v>

465
00:25:45.031 --> 00:25:48.270
He knows you've gotta be very careful if you try to break into the lesbian.

466
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.480
By the way,
if you're a lesbian right now and you're getting offended by this,

467
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.520
how dare you take yourself so seriously,

468
00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.720
pussy and freak and you're yourself and you stop them there licking,

469
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.670
licking boxes and you think that I'm a Weirdo.
I love,
I love you.

470
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.420
Do whatever you want.
That's not my point.

471
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.830
My point is if you were going to try to talk a lesbian over from the dark side,

472
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.690
you have to be a man of experience.

473
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.590
I would have to say you have to be a strong man of some,
some accomplishments,

474
00:26:13.591 --> 00:26:18.591
probably 20s at least a liberal lesbians for two years in New York.

475
00:26:19.021 --> 00:26:21.220
And there was no,
that's something that you,

476
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.730
that was the signal they were sending out to you.

477
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.110
They were not in Shit in fucking you.

478
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.890
The only time that you saw them interact with men you around as well.

479
00:26:28.891 --> 00:26:32.300
So you've tainted the,
the,
the tire experiments.

480
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.030
My study group was contaminated it.
Well you were in it.
Oh No,

481
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.350
he's fucking women.
They don't have nothing to do with it.
[inaudible] yeah,

482
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:45.210
cause you were with them 100 of the time that you were with them.
Yeah.

483
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.930
So you're all your database that you've drawn from their behavior was around,

484
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:52.200
you know,
but I think they were be there as well.

485
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.980
So you want to send any free signals of a fucking possible gang.
Bang.
You know,

486
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:58.680
you get them drunk and they're like,
whoa.
All right,
let's just try it for us.

487
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.710
Come on everybody together.
You were around and they were like,

488
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:05.730
we don't like guys at all.
If you get that,
get that.
Did you get that bird?

489
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.120
No deck at all or it's like,
oh okay.
Shit.

490
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.750
<v 4>No,
they were there.
They were,
I dated one of them for awhile.</v>

491
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.810
<v 0>The defense rests tech.
Just what I just said.</v>

492
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.710
You did it to him.
Bert turned them.
You turn them or you can do that.
If you,

493
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.340
if you're a shitty enough boyfriend,
you can't turn a check.

494
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.900
<v 4>I have,
I uh,
I don't,
I don't know about that either.
Boy.
Maybe I'd,
maybe you can.</v>

495
00:27:29.901 --> 00:27:32.480
Cause you do see some of those women that are just like in their,

496
00:27:32.481 --> 00:27:34.850
like late fifties and they're like,
they're just like,

497
00:27:34.851 --> 00:27:36.170
I'm better with another woman.

498
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.760
<v 5>I think that there's nothing wrong with the idea of loving somebody who you,</v>

499
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:45.400
whoever you love,
if you love a man,
if you love a woman,

500
00:27:45.401 --> 00:27:48.310
if they love you back and yeah,
whatever you guys like doing together,

501
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:49.841
I'm all for it.

502
00:27:49.841 --> 00:27:54.841
100% but when you look at like why try to speculate like why a person goes gay

503
00:27:57.521 --> 00:28:00.010
or while am person,
you know,
why a person to assist,

504
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.370
there's so many factors you have to take into consideration.

505
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.020
Who the fuck knows psychologically who the fuck knows physically what anybody

506
00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:09.700
thinks or feels?
Who knows?

507
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.090
So it's so hard to like point in any individual one,

508
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:18.300
but I think that ultimately it would be a little easier in this culture for a

509
00:28:19.331 --> 00:28:24.331
woman to like just give up on men and have and start having a relationship with

510
00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.810
other women because it's sort of much more culturally accepted than if a man

511
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.650
just was like,
stop trying to get laid,
like really

512
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.110
<v 0>straight,
but girls just won't fuck them.
But guys are always trying to fuck them.</v>

513
00:28:35.111 --> 00:28:38.290
And he's like,
all right,
come on.
Come on.
Come fuck me.
Somebody has got to fuck.

514
00:28:38.291 --> 00:28:40.840
I'm fucking somebody.
It sounds fucking me.
I guess I'm gay now.

515
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.960
That's much rarer that a guy will never heard of a guy getting tapped out of it.

516
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.380
Yeah,
right.
But women do give up on men.
Like,
I've talked

517
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.280
<v 5>to women and you,
you know,
you ask him like,
you know the,
I talked to him,</v>

518
00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:58.281
one who was gay and then she was straight and then she was gagging and uh,

519
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.390
and I was like,
well what happened?
Like what,

520
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:04.830
what like was it just you were changing like your body was changing?
She goes,

521
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:08.550
I just,
I gave up.
She was like,
just,
I when I was hanging out with girls,

522
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:12.570
like we could be cuddling together and you know,
and nobody would,
you know,

523
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.800
be angry at me or yell at me or hit me.
And it was just like,

524
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.820
it was warm and friendly.
There's never that feeling of violence.
Like some girls,

525
00:29:20.821 --> 00:29:23.040
again,
a path loop and there'll be a brown,

526
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.790
a certain type of guy and then they'll find themselves like repeating that

527
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:28.080
pattern for some strange reason.

528
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:31.050
Like they're attracted to these guys that are like really abusive and mean to

529
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:31.370
them.

530
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.470
<v 4>There can be abusive and lesbian relationships would,</v>

531
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.810
that was one of the things that were the ones I love with.

532
00:29:35.811 --> 00:29:37.940
They'd beat the shit out of each other.
It's so crazy.

533
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.000
Like they get fucked up and then something would pop off and next thing you,

534
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.590
someone would throw a punch and then I'd try to break it up.
So then,

535
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.850
cause I was there with my friends,

536
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.880
so I break it up and then they'd start fighting me.
So then you are,

537
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.690
I remember one time I had won,
I have won by like the,

538
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.410
by like the shirt and I was holding the door that I had thrown the other one in

539
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:58.060
and I wasn't letting them get at each other

540
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.410
<v 5>when I was young.
When I was doing taekwondo,</v>

541
00:30:01.411 --> 00:30:04.440
there was this lady who was like a US national champion that trained out of our

542
00:30:04.441 --> 00:30:08.820
gym and she was a lesbian and she was really aggressive and she would spar with

543
00:30:08.821 --> 00:30:13.050
men and fucking light them up really?
And she was a black belt.

544
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.110
Have you sparred with many women?
Really good.
Very rarely.

545
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.900
And when you do [inaudible] Kim,
sorry,

546
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:27.480
excuse me,
I load,
I gotta load,
caught my throat load a flim ladies and gentlemen,

547
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.940
um,
when you spar with them,
you gotta be very careful.

548
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.510
You can't hit them hard and just beat the shit.
No,
not at all.

549
00:30:33.511 --> 00:30:36.780
It's mostly move and just be defensive.
If you,
if you really hit them,

550
00:30:36.781 --> 00:30:40.380
you have to really check your,
your,
your power and you have to be really nice.

551
00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:44.940
Like I've never seen,
well I've seen guys like get a little too rough,

552
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:48.120
but I've never seen it like accepted where everyone says like,
you know,

553
00:30:48.121 --> 00:30:50.840
the women have to fucking get in there and fucking footage.
Just

554
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.030
if you're sparring with a chicken,

555
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.670
you better be technical and just be real gentle with how you hit them.
Oh,

556
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.500
very diverse part of the chick I have,
you know,
if she's part of the right ones,

557
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.440
it's cool.
You know?
It's just like they have to trust you.
You have to trust them.

558
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.940
That's the whole thing about sparring.

559
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.690
The beautiful thing about Jujitsu is that you can go full blast.

560
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.830
That was this curious thing about Jujitsu.
No,

561
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.520
that's the most beautiful thing because you can't really do that.
And kickboxing,

562
00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:18.510
see when you're in kickboxing,
if you go full blast,
you can,

563
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.920
you can do it every day if you want.

564
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:22.830
But that your brain is not going to fucking last.
It's just not,

565
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.480
it's not going to last and you will,

566
00:31:24.481 --> 00:31:29.460
you will ruin your body before you ever get to a high skill proficiency.

567
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.420
Like there's this misconception that it'll make you tougher if you just put the

568
00:31:33.421 --> 00:31:36.750
gloves on and just fucking whale at each other.
Yeah,
I mean in a certain sense,

569
00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:37.111
yes,

570
00:31:37.111 --> 00:31:40.200
it will make you less terrified of going to war because you go to a war every

571
00:31:40.201 --> 00:31:43.550
day.
But in another sense it won't make you better at war.
Okay.
You know,

572
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.100
it's too violent.
It's too crazy.
It's too,
it's too dangerous.
The,

573
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:51.060
the best way to learn is to learn with someone who you know is not going to hit

574
00:31:51.061 --> 00:31:52.440
you.
Like if you and I respond,

575
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:57.060
I would know that you wouldn't be a deck and you wouldn't hit me full blast and

576
00:31:57.061 --> 00:31:58.440
I would never hit you full blast.

577
00:31:58.441 --> 00:32:00.930
And so if we just sort of hit each other like that,

578
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:05.100
so when you move and you can catch you there and you're going fast,
you go fast.

579
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.660
But when you kick each other,
you'd go like that.

580
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.770
You just pull it back and just started stop at that and it hurts a little bit

581
00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:11.604
but not bad.

582
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:16.560
And that's the way to spar because when you spot that way then you understand

583
00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:20.910
timing and movement and you can do it much freer so you can absorb going to hold

584
00:32:20.911 --> 00:32:25.140
off the shin.
Yes,
he pulled back and you absorb information much,
much better.

585
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.640
And then occasionally you spar hard and occasionally spar hard just to sort of

586
00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:32.460
put it together,
just sort of make you short.
You can do it under pressure,

587
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.370
but the real power work is never done in sparring.

588
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.550
Power work should be done hitting the bag,
hitting the myths.

589
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.390
That's where you go full on full blast with sparring.

590
00:32:41.391 --> 00:32:44.390
You just working timing and positioning.
That's for the most part.

591
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:46.280
That's why the guys that are really technical,

592
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:50.540
like the the ties a lot of times especially cause they fight a lot.

593
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.100
They don't spar that much.

594
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.040
Mostly what they're doing is like hitting the bag and hitting pads because these

595
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:59.120
motherfuckers might have a hundred fights plus,
you know,
so they don't,

596
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:03.650
they don't wear themselves out.
Bless you.
Bless you.
My child.

597
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:08.240
Bless you.
So,
um,
they're,
they're,
they're much more,

598
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.450
they're much more conservative with their bodies,

599
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:14.380
like as far as like how the abuse,
their bodies and training.
But uh,

600
00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.790
a lot of American MMA camps,

601
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:19.670
they get this crazy idea that you're supposed to just fucking banging out all

602
00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:23.240
the time.
And so they'll have these like full power sparring sessions.

603
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.980
That's what a lot of people used to do.
You know,

604
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:28.280
a lot of people who are a little bit ignorant as to like the effects on the

605
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:29.680
brain,
like the effects on it.

606
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.260
<v 2>Got It.
Now you see that and you look at people and you're like,
wow,</v>

607
00:33:32.261 --> 00:33:34.510
they're going to have a tough time.
Like you look at like,
uh,

608
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.400
like Brett Farve or something like that.
And you're like,

609
00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:38.140
so this happened to all those dudes?

610
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:38.680
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

611
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.500
What's the dude's name that was on the cover of sports illustrated recently?

612
00:33:41.501 --> 00:33:46.370
He used to be the quarterback for the Chicago bears and he like,
yeah,

613
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.120
he,
she won't let him drive because he gets lost.
Yeah.

614
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.350
<v 2>Like that's fucking terrifying.
And he was one of those like Brett Farve,</v>

615
00:33:52.351 --> 00:33:55.260
like rough and tumble,
like really put it out.
I'm quarterbacks,

616
00:33:55.261 --> 00:33:57.480
I'm going to fucking bang heads if we need to bang heads.

617
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.270
<v 5>Well,
Kudos to him for being honest about this too,
because he sounds fine.</v>

618
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.700
Like when you talk to you,
when you hear him talking to interviews,

619
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:08.270
if he was in denial about all this,
then bring it up.
He sounds fine.

620
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:11.450
Like he was doing that.
I was those that,
I remember that dude's sports show.

621
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:15.920
He's got a sport go ball.
No,
some guy,
it's a radio show,

622
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:20.330
but it's also on TV going anyway.
It's not important.
Uh,
Dan Patrick.
Yes.

623
00:34:20.331 --> 00:34:24.050
Thank you.
Dan.
Pat Powerful.
Dan Patrick [inaudible] who's doing Dan Patrick show.

624
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:28.130
And when he was talking to him,
he sounded like completely normal.
Like you,

625
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:30.290
you know,
he said,
well,
you know,
sometimes I'll,
you know,

626
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.090
and they were telling stories about like,
dude,

627
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.180
find him like in the kitchen not knowing where he's going,
how he got there.

628
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.950
It just be stuck,
you know?

629
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:40.490
And when I was a young kid and he was a superstar.

630
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.990
<v 2>Oh he was a fucking monster.</v>

631
00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:44.240
He used to go to the golf courses in player played barefoot.

632
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.030
That's just remember that's the fucking celebrity that I remember.

633
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:49.580
Like when you have something fascinating like what do you

634
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.620
<v 5>be barefoot?
Just he's eccentric and they would let him do that.</v>

635
00:34:52.621 --> 00:34:57.110
He was Jim fucking McMann.
Some guys play pool barefoot.
Really?
Yeah.

636
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.290
I just thought it was really weird.

637
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:03.720
But I bet back like a lot of what pools about is like about feeling the table

638
00:35:03.721 --> 00:35:06.570
and feeling the floor.
Like yeah,
it's about feel.

639
00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.700
So maybe plant barefoot would be good.
Like you know,

640
00:35:08.701 --> 00:35:11.520
that's a big thing of majority can out now working at barefoot.
Yeah,

641
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.980
I am working out barefoot.
Uh,
they uh,

642
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:17.550
Steve Maxwell is a big proponent of this stuff and especially like doing

643
00:35:17.551 --> 00:35:20.730
kettlebell workouts and stuff.
Don't drop it on your fucking foot.
Stupid.

644
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.270
I dropped a fucking,
I dropped

645
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:25.120
<v 2>the dumbbell.
I'm doing,
uh,
I'm doing,</v>

646
00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.620
I sometimes I'll do this quick like shoulders buys lats,

647
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.380
like just bang them out like 10 times 10,
right.
With weights.

648
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.330
And so I'm doing them and I put the weights up to rest.

649
00:35:34.331 --> 00:35:37.410
I put them on the arm of my couch and I'm watching TV and all of a sudden I just

650
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:38.244
hear Jeff

651
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.370
<v 4>and it right on the top of my foot and I was,</v>

652
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:44.000
and it had a dent in it and I was like,
motherfucker,
I broke.

653
00:35:44.001 --> 00:35:45.690
It just broke my foot.
And I got,

654
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:50.310
you know when you like when you cut your finger cutting onions and then the

655
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.080
second you cut it,
you're like,
I want to take that moment back.

656
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.250
Like I don't want that moment to happen.
You feel so stupid.
Yeah.

657
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.280
<v 1>Do you ever recommended somebody cause you weren't paying attention to unless</v>

658
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:59.400
your foot off the brake?

659
00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.140
<v 4>A cop.
Oh,
fucking cop.</v>

660
00:36:03.141 --> 00:36:06.800
I had to take shifts and I sneezed and hit a cop.
My God.

661
00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.700
Oh no you didn't.
Yeah,
that's fucking state trooper.

662
00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:14.930
Just pay him got out of his car like confused.
That's hilarious.
Oh,

663
00:36:14.931 --> 00:36:19.280
here I got to mention this.
Finally,
Death Squad,
Ohio and death squads,

664
00:36:19.281 --> 00:36:23.720
Scotland.
Your products have arrived.
These are,

665
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.300
uh,
this buck fast is an,

666
00:36:26.301 --> 00:36:29.960
an is a payer apparently like a really dangerous shit for LSD.

667
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:33.470
You just taking this stuff from random fan fucking shit.
No,

668
00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:35.510
I usually just open the top.
I just opened the top.

669
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.870
This easily could be laced but isn't a wine.

670
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:44.600
Everyone gives me a bottles and they always say with like the,
the like,
hey,

671
00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:48.590
bring this back to to La and give it to Joe or do it in the future.

672
00:36:48.591 --> 00:36:52.250
Don't do that shit.
Yeah.
Well it's too late.
We're already started drinking it,

673
00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:56.690
but yeah.
Thank you gentlemen.
Whoever,
whoever purchased it and it's very kind.

674
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.540
All their names are written.
We appreciate it very much.
It's very cool.

675
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:01.190
Rock is one of the nicest things

676
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.780
<v 1>about this podcast is a,
how many cool people,
uh,</v>

677
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:09.540
we have met in how many cool people that it affected,
you know,
the the most,

678
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:14.190
I hate to use that word powerful again,
but that's the perfect place for it.

679
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.810
The most powerful messages that I get are all these people telling me that like

680
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:22.410
the podcast changed their life,
like all of a sudden became ambitious.

681
00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:23.360
Like I lost a hundred.

682
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.430
<v 4>How do you see that dude who lost a ton of weight?
He posted his pictures.
I lost</v>

683
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.550
<v 1>one man.
I listened to a couple and a couple together.
They,
they,</v>

684
00:37:30.551 --> 00:37:34.250
they each last more than 90 pounds and they came to one of my shows.
It's,
well,

685
00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:37.460
it's like choked me up man.
It chokes me up right now.
I'm talking about it.

686
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.570
It's a,

687
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.370
<v 4>it's opened a line of dialogue that is,</v>

688
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:44.300
that is unlike Twitter or Facebook because you're having genuine conversations

689
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.810
with people that are listening and then they know a part of you and you forget

690
00:37:47.811 --> 00:37:50.030
that you tell them that.
So like everyone knows your secrets,

691
00:37:50.031 --> 00:37:51.230
they know everything about you almost.

692
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.770
And then for stand up it makes stand up even crazier because then you go to do

693
00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:55.700
stand up and they're like,
Ooh,

694
00:37:55.701 --> 00:37:59.660
tell the time that you peed on your girlfriend's dining room table.
And I'm like,

695
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.210
I thought a joke.
And they're like,
just tell it like they don't even care.

696
00:38:02.211 --> 00:38:05.780
Like everyone's yelling.
Flying dildos now should make that a bit,
Hey Brian,

697
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.750
<v 1>give me some of that.
Uh,
the Zions Chaz too.
Is there any more of that?
Yeah,</v>

698
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:10.590
there is,
right.

699
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:15.180
<v 4>Oh,
I just drink it on the rocks.
You guys got ice?
Uh,
yeah,
we have ice now,
so,
uh,</v>

700
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.040
yeah,
it's been crazy.
You know,
it's so funny man.

701
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.030
Everyone that we've done these trips flip things with.

702
00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.880
The majority of them are all dead squat fans.
I told you that one group,

703
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.820
one couple I took to Vegas,
I've found them in Denver.

704
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.700
They heard me the night before on your part,

705
00:38:28.701 --> 00:38:30.270
the day before on your podcast mentioned.

706
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.330
And they come riding up on their bikes and they say,

707
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:36.160
they tell me this sweet story about how,
um,
how bite all

708
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.800
<v 3>through Europe and they didn't have any entertainment so they just listened on</v>

709
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:42.790
his iPhone to death squad and Joe Rogan podcasts.
And they're like,
they're like,

710
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:43.750
you know,
it's so funny you guys,

711
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.420
you guys basically traveled through Europe with us every night.

712
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:49.480
We listen to you guys in our tent.
And I was like,
wow.
And then they're like,

713
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:53.140
it's so crazy to be partying with you.
I will say this.
Everyone in Austin,
Texas,

714
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.750
I am looking for new trip flip contested shit.

715
00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:01.000
Saturday this Saturday,
Saturday I might go down.

716
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.320
Why don't you got to do a set?

717
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.560
I talked to the club and told them you work at a in Austin a once a year,

718
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:08.620
but I haven't worked there yet because I always had to cancel.
I love that place.

719
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.330
I think I might go back and do a,
um,
a club because I just did a theater.

720
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.060
They're like,
I'm going to go back to club.
Yeah.
Just to,

721
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:18.820
I want to work on some new shit that's a fucking,
I want to go to their club.

722
00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:21.340
I emailed them,
play,
emailed them and told them that I was gonna be down.

723
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:22.001
Shit can't come down,

724
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:23.830
but I don't know the protocol because I don't really know the club,

725
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:27.170
the comic headlining of like me going into,
Oh yes.

726
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.980
That's an issue with a lot of guys and I know that,

727
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:33.520
I'm not saying that I'm better than he is or anything,
but I know that I would,

728
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.660
I would offer to go last because I've never heard of him,

729
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:40.030
but I don't want to say that because then that's the correct thing is to offer

730
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:42.250
to go last because you don't want to interrupt.

731
00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:45.310
The guys said you don't definitely don't want to trample on his material.

732
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.850
The worst thing in the world is if a guy does the guest set before you and he

733
00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:53.140
does a bit that's like on one of the subjects that you're going to cover as
well.

734
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.850
So that makes your shit look for Dundon.
Yeah,

735
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.120
that's a that that is an issue with guest sets.
So I just didn't know.

736
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:00.790
So I was like,
maybe I'll just go down with my crew and get fucked up.

737
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:04.420
Especially if someone goes long.
That's,
that's,
I mean that's me.
I've seen that.

738
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.980
That's pretty gross with guests.

739
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:10.420
Etsy ever seen the guy like just come in that's 45 fucking minutes and then

740
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:11.111
brings up,
I mean,

741
00:40:11.111 --> 00:40:14.320
I've seen that a couple of times with a big name guys and you're like,
wow,

742
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.670
I definitely have the tendency to go long,
but I,

743
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.670
I've never really done the guests that pretty much.
I don't know.

744
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.500
I'm sure I fucking,
but then again,
the guy could be a scrub and you know,

745
00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.280
really fuck them,
make them,
make them fall.
You Jason Tebow always daily.

746
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.710
Shouldn't be on that stage anyway.
That's possible as well.
So yeah,

747
00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:31.510
if you want to,
if you're in Austin and uh,

748
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:33.130
I guess I'll tweet if I get to do a show down there,

749
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:35.350
but if you're in Austin and you want to be on trip flip,

750
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:40.000
I have some pretty amazing and say you have your kids and you want to bring your

751
00:40:40.001 --> 00:40:42.850
kids.
I just got notes from the network that I could take a whole fucking family

752
00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:45.110
somewhere.
You don't want to take your fucking cancer,

753
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.010
the of Christ because you don't want to take your kids.
Me.
Oh wait.

754
00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:50.410
I just realized that I would fucking suck.
Oh.

755
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.580
But so if you want any information to go to [inaudible] dot com and it's all on

756
00:40:53.581 --> 00:40:56.920
my blog,
all the information of where to meet and all that Shit for Austin,

757
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.400
by the way,
that's a fantastic name,
Bert.
Bert,
Bert.

758
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:06.370
So rememberable I tried to get burned.
It was for a dog.

759
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:10.570
This got a website dedicated to his fucking dog.
And I was like,
well yeah.

760
00:41:10.571 --> 00:41:13.000
I was like,
well this dog and it looked old.
So I was like,
it'll die.

761
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:13.923
And then it died.

762
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:19.210
And then he sold the fucking site to somebody for how much I fucking know.

763
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:19.961
You know,

764
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:22.600
it was the hardest part is trying to name my podcast cause I was like going

765
00:41:22.601 --> 00:41:26.680
through all the fucking names and I was like,
and I was like,
I was like,
you know,

766
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.140
and then you're like,
well,
whatever you name it,
it's going to,

767
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:31.660
everyone's going to say it sounds gay.
So is it this weekend?

768
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.160
This Saturday I'm to Austin is a dude

769
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.020
<v 2>named John Ramsey.
Okay.
So John Ramsey,
we're just going to put this out there.</v>

770
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:44.450
Just let the,
let the Twitter verse reach out to John Ramsey and say,

771
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:49.370
dude,
do you mind if Burke crisis 15 minutes after you on Saturday?

772
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.120
I hope you don't cut too.
I see him and he's like,
not cool.
Anonymous.

773
00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:56.180
Took my email account.
They took [inaudible].

774
00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:00.920
I just got hacked my email the other day.
That is possible.
All right,
John,

775
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:05.750
I'll see you.
I'll see you this week.
Yeah,
that's funny.
Yeah.

776
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.870
John Ramsey,
so that's,
that's the cat who's playing there this weekend.

777
00:42:08.871 --> 00:42:11.000
Cap City Comedy Club.
This is a one of the best clubs,

778
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:15.280
like literally one of those legendary clubs.
There's a,
the,

779
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.990
they're all dead now.
The cap cities,
one of the last one standing.

780
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:22.880
I mean the last stop in Houston was a great fucking room.
Yeah.

781
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.940
Yeah.
Did you ever to before they moved it up before they moved it?
Yes.

782
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.010
The after they moved to the,
I never even went back.

783
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.670
I said that for the opening leap weekend there,
the grand opening weekend.

784
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.510
I took a girl there that I used to date and we fucked on the couch after the

785
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:38.660
show and she left a little spot there and last time I went there,

786
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.080
the spot was still on the couch.
Yeah,
I don't think they,

787
00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:46.310
they watch screen room couches a lot.
He says,
let us scary stories.
Son

788
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.020
fucked her on the couch.
Wait,
where's anyone there?

789
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:54.500
She should go on the trip for that.
She lives back in Texas now.
You got,

790
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.370
what if their kids are annoying?
What's,
what if your kids are annoying,

791
00:42:58.371 --> 00:42:59.660
you're on a trip with a bunch of people.

792
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:05.120
Travel channel's been fucking amazing this year.
This season is trip flip.

793
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.770
They,
I mean,
I can't really go into too much detail,
but I think they've,

794
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:14.180
I know for a fact they've said we really value you and we want you to have more

795
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:16.490
fun on the shows.
We won't,
don't want you to be so much in the box.

796
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.720
So now this season,
it's kind of like they said,
no rules.

797
00:43:20.721 --> 00:43:23.660
You can do whatever you want.
I mean we,
we have had some,

798
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:28.670
we went to Australia and had some fucking insane crazy one day they just gave me

799
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:31.250
a car in the two travelers and they're like,
get lost.
See what you find.

800
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.340
Like travel channel's been really cool.
But then they were like,
I go,

801
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:37.070
I'd love to take more than two people.
Like just to break it up.
And they're like,

802
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:41.780
well fuck it.
Bring if you find something that's right,
take them.
There have been,

803
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:44.860
I saw the first cut of the two,
uh,

804
00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.850
episodes of that or premiere episode and they're fucking hilarious.

805
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:54.250
They're so funny.
And travel channel saw them and they fucking love it there.

806
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.490
They're keeping them up.
That's awesome.
That should be,

807
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:59.540
the show should be exponentially better.
It was a great show last year,

808
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:03.000
but it'd be,
should be exponentially more and enjoying in 10.

809
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:08.030
Entertainable nevermind.
No,
fuck my brain.
My brain.
Just token smile.

810
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:10.760
A gasket you talked for too long and you red lines

811
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.780
that horrible sound.
The black smoke.
Oh Jesus.

812
00:44:19.781 --> 00:44:23.420
That Jamison and this is energy.
It's pretty good.
Mix it with the fruit punch.

813
00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:24.920
This tastes like roller skating rink.

814
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:28.460
Jason Roller Skating Rink and I need to look,

815
00:44:28.461 --> 00:44:32.250
I know I work for the UFC and everything.
I'm,
I'm at suspect

816
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.610
<v 0>what someone who works for the UFC promotes a UFC product.</v>

817
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:40.230
But this shit is delicious.
It's probably terrible for your heart.
Oh all this.

818
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.380
Is there a lot of caffeine in this bitch?
Let me see.
Can you read that Brian?

819
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:44.214
I can't read that.

820
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:49.870
<v 4>Say Caffeine.
It's got an,
well this one has zero calories,
which I totally dig.</v>

821
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.820
I woke up last night thirsty as fuck and I went into the kitchen.
I was,

822
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:55.630
I had been drinking uh,
from the,

823
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.090
my flight before and then partying with this Guy Tom.

824
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.410
I went in and I grabbed what I thought was a box of xeno coconut water.
Yeah.

825
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.440
Talk to this egg whites.
Fucking dope.
Like ride whites.

826
00:45:08.441 --> 00:45:10.660
I fucking wanted to throw up so bad.

827
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.680
You must have immediately the feeling of like how horrible that I didn't even

828
00:45:14.681 --> 00:45:17.110
catch it until like,
cause you know,
coconut does have water,

829
00:45:17.111 --> 00:45:20.200
does have like a weird taste.
[inaudible] second goal.

830
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.600
But like two weeks ago I had a beer with a raw egg in it,
so I,

831
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.380
and I didn't freak out over that.
So if I,

832
00:45:26.381 --> 00:45:29.680
if I hadn't had that preparation of the beer in the raw egg,
it's called a brood.

833
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:31.850
They crack a port.
Take an egg.

834
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.650
<v 0>Did you hear about that guy that died?
What?
There's a goat died in an egg.</v>

835
00:45:35.651 --> 00:45:39.500
He didn't contest?
No.
Yeah.
He like broke some world record in the,

836
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:43.480
the most eggs ever.
And then choked.
Yeah.
I don't know man.
Hold on.

837
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:44.343
I'm gonna pull it up.

838
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:49.250
<v 4>I got a dude.
I got a dude named one more bite.
I retweeted shit all the time.</v>

839
00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:53.800
He ate a jar of peanut butter in 30 seconds.
Wow.
Whoa.
I,

840
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.360
and he's got the video.
He just hasn't fucking loaded it up yet.

841
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.990
<v 0>Okay.
Here it is.
A man died after eating 28 eggs for a bet.
Wow.</v>

842
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.260
For a bet.
Yeah.
It just took a,
took a bet.

843
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:09.540
<v 4>This is energy has 13 milligrams per ounce is a 16 ounces.</v>

844
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:16.610
<v 0>That's math.
That's math.
Yeah.
You lost me.
It seems like,
oh,</v>

845
00:46:16.611 --> 00:46:17.930
this is so crazy.

846
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:22.670
It seems like he swallowed the eggs whole.

847
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.440
Yeah.
Oh,
the shell and everything.
Yeah.
Oh,
what a fucking idiot.

848
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:30.140
Oh my God.
Well,
he lived in Tunisia.

849
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.570
You know how slowly and that is out there.

850
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:37.220
It's hard to get like some solid information on egg eating.
Yeah.

851
00:46:37.221 --> 00:46:39.980
Apparently it seems like that's what this article is saying,

852
00:46:39.981 --> 00:46:42.110
that that this guy is swallowed them.

853
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.540
<v 4>This is their,
their Google searches.
He Ami Canadian eggs and he was like,
yes.</v>

854
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.860
<v 0>Yeah.
He was in um,</v>

855
00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.640
the Tunisian better fucking crazy.
It was a real story.
Wow.

856
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.050
This dude ate a whole entire Denny's entire hobbit menu in 20 minutes.

857
00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:01.620
But like the whole habit minute,

858
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.870
<v 4>he's not even one more bite.
Is this one more bite?
Yes.
This is my guy.</v>

859
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.120
This guy can eat a jar of peanut butter in 30 seconds.
A jar of peanut butter.

860
00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.830
One,
it looks like

861
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.440
<v 0>what's wrong with us that we're impressed with that he might got.</v>

862
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:18.200
He does that skill kit had been developed doing something else.

863
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:22.160
The focus that allows him to eat a pound of peanut peanut butter in in 30

864
00:47:22.161 --> 00:47:22.880
seconds.

865
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.580
He could have been really good at the tight rope or something impressive.

866
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.600
The hobbit is this.

867
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.320
It's like I guarantee you that could have been great at writing books.

868
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:30.250
He needed to focus

869
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:35.050
<v 5>on doing something.
This isn't something positive and not not eating.</v>

870
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:36.990
<v 4>I want to say this quick,</v>

871
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.510
I'm speaking out of school and I know Adam was going to say that this isn't true

872
00:47:40.511 --> 00:47:40.691
but,

873
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:45.010
or maybe he is or maybe isn't as what I heard Denny's offered Adam Richmond $1

874
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.980
million to eat 40 to about dollars worth of food.
Wait a minute.

875
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:49.560
Say that one more time.
Denny's.

876
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.930
I'm know I'm fucking this up cause I've heard this third hand now and Adam

877
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:55.810
hasn't told me this.
I'm just telling you what I heard.
Um,

878
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.810
he Denny's offered Adam $1 million.

879
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.030
If he could eat $40 worth of their food,

880
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.510
he had to order $40 and if he could eat it all,
it'd be awesome.

881
00:48:05.511 --> 00:48:08.480
If you had googled this before we actually started talking about it.
Yeah.

882
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:13.010
Cause it could be total horseshit and Denny's could be a like,
you know what,

883
00:48:13.011 --> 00:48:16.970
that fucking show promotes propaganda and they just make things up and that Bert

884
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.320
Kreischer guy,
that guy's a fucking asshole.

885
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.220
We're not planning on giving anybody for it.
Don't go call.
Put them on the spot.

886
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:26.940
What is the,
I'll Google it.
So Adam Richmond,
that's his name.
Richmond fisherman.

887
00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.450
I.
C.
H.
M.
O.
N.
You know it's [inaudible],
right?

888
00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:35.650
What's up Danny?
Way better than Dennis.
It might've been.
I hop,
I don't.

889
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:37.610
It may have been something like that.
Okay.
Let's see.

890
00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:41.470
<v 5>Denny's is just not,
see it.</v>

891
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:46.280
<v 4>Don't come up.
No.
Oh,
maybe I made it up.
You mother fuckers.</v>

892
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:53.210
Fuck it.
No,
my memories are so crowded now.

893
00:48:53.211 --> 00:48:55.940
I start telling people something that happened.
I'll know.

894
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:58.170
I think I dreamed out here at,
no,
you are right.

895
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.880
<v 5>It's his name is Adam Rich man.
Yeah.</v>

896
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.180
That's why I said I had a Richmond dog.
Wrong.
Yeah.
Comedian.

897
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.870
Okay,
here it is.
You were absolutely bright.

898
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.500
America's diner for more than 50 years has issued a special challenge to man

899
00:49:14.501 --> 00:49:16.360
versus food star.
Adam Richmond,

900
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.840
daring him to prove that he can eat $40 worth of items at a Denny's all day,

901
00:49:22.241 --> 00:49:22.991
every day,

902
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:27.910
$2 $4 $6 $8 value menu,

903
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:33.250
the throw down,
which was issue.
Why we,
why we echo and don't do it.

904
00:49:33.251 --> 00:49:35.890
Shut your mouth,
shut your mouth and speak.

905
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:39.400
When spoken to was accompanied by a pledge from Denny's to tell Nate,

906
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:43.480
$12,468 in special Olympics.
I hate when they do that.

907
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:45.910
If you're going to make a bet,
let's make a fuck that.

908
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.120
Don't say you're doing it for cancer because you're not doing it for cancer.

909
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.880
You're doing it because,
do you want to pump yourself up?
Okay,

910
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.570
give the guy the fucking says Danny's everywhere you fuck.

911
00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:59.050
I don't care how much you've given the fucking cancer research or you know,

912
00:49:59.051 --> 00:50:03.820
whatever you doing,
children,
homeless,
whatever it is,
aids,
whatever it is.

913
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:07.510
It's about Danny's you sons of bitches.
If you want to make a bet,

914
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:12.460
make a fucking bat.
I would like to,
I would like to that televised.
I mean,

915
00:50:12.461 --> 00:50:15.400
I'm not saying that Adam Richmond shouldn't give all of his money to charity

916
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:16.510
because I think he should.

917
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.380
<v 4>Is that the way they were going to give him $1 million and</v>

918
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:23.840
<v 5>actually think you it?
I think you should at least keep 50% yeah,</v>

919
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:28.190
it's just one meal is a 72 ounce

920
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.650
<v 0>steak and an 11 pound pizza.
What the fuck?</v>

921
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:35.000
Must it be like to like be known for being able to eat a fuck load,

922
00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:39.590
but he that's fails to.
Oh sure.
Look,
you can fail this,

923
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:44.360
these competitive eaters.
We I these man,
this guy,
one more bite.
I'm telling you,

924
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:47.540
this guy's amazing.
He ate a fucking 16 pound burger.

925
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.020
Me and we tried to do it.
You couldn't fucking do it.

926
00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:54.620
This guy ate it and fucking 30 but I was at the greatest overeating episodes in

927
00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:57.440
the history of the world.
I was there when pat from Wanaka.

928
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.090
<v 2>Oh,
drank 70 some odd shots.
I listened.</v>

929
00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:05.470
I only have that podcast with you and bill burr on my iPad mini or my eye,

930
00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.580
my little shuffle and I,
and I was like going for a walk yesterday.

931
00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.890
Marco island two days ago and I listened.
I was like,
Oh,
a bill.
And I go,

932
00:51:11.891 --> 00:51:14.020
it's been so long.
I probably won't remember this one.

933
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.010
And then the second you guys talked about that,
I started gagging again.
I go,

934
00:51:17.011 --> 00:51:21.340
I remember this one fucking cause I saw it online.
That baby bird shit.

935
00:51:21.341 --> 00:51:23.230
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever fucking seen.

936
00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.660
It was the most disgusting old reading someone.
I mean,

937
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:29.890
those names are etched in my head forever because of that moment.

938
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.000
<v 0>Dude,
Pat Duffy,</v>

939
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.760
who was that intern from the opening for folks who don't know what the fuck

940
00:51:33.761 --> 00:51:36.700
we're talking about.
This is kind of a specialized little story.

941
00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:41.260
Opie and Anthony had an Eggnog eggnog eating contest.
And who was there?

942
00:51:41.261 --> 00:51:44.330
Ari was there.
Were you there Brian?
Yeah.
Uh,
no.
No,
you won't.

943
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:49.340
I was live streaming it from res phone somehow or something crazy like that.

944
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:54.520
Um,
Bill Burr was there anyway,
uh,
you know,
oop.
Anthony,
Jim Norton.

945
00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.270
And they had this kid named Pat Duffy who was an intern and this kid was

946
00:51:58.271 --> 00:52:01.630
completely crazy.
He would do anything.
He would brush his teeth with dog shit.

947
00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:05.090
Like he was just down for something.
He did.
Yeah,
he did that.

948
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:09.510
He was completely crazy.
He's awesome.
Uh,
and uh,

949
00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:13.180
when they,
the end of the eggnog contest was getting close.

950
00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:17.440
The Guy who won is actually a diabetic Yaki wins every year.

951
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:21.700
You can't stop him.
He's a giant.
He's got his body fits more.
It's just like,

952
00:52:21.701 --> 00:52:25.360
I met him one time,
he's checking he's,
he's crazy.
He's a great guy.

953
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.730
Very funny guy to actually,
by the way.
Very funny.
Yeah.
So he,
um,
he makes this,
uh,

954
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.700
you know,
makes the end,
whatever it was,
70 plus odd shots and,

955
00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.530
and he's letting us know he's gonna hurl,
so don't go play it,
Brian.

956
00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:41.840
<v 7>Don't let,
he says he's going to hurt.
We don't need to see that I have this Id.</v>

957
00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.451
I say,

958
00:52:43.451 --> 00:52:48.451
why not have it so that he throws up in path from when Mackey's mouth and then

959
00:52:49.181 --> 00:52:52.420
someone says like a baby bird.
And that's when it became,

960
00:52:52.421 --> 00:52:53.560
who said there's at Norton,

961
00:52:53.561 --> 00:52:57.940
who was Gilbert Gilbert said on the pocket that it was build where you're right.

962
00:52:57.941 --> 00:53:01.780
It was hilberry say like,
oh my God.
So it'd be like a fucking baby pad.

963
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.330
Look at him just like a fucking baby bird over there.

964
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.330
How can the burn person that's pretty solid right there looking at him.

965
00:53:07.331 --> 00:53:10.510
He's like a fucking baby bed.
Um,

966
00:53:10.511 --> 00:53:15.511
so pat from Menarche unleashes what can only be described as a cartoonish

967
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:20.260
hurling.
Like did you ever see that movie?
It's a movie stand by me.

968
00:53:20.261 --> 00:53:25.261
Where where the kid ass fat ass wins the pie eating contest and hurls on

969
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:26.100
everybody

970
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:26.371
<v 0>drinks.</v>

971
00:53:26.371 --> 00:53:30.900
Kennedy's projectile vomiting in a way that you never see in the real world.

972
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:35.170
Well this tops that drug packet knocking Rockies packed up.

973
00:53:35.171 --> 00:53:36.780
You just sit there.
Well he just did.

974
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:39.270
He's an animal isn't the guy that got puked on his,

975
00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:44.040
he's still alive this cause I don't think that guy threw up in his open mouth.

976
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:48.180
Okay.
And if you haven't seen it,
you haven't gone online.
It is one list.

977
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.050
I hosted fear factor for six and a half fucking years.
Okay.

978
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:53.820
Six years and a half years coming back.

979
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.360
And that was one of the craziest fucking things I've ever seen in person to let

980
00:53:57.361 --> 00:54:02.150
a person do to them.
I was,
that was crazier than fear factor for sure.
Hey,
look,

981
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.920
get to
God.
That is

982
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:07.303
<v 8>retirement.</v>

983
00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:12.790
How can it be taught?
That was me.

984
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:24.320
<v 0>That's fucking crazy.
Timber Watch Anthony's compounds show.
That's how blood.</v>

985
00:54:24.321 --> 00:54:26.640
One of the reasons why Brian and I started doing this in the first place.

986
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.150
Fucking love.
That was another big influence.
By the way,

987
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:33.020
I hung out with him the other day and I've totally forgot about is Tom Green.
He,

988
00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.070
we went to his house.
He's been doing this for a long time.
Yeah,
that's right.

989
00:54:37.071 --> 00:54:41.350
So all of that though,
he don't need to start doing comedy so much.

990
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.800
Say he was just like,
you know,

991
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.100
he just got it out of his house and he sold his whole,
he had a whole studio,

992
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:49.790
kind of like this in the middle of his house.
It was pretty bad ass.
Really.

993
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:53.120
He didn't just have this,
he had servers.
He had his own servers,

994
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.460
so he had one of the rooms.
He had a bedroom in his house.

995
00:54:55.461 --> 00:54:58.650
Had been completely converted to a server room.
You'd go in and she,

996
00:54:58.651 --> 00:55:02.360
she's racks of machines,
so he had these fat cables.

997
00:55:02.361 --> 00:55:05.000
I don't understand the technology behind it on,
but it was,

998
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:08.390
we got to get Tom Green back in the state.
He wants to come on.

999
00:55:08.391 --> 00:55:11.780
I love the love coming up a lot.
Recently,
I'll tell you one of the things I,

1000
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:15.620
I been watching before I released my special,
which is available right now,

1001
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:19.340
Joe Rogan dinette it's only five.
I got it.
It's only $5 free.

1002
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:23.150
How do you like that?
That new business paradigm.
Fucking awesome.
Yeah,
I like it.

1003
00:55:23.151 --> 00:55:25.970
It's all right.
You made it so there's no copyright protection.

1004
00:55:25.971 --> 00:55:27.380
So like if you have like a Roku,

1005
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:30.780
like you could just throw it on an SD card and throw it right into the,
yeah.

1006
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.080
You know,
I knew people were going to torrent it,
but that's okay Ma.

1007
00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.640
You know what a lot of people are gonna buy it.
It's all,
if you don't buy it,

1008
00:55:37.641 --> 00:55:39.940
you're just fucking lame.
I'm telling you,
man,
it's been the,

1009
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:43.190
it's been super well received.
I really,
I'm very,
very happy.

1010
00:55:43.191 --> 00:55:46.700
I'm very happy with people's response to it and people liked it.
You know,

1011
00:55:46.701 --> 00:55:50.740
this is like this.
I think my fourth or fifth one of these fucking things,
it's,

1012
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:55.180
it's,
it's hard to keep coming up and making sure that each one is better.
But I,

1013
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:57.710
I watched this,
I didn't watch it for a long time.

1014
00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.560
I've watched it and I enjoyed it.
I didn't actually enjoy it and I was like,

1015
00:56:00.561 --> 00:56:04.130
that was funny.
Like,
I,
that's like what I wanted to do.
Like it worked out.

1016
00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:08.900
It's your documentary come out,
Bert.
That's so funny.
Oh No,
no,
it has not.

1017
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.090
Uh,
I just talked about that on my podcast today.

1018
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:15.030
The bone that dropped today on cast.
I talked about my,
um,

1019
00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:19.220
documentary there were talking about doing it the way you did your hour special.

1020
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:22.880
Everybody has to do everybody to do it their way.
My question to,
you know,

1021
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.100
do I need

1022
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.670
<v 2>to buy a fucking $25,000?
I'll say,
yeah,
don't worry.</v>

1023
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:31.180
I'll explain everything to you because I'll explain to you off the air,

1024
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.460
the handle,
this whole,
the,
um,

1025
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:38.170
the shift in business is fucking insane.
It's awesome.
This is so great.

1026
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:43.150
This is what's crazy.
So,
so I do the podcast based off of,
you know,

1027
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:44.620
a million conversations,

1028
00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.160
the least of which is Joey who I've been having coffee with every morning going

1029
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:52.830
dog.
It doesn't fucking matter.
You just get up and talk.
And then,

1030
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:57.520
and then I have my podcasting stuff in my man cave and Joey was at my house and

1031
00:56:57.521 --> 00:57:00.190
my dad was there and he was like,
well we'll fucking podcast.

1032
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:04.020
This will be your first podcast.
So we tape it.
My Dad,
Joey Thompson,

1033
00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:07.900
Agora and my man cave.
And it's so crazy because then you like,

1034
00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:10.600
especially the way you've set up this business,

1035
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:14.650
cause I've rethought it cause I got approached by people to be advertisers

1036
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.320
because like,
uh,
you know,
people want to advertise on your site and I was like,

1037
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:21.640
no,
I wanna I wanna fucking do like an on it.
I want my on it.

1038
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.420
Like I don't want to just fucking sell the stack.

1039
00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:28.890
I'm wearing your shit right now.
You're fucking tee shirts.
[inaudible] level.

1040
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.870
Brian,
I'm going next level.
What does that mean by the next level?

1041
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:36.670
I'm buying a fucking vodka company.
Whoa.
Fuck yes.
Why not,
right.

1042
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:41.580
Machine machine vodka.
Oh my God,
I love it.
Fucking Hartman says,

1043
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:45.790
Ivan says,
we put it in all the Improv's.
Oh my God,
that's brilliant.
It's fun.

1044
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.600
Oh my God.
That's how great is that?
It's so brilliant.

1045
00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.690
It's because of you is on it.
You said one night you go,

1046
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.960
I don't know if you remember saying this.
It was one of those nights we were,

1047
00:57:56.230 --> 00:58:01.150
we were drinking whisky and doing the ice house and you were like,
uh,
this is,

1048
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:06.040
I forget exact wording,
but something to the effect of this is the next level.

1049
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:08.620
We're going to the next level.
This is uh,
something cool.

1050
00:58:08.621 --> 00:58:11.840
We're all part of this family.
Fuck the middleman fucked the middlemen.

1051
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:16.060
You'd be the man.
And like I thought you're talking about on it.
And I was like,

1052
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:19.330
yeah,
I want my own fucking product.
That's not what I'm saying.

1053
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.930
And Company,
I was talking about doing podcasts.
He's like,
he's like,

1054
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:30.130
I'm fucking starting the business.
I was like,
oh,
okay.
Well that too.
Yeah,

1055
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.930
you can do that too.
Like the,
the,

1056
00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:34.840
the honest thing came out of a knowing Aubrey went,

1057
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:37.960
RB was working for the fleshlight.
It all brings in Austin,
right?
Yeah.

1058
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.450
I want to kind of get down with that guys.
You've already still oh,
fuck yeah.

1059
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:45.580
He's a great guy,
man.
He couldn't be a nicer guy.
And uh,
when,
when we met,

1060
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:46.630
we instantly hit it off.

1061
00:58:46.631 --> 00:58:50.110
Brian and I met up with them at the w very trendy for the meeting to sponsor.

1062
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.730
So weird.
It's very trendy,
very trendy,
um,

1063
00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:58.800
coolest motherfucker ever.
So,
uh,
their rooftop,
uh,

1064
00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:02.800
like one of those like [inaudible] and we're all sitting around like on this

1065
00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.870
windy day and they're like,
wow,

1066
00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:08.200
this is very nice because this is a pool in some like random girls walking

1067
00:59:08.201 --> 00:59:11.200
around.
This is what people do in Los Angeles.
Yeah.

1068
00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.410
Fucking you love your servant too.
He's amazing.

1069
00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:21.890
He just walked up with a cup.
I was like a fucking given Malaysia.
Nice.
Jaylee.

1070
00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:22.724
Leave him alone.

1071
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:27.320
<v 5>Yeah.
Leave him alone.
You son of a bitch.
Um,
what the fuck did you do?</v>

1072
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:31.990
Tracking Aubrey.
Oh,
Robert.
Oh,
so when we got started,
the idea was that there's,

1073
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.770
there's gotta be a way to sell things online,
like an ideal like selling it,

1074
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.980
like having a supplement company where you're doing it like that in the most

1075
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:41.570
ethical way possible.
You know,

1076
00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:45.140
you're offering like a hundred percent money back guarantee in the first 90 days

1077
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:48.080
if you don't,
you know,
if you don't agree that it's,
it's a good product,

1078
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.940
you provide them with the best fucking shit that you buy and it's just,

1079
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:57.740
it only works that way if you have everybody on board that's thinking exactly

1080
00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:01.130
the same way.
And that's I think really hard for a company to pull off.

1081
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.680
So when a company like is like super ethical,

1082
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:07.010
like you hear about like companies that are like really cool like Google,

1083
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.590
apparently a Google is like super cool to work for.

1084
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:12.970
Like everybody who works for Google was like super happy though

1085
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:17.420
<v 9>except except further there.
Fox,
com guys.
Oh yeah,</v>

1086
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:22.070
this dude's [inaudible].
I Guess Fox comes coming to United States.

1087
01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.840
They're going to open up a thing and they just moved production of the Mac Minis

1088
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.700
to back to the United States.

1089
01:00:28.701 --> 01:00:32.430
So I guess Apple's trying to like bring their business back to the United

1090
01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:32.600
[inaudible].

1091
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.670
<v 0>Yeah.
You know what they're going to do?</v>

1092
01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:37.530
Apple's gonna dig a fucking hole from China through the center of the earth and

1093
01:00:37.531 --> 01:00:41.970
pop it out in the middle and what they're going to go after.

1094
01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:46.320
Everybody has a fucking big grand opening day for the plant.
They saw,
you know,

1095
01:00:46.321 --> 01:00:51.150
job here.
Yeah,
no job for you.
Let's start off.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Mr Kentucky Man.

1096
01:00:51.151 --> 01:00:51.984
No job for you.

1097
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:56.220
And just the population of Asians goes up by a half a million in the states and

1098
01:00:56.221 --> 01:00:57.700
they just funnel them up.

1099
01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:01.890
They could get 500 million Chinese people through the fucking center of the

1100
01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.360
earth before we even know what hit us.

1101
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.030
<v 9>Yes,
I did that movie.
It's fucking awesome.</v>

1102
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.070
Like iTunes had this thing where you're like,

1103
01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:14.090
you could buy looper early before it comes on Blu Ray for like 16 bucks.

1104
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:18.620
I'm like,
you buy it.
And they immediately says,
oh,
available for rent tomorrow.

1105
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.890
And you're like,
oh that was,
that was rude of you to sit and do that.

1106
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.150
Like they don't say that the available for rent tomorrow thing.

1107
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.450
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1108
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:27.820
the renting never works out on iTunes for me cause I always forget I started on

1109
01:01:27.821 --> 01:01:30.760
a plane and I pass out halfway and then I can forget that I have it.

1110
01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:34.310
Plus your fancy extravagant man.
Why don't I just buy it?
You own it.

1111
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.360
Put Full Leo,

1112
01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.560
my sister and my sister and looper on my phone,
like cared about it.

1113
01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.220
<v 0>I'm going to sit alone in the bathroom by the wife is snoring.</v>

1114
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:52.480
<v 2>Looper nice.
Amazing.
My sister is intelligent.
Yeah,
I loved it.</v>

1115
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:56.380
My sister is in charge of screeners for Fox studios.
Those,

1116
01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:00.760
this shit's online son.
Let me tell you something.
That's some motherfuckers out.

1117
01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:04.990
So she,
so the first day she gets her job as a first day,
this is like a year ago.

1118
01:02:04.991 --> 01:02:08.380
The first day she gets her job was the first day that everyone can get
screeners.

1119
01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:11.530
So everyone fucking inundates her like I need screeners.
I need screeners.

1120
01:02:11.531 --> 01:02:13.330
He shouldn't know the fuck to do.
She goes to her boss,
she goes,
what do I do?

1121
01:02:13.331 --> 01:02:16.900
He goes,
look,
send out a mass email,
cut and paste that to every email and say,

1122
01:02:16.901 --> 01:02:20.100
if you need screeners,
you talk.
Tim Jews

1123
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:23.010
<v 4>in the studios told up,
Tim's name is Jews,</v>

1124
01:02:23.011 --> 01:02:26.580
him Jews and Kanye e w s and Kati said,

1125
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:29.370
this world is real and I'll tell you to go fuck yourself.

1126
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.570
[inaudible] simulations.
Cottey says to him,
how do you spell it?
And he says,
Jews,

1127
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:36.870
just like the people.
J E w.
S that's ridiculous.

1128
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:41.640
So Cottey my sister types of mass email cuts him with a,
if you need screeners,

1129
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:45.900
go cold Jewish.
I have has to be,
imagine if it was,
well my blacks white,

1130
01:02:45.901 --> 01:02:48.300
so maybe not to name his first name.
Hates.

1131
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.450
And our son hates so choose.

1132
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:55.710
So she sends out the email to everyone.
Everyone gets it.

1133
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:57.900
She sends maybe 300 emails out,

1134
01:02:57.901 --> 01:03:02.610
cuts and pastes that 300 the next day she gets to work and her inbox is slam

1135
01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:05.760
packed and she just starts cut and paste in the morning and she's realizing,

1136
01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:09.120
oh wait,
tell me,
these people already reached out to me and she reads the line.

1137
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:12.120
There's only one,
Huh?
What the fuck?
Not Cool.

1138
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.780
Spellcheck had changed Tim Jews to the judge,

1139
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:18.990
you in the studio store and she sent out a line,

1140
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.660
an email to everyone at Fox if you need screeners,

1141
01:03:21.661 --> 01:03:23.760
contacted the Jew in the studio.
Store.

1142
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.750
Chew can take care of everything,
but you,

1143
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.750
oh my God.
First Day of work,
oh my God,

1144
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.260
that fucking,
I swear to God.
I thought my sister,
I saw when she came out to la,

1145
01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:39.540
she's going to do stand up.
She's so funny.

1146
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.290
She's the funniest human being here and death squad.

1147
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:44.430
She's the funniest human being she got.

1148
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.630
She got into like being an agent and then went over to publicity at Fox and now

1149
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:50.040
she's had she really happy.

1150
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:53.700
She was funny as fuck and I thought I pissed on her one night when we were like,

1151
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:56.820
you thought you piss.
I have never had that happen.
I've never had that happen.

1152
01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:01.890
Like I was incorrect.
She was in like fourth grade maybe.

1153
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.950
And my parents were out of town when I came in and spend the night to take care

1154
01:04:04.951 --> 01:04:07.620
of her.
And I went out partying with my buddies and I have four and I got fucking

1155
01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:11.040
wasted.
And I wake up the next morning,
she's like school uniform and she's like,

1156
01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:15.180
do you need to take me to school?
Did you piss on yourself?
And I'm like,
no.

1157
01:04:15.181 --> 01:04:17.180
And she goes,
you smell like piss.
He smell like fucking piss.

1158
01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:22.020
And so how old is she?
She's like fucking fourth grade maybe.
I am.

1159
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.450
She was definitely before fifth grade.
Fourth Grade,

1160
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.340
probably nine 10 10 maybe 11 last station she had to be,

1161
01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:33.690
I had to be over 21 so she had to be 11 years old or 10 years old.
So,

1162
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.050
so I go,
I,
I go,
I don't think so.
I'm just in boxers do.

1163
01:04:37.051 --> 01:04:38.940
I get in the car and my windows are down on my car.

1164
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.650
I get in the car in my boxers.

1165
01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:43.710
I told him where to drop her off to school and as we take off it's cold.

1166
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:45.570
I turned the heat up,
we can smell piss.

1167
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.680
It's fucking very like there's piss everywhere.
And she's like,
is it you?

1168
01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:52.740
And she leans over to smell my chest and she goes,
oh my God,

1169
01:04:52.741 --> 01:04:54.900
it's either you piss on yourself.
And I'm like,
oh my God.

1170
01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:56.970
So we wrote ride to school with the windows down the whole time,

1171
01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:00.300
leaning our heads up the windows because it smells so much like this.

1172
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.260
How bad is your piss smell?
It's so strong.

1173
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:07.920
You know you've smelled piss like when a dog.
Yeah,
when it dries out.

1174
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:13.050
And so we're sitting in a car and it's discussing it.
You piss on yourself?

1175
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.080
I have no idea.
She thought I pissed on her cause she,

1176
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:18.520
cause I was drunk and I did talk to her in the middle of the night to find out

1177
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:20.110
what time shitty at it.
You got up for school.

1178
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:23.680
So she remembers me coming into a room and I do have a history with pissing on

1179
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:27.990
things.
So,
so she,
we,
I drop her off at school sites.
He gets out of the car,

1180
01:05:27.991 --> 01:05:30.940
I don't smell it.
And I'm like,
Oh shit.
I pissed on my little sister.

1181
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.060
Like I feel fucking horrible cause it's not in the car.
It'll smell it at all.

1182
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:37.840
I drive home and the second I walk in the door,

1183
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:42.220
the phone rings and it's her principal and I go,
hello.
And she goes,

1184
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:46.390
I had a very interesting conversation with Mary Catherine.
And I was like,
yeah.

1185
01:05:46.391 --> 01:05:47.224
And she goes,
yes.

1186
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.890
She said that someone had pissed on her butt or urinated on her,

1187
01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:54.040
but it was Thelma and I went,
oh thanks.
And I hung up.

1188
01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:56.500
Thelma was our dog and she had peed on her jacket.

1189
01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:58.570
But this woman didn't know that Thelma was a dog.

1190
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:03.630
She just thought some Old Lady Fucking Pills,
dog pee on the jacket.
The jacket.

1191
01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.310
That's what the smell was put on the jacket.
Oh,
that's crazy.

1192
01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:08.350
So you w you blackout so hard.

1193
01:06:08.351 --> 01:06:11.270
You thought you might've piss on yourself back then.
I was fucking,

1194
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:14.590
I was at Celeb that should we definitely wear this thing and she,

1195
01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:18.020
when she tells her story,
I'm fucking in stitches.
Oh my God.

1196
01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:19.720
Because she was a kid.
She was a little kid.

1197
01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:22.740
She used to come up to Florida state and party with me.
Like I'd,

1198
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.560
my parents going through divorce so she'd come up and hang out at parties and

1199
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:29.800
we'd send her around with a hat to get money for a new keg beer to come home

1200
01:06:29.801 --> 01:06:34.650
with like fucking $1,000.
Did you ever try to get into new stand up?
I,

1201
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:39.490
I did.
I did.
And she had no interest.
How powerful is the limit in history?

1202
01:06:39.491 --> 01:06:42.790
Because I don't think of Piss.
When I think of the color yellow,

1203
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:46.360
I think of lemons and I see piss every day.
I rarely see limits.

1204
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:54.480
<v 0>Just let it sit there
kind of point.</v>

1205
01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:58.770
He's got a strong point.

1206
01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:03.450
I was a strong as the lens of good point because even bananas can't hold claim.

1207
01:07:03.451 --> 01:07:07.380
I mean if you see yellow or you think lemon,
lemon is,
it's true,

1208
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.750
but you don't think pis with,
when you think true,

1209
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:14.340
do you think great yellow can bananas can't claim yellow the way the lemons can.

1210
01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:18.420
Giraffes?
Nope.
Orange is claim oranges.
Oranges claimed the fog.

1211
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:21.300
That's cause they named it doesn't matter if they're the only fruit that's a

1212
01:07:21.301 --> 01:07:25.590
fruit and a color.
An orange.
It's winnable.
Yeah.
I see it's orange.

1213
01:07:25.591 --> 01:07:28.890
What the fuck is it?
It's an orange.
What the fuck are you saying?

1214
01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:33.030
Did you imagine if someone said it's a purple,
you'd be like,
go fuck yourself.

1215
01:07:33.031 --> 01:07:37.230
It's not a purple if it is,
it's a plum.
Is that what it is?
It's a purple.
No,

1216
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.050
it's a color and it's a fruit at the same time.
The only,

1217
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.990
the only thing that I can think of,

1218
01:07:42.991 --> 01:07:47.250
first thing that comes to your mind when I say blue blueberries,
blueberries.

1219
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:50.970
Blueberries.
Really?
Yeah.
I think cold coalitions,
blue,

1220
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.710
blue are there.
It's a color.
And then there's berries.
It works,
you know,

1221
01:07:55.711 --> 01:07:57.480
but just to call something an orange,

1222
01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.630
that's the most ridiculous fucking name in the English language.

1223
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.930
What did we run in now?
Sounds that we can make with our mouth.

1224
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.760
There's a fucking fruit and it happens to be orange and you name it the f the

1225
01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:12.570
color.
How did they,
how did they,
now I don't know.
You've got me into a spiral.

1226
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:15.120
How do they name these things?
They're idiots.
A bunch of monkeys.

1227
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:16.340
Before they had TVs

1228
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:19.250
<v 5>and that was just the noise they made when they saw it made noises with the</v>

1229
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:23.510
mouse.
Do you think one guy stood at the fireplace and I was like orange.

1230
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:25.610
Why did anybody ever agree to Swartz and Edgar?

1231
01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:27.740
How did anybody ever agree to that?
I mean,

1232
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:29.780
this is essentially just an annoyance that you make with your mouth to

1233
01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:32.530
communicate a certain thing.
Well,
this is this guy.
What's his name?
Oh,

1234
01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.160
I'm no Swatson.
Come on.
That's not your fucking name.
Is it?

1235
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:40.720
[inaudible] is it [inaudible] you know what's,
what's,
my name's Joe.

1236
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.230
You know what's your name?
Bernet.
Burton.
Yeah.
No,
I'm most Watson that go,

1237
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:49.190
that's too much.
You're asking for too many,
too many things for me to remember.

1238
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:53.330
You're asking for too many.
You gotta look a little dots over your letters.
Stop.

1239
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:58.340
Why are you being so weird with how the noise you make to represent yourself?

1240
01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:00.570
<v 2>That is silly.
When they have the dots over the letters.</v>

1241
01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.100
She doesn't make the letters sound like that.

1242
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.610
<v 5>Yeah.
Just stop it.
You silly bitch.</v>

1243
01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.900
This in Mon fucking full refund.
What is your name?

1244
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.910
The fuck is your noise.

1245
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:13.880
What is your noise that I have to make the represents you and why is it so God

1246
01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:15.800
damn long?
You need a bitch?

1247
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:20.410
Why is it so filled with confusion and silent letters?
You Fuck?

1248
01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.860
<v 2>I was thinking,
I was thinking,
I was watching that buffalo video you posted.</v>

1249
01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:27.530
<v 5>Oh,
that dude,
the white buffalo.
Yeah,
he,
he hit me back on Twitter.</v>

1250
01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.390
It seems like a nice

1251
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:31.160
<v 2>the,
Oh,
the intro.
The open part was funny when he said,</v>

1252
01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:35.590
the guy said his name was Eric and Eric and he set it up.
That was America.
Yeah.

1253
01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.300
He thought.
He said his name was America,
but then I started thinking,

1254
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:42.650
do you think in the future people start naming their kids good names so that

1255
01:09:42.651 --> 01:09:45.640
they can get the website or the email like no one's name in there.

1256
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.480
<v 5>Cathy gave buddy.
He bloody names.</v>

1257
01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:54.680
They're fucking kid and says,
listen honey,
I know it's a stupid fucking name,

1258
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:58.890
but it's a good movie when you get the website or the email,
wait,
oh,

1259
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:00.740
we get the website in the email.

1260
01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:05.741
I think rocket fuck face punch is a good name for our younger Rockland fuck face

1261
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:08.180
punch will be an industry.

1262
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.970
I'm thinking as long as we can show that we love our child,

1263
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:16.040
it doesn't matter what his name is.
Rocky fuck face punch is a very happy baby.

1264
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:19.930
<v 2>Did you guys get the myspace invites like the invitations to be like try the new</v>

1265
01:10:19.931 --> 01:10:21.610
my space invitation only.

1266
01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:24.520
You have to read files back from fucking that when your,

1267
01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:28.030
when your website put your fucking social network website falls off the map.

1268
01:10:28.031 --> 01:10:28.510
You don't come.

1269
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:31.660
<v 5>That seems,
that seems true,
isn't it?
Isn't it funny like they don't,</v>

1270
01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.100
we don't allow them to come back.

1271
01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:36.550
They're sort of like rap careers because we're Americans.
We don't allow rappers,

1272
01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.770
rappers are not allowed to make comebacks.
Like a band,

1273
01:10:38.771 --> 01:10:40.750
like kiss made a gigantic comeback,

1274
01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:44.230
shit wrap and sugar on the sugar hill gang will not be returning any time.

1275
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:47.860
<v 2>Mapquest seems like it's still a cool name to this day.</v>

1276
01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.480
<v 5>Rappers are to make a comeback.
That's fucking crazy.
You're talking about,</v>

1277
01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:54.460
and I'm not even listening to you anymore,
Joe.

1278
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.590
Joe Rules not making a fucking come back.

1279
01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.300
I mean like maybe before it was jam master Jay,
they got merged.

1280
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:05.440
Yeah.
It may be before he died.
Run DMC were so iconic.
They could,

1281
01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:08.640
they could have done a comeback,
you know ll cool.

1282
01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:10.840
Well just know because they never really fell off.

1283
01:11:10.841 --> 01:11:14.070
So you can't really say comeback.
He's always had a career.
But yeah,
it's

1284
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.780
<v 3>hard.
It's hard for a rapper to fall off like DMX.
The big DMX things.</v>

1285
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:21.690
Was that Christmas?
So fucking interesting.

1286
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:25.350
Did you see that Christmas thing that he did?
No.
Oh,
Brian,
pull this up.

1287
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:30.300
The DMX Rudolph,
the red nose reindeer is a big viral hit.
He,
uh,

1288
01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:32.570
somebody asked him if he knows,
uh,
the,
uh,

1289
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.340
the words to Rudolph the red nose reindeer and could he rabbit will apparently

1290
01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:39.870
he does it all the time.
And so he busts out this impromptu Rudolph,

1291
01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:43.890
the red nose reindeer rap,
and it's like classic Dmx Ho.

1292
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:48.570
Oh no,
she got it.
No,
you gotta you gotta you gotta hear it.
I'm not doing it.

1293
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:49.790
Any justice pulled up.
Right.

1294
01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.340
<v 7>It's really,
really,
it's really good.</v>

1295
01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:57.660
[inaudible] tonight [inaudible] him on a table slapping his hands

1296
01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:49.590
and that genuine,
that's his fat chain best.

1297
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.710
<v 3>How can you get to your mantra on this podcast and can I come and</v>

1298
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.620
I won't fucking Dmx.
I'm obsessed with that guy.

1299
01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.730
But I love the fact that his changed his somebody chains around his neck.

1300
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.260
That's a part of the rhythm.
Like it's,
he was part of the music youth crazy.

1301
01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.030
He is the purest air,
but it was awesome.

1302
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.650
He is the purest of fucking representation of art incarnate.

1303
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:15.330
He just can't help but be fucking that like he did you ever see his reality
show?

1304
01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.600
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
he was fucking crazy.

1305
01:13:18.601 --> 01:13:23.100
He should do a whole Christmas album,
you know,
like that.
That would be bad ass.

1306
01:13:23.101 --> 01:13:27.570
That would sell like fucking crazy doctor.
He puts up money.
My rate idea.

1307
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:31.170
Yeah.
That would be awesome.
All Christmas songs.

1308
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:33.600
Maybe we should we sit over in necklaces and have her own sound

1309
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:38.570
on too terrified to someone grabbed,
I hear him sing frosty the snowman.

1310
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.000
Have a breakaway.
Yeah,
I'd have to have a breakaway and breakaway.

1311
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:45.570
Breakaways everybody knows a breakaway.
They'd snatch it and run on me,
dude.
Dude,

1312
01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:48.390
Jane snatch him and sing old school shit.
Dude.

1313
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.620
Chain snatching exists ties to this black dude photos follow I,

1314
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.730
he bought me one time,
he beat me up,
but uh,

1315
01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.850
in high school and he would go to a party and just rip your chain off.

1316
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:03.950
And he goes,
that's mine.
Donovan was his name was scary mother fucker.

1317
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.850
That's annoying.
Chain stealing.
That was a big part of growing up.

1318
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.300
You always hear about people stealing someone's checks.

1319
01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:16.360
<v 0>Brian,
do you want to get killed?</v>

1320
01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.850
Do not fuck with Dr Brian.
Just stop.
I blame Jamison.

1321
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.370
Just stopped to know what his real name is.
Whatever you do,

1322
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.080
just stop for one or two seconds before you do it and just breathe and just

1323
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:33.340
think about what you're about to do and say,
is this a smart move?
Is this,

1324
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.180
is this a good behavior decision?
I feel like I'm talking to my six year old.

1325
01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:41.030
Just a way to go,
damn,
this is a special type of person.
You got to,

1326
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:44.380
got to get you a on this with the show.
I don't have to,
but I would love,

1327
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:48.980
you know,
there's the guy that's on your message boards right now,
uh,
that,

1328
01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:53.650
that people are requesting Lotus,
uh,
uh,
Flying Lotus.
Yeah.

1329
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:57.570
We used to talk to them back into my,
yeah,
I would love to.
Who's Flying Lotus?

1330
01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:02.260
He's a,
he's a brilliant man.
Yeah,
he's really interesting musician.
Yeah.
What did,

1331
01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:04.900
uh,
what did he do?
He didn't,
he wasn't,
yeah,
he was,

1332
01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:09.490
he was a part of the dance floor.
Dale or dance hall.
Dale.

1333
01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.810
Uh,
what's that in his music?
I don't
pull up.

1334
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:15.370
Pull up dance hall.
Dale,

1335
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.180
if you've ever seen is a dance floor Dale or dance hall.
Dale,

1336
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.570
it's Tim and Eric made this video and I've talked about it before,

1337
01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:23.980
so forgive me if you've heard this before,

1338
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.130
but for the interest of my friend Bert Kreischer,
in my opinion,

1339
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:31.150
the most brilliant use of the Internet that I have ever seen this video,

1340
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.740
this video is,
it's hilarious.
It's real,
it's psychedelic,

1341
01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.030
it's all things.

1342
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:41.140
It's just generic from the Austin showed it's a chick who's dancing and the guy

1343
01:15:41.141 --> 01:15:43.810
comes up to her and he's dancing and that,
that's the second one down.

1344
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.450
The second of it is fine.

1345
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:50.270
You don't see that Flying Lotus is music and that's what we said right here.

1346
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:53.770
A real rapper.
I think it's somebody else.
No,
it says Flying Lotus though.

1347
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:58.730
If maybe I said the wrong name too.
Oh,
I think you're thinking of Bassnectar.
No,

1348
01:15:58.731 --> 01:16:03.010
no,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah,
he's going to Lauren.
He'll,
he'll,
he wants to come on.

1349
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.620
I was obsessed with that.
Where are you going with that?

1350
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:08.150
And that may show you that.
I'll play that video tape,

1351
01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.680
but let's find out who the actual person was flying.
I think it is flying.

1352
01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:14.620
I think it's Flying Lotus.
But let's just play that video because I gotta,

1353
01:16:14.621 --> 01:16:18.700
I gotta show this to Burt cause it the people who haven't seen this,
it's called,

1354
01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:22.870
is it called dance hall?
Dale?
Dance floor.
Dale Dance Floor Dale.
And I think it's,

1355
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:27.760
is it Tim and Eric and actually that wasn't the one year we were thinking of.

1356
01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.160
That was like a recent one I was thinking of.
Oh that was,

1357
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.660
that was the remix by Flying Lotus.
But what's the one that it good?
Yeah,

1358
01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.410
that's it.
Because it keeps going.
They start fucking cut it off in the middle.

1359
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:41.580
You know it stopped that,
that video that we were actually watching.
That was it.

1360
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:45.070
Yeah.
That was the end of it.
Yeah.
Here we'll try a different one.
Oh,

1361
01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.880
you just supposed to got a wrong copy of it on youtube.
But the,

1362
01:16:48.881 --> 01:16:50.950
that is the video though.
But we don't,

1363
01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:53.830
we don't have to keep that I've ever seen in seminary.
You know what,

1364
01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.620
for the people that are listening to it though,
it's probably annoying.
Anyway,

1365
01:16:57.130 --> 01:17:01.450
there's,
have you ever seen Tim and Eric's a SNL,
uh,
intro?
Oh No,

1366
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:04.150
I didn't say copied SNL or you know,

1367
01:17:04.151 --> 01:17:06.430
like the persons at the bar and looks down at the camera,

1368
01:17:06.431 --> 01:17:09.970
catches them fucking hilarious.
The person,
the bar looks at you,
you know,

1369
01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:14.100
<v 2>like an SNL when the intro,
the intro Andy Samberg and he like,
oh yeah.</v>

1370
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:18.500
Gets out of a cabin stops and like those awkward,
they'd been doing it forever,

1371
01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:21.320
but it's,
they still do it.
Tim and Eric did a copy of it,
did a version of it,

1372
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:24.020
but for them,
for their show,
it was fucking hilarious.

1373
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:24.953
<v 5>The,
um,</v>

1374
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.290
every now and then like if I can't be bothered to like watch a whole Saturday

1375
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:31.920
night life,
I just can't do it.
Fucked me too many times,

1376
01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:34.820
too many times I watched it and I was like,
what is,
what did I just,

1377
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.780
<v 2>the good ones get put on Facebook.
Exactly,
exactly.</v>

1378
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.910
The Chinese workers at Foxconn with people that were complaining about the

1379
01:17:41.911 --> 01:17:44.220
iPhone.
If you seen that one,
oh,
you got to see it.

1380
01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:47.940
We played it on the podcast for otherwise we would bill Hader doing a puppet.

1381
01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:51.770
Who's have you seen as bill haters?
I think that's the name.
I'm not sure he's,

1382
01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.320
it's so fucking hard to do with some of the good ones,
man.

1383
01:17:55.321 --> 01:17:59.340
I'm trying to don king home runs and you're really appreciative of them putting

1384
01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.730
together entertainment that quickly,
week after week.
Like I go,
wow.

1385
01:18:02.731 --> 01:18:07.120
But then there are so many misses,
so many misses a little bit,

1386
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:07.771
and then they'll assume,

1387
01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:11.160
imagine if you had to do an hour of new standup every week.
How much?

1388
01:18:11.161 --> 01:18:12.630
Let me tell you something,
Miss.
I think,
you know,

1389
01:18:12.631 --> 01:18:16.860
I run into so many comics that talk about the,
is that,

1390
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:21.340
is that it's silly that the whole sketch,
right?
Something that yeah,

1391
01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:25.050
probably have to watch your life.
See what?
I don't know.

1392
01:18:25.051 --> 01:18:27.530
If I could do a show like Saturday night live,
you could do it,

1393
01:18:27.531 --> 01:18:29.310
but you couldn't do it.
Well.
Yeah,

1394
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:36.000
that would be an awesome,
that would be an awesome reality show.

1395
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:38.490
They ever wanted to make a a Saturday night live comeback.

1396
01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:42.480
Can you do Saturday night live and then like you take a bunch of comics and you

1397
01:18:42.481 --> 01:18:45.870
get thrown into having to do Saturday night live.
I think.
Swear to God.

1398
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:47.190
Let's take this to the next level.

1399
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:52.370
Try our own Saturday night live.
I liked,

1400
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:54.570
I like podcasts acting.

1401
01:18:54.571 --> 01:18:58.230
I watched you this week and at the fucking zoo thing keeps on popping up.
Oh,

1402
01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:00.030
zookeeper.
Yeah.
That was fun.

1403
01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:03.350
<v 5>I love doing that.
I'll do movies at Kevin till the cows come home.</v>

1404
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.540
He's a great guy.
Yeah,
but I don't do any other movies.

1405
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:10.160
I just passed on a movie the other day.
I was happy.
I was happy to say no.
Yeah,

1406
01:19:10.161 --> 01:19:12.560
I mean for a lot of people want to be an actor.
Yeah,

1407
01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:13.730
that sounds like a good time.

1408
01:19:13.731 --> 01:19:17.140
But when I tell Brian Callen acts and every time we talk about acting,

1409
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:21.290
he just talks to me about fucking trailers and waiting all day and pulling away

1410
01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:24.540
from his family and it's like,
I didn't want to do anybody else's shit

1411
01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:28.050
<v 2>anymore.
But what if you,
you and Brian counted a good cop,
bad cop,</v>

1412
01:19:28.051 --> 01:19:30.300
lethal weapon for the new age.
Why would you do that?

1413
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:33.550
And they want to know what you want to do it.
You know what you want to do.

1414
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.020
<v 5>Brian Cowen led Brian [inaudible],
Brian County.
What?
Brian Cowen excels.</v>

1415
01:19:38.021 --> 01:19:40.900
Is that being him?
Yeah.
That's why when we went hunting,

1416
01:19:41.230 --> 01:19:43.530
when that video comes out,
let me tell you something.
We're going to,

1417
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:47.620
we're going to take a lot of that show and put it online because a lot of it was

1418
01:19:47.621 --> 01:19:52.420
way too ridiculous and over the top and you could never fucking show on on this

1419
01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.420
television show on the sportsman's network or the outdoor channel.

1420
01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:59.520
<v 2>That too.
It's interesting.
It's fun.
Very.
Steve Reynolds,
Steven Rinella.
He's</v>

1421
01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:03.630
<v 5>very interesting.
But Callan was fucking hilarious.
Really.</v>

1422
01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:08.070
I knew that if I went hunting with Callan,
first of all cigarettes,
Brian Cowen,

1423
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:12.510
yeah,
guy.
Brian Cowan is a man,
you know,
I mean,
he's a fucking man.
You know,

1424
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:12.960
there's,

1425
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:17.960
there's certain dudes that I just trust with my life and Bryan County is one of

1426
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:21.060
them.
You know,
like if,
uh,
if I,
you know,

1427
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:24.090
if Brian Cowen called me in the middle of the night and had I had a drive to

1428
01:20:24.091 --> 01:20:28.530
Russia,
I would do it.
You know what I mean?
There's certain people that they like,

1429
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.300
he's,
he's rock solid.

1430
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:35.130
So I knew that we were going to go camping in Montana for five days.

1431
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:39.150
We're going to go hiking and the fucking lockets 12 degrees outside and we were

1432
01:20:39.151 --> 01:20:41.160
looking for animals.
We're going to animals to murder.

1433
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.180
A new calendar would be down.
And he didn't,
didn't discipline me.

1434
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:48.210
Not One fucking step of the way.
Every step of the way.

1435
01:20:48.211 --> 01:20:50.880
He was there five 30 in the morning.
He was up like everybody else.

1436
01:20:50.881 --> 01:20:52.560
There was no complaining.
There's no bullshit.

1437
01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:56.970
He just went out and did his fucking thing.
That's rare,
dude.

1438
01:20:56.971 --> 01:21:00.510
That's rare that you could find a friend who's never hunted before and you go,

1439
01:21:00.511 --> 01:21:03.000
come on man,
let's do something crazy.
And he's not,
doesn't just do it,

1440
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:06.760
but excels at it,
succeeds at it,
kills a deer and doesn't,

1441
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.420
does the whole thing hikes for miles.

1442
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.710
<v 2>So I also,
did they go silent?
He didn't know Steve.
He didn't know anybody.</v>

1443
01:21:11.711 --> 01:21:13.910
So Steve contacted you and you were like,
can I bring a buddy?
Yeah,

1444
01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:18.130
<v 5>I knew like four.
I'm like for five days I'm like,
I'm bringing Callan,</v>

1445
01:21:18.370 --> 01:21:22.810
we're gonna.
I have probably the most fun ever.
So for five days,

1446
01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:25.840
freezing our dicks off,
cracking jokes at each other back and forth.

1447
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:28.810
So the video that we're not going to be able to show on TV is probably way

1448
01:21:28.811 --> 01:21:30.300
better.
The ravine calmer.

1449
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:32.320
The thing that I've been talking about on the podcast before,

1450
01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.290
Brian County did a thing while we're gutting his dear.
Okay,

1451
01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:38.710
we're cutting this deer into pieces.
I just murdered it recently.

1452
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.980
So we're standing over the carcass.
We're,
we,
we,
we,

1453
01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:46.780
we were kind of getting into pieces and Callan is doing this bit about a guy who

1454
01:21:46.781 --> 01:21:51.700
only comes in ravines
and I the boxes in there.

1455
01:21:51.701 --> 01:21:53.620
I don't you does anybody else have a lighted,
you get a lighter?

1456
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.820
I'd stole his lighter but it's in that box.
Um,

1457
01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.080
and Callan is doing,

1458
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:06.880
<v 2>threw it behind it.
It's wrapped up in one of those coils.
Brian,
sorry.</v>

1459
01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.520
<v 5>Callen does this bit before the day.
Remind me to,</v>

1460
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.620
I'm getting one of those air cleaners so that people,

1461
01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:17.120
so many people fucking smoke in here.
We'll get it.
We need an air cleaner turn.

1462
01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.330
Can you turn the AC on?
Jane?
See made,
made it fun.
That helps to um,

1463
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.090
any way caught calendars,

1464
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:28.100
this fucking thing where he pretends that he has some talk show and the

1465
01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:30.060
interviews people on the talk show.

1466
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.330
And then at the end of the talk show he talks about what they talked about while

1467
01:22:33.331 --> 01:22:35.880
he jerks off violently ravine.

1468
01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.680
<v 2>No sense at all,</v>

1469
01:22:39.681 --> 01:22:44.681
but it was so violent and ridiculous and hilarious for five days is like I was

1470
01:22:44.811 --> 01:22:48.380
treated to the Brian [inaudible] show,
you know,
for five days.
It just,

1471
01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:52.140
we just laugh our asses off.
April there's,
there's,

1472
01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.540
there's a few people that you know that you can do things with or that you can

1473
01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.610
like,
uh,
honest,
like call in favors television favors type things.
Yeah.

1474
01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.040
I did that to you.
I made you do the skeet shooting with me.
Yeah.
That was really,

1475
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:05.960
this was really fun.
You know,
man,

1476
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.050
<v 4>it was,
thank you.
So I had to say thank you.</v>

1477
01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:10.450
I know I said a million times my crew.
Do you know what you know,

1478
01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:15.010
my crew said they go,
uh,
um,
you know why we can tell he's a good guy.

1479
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:17.890
And I said,
why?
And he goes,
because he took a picture,

1480
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:21.040
he said goodbye and he said goodbye to all of us individually and shook all of

1481
01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:23.740
our hands that made,
you know,
like my sound Guy John sales is like,

1482
01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.700
that's the only types of men that look you in the eye and say thank you and say

1483
01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:30.820
goodbye.
Like that's a big fucking deal.
I was like,
I didn't like,

1484
01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:33.510
I never noticed that I was taking us.
All you have to do is be polite.
Yeah.

1485
01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.630
But people,
but people do so many celebrity Douche bags.

1486
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:41.000
<v 5>That's sad.
That's sad to me.
You know,
cause it's like the,</v>

1487
01:23:41.001 --> 01:23:45.490
the bottom line about being a celebrity,
even a low level celebrity like I am,

1488
01:23:45.491 --> 01:23:48.630
I said it's,
it's a,
you're in a very privileged position.
Yeah.

1489
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:53.240
So like you have this massive privilege and if you meet people,

1490
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:57.020
like the best thing you can do is just be nice.
You know?
And,

1491
01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.860
and be happy that those people are trying to be nice to you,
you know?

1492
01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:03.680
But for a lot of people,
they look at it like it's some big crazy bother,

1493
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:07.220
which look,
it can be if you're in a rush,
if you were on the rate of the airport,

1494
01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.880
you're proud of people.
If you're checking,
if you're checking it

1495
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:11.180
<v 4>because there was a girl at least,</v>

1496
01:24:11.181 --> 01:24:13.930
or Mister Miss Leighton Meester what the fucks,

1497
01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:18.840
I don't know at least to Mister Mister,
these 30
well,

1498
01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.290
Arnold Schwarzenegger was ridiculous.

1499
01:24:21.650 --> 01:24:23.690
She was at my show in Marco Island this weekend.

1500
01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.670
She's apparently song gossip girls and stuff,
and so they,
they were,

1501
01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.880
everyone was like,
I got done the show and everyone's like,

1502
01:24:28.881 --> 01:24:31.470
can you believe she was at your show?
And I was like,
alright,
not man.
Not,

1503
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.050
not that I didn't know who she was,
but I didn't know.

1504
01:24:33.051 --> 01:24:36.890
She was so fucking walked over to her and these people wanted a picture with
her.

1505
01:24:36.891 --> 01:24:39.920
And so I just assume I'll take pictures with everyone.
I go,
I'll walk you over.

1506
01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:43.310
I said,
hey.
She went,
hey,
the comedian.
No one's like,
yeah.
She goes,
uh,

1507
01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:45.680
we'd like to enjoy your show.
I go,
Hey,
can you take a picture of these people?

1508
01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.700
But I didn't realize she's not dressed up so she's not like picture ready to

1509
01:24:49.701 --> 01:24:50.630
like send out in public.

1510
01:24:50.631 --> 01:24:54.740
She's actually dressed down so no one recognizes her cause you super famous got

1511
01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:57.530
like fucking 2.5 million followers on Facebook,
on Facebook.

1512
01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:01.660
And so he fucking girls are savage.
She was in,
she was in a,

1513
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.250
she's been been in movies and she released a country album.

1514
01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:09.110
Are you in love with her or Rachael Ray.
Okay.
You asked me about Oprah and Ellen,

1515
01:25:09.111 --> 01:25:13.700
her or Rachael Ray.
Which one would you,
which one would you take it to?
The,

1516
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.900
to the fucking right.
If it's,
if it's,
if it's,
um,

1517
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:19.820
if I'm compromising the integrity of my marriage and it's going to go home.

1518
01:25:19.821 --> 01:25:22.130
Now you go into a time machine,
he'd go back and

1519
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:26.090
<v 5>the time to before you were ever married and bring the three before you and your</v>

1520
01:25:26.091 --> 01:25:29.720
wife ever even met.
Okay.
You bring them to,
you hit it,

1521
01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.450
you make your pick and you hit it.

1522
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:36.070
<v 4>My brain went,
Rachel,
my bane.
Oh,
Rachel,
right away.
But,
but I wouldn't,</v>

1523
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:39.430
I wouldn't do I now,
but if I think about it,
I go,

1524
01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:42.880
she might hear that and I don't want her to feel walker.
Who's the other girl?

1525
01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.270
Leighton,
Leighton Meister,
whatever the file name is less gossip girl.

1526
01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:51.100
She can't lie.
I G H t two she's hottest fussing me brother.

1527
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:55.690
She listened to me brother.
She can't cook.
She can't cook.
She can cook.

1528
01:25:55.710 --> 01:26:00.250
She is too hot for you.
Let's be honest,
Rachel Ray is hot but hot.

1529
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:03.980
You could get that Rachel Ray's,
I'm not saying that you could get that,
but

1530
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.820
<v 0>I'm saying in the,
in the universe that's in your wheelhouse.
Okay.</v>

1531
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.910
I'm not saying that the individual like me,

1532
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.490
like making her like some sort of an object that you could acquire a capture.

1533
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:16.430
I'm not demeaning or dehumanizing her in any way,
shape or form,

1534
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:21.200
but I'm saying that it makes sense.
See if I saw you with Traci Lords,
I was like,

1535
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:25.230
oh that poor mango and get his heart broke.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

1536
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:29.150
I don't want 25 I want someone who wants to own some shit together.
If yeah,

1537
01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.440
<v 5>if I saw you with some like 25 year old 11 so in 25 year old just like</v>

1538
01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.400
<v 0>Ooh,
like you,
you can't breathe.
Mr Nexstar give a picture of her.
Brian,</v>

1539
01:26:40.401 --> 01:26:44.030
that's not good for you.
Girl would have like a little 10 pounds extra weight,

1540
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:46.250
which is not bad.
It's Kinda hot.

1541
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:48.710
I want some compounds and grows 10 pounds overweight,

1542
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.490
a little sloppy is more likely to stay in bed and fuck you then go to work,

1543
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:56.000
you know,
that's Kinda hot,
you know like call in sick and just bang her all day.

1544
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:59.900
That's all sloppy though.
Almost like I get turned on by my wife's flaws now.

1545
01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.180
Like I see them and I go convenient.
Yeah.

1546
01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.130
I've got this guy on

1547
01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:12.340
<v 5>tomorrow.
Um,
doctor Doctor Chris Ryan,</v>

1548
01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.100
he's the one who wrote that book sex at dawn.

1549
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:18.490
It's all about like what sex was like,

1550
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.610
<v 9>don't let your girlfriend know that you had that book by the way.
Why?</v>

1551
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:24.280
I was dating a girl and she,

1552
01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:28.010
she saw that in my car cause I bought that book and it had in my car and I took

1553
01:27:28.011 --> 01:27:30.680
it to the airport and I put it in my back seat or something.
And she's like,

1554
01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:33.560
well what's this book?
And I'm like,
Oh,
it's my book.
And then she's like,
oh,

1555
01:27:33.561 --> 01:27:36.260
let me read it.
And so she read it.
She's like,
why do you have that book?
That's,

1556
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:37.790
that's like,
I guess it's,

1557
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:43.090
it breaks down how silly like marriages and relationships with guys and girls

1558
01:27:43.731 --> 01:27:44.260
doesn't it?

1559
01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.240
<v 5>Well not necessarily.
Um,</v>

1560
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:51.270
what would it breaks down is the origins of monogamy and the um,

1561
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.170
the sort of what we,
we,
it's,

1562
01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:56.560
we're going to be really interesting to talk to this guy because one of the

1563
01:27:56.561 --> 01:27:57.181
things is a,

1564
01:27:57.181 --> 01:28:02.181
about promiscuity and about the prevalence of promiscuity in men and women in

1565
01:28:02.531 --> 01:28:05.620
the early civilizations.
The way we look at it,

1566
01:28:05.621 --> 01:28:08.770
I think we look at it very differently because we look at promiscuity is in

1567
01:28:08.771 --> 01:28:09.910
fucking strangers.

1568
01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:12.820
Like the girl goes out and she gets drunk and she starts fucking strangers.

1569
01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:16.120
That didn't really used to happen back in the day.

1570
01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:19.810
Everybody stayed in the tribe and they might be a hundred people in the tribe

1571
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:23.020
and the people who fuck people,
they fucked people in the tribe.

1572
01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:26.710
They found someone in the tribe to fuck the new,
knew that person intimately.

1573
01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.380
Everyone else in the tribe knew that person.

1574
01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:33.490
Intimately situation that we deal with today is very alien.

1575
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:38.020
The idea that you can meet a person in a city and they're a total,
complete,

1576
01:28:38.050 --> 01:28:42.550
absolute stranger.
You know nothing about them and yet you can fuck them.

1577
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.410
That didn't exist before.

1578
01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:47.250
The only way that existed before was when somebody came into your village is

1579
01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.570
just started raping and pillaging spree.

1580
01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.950
But before that you didn't really just meet people and fuck them.

1581
01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.830
There wasn't that many people.
It times,
you know,

1582
01:28:57.130 --> 01:28:59.360
you're dealing with tribes in the,
you know,
the,

1583
01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:02.520
the dawn of civilization or a people,
50 people,

1584
01:29:02.521 --> 01:29:05.630
whatever they are to go fuck other people's wives will have.

1585
01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:10.660
The idea is that the people were much more inclined to be orgiastic and they

1586
01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:16.650
were much more inclined to have multiple sexual partners.

1587
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:20.250
But even though you would use the word promiscuous to describe that,

1588
01:29:20.251 --> 01:29:24.180
the word promiscuity has its roots in a word that means mixed.

1589
01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:27.270
So it doesn't mean it doesn't have the negative connotation that we

1590
01:29:27.271 --> 01:29:29.610
automatically associate to this society.

1591
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.020
What it means is that these people had these sort of,
uh,

1592
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:39.660
inter,
like they had relationships with several people,
the women did,
and the did.

1593
01:29:39.661 --> 01:29:43.200
And there's apparently a lot of so strong is the evidence to support this,

1594
01:29:43.201 --> 01:29:48.150
that Darwin even changed his take on it from his initial take.
Um,

1595
01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.460
and moved on to the,
uh,

1596
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:54.900
the sort of acceptance that in the dawn of civilization that sexual promiscuity

1597
01:29:54.901 --> 01:29:55.560
was the norm.

1598
01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.530
So was does that mean that insecurity is something that we've kind of stumbled

1599
01:29:58.531 --> 01:30:02.810
upon?
It might not,
it doesn't necessarily mean anything.
I mean,
secure not,

1600
01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:06.030
might not be bad.
It's,
it's like it might be evolution.

1601
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:11.060
The idea that we should continue along the same path as the people that were

1602
01:30:11.491 --> 01:30:14.760
around thousands and thousands of years ago,
to me seems rather silly.

1603
01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:17.070
It seems silly socially.
Uh,

1604
01:30:17.071 --> 01:30:21.370
it seems silly in terms of how we deal with war and how we deal with slavery and

1605
01:30:21.371 --> 01:30:24.600
I,
we deal with a lot of other issues like religion.
I mean,

1606
01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:29.310
there's a lot of other issues that we have evolved to a much higher level of

1607
01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:34.560
human communication and evolution and understanding of like how people operate.

1608
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:39.150
So why wouldn't that be the case sexually as well?
You know,

1609
01:30:39.151 --> 01:30:42.090
and I think it probably is,
and I'm,
I'm not,

1610
01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.880
I'm not like a proponent of monogamy,

1611
01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:48.870
but I know some people that are monogamous that are happy.
Yeah,

1612
01:30:48.871 --> 01:30:52.660
I know what I'm saying.
The idea that it's impossible either.

1613
01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:57.810
The real issue for a lot of people is compatibility and you being someone who

1614
01:30:58.981 --> 01:31:01.470
has their own shit together because if you don't have your own shit together,

1615
01:31:01.471 --> 01:31:04.110
you're never going to find somebody else who has their own shit together.

1616
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.260
And so you're just going to be fussed as fun.
They do.

1617
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:11.850
They attract each other and they smash heads until they both get obliterated in

1618
01:31:11.851 --> 01:31:15.240
a fucking sea of meth.
It's crazy how easily you can point out a mess.

1619
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:17.430
You can go on a fucking person is a mess,
but you can't,

1620
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:20.880
like you can't point it out to them.
You can't,
like I've tried,

1621
01:31:20.881 --> 01:31:24.110
I've tried to be like,
listen,
this is what's going on.
Well,

1622
01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:28.470
your mindset has to be in a place where you can see in your mindset has to be in

1623
01:31:28.471 --> 01:31:32.520
a place where you're willing to accept information and you have the idea in your

1624
01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:35.910
head,
you're focused on the idea of progress and moving forward.

1625
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:40.440
And that really is as simple as your consciousness directing the thoughts.

1626
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.530
But it's hard to get on a tight group like that.

1627
01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.310
And that is one of the things that I've been most proud of about this podcast is

1628
01:31:47.311 --> 01:31:50.100
the ability to affect people in a positive way.

1629
01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:54.450
Just because they can sort of pick up on the way that the guests will think or

1630
01:31:54.451 --> 01:31:54.751
the,
you know,

1631
01:31:54.751 --> 01:31:58.620
we've had some brilliant people on this podcast and you can pick up the way they

1632
01:31:58.621 --> 01:32:00.070
think and communicate and

1633
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.690
<v 0>the ideas that they espouse and the uh,
the approach they have to life,
you know,</v>

1634
01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:07.620
whether you know,
and a number of,

1635
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:12.500
<v 2>I take it to the next level and I'll say this as I came to this podcast is a fan</v>

1636
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:13.343
of the podcast.

1637
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:16.520
Like I was listening to it and enjoying it and then started doing it.

1638
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:21.120
And then so then like,
so these,
both these bottles desk got Ohio and death squad,

1639
01:32:21.121 --> 01:32:23.060
Scotland,
these desks squads gotten guys,

1640
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:26.930
they just texted me or tweeted me and said,
if you're in Scotland,

1641
01:32:26.931 --> 01:32:29.390
we'd love to have a drink with you.
And always shooting.
And I was like,
well,

1642
01:32:29.391 --> 01:32:32.390
I just wrapped up sitting by a bar,
told them where I was.
They showed up.

1643
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:36.050
<v 0>What if they brought a bag and tape and the saw</v>

1644
01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:38.500
<v 2>fertilizer.</v>

1645
01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:43.400
So rogue instance maybe wouldn't have giant gay guy wearing a leather mask.

1646
01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:47.840
Invert.
No.
So,
but it's so funny because we ended up um,

1647
01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:51.620
you had just done a podcast with God.
Bob Bobcat Goldthwait.
Yes.

1648
01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:53.930
And we ended up sitting down having a beer was talking about that podcast cause

1649
01:32:53.931 --> 01:32:57.110
we'd all listen to it and it was like there was no like there were twice or

1650
01:32:57.111 --> 01:32:58.970
three times maybe they were like I can't believe I'm going to be with the

1651
01:32:58.971 --> 01:33:02.570
machine.
But there was no that it was us talking about your podcast.

1652
01:33:02.571 --> 01:33:06.650
It was us talking about like those dudes technique,
tech mad technique,

1653
01:33:06.710 --> 01:33:11.030
the black Jesus Christ.
That was such a fucking great podcast.

1654
01:33:11.031 --> 01:33:12.290
I would have never heard of them in my entire life.

1655
01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.000
<v 0>They were the two dudes,
Gi Joe,</v>

1656
01:33:14.001 --> 01:33:19.001
Dj Gi Joe and a Suede Suede is the bat the battle rapper.

1657
01:33:19.641 --> 01:33:24.200
Right dude,
I fucking obsessed with him cause he's guys were so cool.

1658
01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:27.170
Like hung with us due to mortal technique brought me some food that his

1659
01:33:27.171 --> 01:33:32.030

1660
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:36.290
Immune like in a pot and everything.

Grandmother,

1661

Those are so cool man.
How come?
Do you know what I'm doing?

1662
01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:41.750
I'm going to get busy.
A lot of people have been saying to get Vinnie paths.

1663
01:33:41.751 --> 01:33:44.690
We're going to get mini pads.
Oh,

1664
01:33:44.691 --> 01:33:47.570
He's going to do it.
That of turned me onto that Vinny paths guy to another one.

1665
01:33:47.571 --> 01:33:51.150
He invited me over to his grandmother's house where his mother's house to cook a

I've fucked Vinnie pads.
It's awesome.

1670
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:07.040
And his album had come out to his album hadn't come out yet,

1671
01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:09.530
I think when you tweeted it or something or the new album.
So man,

1672
01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.290
I tweeted about a video.
Oh,

1673
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:14.130
there was a video that I tweeted that was just fucking bad.

1674
01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:19.020
I preordered his album because of that.
I love that.
He's fucking great.
Yeah.

1675
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:22.700
Yeah.
He's a box cutter.
Baby bath,
kind of patsy.

1676
01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:27.920
Patsy,
his nickname.
I'll watched the rap battle online last night.

1677
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:32.480
Lux and Calico cheese steaks is the Brian,

Vinnie pads.
Cheese steaks.
That's a great fucking salt.
That's all.
I got addicted.

1680
01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:45.200
I play take fucking video like 2030 if you go there right now,

1681
01:34:45.201 --> 01:34:48.750
you'll probably see a hundred thousand fucking hits that have like a,

1682
01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:54.360
yeah,
it's,
oh,
it's over a million man.
You serious?
Yeah.

1683
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:56.300
Why you think he makes for that?
I don't know dude,

1684
01:34:56.301 --> 01:34:58.280
but I'm telling you the last I looked at it,
it was like,

1685
01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.970
<v 3>I think it was,
I want to,
I don't remember.
Maybe I was incorrect,</v>

1686
01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.460
but I don't think it was nowhere near a million.

1687
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:06.410
I thought it was like in the hundreds of thousands.

1688
01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.730
<v 7>Is it great.</v>

1689
01:35:13.090 --> 01:35:17.440
Gritty as fuck.
That's him.
And he's a Muslim big,

1690
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:21.550
<v 3>big boxing fan.
Yeah.
I think he,
I think he,
I think I like it.</v>

1691
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:26.630
I read is I kind of like a spiral on him.
So his Brody from homeland,

1692
01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:41.590
he's driving in his city,
bobbing his head.
Where have we seen this before?

1693
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:47.160
He's got a gun.
No rappers have good sniper,

1694
01:35:47.170 --> 01:35:52.170
but now he's got his own necklace that makes it a little jingle of as he has his

1695
01:35:52.961 --> 01:35:54.610
own sound for this song.
I liked that.

1696
01:35:54.611 --> 01:35:57.430
Halfway through the video you can tell that he shaves his hair back to a

1697
01:35:57.431 --> 01:36:01.060
straight line cause it's,
they didn't cut it perfect or it's right there.

1698
01:36:01.061 --> 01:36:03.700
I think you haven't cut it yet.
I love his lyrics.

1699
01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:07.480
How did my sister used to put her fucking lines in her eyebrows and my mom used

1700
01:36:07.481 --> 01:36:11.340
to looks like Jeff Ross a little bit.
No,
he does kind of looks like Jeff.
Ron.
No,

1701
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:14.020
he does sort of out.
Wait,
look,
there's a moment.

1702
01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.090
There's a moment where he looks like

1703
01:36:16.450 --> 01:36:17.520
<v 7>it does look like Jim Rohn.</v>

1704
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:23.270
He looks like Patton Oswald [inaudible] rapper.

1705
01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.500
Oh my God.
He's got so much like you said,
by the way,
mad respect to Patton.

1706
01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.950
Oswald got love.
Patton Oswald.
Well,
did you see that?

1707
01:36:32.951 --> 01:36:36.010
What do you just showed that guy flying through the air that's in the

you don't want to do in New York.

1711
01:36:45.271 --> 01:36:48.100
Everyone's gotten New York.
Jaycee's got New York.

What are you living in?</v>

1713
01:36:51.491 --> 01:36:55.510

Burton soap.
Disconnected.

1714
01:36:56.150 --> 01:37:00.460
Very bursty.
Ultimate target.
Target consumer.
Like they fucking didn't get him.

1715
01:37:00.461 --> 01:37:04.850
They can target him.
Oh,

1716
01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:06.300
Jaycee's got New York.

1718
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:15.350
No one has a goddamn city locked down.
Bernie,
I sure as hell.

1719
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:19.170
He's got too many people.
That's a preposterous state,

1720
01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.280
<v 3>man.
All right,

Who's got Iowa silver?
Vandelay silver,

1722
01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:29.020
<v 7>What the fuck are you in Brazil?</v>

1723
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:33.510
You would show on his arm broke

1724
01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.020
<v 3>wrong.
What's the guy that let us arm get Tim Silvia.
Tim Sylvia.</v>

1725
01:37:36.021 --> 01:37:38.990
That's what I meant.
This from Maine.
He's nicknames the maniac.
Oh,

1726
01:37:38.991 --> 01:37:42.010
I thought he was from,
she lives in Sun fight guys,

1727
01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.280
which today he's a huge a hunting fan.
Yeah.
He lives in Iowa now.

1728
01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:49.440
When you go to penguins,
he'd showed up at the shows.
Yeah,
he moved there for a,

1729
01:37:49.450 --> 01:37:53.390
the military fighting systems camp was a big camp in the early two thousands I

1730
01:37:53.391 --> 01:37:56.220
mean it's one of the,
one of the biggest camps ever,
and pat military had

1731
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:58.370
<v 0>a place in Bettendorf by,
whether it's from Matthews,</v>

1732
01:37:58.410 --> 01:38:01.290
came out of Robbie Lawler camp full of killers.

1733
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:04.150
And when Tim Sylvia was the heavyweight champion,
you know,
that's when,
you know,

1734
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.680
he was at its peak when he,
when he knocked out Rico Rodriguez to win the title.

1735
01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.690
Tim Silvia,
man.
A lot of people sleep on that.

1736
01:38:09.691 --> 01:38:13.470
But there was a point in time where Tim ScaleIO Sylvia was a scary,

1737
01:38:13.471 --> 01:38:18.060
scary mother was,
you know,
he hasn't shown that form and a long time,
but look,

1738
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:21.180
this is a tough business.
It's tough on your body and his,
yeah,
his,

1739
01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.680
he's still like I was,
I always thought that.
I was like,

1740
01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:28.290
it was a fucking gangster.
He moved to let his arm get broken.
Well,

1741
01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:30.750
he didn't want to let us,
I'm getting broken.
He just didn't want a tap.

1742
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.830
That's fun.
We want to keep going.

1743
01:38:32.831 --> 01:38:35.550
And he might not have known that his arm was broken when you're so filled up

1744
01:38:35.551 --> 01:38:38.010
with adrenaline when you're in a fight.
But,
but Tim Silvia,

1745
01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.540
he would've tried to hit him with the left hand.

1746
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:42.270
Tim Sylvia does not have like a lot of physical gifts.
You know,

1747
01:38:42.271 --> 01:38:44.130
he was the heavyweight champion physically.
Like,

1748
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:46.620
he's not like unbelievably talented.
Like there's certain guys like,

1749
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:51.920
you know Melvin Manhoef is Melvin Manhoef is this incredible Dutch kickboxer and

1750
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:56.940
he's so frightening,
man.
He's so,
he won.
He had a fight this weekend.

1751
01:38:57.090 --> 01:39:00.390
He won with a one knee to the body.
Kayo and the first round over this guy,

1752
01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:03.180

Melvin Manhoef is one of the scariest.
I don't have that.
I don't have that DNA.

1755
01:39:11.401 --> 01:39:14.100
So swole,
we went to,

1756
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:19.130
he's only like five 10 but he's like 205 pounds and he looks like a Goddamn

1757
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.730
Superhero.
He looks like the hulk.
If it was a telco,
no,
no.
Yeah.
Kenneth Cole.

1758
01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:28.950
Like Macy's.
No.
Just look up pride.
18 we wouldn't.

1759
01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:32.370
Melvin just look up the word Melvin.
You know how to spell that right.
Okay,

1760
01:39:32.371 --> 01:39:36.360
Sweetie.
We went to do 10th planet.
Me and Joey and we were going to,

1761
01:39:36.361 --> 01:39:39.570
we didn't even do 10 planet.
We were going to learn Jujitsu.
Where was this?

1762
01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.580
I told you about this.
Hold on a second.

1763
01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:44.580
Watch this fight because this fight does not take long.
This is Dennis Kang.

1764
01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:45.440
Dennis Kang is a

1765
01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.620
<v 1>pretty high level.
Melvin.
Yeah.
Wait till you see this guy's body.</v>

1766
01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:54.630
It's shifts to retard it did,
did,
did,
did he just a muscle.

1767
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:58.680
He's a giant black muscle and he can't wait to fuck you up.

1768
01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:03.330
Right?
The legend shamrock and he fights heavyweights.

1769
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:05.070
He's fighting one 85 in this fight,

1770
01:40:05.190 --> 01:40:08.010
but this guy fights heavyweights all the time.

1771
01:40:08.011 --> 01:40:12.450
I do is way bigger than fighting one 85 right now.
Yeah,
he's fucking crazy.

1772
01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:16.190
He's really fun to watch.
Fight.
I mean he's lost before he'd,

1773
01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.980
Robbie Lawler knocked him out.
A lot of guys have submitted him,
but if,

1774
01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.680
if you stand and swing with this guy,

1775
01:40:22.681 --> 01:40:26.720
he is a fucking destroyer.
Watch this shape.

1776
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:29.130
They get into like a little firefight.

1777
01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:32.160
Dennis Kang lands first and he starts going on after him.

1778
01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:36.110
His candy canes going after hangs.
Try it like this is a big win for canyon.

1779
01:40:36.111 --> 01:40:39.240
If he can get this motherfucker,
but now sweat.
This name gets the clench.

1780
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:43.280
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1781
01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.950
That's some scary shit.

1782
01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:51.500
That dude's got some hour.
Look at this body.
Fucking,

1783
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:54.430

1784
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:58.060
<v 3>when you go over the house and you'd go to pick up your fucking keys.</v>

1785
01:40:58.061 --> 01:40:59.380
You left him there and you got in.

1786
01:40:59.381 --> 01:41:01.870
That guy's in his underwear walking around your house and you're like,
oh,

1787
01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:06.700
this is Melvin [inaudible].
Hey Man,

Big Fan man.

1788
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:10.060
Big Fan.
Big Fan.
Hey,

1789
01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:13.060
I have my girlfriend,
a good guy.
I know he'll take care of Melvin.

1790
01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:17.380
Joey and I joined.
I went to 10th Joey and I talk to Eddie Bravo.

1791
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:22.210
I talked to Eddie Bravo seeing went to the Tab gym downtown La to 10th planet

1792
01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:27.060
and on Burbank.
Oh,
that's a long time ago.
Yeah,
it's,
did they move?
Yeah.

1793
01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:31.120
Oh yeah.
Tell us about your really understand the tap out Jim and downtown La.

1794
01:41:31.121 --> 01:41:35.230
It's a much better spots.
Huge,
huge,
huge spot parking.
I called up,

1795
01:41:35.231 --> 01:41:38.630
I talked to you last time I talked to you about going to Jujitsu and you're
like,

1796
01:41:38.690 --> 01:41:41.970
help get rid of anxiety when you know when you go head to head with another
dude,

1797
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.920
it really kind of levels you out and you get relaxed.
End of the day.

1798
01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.990
Definitely relaxes you.
Yeah.
That's a lot of stress.

1799
01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.310
So I reach out to Eddie Bravo,

1800
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:51.220
I think I called Brian Or said something to Brian and Brian Goes,
call Eddie.

1801
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:56.250
And so I texted Eddie and he just called me and I was in my man cave drinking a

1802
01:41:56.411 --> 01:41:59.680
bottle of wine and he's like,
what are you looking for?
I was like,
I don't know.

1803
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:03.580
I want like,
I want to be able to like,
I want to be able to tap someone out.

1804
01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:07.090
He goes,
I can get you tap motherfuckers out within a year.
I go,
really?
He goes,

1805
01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:10.160
done.
He goes,
meet me at 10 planets.
So we go,
I meet him up at 10th Planet,

1806
01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:13.720
talk to him and he goes,
he was looking at camp like whatever it is,
they're like,

1807
01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:17.050
everyone's there trains with him.
It's fucking savage.
So he's like,

1808
01:42:17.051 --> 01:42:18.550
why don't I get you up to speed?
You've never wrestled.

1809
01:42:18.551 --> 01:42:21.220
You never let anything you need to get up speed.
So he gets Edgar,

1810
01:42:21.221 --> 01:42:24.280
this Guy Edgar to give me.
Then I bring them to Joey and Joey was like,

1811
01:42:24.281 --> 01:42:26.500
I want to fucking do it too.
So then Edgar,

1812
01:42:26.501 --> 01:42:29.430
me and Joey and then fucking Dunkin's like I want to be in Noah's case.

1813
01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:32.620
Now we're starting to fight club in my backyard.
Cause Edgar's like,

1814
01:42:32.621 --> 01:42:35.300
I'll get the maths,
we'll do it in your backyard.
But then,

1815
01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:39.390
then very quickly I realized you do like get black eyes and you do get broken

1816
01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.140
noses.
Rainwear yeah.
And,
and I was like,
I was like,
I'm on TV.

1817
01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:48.640
I can't,
like I can't just show her fucking NOCI listen,
I had two black eyes.

1818
01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:52.300
I did fear factor.
Brilliant product and makeup person.
Yeah.

1819
01:42:52.730 --> 01:42:56.460
Fucking pussy joke.
When I did the UFC,
I didn't even put makeup on.

1820
01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.500
I just left it on.
I had black eyes during the whole broadcast.
I was like,

1821
01:42:59.501 --> 01:43:01.000
I'm doing a fucking show.
We're dude,

1822
01:43:01.001 --> 01:43:03.910
get the fuck beat out of them and you want to put makeup over my black eye.

1823
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:07.610
Eddie Bravo is fucking cool dude.
He's cool as fuck.
Like I that.

1824
01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:11.020
It's podcasts now too.
Yeah.
It's called Eddie Bravo radio.

1825
01:43:11.021 --> 01:43:13.570
And if you believe in chem trails like he believes in chem trails.

1826
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.150
That's the show for you.
The picture,
the picture,

1827
01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:20.560
the picture we took after we went to the shooting range has it chem trail in

1828
01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:24.700
between us.
Oh and by the way,
the last one I'm told,
I think it's number three,

1829
01:43:24.701 --> 01:43:29.290
Eddie Bravo told the infamous stinky polisci stinky feet away,

1830
01:43:29.291 --> 01:43:32.140
which is one of the greatest stories in the history of the universe.
I remember,

1831
01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:35.470
I remember that hearing common.
Wait,
what you say,

1832
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:37.360
what is this hearing at the comedy store?

1833
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:42.160
And he introduced me to having to take vitamins to make sure smells don't
happen.

1834
01:43:42.810 --> 01:43:47.500
What is it?
I can't describe it to Eddie Bravo radio and listen to it.

1835
01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.650
It's a story about a sexual encounter that he had with the young lady who had a

1836
01:43:51.651 --> 01:43:51.980
yeast

1837
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.590
<v 5>infection and smelly feet at the same time.</v>

1838
01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:57.230
<v 2>And he had sex with her in a very,</v>

1839
01:43:57.330 --> 01:43:59.630
in close quarters in the back of a truck.

1840
01:44:00.110 --> 01:44:04.670
It is such a funny fucking story.
Oh Dude,
by the way.

1841
01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:09.530
Oh,
you went to Russell Peters south to Russell Peters House party,

1842
01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.180
like for New Year's party.
Look,

1843
01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:16.210
John Faroe fucking brightest own iron man laptop and was deejay deejaying for

1844
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:21.290
two hours a DJ too.
Dude.
He,
they're all djs.
And then on top of that,

1845
01:44:21.291 --> 01:44:25.890
right before new years of Bruce Buffer,
uh,
did like the whole,
uh,

1846
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:29.880
get ready for 2003.
You know,

1847
01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.630
Lailey is so fucking pissed.
So classic.

1848
01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.940
I'm friends with Russell.
He should've invited me.

1849
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:42.440
I'm actually friends with the guy
invited me bitch.
Lucky.

1850
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:45.650
Got fucking crazy.
Like decorations.

1851
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.170
Scarfaces house I guess.
I guess his house,
his house is amazing.

1852
01:44:51.171 --> 01:44:54.250
He's such a good dude.
He really is an understated too.

1853
01:44:54.251 --> 01:44:55.340
I was so funny you say this.

1854
01:44:55.590 --> 01:45:00.590
I was talking to a Mazda and AAA today and I talked about Russell and I've seen

1855
01:45:00.741 --> 01:45:04.870
Russell work so much because we've worked together like just like doing the

1856
01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:08.390
showtime special and so often he's just like fucking dicking around those days

1857
01:45:08.391 --> 01:45:10.780
to a crowd work or whatever.
And I saw,

1858
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:13.700
I went online and watched one of his videos of him in the Middle East doing a

1859
01:45:13.701 --> 01:45:17.000
show dude,
he fucking hello.
Like I don't think I've ever,

1860
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:20.420
I don't think I've ever paid them the honest respect probably why we're friends,

1861
01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:23.300
but as a comedian,
like I don't think I've ever really watched any of his shit.

1862
01:45:23.301 --> 01:45:27.260
And then I started watching all this shit.
I was like,
he's a fucking hilarious.

1863
01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:30.510
<v 5>That's what I was going to say earlier that I got sidetracked about Tom Greene.</v>

1864
01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:33.630
I watched a lot of specials when I was preparing for my special,
I was like,

1865
01:45:33.631 --> 01:45:35.580
I wanna like you would get a feel of like,

1866
01:45:35.670 --> 01:45:38.760
you know what it feels like to go out there and watch someone,
you know,

1867
01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.870
go out there and kill.

1868
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:43.830
A lot of people were worried about being influenced by other guys.

1869
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:46.370
Without a doubt.
I'm influenced by other comedians.

1870
01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:47.333
<v 2>Yeah.
Helping</v>

1871
01:45:48.110 --> 01:45:50.620
<v 5>worried about that.
Um,
what I'm,
what I'm,</v>

1872
01:45:51.010 --> 01:45:54.340
what I'm interested in is I'm interested still in being a fan.

1873
01:45:54.341 --> 01:45:57.900
I want to see it as a fan and I think I get knowledge from that.
I think,
um,

1874
01:45:58.090 --> 01:46:02.350
it's really widely recognized that the best way to be a writer is to do a lot of

1875
01:46:02.351 --> 01:46:05.230
reading.
It's one of the best ways to being a writer,
not just writing a lot,

1876
01:46:05.231 --> 01:46:09.060
but also bring a lot of reading if you want to be a good writer.
Um,

1877
01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.350
that's one of the things that,
oh,

1878
01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:15.100
Stephen King stresses a lot of writers stressed that in order to be a good

1879
01:46:15.101 --> 01:46:18.520
writer,
you should also be a good reader and you should read a lot of books.

1880
01:46:18.521 --> 01:46:19.810
And I think as a comic or the,

1881
01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:23.530
there's nothing wrong with being influenced by people.

1882
01:46:23.531 --> 01:46:27.040
I think we all support each other and then we all sort of like move each other

1883
01:46:27.041 --> 01:46:30.790
in a direction.
I think it's one of the reasons why being around La,

1884
01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:35.640
like especially like right now is a really good spot for standups.
Great.

1885
01:46:35.650 --> 01:46:40.300
So many of us,
you know there's,
you know Fitzsimmons is here,

1886
01:46:40.330 --> 01:46:41.163
Diaz

1887
01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:45.280
<v 2>[inaudible] you guys have done with the ice house chronicles and getting all the</v>

1888
01:46:45.281 --> 01:46:49.030
comics there for one night is amazing.
I've got,
I've been on shows that I,

1889
01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:49.980
I couldn't even dream

1890
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.400
<v 3>of if we're talking about like if you pitch that,
yeah,</v>

1891
01:46:52.401 --> 01:46:54.300
it's a fucking $180,000 show

1892
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.970
<v 5>you did was you me?
Fitzsimmons D as shift fear.</v>

1893
01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.890
What did you go to?
You might not think you were out of town.

1894
01:47:02.891 --> 01:47:06.580
The last one we got to town,
the last one,
the last one,
the last ice house show,

1895
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:10.140
whatever it was.
I mean you've been in for a million of them that they're shut.

1896
01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.470
My point is,
yeah,

1897
01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:14.680
there's show some we never would be able to do if we didn't all live in this one

1898
01:47:14.681 --> 01:47:18.880
area.
But when you do a show like that,
listen man,
why,
why go anywhere?

1899
01:47:18.881 --> 01:47:20.470
And we're right here.
Cut It already.

1900
01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:25.680
But when you're doing it and you get to see all these like really good guys I

1901
01:47:25.691 --> 01:47:29.740
think at like ups your level,
I think it makes it makes you a better comic.

1902
01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:32.740
<v 3>I follow.
I've,
I've been following like whenever recently,</v>

1903
01:47:32.741 --> 01:47:35.260
every time I've gone on ahead to follow Benson and I think Benson,

1904
01:47:35.290 --> 01:47:39.320
one of the quickest people on his feet talking about absolutely nothing does

1905
01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:42.520
great.
Doug's amazing.
And it's like,
wow,
it's so never on the road.

1906
01:47:42.521 --> 01:47:44.830
Am I ever going to follow a guy like Doug Benson?
Never.

1907
01:47:44.831 --> 01:47:45.760
That's never going to happen.
Yeah.

1908
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:50.290
<v 5>Well Dude,
I took a,
I took Fitzsimmons on the road with me to San Francisco,</v>

1909
01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:53.850
Seattle and he could destroy is,
he was great.

1910
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.130
He was bringing heat.
I was like God.

1911
01:47:56.150 --> 01:47:58.410
And it was like that old school Boston comedy,

1912
01:47:58.411 --> 01:48:01.300
like a real edge and a real honesty to it.
Yeah.

1913
01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:05.170
<v 3>I didn't realize how good he was until I had kids and I and,</v>

1914
01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:07.850
and this material that he had done about having kids.

1915
01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:11.480
I was revisiting it in life and going like Brexit.

1916
01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:14.570
Fitzsimmons already wrote that.
Yeah.
He's a funny dude.
He,

1917
01:48:14.571 --> 01:48:17.060
I started out together tell you what they like.

1918
01:48:17.061 --> 01:48:19.790
We're like a week apart from each other.
I've known that dude forever.

1919
01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:23.150
That was one of my favorite.
I listen to the first podcast you guys did together.

1920
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:24.890
I was driving.
I had like a road trip.

1921
01:48:24.891 --> 01:48:28.460
I was driving from Columbus to fucking Dayton or something and I listen to the

1922
01:48:28.461 --> 01:48:29.990
whole podcast.
It was a great podcast.
Yeah.

1923
01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.480
We're going to try to Greg Greg on next week,
but the,

1924
01:48:32.481 --> 01:48:36.950
I'm doing a two inch shows with him.
It May,
I swear to God makes you stronger,

1925
01:48:36.951 --> 01:48:39.140
better.
I did shows recently.

1926
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:41.870
We will at the end of the world show is a perfect example man.

1927
01:48:41.871 --> 01:48:46.370
Let me tell you something with dog and having done that,
Ari,

1928
01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:50.450
me,
Dunkin,
all wanted to come and hang out and watch you guys work.

1929
01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:53.510
Like we'd all talked and texted and we were all like,

1930
01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:56.420
I don't want to fucking interrupt them hanging out like I don't want to,

1931
01:48:56.421 --> 01:48:58.250
I don't want to ruin the moment of them hanging out.

1932
01:48:58.530 --> 01:49:00.570
<v 5>No interrupting man.
Everybody said,
you know,</v>

1933
01:49:00.571 --> 01:49:04.770
Bill Bursa the exact same thing you said and that is that what that shows me is

1934
01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:06.810
how cool you guys are that you'd not selfish at all.

1935
01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.270
<v 3>We all wanted to go.
I go,
I said,
you go then because,
because you know,</v>

1936
01:49:11.271 --> 01:49:14.180
you and Doug are like actually friends.
Okay.

1937
01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.800
<v 5>It's still the bus.
I'm feeling the Starbucks cup and um,
it's like,</v>

1938
01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:23.740
look at this.
It's like they didn't treat the whole cup.

1939
01:49:24.230 --> 01:49:25.980
You know how like you have a cup,

1940
01:49:25.981 --> 01:49:29.770
there's a reason why your cup can hold water or coffee or whatever.

1941
01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.150
But this one has a spot where they say,

1942
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:35.140
<v 3>yeah,
yeah,
you got it.</v>

1943
01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:40.230
You got comfortable.
They didn't get all their,
their cunty.
TJ's you've got cut,

1944
01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.840
fuck.
Get their country just over this side.
There's no here.

1945
01:49:43.841 --> 01:49:46.280
So it's like my finger went right through it.
Look,

1946
01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:52.840
oh shit.
Listen,
I back that shit up.
Don't worry.

1947
01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:58.300
I'm not stupid.
No.
Ari and I talked about it and we were like,
uh,
we were like,

1948
01:49:58.301 --> 01:49:59.370
you know,
we,

1949
01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:04.030
you want to give your friends respect to have other friends also is so crazy.

1950
01:50:04.031 --> 01:50:08.080
Listen man,
you guys are nuts and anywhere come,

1951
01:50:08.081 --> 01:50:10.630
come hang out and you'd be on the road.
I'd show up,

1952
01:50:10.631 --> 01:50:13.690
but it was la and it was like another thing is like don't come over my house

1953
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:17.650
when I'm trying to fuck
all I'm saying,
man,

1954
01:50:17.710 --> 01:50:22.090
I want everything else you're in.
I wanted to see,
uh,
I wanted to see,

1955
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:25.090
I never get to see you do stand up.
Like when we do the thing,

1956
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:27.820
when we do the thing,
the guys have chronicles,

1957
01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.470
I get offstage and I have to go back in the room.

1958
01:50:29.471 --> 01:50:32.140
She was till podcasting and usually everyone's starting to trickle out by the

1959
01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:35.320
time you go on.
So I never really get to see you work and I was like,

1960
01:50:35.321 --> 01:50:37.350
I want to see him to do like a fucking ass.
I'm going to see like,

1961
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.940
I want to see Stan hope work two minutes.

1962
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:43.240
This is terrible miscommunication then because from now on,
anywhere I am,

1963
01:50:43.241 --> 01:50:47.050
you're welcome.
Period.
End of discussion.
I know by know hundred percent welcome.

1964
01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:50.830
I don't just show isn't any different.
I went to coffee with Joey the next day.

1965
01:50:50.831 --> 01:50:51.041
He goes,

1966
01:50:51.041 --> 01:50:55.930
it was genius watching Doug Joe Shadow boxing and Doug's smoking cigarettes.

1967
01:50:55.931 --> 01:50:58.370
Like he's got three weeks to live because goes,

1968
01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.360
I'm in the green room and stand up smoking fucking cigarettes.

1969
01:51:01.361 --> 01:51:06.340
And Joe Shadowboxing,
Joey Diaz is,
we have a very different approach.

1970
01:51:06.341 --> 01:51:07.090
One of the men,

1971
01:51:07.090 --> 01:51:10.660
one of the biggest blessings I've had in my life just to fucking really

1972
01:51:10.661 --> 01:51:11.590
interesting guy.

1973
01:51:11.770 --> 01:51:15.940
<v 1>Yeah,
me too.
Um,
and that's why it's always,
you know,
one of the,</v>

1974
01:51:16.890 --> 01:51:21.670
I've,
I've,
I've tried to figure out a way to make Joey Diaz famous for 10 years.

1975
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I knew when I met him that Joey Diaz was just this very unique human.

1976
01:51:27.101 --> 01:51:31.210
I was,
I knew like what a rare diamond this is.
Like how do you find one of these,

1977
01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:35.980
you know,
so I,
I would never say that I took care of Joey.

1978
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:40.420
Joey takes care of himself.
You know,
Joey doesn't need me,
but I've always been,

1979
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:44.770
it's always been very important to me to try to promote Joey in any way I could,

1980
01:51:44.771 --> 01:51:48.970
whether it's talking about them on my website,
doing interviews with them,

1981
01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:54.190
telling people how he's one of the rarest,
most beautiful,

1982
01:51:54.191 --> 01:51:58.930
unique characters I've ever met in my life and I have a discerning eye for,

1983
01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:02.800
for really interesting people as opposed to fake interesting people that are

1984
01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:06.250
trying to pretend to be interesting because I have no patience for that
nonsense.

1985
01:52:06.251 --> 01:52:07.570
That boondock saints type.

1986
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:10.860
<v 3>Oh Shit.
You can suck my Dick.
Okay,
that's fake.</v>

1987
01:52:11.190 --> 01:52:15.120
I know what fake is on real is not going to get me caught up.

1988
01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.140
Cigarette commercial.

1989
01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:25.230
I just want to smoke inside and you all need to swim until you drown.

1990
01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:28.380
Okay.
Just go out there and show me what kind of character you really have.

1991
01:52:28.381 --> 01:52:30.090
You fake fucks,
dude.

1992
01:52:30.091 --> 01:52:34.050
Have you seen [inaudible] I'm learning more and more about this.

1993
01:52:34.051 --> 01:52:38.200
Stephen Dorff a loose cigarette thing.
Have you watched the behind the scenes?

1994
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:41.970
Wait,

Wait,

Hold on.

1995
01:52:41.971 --> 01:52:46.971
A thing on our podcast where we talked about with the commercials burn Stephen

We actually requested it.
Brandon made it so we,
we have to pull it up.

2002
01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.210
We said how beautiful would it be if they combined the two douchey has

2003
01:53:09.211 --> 01:53:10.620
commercials in the history of the world.

2004
01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:15.860
Stephen Dorff stupid fucking electric cigarette commercial and I think it's the

2005
01:53:16.710 --> 01:53:18.520
Joe Rogan.
The douchey is commercial in the world.
Yeah.

2006

2010
01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:37.010
I have no hatred whatsoever.
Seat.
You haven't seen this video.

2011
01:53:37.011 --> 01:53:37.940
You haven't seen this video

2012
01:53:38.170 --> 01:53:42.990
<v 1>fear factor for six fucking years.
I cannot really be in all honestly,
uh,
in,</v>

2013
01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.050
in all honesty,

2014
01:53:44.051 --> 01:53:48.100
rather innocently shitting on someone who's doing a cigarette commercial.

2015
01:53:48.210 --> 01:53:50.140
You know,
I did,
I did a lot of stuff that could be

2016
01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:54.510
<v 3>easily can be promoters and Stephen Dorff I did,
he was great in blade.</v>

2017
01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:59.310
He's uh,
he's great.
He was great in Sfw.
I haven't seen the garden.
He's,

2018
01:53:59.311 --> 01:54:02.310
everyone has a stevedore story.
He's the regular stores like Scotty Con.

2019
01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.500
Everyone's got a story man.
Those guys,
huge fan of

2020
01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.380
<v 1>the comic book blade.
When I was a kid,</v>

2021
01:54:07.381 --> 01:54:09.840
that was one of my favorite comic books with that movie came out.

2022
01:54:09.841 --> 01:54:14.730
I was super sick and he was pretty fucking bad ass.
He did a great job.

2023
01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:15.760
Brad Pitt

2024
01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:19.140
<v 0>commercial return is just to go on the journey ends,</v>

2025
01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:21.270
but we go around the world turns when we turn.
Was it,

2026
01:54:21.450 --> 01:54:25.530
let's turn to when we turn lesson plans.
Hold on.
We got listed twice.

2027
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:29.330
<v 1>You got an echo in here.
You fucking tacked them logically.
Confused Bitch.</v>

2028
01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:31.070
What's going on?

2029
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:36.530
<v 0>I you are play this again cause nobody knows what you just said.
Stop.
It</v>

2030
01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:43.070
twirled turns.
When we turned.
Was it?
What did your two deep fans disappear?

2031
01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:46.240
Put it in my mouth.
Oh God,
my hair.

2032
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:52.270
But wherever I go.
Oh,
you are a bit his kisses salty.

2033
01:54:54.010 --> 01:54:56.720
I faked my fortune.

2034
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.790
Chanel number five.
Whoa.
No you didn't Brad.
Brad's auditable.
God,
Brad,
Brad,

2035
01:55:02.791 --> 01:55:06.330
Brad.
That's only part of it.
That's

2036
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:08.590
<v 3>you.
That's you on the podcast.
That's you right there.</v>

2037
01:55:08.591 --> 01:55:09.730
You're not working right now.

2038
01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:14.710
<v 0>No.
No.
He has it.
And let someone else like Morgan Freeman.
This is not it.</v>

2039
01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:19.540
There's someone.
He combined the two together with that song.
Kiss me playing.

2040
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:24.070
You've got the wrong video,
son.
This is ladies and gentlemen,

2041
01:55:24.071 --> 01:55:27.280
before you criticize Brian,
I want you to know that this is not planned out.

2042
01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:31.170
We just were trying to win.
Here is here Steven door.
Good.

2043
01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:36.120
Here it is.
Until we turned whiskey.
That's what we requested.
One.

2044
01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:42.060
I'm tired of being a walking astrick plans to superior negative too.

2045
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:44.250
I'm tired of feeling guilty

2046
01:55:44.250 --> 01:55:48.570
<v 11>every time I want to light up.
Dreams takeover with blue.</v>

2047
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.030
He could smoke at a basketball game that you want to.

2048
01:55:51.250 --> 01:55:52.500
Can you pause this for one second?

2049
01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.910
<v 0>If you make anything in black and white,
you're a fucking Douche bag.
Okay?</v>

2050
01:55:58.090 --> 01:56:03.090
You are not going to trick me into thinking you're thing is moody and historic

2051
01:56:03.881 --> 01:56:07.960
and interesting cause it's black and white.
Fuck you.

2052
01:56:08.410 --> 01:56:11.680
It's 2013 stupid.

2053
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:14.380
If you're only showing me things in two colors,

2054
01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:19.240
it means you're dumb and you want me to be all dumb with you and I'm not into
it.

2055
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.460
Okay?
Fuck you.

2056
01:56:23.461 --> 01:56:28.180
You're black and white shit bag two dimensional world.
I need color.
Stupid.

2057
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:32.230
I want reality.
I don't want things to be romantic.
I can't see him clearly.

2058
01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:35.680
I want you to tell me what the fuck is really going on and stop living in a

2059
01:56:35.681 --> 01:56:39.700
goddamn dream world.
Okay?
Fuck black and white.

2060
01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:43.200
I would love it if they'd color that Steven doors jacket was purple.

2061
01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:49.260
He's silly.
He's just silly,
man.
You need a letter?
He's silling Brad Pitt.
Silly.

2062
01:56:49.261 --> 01:56:51.390
They're both silly.
They should've never agreed to that.

2063
01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.590
You only agree to that shit when you're starving for Stephen Dorff for Brad Pitt

2064
01:56:55.591 --> 01:56:58.320
and less,
it all went for children's cancer or something.

2065
01:56:58.550 --> 01:57:01.470
Might Have Brad Pitt's a great human being.
He's a great human being.

2066
01:57:01.770 --> 01:57:05.020
That's why it's hard for me to criticize.
I'm definitely in love with Brad Pitt.

2067
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:08.520
He's a funny character.
Was making electronic cigarettes.

2068
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.030
He just wants to add in the bathroom on his house.
I don't know what he's doing.

2069
01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:15.180
I can't hate on the guy.
Let's just take,
it's,
would you ever renters commercial

2070
01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:21.450
<v 11>or with your friends wherever I go.
Because you are,</v>

2071
01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:24.390
the point is you can smoke blue virtually anywhere.

2072
01:57:30.450 --> 01:57:34.570
Oh my God.
Hit pause.
Brian.
What's so funny is that they're going

2073
01:57:34.570 --> 01:57:39.570
<v 0>for the iconic James being smoking and it's so funny to watch him and just know</v>

2074
01:57:39.821 --> 01:57:42.010
what to the electrics.
So ridiculous.

2075
01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:46.870
And he's got the same peacoat on that like they wrote when when like Jack

2076
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:48.070
Kerouac wrote classic novels,

2077
01:57:48.071 --> 01:57:51.670
he paid for your brilliance smoker and I got approached by this fucking company

2078
01:57:51.671 --> 01:57:54.580
for my podcast.
Really?
What'd they say?
I think it was blue cigarette.

2079
01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:58.420
Oh my goodness.
What'd you say?
No,
and Brad Pitt.
I don't,

2080
01:57:58.430 --> 01:58:00.070
I don't care about advertisers as much.

2081
01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:03.710
Right pits talking to you like at like being at the w in the elevator pit is

2082
01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:07.120
over gang.
It like he's really trying to ear fuck you.

2083
01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:11.770
Like if I was to do a commercial for,
for like perfume,

2084
01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:16.930
the only way I would ever be able to sit with it is if I did it in character.

2085
01:58:17.110 --> 01:58:19.660
And if you look at Brad Pitt's,
oh,
all his older videos,

2086
01:58:19.661 --> 01:58:23.590
remember we pulled those up.
Brian,
the Japanese ones,
those were all in character.

2087
01:58:23.591 --> 01:58:26.440
He did a lot of Japanese videos and he did,
um,

2088
01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.920
like almost as if like it was a scene in a movie like weird,

2089
01:58:29.921 --> 01:58:34.921
so he can sort of justify like some sort of creative well aspect of this stupid

2090
01:58:35.171 --> 01:58:37.180
fucking commercial and maybe that's what he's doing there.

2091
01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:41.020
Maybe he was just being like the Uber Douchey Guy.
Like ridiculous.
My Love.

2092
01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:42.130
Maybe he's,
maybe he's

2093
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:45.820
<v 2>listening to this right now.
Going get it.
I didn't get it.
No,
no,
no,
no.</v>

2094
01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:47.520
The town at the top.
The top.

2095
01:58:47.530 --> 01:58:52.300
<v 1>Listen to me.
I got it.
It's no,
okay.
I know what you're,
I know what you thinking.</v>

2096
01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:54.590
This is what's going on Brad.
He need friends.
Okay.

2097
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:57.430
You need real friends telling me what the fuck is going on.

2098
01:58:57.630 --> 01:59:00.580
You live in with that crazy bitch and you have 85 kids and you don't get a

2099
01:59:00.581 --> 01:59:04.420
moment to like stick your head up and get some air and so it's showing in your

2100
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:08.050
psyche and one of the ways that's manifesting itself is you just did a fucking

2101
01:59:08.051 --> 01:59:10.940
Chanel number five commercial.
How recent that shot.
I don't,

2102
01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:15.760
I don't give a fuck if it was a year ago.
It's in the future.
That shit is crazy.

2103
01:59:15.761 --> 01:59:18.610
That's what we need to concentrate on.
Not,
not when it manifested itself,

2104
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:23.290
but how the fuck everybody has an up in arms.
Yeah.
Brad Pitt.
What are you doing?

2105
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:25.270
How did you do a Chanel number five cornerstone?

2106
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:29.110
Do they have a video of you fucking they Chanel number five lady.
Like what?

2107
01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:34.210
What happened that made you say yes to that?
Right?
You don't need the money.

2108
01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:37.630
He doesn't need the money and I agree with you.
He needs friends.

2109
01:59:37.631 --> 01:59:39.880
He knows what he needs.
He needs someone to tell him what the fuck is going on.

2110
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:42.400
He needs to go to coffee with Jody as one more to do with mushrooms.

2111
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:44.980
I think it used to be a bunch of the mushrooms he used to party with.

2112
01:59:44.981 --> 01:59:46.060
Bill Maher could be too much.

2113
01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:49.410
<v 2>Dude.
Everyone I meet nowadays that's Party with Bill Maher.</v>

2114
01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:54.450
[inaudible] Date Bill Maher.
Maher.
I'm like,

2115
01:59:54.451 --> 01:59:57.920
what Bill Maher's him pimp.
That dude is a pimp.
Have you come to the girls?

2116
01:59:58.290 --> 02:00:01.800
Cause he cool on the show is very nice.
Yeah,
very nice to me.
The mother,

2117
02:00:01.810 --> 02:00:05.640
the wife is in love with them.
My wife hates Brian Gumbel.
Wow.
Why hates him?

2118
02:00:05.641 --> 02:00:08.070
Because he,
I don't know,
he's a little Douchey and yeah,

2119
02:00:08.170 --> 02:00:09.030
<v 1>Bill Maher.
Uh,</v>

2120
02:00:09.130 --> 02:00:13.180
the only thing that I've ever heard people critique about him is that they think

2121
02:00:13.181 --> 02:00:17.810
that he's an arrogant or they think that his ego is out of control or egos.

2122
02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:21.340
Obese sounded like he had a beef with dice clay and he did one thing that was

2123
02:00:21.341 --> 02:00:23.770
kind of crazy as that he wanted to go on after dice.

2124
02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:26.220
They did gigs together and Phoenix,
they're supposed to,

2125
02:00:26.230 --> 02:00:29.320
they did one Gig for sure.
And this,
uh,

2126
02:00:29.590 --> 02:00:32.680
the idea was that dice would go on and do a headline set and then Bill Maher

2127
02:00:32.681 --> 02:00:36.340
would headline and going after dice the last thing you want to do it,

2128
02:00:36.341 --> 02:00:40.120
let's go on after dice with like essentially a political act.

2129
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:44.620
And apparently it was just just absolutely disastrous and he got booed according

2130
02:00:44.621 --> 02:00:48.060
to dice.
Of course you got off the stage fucking dice,

2131
02:00:48.210 --> 02:00:50.980
one of the funniest fucking human beings to hear on a podcast.

2132
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.150
Bill's like he's a different sort of an animal when it comes to comedy and what

2133
02:00:55.151 --> 02:00:56.050
he's doing,
you know,

2134
02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.840
I think he has is his place and his place is that show that show is you know,

2135
02:01:00.850 --> 02:01:02.840
way more impactful than his actual standup.

2136
02:01:02.850 --> 02:01:06.430
This show the show where you get to see and yes he said some very good opinions

2137
02:01:06.431 --> 02:01:09.940
on things,
very good points of view on things.
I think bill is a very smart guy,

2138
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:11.463
really smart,

2139
02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:15.820
smart enough to not go on after Andrew dice clay though I read a article ego

2140
02:01:15.821 --> 02:01:17.590
wise,
like that was a silly idea.

2141
02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:21.120
<v 2>I don't know if I told you this or not,
but I read an article about Chris Rock,</v>

2142
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:31.740
you know that show I shouldn't have been there when I was oh yeah.

2143
02:01:32.490 --> 02:01:36.060
You know that show,
that show that made me laugh so hard.
Yeah.
Listen to it.

2144
02:01:36.210 --> 02:01:39.280
His New Year's Eve special.
No,
it was a good fucking great.
Really?
Yeah,

2145
02:01:39.281 --> 02:01:39.980
it's fucking

2146
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:40.813
<v 4>great.</v>

2147
02:01:41.010 --> 02:01:45.380
As he got into showing the dice that he shows people when he doesn't know he's

2148
02:01:45.381 --> 02:01:50.210
on like,
like there was a,
there was a of time we're dice was being like,

2149
02:01:50.211 --> 02:01:53.630
I only hung out with them a couple nights or I take that back more than that.

2150
02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:58.300
But he,
when he wasn't on stage,
he was 10 times funnier than him.
He was on stage.

2151
02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:59.313
Well

2152
02:01:59.330 --> 02:02:02.990
<v 5>for while he probably law,
not,
I want to say lost focus,</v>

2153
02:02:02.991 --> 02:02:05.450
but wasn't focusing on standing up as much as he isn't it.

2154
02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:07.800
<v 4>Yeah.
He's in family.
I think he was in family mode,</v>

2155
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:11.790
but he told me a story about kids.
Yeah,
he's very involved.

2156
02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:15.390
He told me a story about him taking his kids to the park and he had to take
them.

2157
02:02:15.490 --> 02:02:18.720
I needed to bring their bikes and it was so fucking funny.

2158
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:20.820
He was telling me Louie Anderson and Chris Rock,

2159
02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:25.500
I was lucky enough to be there and I laughed so fucking hard that I was like,

2160
02:02:25.710 --> 02:02:27.960
he doesn't even realize this is fucking funny.

2161
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:30.750
Like he doesn't even know how bad this is killing.
He should do it on stage.

2162
02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:34.290
It's sucks when you find people that are hilarious in person more so than on

2163
02:02:34.291 --> 02:02:36.600
stage.
And I didn't know if that's what he was doing,

2164
02:02:36.630 --> 02:02:38.580
like if he had gotten to that place with the stand up yet.

2165
02:02:38.690 --> 02:02:41.270
<v 5>Well I think dice got,
there was a point in time,</v>

2166
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:45.680
well I think it's going to be really hard for you and I to understand how famous

2167
02:02:45.681 --> 02:02:46.510
he got.

2168
02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:51.070
<v 4>It's very hard for me to understand.
It's,
he got to like perspective.</v>

2169
02:02:51.071 --> 02:02:56.050
I think I'm famous now.
So like,
and so we that's ridiculous.
Exactly.

2170
02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:59.190
Yeah,
I know.
No,
that's why,
that's why I'm putting it in perspective.

2171
02:02:59.191 --> 02:03:00.610
And Mommy had to know you are,

2172
02:03:00.611 --> 02:03:04.040
you are amongst listeners of the podcast is to people who know who I am,

2173
02:03:04.050 --> 02:03:05.530
but what is,
um,
what is famous?

2174
02:03:05.531 --> 02:03:09.100
Like how many people have to know you before Pam might,
your mom has to know you.

2175
02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:12.550
That's what I,
that's what I think it's a mom thing then I'm not even famous.

2176
02:03:12.810 --> 02:03:16.320
My mom knows you.
Yeah.
But your mom knows me because you work for yeah,
no,

2177
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:20.770
my mom knows fear factor.
Oh,
okay.
My Dad mom know you because of this podcast.

2178
02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.030
Really?
Yeah,
but it's interesting.
But yeah,
they do.
If I,

2179
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:27.560
if I said [inaudible] watch UFC,
was you some kind of a pussy?

2180
02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:31.510
Actually my mom knows you from news radio.
She was at Phil Hartman.

2181
02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:35.740
I knew you from news radio.
I didn't know.
That's where I first found you.
So,

2182
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:37.630
but then what is famous?
Yeah.

2183
02:03:37.631 --> 02:03:41.140
What's famous and what level is it when the sky captain,
I mean,
look,
it's a gross

2184
02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:44.230
<v 5>distinction when you're putting it on yourself.
Everybody knows that.
You say,</v>

2185
02:03:44.231 --> 02:03:48.160
well,
I'm famous.
Everybody goes,
if Tom Cruise had Melissa folks,
I'm famous.

2186
02:03:48.161 --> 02:03:49.590
If you knew it,
I was like to be me.
You'd be like,

2187
02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:51.630
<v 4>but it's so accurate.</v>

2188
02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:55.170
<v 5>Cool.
Well,
Tom Cruise is the most accurate thing ever.
I was with Kevin James.</v>

2189
02:03:55.171 --> 02:03:57.880
You want to hear how famous Tom Cruise's?
Yeah,
I was with Kevin James.

2190
02:03:57.881 --> 02:04:02.881
We're in Kevin's hotel room in Boston and his hotel room was a in is a very nice

2191
02:04:03.401 --> 02:04:06.930
hotel and across the street is this nice restaurant and we're on like,

2192
02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:09.850
I don't maybe like the fifth or the sixth floor and we're looking down and we

2193
02:04:09.851 --> 02:04:14.851
see Tom Cruise and people start running away from Tom Cruise to tell their

2194
02:04:16.841 --> 02:04:17.171
friends.

2195
02:04:17.171 --> 02:04:21.910
We watched it all happen that Tom Cruise is down here and they run back over and

2196
02:04:21.911 --> 02:04:25.240
you see like all these flash bulbs are going off down the street.
They just,

2197
02:04:25.241 --> 02:04:29.950
people decided that it was worth dropping everything they're doing.

2198
02:04:30.150 --> 02:04:33.760
It's running over to try to get a picture of Tom Cruise and me and Kevin James,

2199
02:04:33.761 --> 02:04:35.680
we're watching.
We were like,
Whoa,
there's Tom Cruise.

2200
02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:38.830
<v 4>But,
and you guys are both certifiably payments.
Well yeah,</v>

2201
02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.730
<v 1>he's more than I,
but for sure.
Yeah,
there's a lot of people know who we are,</v>

2202
02:04:42.731 --> 02:04:45.940
but we're not,
it's nothing like what it is to be this guy.

2203
02:04:46.130 --> 02:04:50.410
Like it gave me a dose of reality because like sometimes like after fights,

2204
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:51.790
after fights,

2205
02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:54.700
sometimes it becomes a pain in the ass to try to get out of the arena because

2206
02:04:54.701 --> 02:04:56.290
like you gotta like,
like,

2207
02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:59.560
like this time I was meeting some friends and they'd come in from New Mexico and

2208
02:04:59.561 --> 02:05:02.500
it was like seven o'clock I had to get out of there,
you know,

2209
02:05:02.630 --> 02:05:04.780
we're at 10 o'clock rather 11 o'clock whatever it was.

2210
02:05:05.050 --> 02:05:07.960
I had to get out of there and I had to get to the restaurant as quick as

2211
02:05:07.961 --> 02:05:09.400
possible and you know,

2212
02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:12.700
you've got to try to make your way through this gigantic massive people because

2213
02:05:12.701 --> 02:05:16.540
if you don't,
you're,
you won't go anywhere for hours and hours and hours.
Yeah.

2214
02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:19.540
You will get stuck.
Yeah.
But that's a,

2215
02:05:19.690 --> 02:05:22.000
that's a small little microcosm.

2216
02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:26.500
Only after a fight in an arena for Tom Cruise,
the whole world is like that.

2217
02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:27.880
Everywhere that guy goes,

2218
02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:30.030
<v 4>has it crept into your head?
Like what?
Like,</v>

2219
02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:32.260
are you aware of it when you're going to go

2220
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:37.150
<v 1>grocery shopping?
Occasionally.
It's more young dudes,
you know,
can,
you,</v>

2221
02:05:37.151 --> 02:05:40.720
can do,
can you point out someone that you go,
like there was a guy,

2222
02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:43.570
his head shaved and he's wearing tattoos.
That guy knows who I am.

2223
02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:45.581
<v 4>I was so,</v>

2224
02:05:45.581 --> 02:05:49.150
it's so funny cause I can point out people that w that might know me through

2225
02:05:49.151 --> 02:05:51.370
knowing that,
you know,
it's funny,

2226
02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:53.710
like the guy sitting next to me on the plane was wearing was,

2227
02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:55.300
he definitely was an MMA fighter.

2228
02:05:55.580 --> 02:06:00.430
He is a black eye fucking just first class Jack with a tap out shirt,

2229
02:06:00.670 --> 02:06:04.840
fucking hat with like he's been wrestlers entire life and he slept,

2230
02:06:04.841 --> 02:06:08.640
he got on the planet,
he fucking slept deviated septum.
Like,
and I was like,
yeah,

2231
02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:12.070
I go,
I guarantee,
I guarantee that if I said,

2232
02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:15.820
or are you involved in MMA or mixed martial arts?
He'd be like,
yeah.

2233
02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:18.340
And then I could go,
oh,
do you know Joe Rogan is?
And you'd be like,
yeah,

2234
02:06:18.430 --> 02:06:19.450
and he's listening to a podcast.

2235
02:06:19.451 --> 02:06:22.870
I couldn't see what it was he had his ear sets in.
I was like,
um,
have you ever,

2236
02:06:22.871 --> 02:06:25.660
like,
I was like,
it was,
that's how crazy the I was,

2237
02:06:25.661 --> 02:06:29.320
I could trickle down six degrees of separation or you might know who I am.

2238
02:06:29.710 --> 02:06:32.050
<v 1>Well,
that's another thing that I wanted to talk about earlier that I forgot.</v>

2239
02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:35.280
Is it one of the things that we've been discussing about like,
um,

2240
02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:40.630
what we're doing by doing all these podcasts and you have yours now and you
know,

2241
02:06:40.631 --> 02:06:45.010
of course Brian has had like a whole network of them from like maybe like the

2242
02:06:45.011 --> 02:06:46.120
first year on right

2243
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:50.510
<v 4>after the first year.
First Year we did it get started enough.
Yeah.</v>

2244
02:06:51.790 --> 02:06:56.650
<v 1>What year was that?
Like 2009.
Yeah,
nine,
10 maybe 10.</v>

2245
02:06:56.770 --> 02:07:00.990
<v 4>By the way,
I found Steven Tours and Steve O's video.
It's amazing.
I forgot about,</v>

2246
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.940
he calls her and Po Stevedores finish the story first.
One second.

2247
02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:08.240
<v 1>Um,
um,
and,
um,
when Shit,</v>

2248
02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:10.390
what was my point about these podcasts?

2249
02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:15.200
What we've done is created like a legitimate network and like there's always

2250
02:07:15.201 --> 02:07:18.320
been networks with comedy central on NBC and CBS and ABC,

2251
02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:20.990
but are they really a network?
Essentially?
There are business,

2252
02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:22.880
I mean when you call a network,
sure.

2253
02:07:22.881 --> 02:07:26.240
They mean if there's a network of people that pick up on their shows.

2254
02:07:26.241 --> 02:07:30.200
But as far as like a creative network,
it's not really,

2255
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:34.490
it's just like sort of one business that tries to put on television shows and

2256
02:07:34.491 --> 02:07:36.000
they have a network of people that received

2257
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:36.520
<v 5>them.</v>

2258
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.360
But the difference in the kind of network that we're sort of doing right now is

2259
02:07:40.361 --> 02:07:44.830
that it's a real network amongst friends and amongst people that are talented

2260
02:07:44.831 --> 02:07:47.440
and the people that we respect,
like as,

2261
02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:50.770
as we sort of do all these podcasts and link them all together,

2262
02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:53.770
Dunkin's to yours,
to Ari,
Joey's to,
and as,

2263
02:07:53.771 --> 02:07:55.570
as all of these things get sort of linked together,

2264
02:07:55.571 --> 02:07:59.950
that becomes like a real network and then an organic network,

2265
02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:04.350
like you're a part of it and Dunkin's a part of it and is a part of it in Joey's

2266
02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:08.590
a part of everyone's a part of it and it's all just connected together and it's

2267
02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:12.220
connected together by nothing other than true friendship.
There's no paperwork,

2268
02:08:12.221 --> 02:08:16.170
there's no bullshit.
There's no contracts,
there's no obligations.
There's,

2269
02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.380
there's no,
there's not

2270
02:08:17.670 --> 02:08:20.670
<v 4>so interesting that you say that side.
Perfect.
Now that I think about it,
I go,</v>

2271
02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:23.710
yeah,
like,
uh,
like a Dunkin,

2272
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:29.030
like the people that have been on my podcast or Joey Ari have fron like it's

2273
02:08:29.131 --> 02:08:32.270
just,
it's like jump my buddy John Morris,
all friends and,

2274
02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:36.750
and I'm in Dunkin texted me right after he got done the cancer thing and was

2275
02:08:36.751 --> 02:08:39.060
like,
Hey,
I'd love to have you on my podcast.
And I was like,
oh,

2276
02:08:39.061 --> 02:08:41.340
I'd like to have you on mine.
And he was like,
cool,
we'll do that then.

2277
02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:42.480
And it was like,
like,

2278
02:08:42.481 --> 02:08:45.030
and I clearly understand what it's like to try to find guests to get on a

2279
02:08:45.031 --> 02:08:46.470
podcast now.
I never knew what it was like,

2280
02:08:46.471 --> 02:08:50.010
I just always did them because I liked him.
But like you very easily,

2281
02:08:50.011 --> 02:08:54.330
there could be a continuance of like,
like there are people that like,
uh,
like,

2282
02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:57.330
uh,
very candidly,
I'll say this,
I don't know,

2283
02:08:57.410 --> 02:09:00.860
I'm trepid walking into anything in this material.
Tom's guru and I,

2284
02:09:00.861 --> 02:09:03.930
we're going to do a podcast about Jay,
more about my experience with Jay.

2285
02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:08.790
And so we were like going to do it and I was like,
I was like,

2286
02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:13.380
maybe it will just be fucking honest.
Why would you bother?
Exactly.
Exactly.

2287
02:09:13.381 --> 02:09:15.060
Why would you bother?
Exactly.
We were like,

2288
02:09:15.061 --> 02:09:17.580
maybe we'll just talk about it and like air it out.
And I was like,
fuck it.

2289
02:09:17.610 --> 02:09:19.560
It's gone.
It's in my history and my past.

2290
02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:23.920
<v 2>Yeah,
but he keeps on breaking it up.
Well,
he's on Pokemon.
Everything.
It's like,</v>

2291
02:09:23.921 --> 02:09:28.830
come on,
just stop and move on.
That's on him.
I know that,
but it sucks.

2292
02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:32.820
<v 5>In fact,
I don't have a problem with Jay more.
I've never,</v>

2293
02:09:32.821 --> 02:09:34.350
I've never had a problem with Jay Moore.

2294
02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:37.980
The last text I sent him was positive and I w I haven't spoke to him since,

2295
02:09:38.010 --> 02:09:40.900
but I don't,
I don't want to necessarily go into anything.
No,

2296
02:09:41.010 --> 02:09:43.530
I don't want to dis guy.
I know what things,

2297
02:09:43.650 --> 02:09:46.350
I know when things are crazy and when things are normal.
Okay.

2298
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:50.040
I know what makes sense and when you just keep bringing something up when you

2299
02:09:50.041 --> 02:09:53.640
keep going back over an issue and responding.
If I wanted to,

2300
02:09:53.641 --> 02:09:56.010
I could respond to Joe Rogan.

2301
02:09:56.011 --> 02:09:59.430
I smoke rocks all day every day and you would think that that's the only thing

2302
02:09:59.431 --> 02:10:02.160
that ever get on Twitter because I get it everyone almost every day,

2303
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:05.890
<v 2>almost every day.
Someone serious broken.
I don't know if you know this about me,</v>

2304
02:10:05.891 --> 02:10:07.550
but I smoke rocks.
Yeah,

2305
02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:12.390
<v 5>I'm and I'm honored.
I was a part of an iconic sketch,
which in my opinion,</v>

2306
02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:17.420
the the funniest guy ever in any sort of a show on TV.
Dave Chappelle.
Yeah.

2307
02:10:17.421 --> 02:10:18.254
I think that,

2308
02:10:18.330 --> 02:10:22.080
I think that show was the funniest show for me that I've ever seen in the

2309
02:10:22.081 --> 02:10:25.230
history of my life.
So I'm honored when I don't get upset,

2310
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:27.870
but if I wanted to just respond to that all day,

2311
02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:31.710
that's what my Twitter feed would be.
You choose what you respond to.
So

2312
02:10:31.930 --> 02:10:34.280
<v 2>I don't respond to anything.
There is no real drama</v>

2313
02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.980
<v 5>between me and Jay more or you if everybody really does move on,</v>

2314
02:10:39.190 --> 02:10:44.190
why respond to trolls who are just trying to get you to respond to something

2315
02:10:44.411 --> 02:10:49.330
that's a hot button topic by bringing up that shit is childish and I am a grown

2316
02:10:49.331 --> 02:10:50.750
man and I don't know,

2317
02:10:50.850 --> 02:10:54.390
<v 0>play 40 years old style this 40 years old.</v>

2318
02:10:54.391 --> 02:10:59.391
I'm a grown man and I have a lot of interests and none of them involved

2319
02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:02.540
responding to little silly bitches online.

2320
02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:06.330
I have zero interest in never.
I've never,

2321
02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:09.630
the one thing suggest you do the same.

2322
02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:13.890
I suggest to everybody when someone sends you something online,

2323
02:11:13.891 --> 02:11:17.830
it's Douchey and Conti and you want to respond.
That is your,

2324
02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.680
this is the universe giving you a test and just got an intelligence test.

2325
02:11:22.681 --> 02:11:26.250
Dude,
I've responded,
uh,
responded to people and regretted it.

2326
02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.700
Of course we all have in the second.
You do.
Yeah.
The moment you say,

2327
02:11:29.701 --> 02:11:33.930
fuck your mother and your fucking mother's assholes where your fucking Dick came

2328
02:11:33.931 --> 02:11:38.230
out of the moment.
You do that,
you feel like such a stupid person and then you,

2329
02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:41.840
and then you're,
you're sucked into a web.
Yeah,
it's negative energy,
but it's the,

2330
02:11:41.850 --> 02:11:45.000
it's Brody,
Stevens mentalities,
negative energy but gets negative energy,

2331
02:11:45.001 --> 02:11:48.160
positive energy.
That's all you gotta do.
And I,
and that's why I like [inaudible].

2332
02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.510
It's been,
yeah,
but I also believe firmly

2333
02:11:51.790 --> 02:11:52.151
<v 5>that,</v>

2334
02:11:52.151 --> 02:11:56.200
but then you believe that the people that have sent me negative things online,

2335
02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:01.610
there's been truth in a lot of it.
I've read a lot of criticisms of

2336
02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.180
<v 0>Dan,
Dan [inaudible] or listen to me.</v>

2337
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:08.540
I've read a lot of criticism into my stand up or criticism.

2338
02:12:08.690 --> 02:12:10.230
<v 5>If my commentary on,</v>

2339
02:12:10.231 --> 02:12:15.231
on fighting and criticisms even on the podcast and I have legitimately learn

2340
02:12:15.541 --> 02:12:20.541
from it even from people that said negative shit because whether I like them or

2341
02:12:20.971 --> 02:12:23.790
not,
they have a very,
they have a point of view.

2342
02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:27.360
They've seen something and they seen it from their eyes and for whatever reason

2343
02:12:27.361 --> 02:12:32.220
from their eyes,
I'm annoying.
And that's real.
That,
that is how they view me.

2344
02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:34.230
And that's not what you say.

2345
02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:37.920
It's not to say that the people that aren't annoyed by me aren't correct.

2346
02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:40.380
It's just that's what,
what,
how they feel about it.

2347
02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:43.320
Like there's a lot of people that I'm friends with that,
you know,

2348
02:12:43.321 --> 02:12:47.250
a lot of people like,
look,
my wife would not want to hang out with Joey Diaz.

2349
02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:52.500
Okay.
If Joey Diaz was was high as fuck and uh,
you know,

2350
02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:57.510
and,
and he was on some wild,
crazy rants about licon Lucy snore bushes,

2351
02:12:57.511 --> 02:13:00.990
pussy in the middle of the night.
If he,
if you know,
if she was in this room,

2352
02:13:00.991 --> 02:13:03.960
she would absolutely,
she would laugh,
no question about it.

2353
02:13:04.110 --> 02:13:08.090
But it's not like she would go seek to hang out with Joey Diaz,

2354
02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.110
whereas I would yet obviously I love both of them.
You know what I'm saying?

2355
02:13:13.111 --> 02:13:16.050
Right.
It's like we don't have to change each other,

2356
02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:19.800
but we must accept the fact that,
you know,
it's,
you're,

2357
02:13:19.801 --> 02:13:23.190
you're not gonna like me always.
I'm not going to like you always,

2358
02:13:23.191 --> 02:13:26.520
it's just like just be nice and find the people that you do like and

2359
02:13:26.521 --> 02:13:27.300
everything's fine.

2360
02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:30.960
But even the people that don't like me or they've seen my shit,

2361
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:32.370
I've gotten criticism

2362
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:34.080
<v 1>out of that,
that I've incorporated.</v>

2363
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:37.950
But what about looked at it like from their point of view and it's helped me.

2364
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:41.300
<v 4>No.
What about this point though?
Is that especially on Twitter?</v>

2365
02:13:41.301 --> 02:13:43.790
I'll say Twitter exclusively cause I remember when bird,

2366
02:13:43.791 --> 02:13:45.840
the conquerors started airing and I started at some guy,

2367
02:13:45.841 --> 02:13:50.841
I remember some black dude wrote a very quick like currently who is this ass

2368
02:13:51.231 --> 02:13:55.310
clown?
The conquer,
am I supposed to enjoy this shit?
And then I wrote back,

2369
02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:58.520
just wrote back positively.
I was like,
I was like,

2370
02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.750
imagine BME watching it and then he wrote black.
Oh ha ha ha.
So funny.

2371
02:14:02.751 --> 02:14:05.510
He didn't know you'd read this.
Sorry.
I really liked the show.

2372
02:14:05.511 --> 02:14:07.610
I was just fucking around.
Like how about those?

2373
02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:09.980
Like the opinions have gotten so bold now.

2374
02:14:10.190 --> 02:14:12.710
Like people say things they would never say to your face.
Yeah,

2375
02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:15.620
there's definitely adapt.
But I don't really mean,

2376
02:14:15.630 --> 02:14:18.620
it's like that video just posted twitch,
twitters,
you know,

2377
02:14:18.621 --> 02:14:22.250
like people that are just twitching almost like,
like I thick.
Yeah.
Your mom.
Yeah,

2378
02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:24.770
I need something to tweet.
Fuck this guy.
It's like that video.

2379
02:14:24.771 --> 02:14:29.771
I don't if two inch twitters such a fucking funny ways.

2380
02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:35.660
Like,
you know what it is?
It's like tweet Tourette's.
Yeah,
but like those,

2381
02:14:35.661 --> 02:14:38.120
you see that like money Todd.
Yeah,
that's the word.
Lucky Todd.

2382
02:14:38.121 --> 02:14:40.070
Like last night went crazy.
Fucking psycho.

2383
02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:44.510
Well he's just a gentleman trying to make his way through this to get her
spiral.

2384
02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:48.650
You're lucky bitch.
We all fall apart eventually.
Every one fucking literally,

2385
02:14:48.690 --> 02:14:52.220
and you see the video you tweeted about those.

2386
02:14:52.221 --> 02:14:55.780
I don't know if we can talk about it or not cause it's kind of sketchy boys.

2387
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.660
<v 1>The boys who uh,
allegedly gang rape some girl and they were joking about it.</v>

2388
02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:04.750
<v 4>Oh my God.
But here's,
here's the thing.
It's like,
it's like a man.
It's you.</v>

2389
02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:09.500
You look at the tweets from them,
the tweets about lying.
My God,

2390
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:12.700
borrowers get no respect or whatever.
And,
and,
uh,

2391
02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:17.060
now I didn't grow up with Twitter,
so I go,
how the fuck could you be that person?

2392
02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:20.620
But maybe that's a new part of like,
maybe they're going to be like,
oh,

2393
02:15:20.690 --> 02:15:22.790
we didn't mean it.
No.
Listen,

2394
02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:26.160
<v 1>those people always existed.
They always existed.</v>

2395
02:15:26.190 --> 02:15:29.220
They just didn't have the opportunity to express themselves like they do now

2396
02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:31.020
with Twitter to the point where everyone,

2397
02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:34.440
anybody who wants to can literally go on Twitter and read what they said.

2398
02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:38.500
But what's different now is that people can respond to these kids and these
kids,

2399
02:15:38.501 --> 02:15:41.340
do you understand that there forever you're fucking documented.

2400
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:45.690
They've always existed.
They've always existed.
Sociopath's have always existed.

2401
02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:50.900
Groups of men willing to gang rape have always existed existed.

2402
02:15:50.970 --> 02:15:53.430
I can't even fathom out the reason why they've always existed.

2403
02:15:53.431 --> 02:15:57.420
One of the big reasons is that there had been no repercussions for it in,
uh,

2404
02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:00.340
like an internal way.
Like it's not,
there's never been like,

2405
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:05.160
there's never been like documentation about a gang rape from the Roman era that

2406
02:16:05.161 --> 02:16:06.210
we can like put,

2407
02:16:06.211 --> 02:16:10.530
go and read online and watch and then go and watch videos of guys joking about

2408
02:16:10.531 --> 02:16:12.900
it and then going see photos of the victim.

2409
02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:16.440
There's never been an opportunity like that,
but there is now and that,

2410
02:16:16.590 --> 02:16:19.310
those images of that,
there's a,
there's one image of a girl.

2411
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:20.910
It's unbelievably shocking.

2412
02:16:20.911 --> 02:16:23.550
The girls completely unconsciously dragging her and they're called.

2413
02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:25.350
They call them or people call them the rape.

2414
02:16:25.670 --> 02:16:29.770
<v 4>Wait,
hold on.
I didn't,
I was afraid I,
this is how fucking sensitive.</v>

2415
02:16:29.771 --> 02:16:31.180
I've got two daughters.

2416
02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:35.170
I was afraid to even click on the video that they had because I got nervous.

2417
02:16:35.171 --> 02:16:37.240
I was like,
I'm going to want to see an exact,
you should be,

2418
02:16:37.241 --> 02:16:38.350
you should creep into my life.

2419
02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:41.720
<v 5>You know?
First of all,
we have to figure out what if you don't end the story.</v>

2420
02:16:42.110 --> 02:16:46.640
There was apparently a gang rape in Ohio like a year ago and what happened was

2421
02:16:46.670 --> 02:16:51.670
the whole town has struggled to try to cover it up because the team is filled

2422
02:16:52.011 --> 02:16:53.870
with these,
like it's all their football team.

2423
02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:56.740
The football team is like a big source of revenue and,

2424
02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:59.430
<v 4>and this is [inaudible].
Is this allegedly Joe?</v>

2425
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:03.590
This is not allegedly allegedly like people have like taken.
I don't,

2426
02:17:03.591 --> 02:17:07.380
I don't know what's in it.
What is it,
Steubenville?

2427
02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:09.000
Where does that stigma goes?

2428
02:17:09.001 --> 02:17:13.240
I really Hick Hick town in Ohio or is it really super hero?

2429
02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:14.933
Kids were charged.

2430
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:18.960
They drugged up this girl and they hold a broader from party to party.

2431
02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:21.660
Hold on one second.
The more than one party.
The lead guy,

2432
02:17:21.690 --> 02:17:24.600
it was his ex girlfriend,
she dumped him and he said,

2433
02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:28.830
no bitch will ever get over on me or something to that effect.
And then he,

2434
02:17:28.860 --> 02:17:33.030
him and his friend set it up.
They had his fucking,
one friend said like,
go,
Hey,

2435
02:17:33.031 --> 02:17:34.140
I want to go out on a date.

2436
02:17:34.141 --> 02:17:37.890
And they picked her up and then they drugged her and then apparently they gang

2437
02:17:37.891 --> 02:17:40.140
raped her and took her from party to party like weekend at Bernie's.

2438
02:17:40.141 --> 02:17:44.880
Just horrific.
I mean it's so fucking,
it's so inhuman and end.

2439
02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:47.250
They have,
I can't,
um,

2440
02:17:48.090 --> 02:17:52.290
the only thing that I just get confused about is their fucking Instagram

2441
02:17:52.470 --> 02:17:55.710
instagramming all of these pictures.
Yeah.
And they're not just instagramming.

2442
02:17:55.711 --> 02:17:58.680
They're tweeting about it.
They're taught calling the girl a whore and know her,

2443
02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:00.960
she gets any worse,
bad conscious.
And it's like,

2444
02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:04.250
<v 5>and you know how this got exposed.
Anonymous seriousness.
Yeah.</v>

2445
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:07.180
Anonymous is important.
You know it,

2446
02:18:07.430 --> 02:18:12.280
I have not disagreed with them on any move yet.
I have no fucking every,

2447
02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:12.981
I followed him.

2448
02:18:12.981 --> 02:18:16.100
I had to unfollow him because he have treats way too much to see their point of

2449
02:18:16.101 --> 02:18:19.490
view.
I see what they're trying to do and when they do something like this,

2450
02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:23.390
I say it's worth every negative aspect that they bring to the table.

2451
02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:28.570
Any idea about vigilantism or any idea that people have issues with when they do

2452
02:18:29.031 --> 02:18:31.100
something like this?
I say it makes them,

2453
02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:35.870
if they are one of the most valuable assets on the Internet when something goes

2454
02:18:35.871 --> 02:18:40.400
wrong and the world is upset when we were all morally upset,

2455
02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:41.630
they come in

2456
02:18:42.330 --> 02:18:42.780
<v 4>if Goo,</v>

2457
02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:47.100
if anonymous made like a thing where it's like Google where like like I don't

2458
02:18:47.101 --> 02:18:51.180
want Google to know all my shit,
but if anonymous knew all my shit,
I'd be like,

2459
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:55.300
I'd be feel more safe than [inaudible].
You know,

2460
02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:57.050
despite what a lot of people have said,
you're

2461
02:18:57.050 --> 02:19:01.080
<v 5>a nice guy,
you know,
you're a very nice guy,
you're a nice guy.
I am.</v>

2462
02:19:01.081 --> 02:19:03.080
I try as hard as I can be to be a nice guy.

2463
02:19:03.081 --> 02:19:04.730
I would never describe myself as a nice guy.

2464
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:06.740
I don't have to self-defining thoughts,

2465
02:19:07.130 --> 02:19:10.850
but I try as hard as I could be to be a nice guy.
Jamie's a nice guy.

2466
02:19:11.210 --> 02:19:14.120
There's this is,
this is in escapable.

2467
02:19:14.210 --> 02:19:16.580
If you go through life and you try to be a nice guy,

2468
02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:20.360
generally people are not going to be angry with you generally.

2469
02:19:20.361 --> 02:19:24.530
If you can avoid conflicts,
do it and you'll get along way better in this life.

2470
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:28.520
Well,
when you get to a situation,
we're ultimately,

2471
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.230
<v 1>we're going,
no question about it.</v>

2472
02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:34.310
We're going to get to a situation where everyone can reach out to anyone at any

2473
02:19:34.311 --> 02:19:36.580
time,
all over the world.
It's going to come.
Yeah,

2474
02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:39.860
there's going to be privacy filters that we're going to try to put into place to

2475
02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:41.390
keep people from contacting you,

2476
02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:44.690
but ultimately you're going to be responsible for the frequency that you put
out.

2477
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:47.390
And if you put out a frequency,
if you're a famous guy,

2478
02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:51.560
if you're a Bert Kreischer,
I say Berg crushed his famous,
putting out a free,

2479
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:56.710
you're putting out a frequency to whether it's 100,000 people or 300,000 people

2480
02:19:57.471 --> 02:20:02.180
with 3 million people,
whatever that frequency is going out to,

2481
02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:06.370
you're responsible for that.
And if you get bad pings,
so repeatable,

2482
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:08.720
get upset at that.
There's,

2483
02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:13.760
there's opportunities to both learn about yourself and learn about other people,

2484
02:20:13.761 --> 02:20:14.091
man,

2485
02:20:14.091 --> 02:20:18.260
because when you learn about other people from their interactions with you and

2486
02:20:18.261 --> 02:20:19.430
how they interpret you,

2487
02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:23.540
you can see weakness in people that you don't have to senior yourself.

2488
02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:26.040
You could see mistakes and people that you can learn from.
Well,

2489
02:20:26.041 --> 02:20:29.270
you don't have to make those mistakes.
That should super important.

2490
02:20:29.390 --> 02:20:33.170
You need losers to show you the way.
They might not even be real.

2491
02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:37.160
The more they look into simulation theory and the more they try to understand

2492
02:20:37.161 --> 02:20:40.640
that the very nature of the reality that we live in and how fucking truly

2493
02:20:40.641 --> 02:20:41.480
slippery it is.

2494
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:45.830
The douche bags that you encounter might be bad guys in the doom video.
Okay.

2495
02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:50.570
They might be there so that you can understand what is the wrong way to behave

2496
02:20:50.571 --> 02:20:53.850
and learn from it.
They might not even be real.
Yeah.

2497
02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:59.690
The anybody out there that's lost a loved one or had someone victim of a violent

2498
02:20:59.691 --> 02:21:02.810
crime.
That sounds ridiculous and in your reality,
yes,

2499
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:04.880
but in bird crushes reality.

2500
02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:08.090
<v 3>No.
My upon realities twisted right now.
Fuck.</v>

2501
02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:13.260
I was blown away though by the fucking anonymous was like showed the pictures of

2502
02:21:13.381 --> 02:21:16.230
the guy.
Yeah.
The guy was fucking so went almost.

2503
02:21:16.231 --> 02:21:19.530
You almost appreciate a guy like that.
He should do that for almost man.

2504
02:21:19.531 --> 02:21:21.210
I appreciate the,
I appreciate him.

2505
02:21:21.211 --> 02:21:24.690
I couldn't tell them on Twitter but I appreciate what they're doing and I and

2506
02:21:24.691 --> 02:21:28.020
I'll fall.
Anybody who does that on Twitter?
I have you do follow anonymous?

2507
02:21:28.021 --> 02:21:31.670
Probably.
Nah,
I do follow a lot of people don't want to miss tweets.
I phone stop.

2508
02:21:31.890 --> 02:21:35.340
You know what?
I was a big thing.
You got it on just recently.

2509
02:21:35.370 --> 02:21:39.000
I'm really upset recently that Twitter's been only suggesting porn stars to me.

2510
02:21:39.070 --> 02:21:42.600
No,
sorry.
Ever suggested that to him.
God,
what am I,
what are you trying to say?

2511
02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:46.530
Okay I to say anything wrong with porn stars but how about a phd?

2512
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:50.580
Every now and again,
am I really just a fucking pervert?

2513
02:21:50.581 --> 02:21:54.800
Is that all you're saying?
Twitter Dude,
Asa Akira traceable.

2514
02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:58.470
Fucking watch that shit.
You will buy when to buy her flowers.

2515
02:21:58.570 --> 02:22:00.400
I feel so bad cause even better.
I got it

2516
02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:05.250
<v 1>chick.
Let's,
let's,
let's,
let's make people go and fall somebody.
How about this?</v>

2517
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:10.420
Cause someone named Mackenzie dern and she is at Gracie who mada she meet a

2518
02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:15.570
brown belt,
five time world champion.
See Twitter asked me to follow her.

2519
02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:19.770
Mckenzie Mac,
Kenzie dern,
d e r.
N.
And I say,
yes,

2520
02:22:19.771 --> 02:22:24.060
I will follow her [inaudible] ass chick out this strangling.

2521
02:22:24.390 --> 02:22:26.760
<v 4>Oh,
I didn't look at mine.
Mine.
Oh,
clearly.</v>

2522
02:22:26.761 --> 02:22:31.761
Clearly I am on a a desk squad kick because mine are tap out and Frank Mir,

2523
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:37.830
well frank is Wagner's a very intelligent guy to watch sleepwalk with me.

2524
02:22:37.831 --> 02:22:42.420
It's on Netflix.
We had Mike [inaudible],
I finally watched it.

2525
02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:45.240
That's a great fucking movie.
Started watching.

2526
02:22:45.241 --> 02:22:49.590
I started listening to the NPR podcast because of your interview with,

2527
02:22:49.650 --> 02:22:52.440
with Birbiglia and I and I think I even told him,

2528
02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:57.540
I think I tweeted him or something.
But Man,
American,
uh,
American,
what is it?

2529
02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:01.410
Uh,
the one with IRA glass,
the one that he does all the,
all the time.

2530
02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:05.310
This American life is great and you know,
whatever other ones.
Great.

2531
02:23:05.311 --> 02:23:06.120
His radio lab,

2532
02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:10.020
there's a podcast at radio lab did that I listened to on a treadmill.

2533
02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:13.590
I had to stop running and sit down and finish it.
It was so fucking good.

2534
02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:15.930
It's called the dark side of the moon or something.

2535
02:23:15.931 --> 02:23:18.510
It's about an astronaut who's,
he's an old man.

2536
02:23:18.511 --> 02:23:22.620
He calls in to moving Demitri Martin directed it.
Dimitri.

2537
02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:26.640
They do these live shows in a theater with the lights out because it's a
podcast.

2538
02:23:26.641 --> 02:23:26.910
Right.

2539
02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:29.730
And they do a live show up on the thing and then they had this guy called in,

2540
02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:34.740
he was an astronaut.
So it's like a play it,
no it's,
it is,
but with no,

2541
02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:37.800
they know you can't see anything.
They're doing it more dark.
Okay.

2542
02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:42.480
So everyone's just coming to the show on radio shows or radio live audience.

2543
02:23:42.481 --> 02:23:45.770
Right.
And they're throwing what a great idea.
Fucking right.
And their throat.

2544
02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:47.250
And Dimitri said,

2545
02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:51.480
I think we could get everyone laser pointers so they can all hit like a bad
idea.

2546
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:54.600
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
But it's like,
it's like,
so they're all that,
but no,

2547
02:23:54.601 --> 02:23:57.040
but everyone's doing it in unison.
Like I,
I,

2548
02:23:57.041 --> 02:24:00.030
maybe I'm fucking this [inaudible] so anyway,
but the,
the,
the,

2549
02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:04.350
the point of the story of this guy has told is that is no more balls anymore

2550
02:24:04.351 --> 02:24:08.820
cause it kind of burned out by lasers.
No,
he doin lasers were dangerous.

2551
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:12.270
I want to,
Star Wars are dangerous if they get in your eye.

2552
02:24:12.330 --> 02:24:14.590
Not all of them though.
Anyway,
the point,

2553
02:24:14.810 --> 02:24:18.570
good point story is this guy gets locked out of the fucking space station with a

2554
02:24:18.571 --> 02:24:21.420
Russian and they have to try to break into a new hole and get it in.

2555
02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:23.880
And it's all about him being in the dark and him being in the,

2556
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.200
it's w I'm telling you,
Joe,

2557
02:24:25.201 --> 02:24:28.620
it's one of the greatest stories I've ever heard I love called.
Uh,
it's called,

2558
02:24:28.621 --> 02:24:33.360
it's,
it's,
it's a,
a king woods radio lab.
It's a few weeks back,
dark.

2559
02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:37.200
Is it in the dark,
in the dark and it's dark and a deal.
It is.

2560
02:24:37.201 --> 02:24:41.340
The gradient is the fucking coolest interview I've heard.
And he's an old man,

2561
02:24:41.341 --> 02:24:44.820
so he's not trying to be funny.
He's just being an old man and he's like,
uh,

2562
02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:47.430
and this is a true story.
True Story.
100% true.

2563
02:24:47.431 --> 02:24:50.820
You're just sitting there fucking floored.
Like,
Oh,
I'm just confused.

2564
02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:54.030
I thought it was a fiction piece.
No,
the guy is a real story.

2565
02:24:54.031 --> 02:24:56.420
He was up there with his Russian and it's,
dude,

2566
02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:01.180
it's painted in the dark and weird.
Yeah,
that sounds so good.

2567
02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:05.820
You know?
Listen,
man,
we need to do that.
We need to do podcast where we,

2568
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.470
this is what we're going to do [inaudible] to the next level.

2569
02:25:10.471 --> 02:25:13.260
We're going to hire security guards and have infrared goggles on.
Okay?

2570
02:25:13.261 --> 02:25:16.410
So that makes sure that nobody gets crazy cool and they'll hide in the corners

2571
02:25:16.411 --> 02:25:19.560
of the room with fucking guns and Mace.
Okay?

2572
02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:23.980
Then the rest of the audience is in complete and total darkness.
Joe,

2573
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:28.790
<v 0>this is a fucking genius idea.
And then sports walking around getting blow jobs.</v>

2574
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:33.230
No,
because the guys with the night vision goggles,
what if they it and no,
no,
no,

2575
02:25:33.250 --> 02:25:37.000
no.
They're not allowed to look at it.
This is a genius.
This is genius idea.

2576
02:25:37.090 --> 02:25:41.750
You do this on a stage.
We donate.
We have a magic word marshmallow.
Say we have,

2577
02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:44.840
we,
we have a safe word.
No record dude.
Who recorded.

2578
02:25:44.850 --> 02:25:46.810
Imagine doing a podcast.

2579
02:25:46.811 --> 02:25:50.220
We're all getting blowjobs to whole time or doing a podcast.
That sounds like,

2580
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:52.840
that sounds like something that no one would want to listen to.
Brian,

2581
02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:55.530
it's a lot like a lot of this.
If you want to listen to,

2582
02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:58.330
can listen to the fucking swell dialogue and porn.

2583
02:25:59.190 --> 02:26:01.750
You want to say her good dialogue in a movie where it's like,
wow,

2584
02:26:01.751 --> 02:26:04.600
that guy has a really good point.
While he's getting blown.
No.

2585
02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.500
Most of your reserves will be spent concentrating on coq feelings.

2586
02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:11.200
That's the next level of stand up.
Stand up in the dark.

2587
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:14.950
No good is your material that you can do is stay up in the dark.

2588
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.690
When we look at your bitch,
you're right there.
What's the,

2589
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:21.550
why are we playing games?
Cut off the lights but a podcast in the dark.
Well,

2590
02:26:21.551 --> 02:26:23.320
I mean cause that was,
people listen to it.
It look,

2591
02:26:23.321 --> 02:26:26.740
it'd be fun to do stand up if we all agreed to lie on the ground.
Yes.

2592
02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:28.750
If we had a room.
How about this?

2593
02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:31.420
How about if we had stand up and we did stand up like this.

2594
02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:35.420
So I did stand up and like a gymnasium and everybody gets like a

2595
02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:41.260
one of those pads.
So they like fucking go camping and just like,

2596
02:26:41.300 --> 02:26:45.310
it's like partying.
Yeah,
going to bed and you can't,
can't see me.

2597
02:26:45.311 --> 02:26:46.900
Everyone's lying down.
We're in the document,

2598
02:26:46.901 --> 02:26:50.470
what's up bitches and everybody laughs and then he just started talking about

2599
02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:53.680
whatever and whatever.
Everyone's here would have to be.
It would have to be,

2600
02:26:53.681 --> 02:26:54.430
you would have to,

2601
02:26:54.430 --> 02:26:57.190
it would be completely different kind of shout because you would,
first of all,

2602
02:26:57.191 --> 02:26:58.330
the people would be right there.

2603
02:26:58.331 --> 02:27:01.000
And there's that element you can't get away from.

2604
02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:05.710
By the way,
I'm at the Ice House Comedy Club,
January 11.

2605
02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:10.390
That's Friday eight 30 enter within 10 30.
So far.
Sam triply is confirmed.

2606
02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:13.930
I believe I'll be there Friday.
Shit,
Brian will be there as well.

2607
02:27:14.390 --> 02:27:17.310
To me it's only one night.
Oh,
this Friday,
this Friday.

2608
02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:20.710
I that this is a really great idea.
My point is sleeping bags.
Everyone,

2609
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:25.200
we do it in a gymnasium.
We've got to do a comedy show in the gymnasium and uh,

2610
02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:31.140
each act lies down and instead of passing the mic back and forth to each other,

2611
02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:33.430
you just turn your mic on when it's your turn.

2612
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:36.820
So like we would all lie down together on the stage and if you have to get up

2613
02:27:36.821 --> 02:27:40.360
and go pee,
that's okay.
So we're not Nazis.
You know you can get up and leave,

2614
02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:42.850
but don't be staring at people while they're lying down.
Okay.

2615
02:27:42.851 --> 02:27:46.560
With your eyes closed because that's fucking creepy.
How fucking great is that?

2616
02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:48.940
I'm excited just talking about it.

2617
02:27:48.970 --> 02:27:52.490
This is the only better idea I've heard from you is our compound.
I won't,

2618
02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:54.430
that's happening,
happening.

2619
02:27:54.431 --> 02:27:59.020
Aubrey's in Aubrey's done a more realistic idea.
We all go to Joshua tree.

2620
02:27:59.050 --> 02:28:03.400
Go to that.
That,
that uh,
place that I stayed at a more realistic idea.

2621
02:28:03.401 --> 02:28:06.520
How can you say it's more realistic because we're not all gonna like move our

2622
02:28:06.521 --> 02:28:10.570
families.
No,
no,
no,
no.
This,
you don't understand.
This is the latest idea.

2623
02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:16.020
The latest idea is we get a set up like [inaudible] why did you make condos gay?

2624
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:22.190
It was at one point

2625
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:27.140
<v 7>in time,
kind of used to be a mailing work point of success.</v>

2626
02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:32.060
Well,
I've got a condo.
I can take her back to the condo.

2627
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:34.010
I leased a BMW three series.

2628
02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:39.290
Enjoy yet you do you sexualize that word forever.

2629
02:28:39.470 --> 02:28:41.870
Drive knows

2630
02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:49.350
timeshare.
Kinda.
Let's
imagine being a dude named Bruce.
Oh,

2631
02:28:49.351 --> 02:28:52.130
your name is Bruce.
It's like they sexualize.

2632
02:28:52.131 --> 02:28:56.690
That name is literalize Bruce.
They broke it off.

2633
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:59.690
They broke it off with sweet.
What's the next generation of the [inaudible]?

2634
02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:03.650
<v 0>The compound.
The next generation of the combat is a high fence hunting setup.</v>

2635
02:29:05.250 --> 02:29:08.440
<v 7>It's really,
do
you get</v>

2636
02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:13.050
lab in Texas?
You get a slab in Texas.

2637
02:29:13.350 --> 02:29:16.250
We want to get at least a few hundred acres,
but mo,

2638
02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:21.180
ideally several thousand acres with a lake or to Santa Barbara left.

2639
02:29:21.181 --> 02:29:25.110
Hold on.
I did.

2640
02:29:25.111 --> 02:29:26.190
I did.

2641
02:29:26.191 --> 02:29:31.191
I tell you now how dedicated on it is to success.

2642
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.000
This is the idea and this is I bring in Aubrey,
of course,
this is my main man.

2643
02:29:36.001 --> 02:29:40.120
Anything on a business related by the way,
higher-primate.com

2644
02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:43.330
<v 0>the tee shirt.
We will get tee shirts back in.
I'm so sorry.</v>

2645
02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:44.460
Everybody keeps complaining.

2646
02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.560
Eventually a Aubrey is going to be involved in that as well.

2647
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:52.660
The idea is you set up and a purse.
Everyone has a person that's got fucking

2648
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:55.380
<v 7>glitter on it.
Let it go.</v>

2649
02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:58.990
My audit man versus are going to have fake rubies.

2650
02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:03.330
You plastic on it man.
Versus we should say,

2651
02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:06.301
okay,

2652
02:30:06.301 --> 02:30:10.500
am I lying when I say I [inaudible] am I lying when I say I go to the airport

2653
02:30:10.501 --> 02:30:12.210
with a fanny pack on it,
man?
No,

2654
02:30:12.211 --> 02:30:16.540
I'm not fucking make me pull up the and pull up the,
yeah,

2655
02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.340
go,
go on.
Amazon is

2656
02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:22.750
<v 0>on and look up saddle leather laptop bag.</v>

2657
02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:24.090
We'd go back to the next level.

2658
02:30:25.150 --> 02:30:30.150
The next level of the compound is a large self sustaining home in a high fence

2659
02:30:32.291 --> 02:30:36.160
set up and the idea is that you have a well or several wells.

2660
02:30:36.490 --> 02:30:41.200
I'm neither of those,
Brian.
It might be the one.
Oh yeah,
the far right.

2661
02:30:41.201 --> 02:30:45.600
Far Right.
Far right up top.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Yes,
that's it.

2662
02:30:46.590 --> 02:30:50.500
Yeah,
it's very the George Clooney collection.
It's a very,
I looked very sexy.

2663
02:30:50.501 --> 02:30:53.470
Sophisticated.
That's period.
That's not the right one.
That's not the right one.

2664
02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:58.480
The one I got is we've been more preposterous than this.
Just a Oh,
that's it.

2665
02:30:58.481 --> 02:31:01.480
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
It's like those,
the far left one.

2666
02:31:01.481 --> 02:31:05.740
It's got fucking straps in shit.
Sweet.
Similar.

2667
02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:07.390
If it's not the same one,
it's similar.

2668
02:31:07.870 --> 02:31:09.930
So this compound sounds a lot like reveal it.

2669
02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:14.650
The idea is the idea is not that we're prepared.
We're not prepper.

2670
02:31:14.651 --> 02:31:16.760
So K we're not preparing for the end of the world will hold,

2671
02:31:16.770 --> 02:31:20.100
but if he in the world happens,
isn't it to have a couple of bucks

2672
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.760
<v 5>in the bank?
That's what I'm saying.
Every motherfuckers worrying about gold.</v>

2673
02:31:23.761 --> 02:31:25.950
Let me tell you something about gold,
okay?
It's not,

2674
02:31:26.130 --> 02:31:29.830
I'm not going to give you a cow for some gold if there's no internet.
Okay?

2675
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:33.290
I'm not giving you shit for gold.
When society collapsed,
what do you want?

2676
02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:38.430
Bullets.
Gasoline.
That's what I want.
Machines last a long time.

2677
02:31:38.431 --> 02:31:41.700
If you take care of him,
you need bullets and gasoline.
Okay?

2678
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:44.880
The idea is you have a high fence set up with solar power,

2679
02:31:44.881 --> 02:31:47.670
everything on their own animals.
Yes.

2680
02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:51.480
You have a high fence in Texas.
They have all these,

2681
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:56.510
what they call high fence ranches and I have a love hate relationship with Ted

2682
02:31:56.820 --> 02:32:01.110
Nugent.
Okay?
I love Ted Nugent for a lot of ways.
One of the things I love,

2683
02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:04.740
first of all,
stranglehold,
one of my favorite songs of all time.

2684
02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:06.120
I love that fucking song.

2685
02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:11.250
And I love the fact that he promotes a hunting lifestyle and a lot of people

2686
02:32:11.251 --> 02:32:14.260
would think that that makes you some sort of a sadist or someone that hates it.

2687
02:32:14.261 --> 02:32:15.000
Animals.

2688
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:20.000
What I am is a person who is really trying to come to grips with the idea of

2689
02:32:21.001 --> 02:32:25.200
life and death and like all of us,
I understand that I myself,

2690
02:32:25.201 --> 02:32:26.670
I'm a temporary being.
I,

2691
02:32:26.671 --> 02:32:30.000
there's only a certain amount of time that you have left a certain amount of

2692
02:32:30.001 --> 02:32:32.010
time that the human race has left.

2693
02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:36.000
Even the star that fucking heats us itself is finite.

2694
02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:40.920
So we all have to face the fact that we're in a revolving cycle of some sort

2695
02:32:40.921 --> 02:32:44.190
that may be infinite,
but at one one point in time,

2696
02:32:44.310 --> 02:32:48.300
this is going to change and go into something else.
There's no doubt about that.

2697
02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:49.560
So if that's the case,

2698
02:32:49.561 --> 02:32:53.130
why let all these delicious animals just fucking die of old age?

2699
02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:55.230
That seems ridiculous.
Okay.

2700
02:32:55.390 --> 02:32:58.740
So I'm with uncle tad when it comes to that and when I see him shooting all

2701
02:32:58.741 --> 02:33:02.580
these animals and eating them,
I'm like,
I think that's probably the way to go.

2702
02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:06.330
So I hunted for the first time this year.
I got an animal,

2703
02:33:06.331 --> 02:33:10.320
I ate it and I've been so satisfied and eating the meat from this animal.

2704
02:33:10.321 --> 02:33:14.010
I think that that's a beautiful way to,
to,
to exist,

2705
02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:17.250
to be actually responsible for the animals.

2706
02:33:17.251 --> 02:33:20.880
You go out and hunt and people have some really ridiculous ways of looking at

2707
02:33:20.881 --> 02:33:21.880
that and like,
Ooh,

2708
02:33:21.950 --> 02:33:25.350
if you really want to make it a one on one help and you don't bring a weapon,

2709
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:30.210
well what are you anti human.
There's a reason humans invented weapons.

2710
02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:33.120
You know why they invented weapons?
To make it way easier to survive,

2711
02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:36.300
whether it's by defending yourself or whether it's by shooting animals,

2712
02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:41.480
the aberration of the school shootings and and serial killers and robbers in

2713
02:33:43.890 --> 02:33:47.500
using weapons dot.
That is all an aberration of society.

2714
02:33:47.501 --> 02:33:50.340
It's akin to being a spoiled Brat.

2715
02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:55.200
It's a similar thing because the person who spoiled is a person who has had

2716
02:33:55.201 --> 02:33:59.040
great success without any effort,
no character building.

2717
02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:02.280
They just become successful by virtue of being born.

2718
02:34:02.430 --> 02:34:07.200
And that's why kings have been historically so fucking cruel because their

2719
02:34:07.201 --> 02:34:08.034
royalty.

2720
02:34:08.110 --> 02:34:12.180
So they're putting this position of extreme power and influence without having

2721
02:34:12.181 --> 02:34:16.430
the character,
without having the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the Willer,

2722
02:34:16.590 --> 02:34:17.320
the will,

2723
02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:22.060
the character of a person who has gone through a difficult life to understand

2724
02:34:22.330 --> 02:34:25.520
the ins and the outs of social interaction,
the,

2725
02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:30.620
the odd experience of this life when you've gone from complete disarray and,

2726
02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:33.640
and,
and,

2727
02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:38.640
and total worry about the idea of the future and no idea whatsoever of what

2728
02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:43.750
possibility the future may label it comes to having your next meal,

2729
02:34:43.751 --> 02:34:47.260
your next place to sleep or your next dollar that you earn.

2730
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:52.360
And comparing that to a person who every day of their life has been assured that

2731
02:34:52.361 --> 02:34:56.260
everything will be okay every day of their life has been assured that there's no

2732
02:34:56.261 --> 02:34:57.280
effort necessary.

2733
02:34:57.340 --> 02:34:58.900
<v 4>It's akin to people growing,</v>

2734
02:34:59.850 --> 02:35:03.730
<v 5>but hold on a second,
sorry.
But that you special for no reason,
for no reason.</v>

2735
02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:08.320
And that's where those crate,
and it's almost as if they know that they're wrong.

2736
02:35:08.321 --> 02:35:09.790
So they're begging you to kill them.

2737
02:35:10.170 --> 02:35:14.410
Then they know that they're wrong and they know that being king is fucking

2738
02:35:14.411 --> 02:35:15.011
ridiculous.

2739
02:35:15.011 --> 02:35:18.760
So they're trying to torture people in Maine to the point where you just

2740
02:35:18.761 --> 02:35:20.290
violently react.

2741
02:35:20.530 --> 02:35:25.330
It's almost like they're pushed by by the universe to reacting in such a

2742
02:35:25.331 --> 02:35:27.850
preposterous way that it demands reaction.

2743
02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:33.670
<v 4>It's interesting because my wife has taken to growing,
um,</v>

2744
02:35:33.860 --> 02:35:37.220
vegetables and it,
and I heard,

2745
02:35:37.221 --> 02:35:39.080
I might've heard it on your fucking podcast,

2746
02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:43.850
but the concept that people look for hardship in their life to feel real.

2747
02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:48.860
Yeah.
Like my wife grows like nine goddamn tomatoes and then she brings them in.

2748
02:35:48.861 --> 02:35:53.390
I got tomatoes and we eat her crappy ass tomato that in polluted with all her

2749
02:35:53.391 --> 02:35:57.680
tomatoes just weak.
It's like she just doesn't know what the fuck she's doing.

2750
02:35:59.150 --> 02:36:02.200
Bugging wilted and small.
You can't really put them on a Saturday.

2751
02:36:02.201 --> 02:36:06.830
You of use all of our,
her whole fucking crop goes onto one salad.
And so,

2752
02:36:06.831 --> 02:36:11.600
but it's the idea that she's looking for hardship to make her feel real,

2753
02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:16.030
you know?
Yeah.
It's like a fucking,
I get,

2754
02:36:16.050 --> 02:36:20.290
I get floored by that kind of shit because I,
I kind of was like,

2755
02:36:20.291 --> 02:36:23.870
I wonder if it's a connection with working out because like I love when you work

2756
02:36:23.871 --> 02:36:26.130
out and you feel like you get yourself to death row up points.

2757
02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:31.220
<v 5>Did you listen to the podcast that we had with rich roll?
I don't know which one.</v>

2758
02:36:31.250 --> 02:36:32.420
Rituals and Meagan

2759
02:36:32.530 --> 02:36:37.390
<v 4>and uh,
I've listened to all your podcasts.
Super,
super intelligent guy.</v>

2760
02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:42.130
And uh,
what was his book?
Do you remember Brian?
Look up rich roll's book.
Anyway,

2761
02:36:42.131 --> 02:36:46.840
he came on the podcast and he was a guy who was essentially living an unhealthy

2762
02:36:46.841 --> 02:36:48.090
lifestyle.
And Yeah,

2763
02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:53.160
I did listen to a Vegan and just started living this really and 10 podcast

2764
02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:55.790
because,
because great,
I listened to him.

2765
02:36:55.890 --> 02:36:58.000
The only reason I remember listening to him is because I remember hearing him

2766
02:36:58.001 --> 02:37:00.940
talking about BDB again and then talking about changing his lifestyle and then

2767
02:37:00.941 --> 02:37:03.190
going,
oh,
that's so funny.
This whole time I've been listening to him.

2768
02:37:03.191 --> 02:37:06.300
I've been thinking he was skinny and I can't imagine him now as a fat person

2769
02:37:06.301 --> 02:37:09.910
signing Altera.
Yeah,
I know he's,
yeah,
finding ultra it.
So by the way,

2770
02:37:09.911 --> 02:37:12.460
I haven't read it all,
but it's a great book.
Whatever

2771
02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:16.310
<v 5>red,
it's so honest and interesting and having them on the podcast,</v>

2772
02:37:16.311 --> 02:37:21.000
like that guy has zero douche bag in his body.
He's a sweetie and,

2773
02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:23.930
and,
and he's a really intelligent,
interesting guy.

2774
02:37:23.931 --> 02:37:28.931
And His conversion from like going from being living an unhealthy lifestyle to

2775
02:37:28.971 --> 02:37:33.890
completely plant based Diet and plant based foods and how healthy he became

2776
02:37:33.891 --> 02:37:36.350
because of it is so inspirational.
You know?

2777
02:37:36.351 --> 02:37:40.460
And I goof on like vegans a lot of times because there's like,

2778
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:45.110
there's a thing that people do when they become anything or when anything is

2779
02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:46.040
possible to become,

2780
02:37:46.041 --> 02:37:51.041
whether it's a scientologist or whether it's Catholic or sober or sober w that's

2781
02:37:51.921 --> 02:37:54.520
a good point.
That's a really good base where they preach,

2782
02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:58.760
they spit it out at you and preach it to you and they're doing it,

2783
02:37:58.761 --> 02:38:03.761
not necessarily to let you know that you know that they are Vegan or sober or

2784
02:38:06.801 --> 02:38:10.400
whatever it is.
But to establish a social position.

2785
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:15.340
<v 4>Yeah,
and it's,
it's also this,
it's also in my opinion,
like a perfect,</v>

2786
02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:20.950
like it's a self righteousness.
It feels good to us.
I was at a party,

2787
02:38:20.951 --> 02:38:24.370
a birthday party for someone.
My,
my buddy James,
um,

2788
02:38:25.050 --> 02:38:27.850
it was at a park and he brought up in the morning and he brought a bottle of

2789
02:38:27.851 --> 02:38:29.830
whiskey and he was like,
Hey,

2790
02:38:29.831 --> 02:38:34.300
let's do shots or morning birthday party.
And I'm like,
I can't,

2791
02:38:34.301 --> 02:38:38.080
I have a shoulder and I was working in Irvine or Bria.
I go,
I can't.
And he goes,

2792
02:38:38.470 --> 02:38:41.230
oh come on man.
If you don't do shots,
none of us can do shots.

2793
02:38:41.410 --> 02:38:43.330
Like you do shots and we can all do shots,

2794
02:38:43.331 --> 02:38:46.360
but if you don't do them then we're going to look weird.
If we do shots,
I go,

2795
02:38:46.361 --> 02:38:49.490
I can't logic is that,
that's cause that's kind of Sam,

2796
02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:53.980
that new deeds need to go to the dunes and run up sandhills.
No,
no.
Think about,

2797
02:38:53.981 --> 02:38:55.120
think about,
think about it this way though.

2798
02:38:55.330 --> 02:38:58.190
Like you're the kind of person like hypothetically space saying,

2799
02:38:58.260 --> 02:39:02.650
do your friends of your kids,
like your friends,
family,
friends,

2800
02:39:02.651 --> 02:39:06.430
do they know you smoke pot?
Oh yeah.
Okay,
so now wait,
hold on.

2801
02:39:06.431 --> 02:39:09.310
You don't know I smoke pot.
It's because you're not paying attention but you,

2802
02:39:09.311 --> 02:39:09.851
but sometimes,

2803
02:39:09.851 --> 02:39:13.150
but sometimes you meet new family friends that you haven't asked at all.

2804
02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:14.970
But so now Harvey just retiring,

2805
02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:18.310
Go du Du Pont documentaries.

2806
02:39:18.370 --> 02:39:23.370
But my point is so say say they go to a birthday party and and all the parents

2807
02:39:23.591 --> 02:39:26.440
want to smoke pot and you're like,
no,
I'm choosing not to.

2808
02:39:26.710 --> 02:39:28.840
Then all of a sudden all the parents look like degenerates.

2809
02:39:28.841 --> 02:39:33.841
Cause the guy that is nationally known for smoking pot is choosing to be sober

2810
02:39:34.301 --> 02:39:35.710
because he wants to be an,
you know what I mean?

2811
02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:40.860
<v 5>Don't smoke pot around my kids,
but I could smoke pot around my kids.</v>

2812
02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:44.570
<v 4>I'm not,
I'm not saying that I wouldn't smoke,</v>

2813
02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:49.480
<v 5>I wouldn't smoke pot around my kids for for several reasons.</v>

2814
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:52.240
One reason is it would be very confusing,

2815
02:39:52.570 --> 02:39:57.570
but when the idea of altering consciousness comes up with my four year old or my

2816
02:39:58.271 --> 02:40:01.210
two year old,
I will discuss it.
But with my 16 year old,

2817
02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:03.220
I have discussed it with her many,
many times.

2818
02:40:03.221 --> 02:40:08.221
We've had some long conversations and my point of view on altering your state of

2819
02:40:08.591 --> 02:40:12.100
consciousness as,
as hypocritical as it may be,
and it absolutely is,

2820
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:16.950
is that you should not do it until your brain forms.
Yeah,
I agree with that 100%.

2821
02:40:16.951 --> 02:40:21.951
I got very fortunate in that I didn't fuck with any sort of hardcore chemicals

2822
02:40:23.010 --> 02:40:28.010
until I was like deep in my thirties I was 14 but I was very lucky because I was

2823
02:40:28.261 --> 02:40:29.610
crazy.
In another way.

2824
02:40:29.611 --> 02:40:33.900
My crazy was I was terrified of doing anything that was going to inhibit my

2825
02:40:33.901 --> 02:40:35.320
physical performance.
Yeah.

2826
02:40:35.410 --> 02:40:40.410
Because most of my formative years from my teenage years until my early twenties

2827
02:40:40.711 --> 02:40:42.420
were based on fighting performance.

2828
02:40:42.421 --> 02:40:45.240
That's what I was mostly concentrating on fighting performance.

2829
02:40:45.450 --> 02:40:48.630
And that was dedicated to the idea that anytime that I,
10 minutes,

2830
02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:51.930
anytime that I spent working on um,

2831
02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:56.730
martial arts or training would be eroded by partying if I got drunk.

2832
02:40:56.810 --> 02:41:00.170
<v 7>I wish I had that condition which had waited until I was older.</v>

2833
02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:03.680

2837
02:41:16.731 --> 02:41:19.310

2846
02:41:45.981 --> 02:41:47.540
Before you think about my

2847
02:41:47.650 --> 02:41:50.770
<v 5>piss or even masturbate thinking about my past,</v>

2848
02:41:50.771 --> 02:41:55.771
I want you to go to rogan.ting.com that my friends is the last thing that ting

2849
02:41:55.930 --> 02:42:00.930
ever wanted when they signed up to be a sponsor on the Joe Rogan experience.

2850
02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:06.360
They never wanted anybody to connect pis and Tang and masturbation too late.

2851
02:42:08.830 --> 02:42:09.663
Sorry.

2852
02:42:09.970 --> 02:42:14.690
But if you got a rogan.ting.com they will give you $50 off the bat,

2853
02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:20.240
motherfucking android cell phones available and that will take the sting off the

2854
02:42:20.291 --> 02:42:24.670
homosexual implications of anything that I've said in the last 15 minutes that

2855
02:42:24.671 --> 02:42:27.490
made you rethink your childhood.
Get a whole phone,

2856

<v 7>I think it was like condos.</v>

2858
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:37.750
This sponsor was also brought to you by a combination of on it and Jameson at

2859
02:42:37.971 --> 02:42:38.804
the same time.

2860
02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:44.920
I wouldn't recommend it if you have to drive you around.

2861
02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:50.690

blenders,

2872
02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:38.940
kettlebells or battery rubs cause them shits is expensive one day when the Onnit

2873
02:43:40.421 --> 02:43:45.421
compound is super successful and we have started our own religion we will offer

2874
02:43:45.491 --> 02:43:49.950
significant discounts.
Yes because there will be no money and it won't.

2875
02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:50.890
It won't match.

2876
02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:56.220
You will be bringing over goats and cheese and spring water because that will be

2877
02:43:56.681 --> 02:44:01.681
the commodity of the future or not or the commodity.

2878
02:44:01.811 --> 02:44:06.310
Their future will be bandwidth because we'll be living in an infinite dimension

2879
02:44:06.550 --> 02:44:11.550
of pixels and particles in non essential bits flying through the interwebs and

2880
02:44:15.071 --> 02:44:20.071
Al Gore will be worshiped as Shiva is here at the higher primates studios.

2881
02:44:21.671 --> 02:44:25.420
We'll see you guys in three and a half minutes.
Meanwhile,
go fuck yourself.

2882
02:44:25.450 --> 02:44:27.760
It shouldn't take that long.
We'll be right back.

2883
02:44:31.310 --> 02:44:36.310
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

2884
02:44:41.290 --> 02:44:44.640
<v 0>I would maybe I would maybe do.
Hold on a second.
Don't</v>

2885
02:44:46.990 --> 02:44:49.150
say a word.
Don't say a word.

2886
02:44:49.450 --> 02:44:54.400
Don't say a word until this bitch gets cracking birth.
Quite sure.

2887
02:44:54.490 --> 02:44:59.320
Train by the crusher.
Bert Kreischer I want you to keep it together.

2888
02:44:59.321 --> 02:45:00.460
I want you to hold on.

2889
02:45:00.490 --> 02:45:04.390
I'm holding us to realize this is a gun damn commercial free podcast.

2890
02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:07.230
Exceptional addition is an,

2891
02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:11.590
except the podcast was so good at cannot be stopped for the greater good of

2892
02:45:11.591 --> 02:45:16.591
Shiva or Odin or Thor or Cassio p uh,

2893
02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:18.670
did anybody ever worshiped Cassiopeia?

2894
02:45:18.671 --> 02:45:22.300
Is that the watch some chick with some dude probably wanted to fuck and he got

2895
02:45:22.301 --> 02:45:27.301
all exaggerated with how hot she was named Meryl fucking constellation or some

2896
02:45:27.731 --> 02:45:30.260
shit rate.
Cassiopeia I bet her website's available.
Good.

2897
02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:33.970
Is your pussy you have to be before they named constellation after it.

2898
02:45:34.270 --> 02:45:38.040
Not even like a tree while a rock,
not a mountain.
No.

2899
02:45:38.050 --> 02:45:42.280
A series of nuclear explosions in the middle of the universe.

2900
02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:45.580
Why haven't they rebooted Thor in like he got a haircut yet?

2901
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:49.370
Because thought is a little bit lucky.
There is red.
He's dope.
Don't be,
hey,

2902
02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:51.790
listen,
Brian,
do you have a full head of hair?

2903
02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:56.170
You shouldn't be hating because I have almost zero hair and I'm not hating.
Okay?

2904
02:45:56.290 --> 02:45:59.560
It's a matter of time before I shaved my head.
It's your issues.
You should do it.

2905
02:45:59.561 --> 02:46:04.090
I sprinkled the heroin now bringing things.
Yes.
Yeah.

2906
02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:09.040
Dude.
Shaving your head as a beautiful feeling.
Is it just do it.
Trust me.

2907
02:46:09.270 --> 02:46:12.560
Just do it once.
You obviously don't give a fuck about your body.

2908
02:46:13.820 --> 02:46:17.780
<v 7>Let's be realistic.
You've,
he's been working out a lot.
No,
you're not.
Okay.</v>

2909
02:46:17.930 --> 02:46:20.060
If you're saying you have to be honest,

2910
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:21.880
<v 0>you know I love you,
but let's be honest.</v>

2911
02:46:21.881 --> 02:46:23.740
If you were entering into a bodybuilding contest,

2912
02:46:23.741 --> 02:46:25.110
I would say this guy does not want,
okay.

2913
02:46:25.850 --> 02:46:30.090
<v 7>Okay.
He is not trying to win sexiest.
Man.
I don't even look good in Europe,</v>

2914
02:46:30.091 --> 02:46:30.970
in his speedo.

2915
02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:35.530
Yay.

2916
02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:40.410
<v 0>Oh,
oh,
oh.
I sound not that there's anything wrong with that,</v>

2917
02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:44.700
but let's be honest about our pants or his life.
Ladies and gentlemen.
So deaths,

2918
02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:45.660
a death squad,

2919
02:46:45.661 --> 02:46:50.661
Scotland and desk got Ohio are losing their fucking minds because they're told

2920
02:46:50.821 --> 02:46:52.740
you to stop communicating with those people.
You don't know them.

2921
02:46:52.741 --> 02:46:55.820
You have not vetted them.
Sir.
I know you guys gotta hire.
They're awesome.
Yeah.

2922
02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:59.670
You know he,
Brian does know.
Yeah.
God dammit you none of them.

2923
02:46:59.671 --> 02:47:01.530
Mother fuckers have a proper filter in place.

2924
02:47:01.531 --> 02:47:04.410
We need to fucking setups of scientific checks and balances.

2925
02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:08.610
Much like the CIA uses.
If this,
uh,
can't just decide.

2926
02:47:08.770 --> 02:47:11.460
You can let some mother fucker send you some whiskey.
Oh,

2927
02:47:11.490 --> 02:47:16.140
I can't believe we have a refrigerator here at [inaudible] water studios were so

2928
02:47:16.141 --> 02:47:18.570
not fucking around,
ladies and gentlemen.
Okay.

2929
02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:21.480
We're taking this to the next level.
Bert Kreischer to see what we're doing here.

2930
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:25.380
This is not my own Buddha.
I got to fucking care package from on it.
Yeah.

2931
02:47:25.381 --> 02:47:27.230
You've got a care package from on.

2932
02:47:27.370 --> 02:47:31.680
And we got the Buddha responsible for my tattoo.
What was that?
The Buddha.

2933
02:47:31.770 --> 02:47:32.700
He's an asshole.

2934
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:35.610
<v 7>He's like,
Hi guys,

You don't,

2935
02:47:35.611 --> 02:47:37.740

2936
02:47:38.350 --> 02:47:40.890
<v 0>Can you say that shit?
You're right arm that is the same.</v>

2937
02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:43.953
<v 12>Hello.</v>

2938
02:47:44.450 --> 02:47:46.130
<v 0>The guy who did my offer,
first of all,</v>

2939
02:47:46.131 --> 02:47:49.250
he's a beautiful artist and he's a cool mother fucker.

2940
02:47:49.251 --> 02:47:54.230
His name's Aaron Dellavedova and he,
uh,
works at Guru Tattoo in San Diego.
I get,

2941
02:47:54.260 --> 02:47:57.770
I would get tattoo just to hang out with that dude.
He's so cool.

2942
02:47:57.860 --> 02:48:01.840
I want to say I want to kill him,
but he's a real artist.
He easily,

2943
02:48:01.841 --> 02:48:06.230
it's really cool paintings and I,
I love his,
like his point of view.

2944
02:48:06.231 --> 02:48:10.610
Like it's so uniquely his own that you remember that guy that was,
uh,
uh,

2945
02:48:10.611 --> 02:48:13.170
Jesse James Rather,
who's married to Sandra boats.
Yeah.

2946
02:48:13.210 --> 02:48:18.210
Remember he had that affair with some grow at tap to swap to a bicycle I saw,

2947
02:48:18.850 --> 02:48:22.370
no,
no,
no.
She doesn't have that.
Yes,
yes.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2948
02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:26.700
She was not a swipe power.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah.
She didn't know she did do,

2949
02:48:26.701 --> 02:48:29.300
she did not know.
She definitely did.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2950
02:48:29.350 --> 02:48:32.250
She had swastikas tattooed.
So stop it.
Stop.
No,
swear to God.
Jo.

2951
02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:35.840
She's really good at telling you when you,
I'm telling you you're wrong.

2952
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:39.860
What's her name?
Check.
Wait,
it's like Michelle dynamite or something like that.

2953
02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:40.461
No,
but anyway,

2954
02:48:40.461 --> 02:48:44.600
my point is that she had this sleeve and I looked at the sleeve and I said,

2955
02:48:44.601 --> 02:48:46.370
that's an Aaron Dellavedova Tattoo.

2956
02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:51.510
I could tell that his style is so distinctive and I'm uh,
I'm,

2957
02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:56.390
I'm such a huge fan of individual points of expression.
Why?
Or like,

2958
02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:56.960
um,

2959
02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:00.740
like there's certain like pool cues where you could look at the pool cue and you

2960
02:49:00.741 --> 02:49:05.570
know,
that is a sugar tree.
That's a cue that Eric,
Chris May,

2961
02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:08.320
that is a cognitive centi acute at Joe Gold

2962
02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:12.470
<v 1>May that they have like this individual point of expression.
Michelle.</v>

2963
02:49:12.990 --> 02:49:14.910
Michelle Mccain.
Yeah.
She didn't

2964
02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.910
<v 4>Nacho.
That's what it was.
She just not have any,
she doesn't have tattoos.</v>

2965
02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:22.540
Like some crazy photo shoot that she had to do.

2966
02:49:22.570 --> 02:49:24.700
Although it does say WP on her leg.

2967
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:28.140
<v 1>Yeah.
Like as in white power?
No.</v>

2968
02:49:28.410 --> 02:49:33.330
Or what it means or,
whoa.
Is that really what it means?
WP?

2969
02:49:33.331 --> 02:49:36.230
I'll think.
What else?
Oh,
poop.

2970
02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:38.760
What was my point about her?

2971
02:49:39.010 --> 02:49:42.080
<v 4>Uh,
you were talking about,
uh,
your tattoo artists had her arm or something.</v>

2972
02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:46.600
<v 1>I saw her arm and one of her arms.
I think it's a right sleeve.
Yeah.</v>

2973
02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.760
His style is so distinct.
Did you start to check out?
Well,

2974
02:49:51.761 --> 02:49:55.900
I looked,
uh,
in California and I was looking at all these different,
you know,

2975
02:49:55.901 --> 02:49:58.360
it's like you,
if you,

2976
02:49:58.510 --> 02:50:01.360
there's a lot of really good artists in California,
especially,

2977
02:50:01.361 --> 02:50:03.640
you mean Kat von D who we've had on the podcast.

2978
02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:05.420
<v 4>Ah,
shoot.
That's a great podcast.</v>

2979
02:50:05.430 --> 02:50:09.030
<v 1>Yeah,
she was really cool.
There's this,
there's just so many,
like,</v>

2980
02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:12.540
I don't even want to name names,
is a million talented artists.

2981
02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:15.260
But when I saw Aaron's work online,

2982
02:50:15.450 --> 02:50:18.420
especially sleeves and big back pieces,

2983
02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:22.980
like his style is really about big,
bold,

2984
02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:24.000
like pieces.

2985
02:50:24.210 --> 02:50:28.470
And when I started talking to him like immediately we hit it off.
I was like,

2986
02:50:28.471 --> 02:50:32.790
this girl is cool as fuck.
He's so cool.
Like right away.
Like I was like,
like,

2987
02:50:33.390 --> 02:50:33.850
you know,

2988
02:50:33.850 --> 02:50:37.210
you talked to someone you really like happy to have a conversation with them.

2989
02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:40.890
And we were like on the perfect level.
Like it really like,
you know,

2990
02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:45.070
both of us were talking about all kinds of like different crazy shit and he's

2991
02:50:45.071 --> 02:50:49.920
hurt.
He's an honorable person.
He's an artist is like right away.
I was like,

2992
02:50:49.930 --> 02:50:52.260
I love this guy right away.
It's perfect guy to do it.

2993
02:50:52.380 --> 02:50:56.740
<v 4>What did you guys,
uh,
if you,
if you remember,
I'm curious to see if you remember.</v>

2994
02:50:56.770 --> 02:50:58.630
What did you guys talk about while he was tattooing you?

2995
02:50:59.290 --> 02:51:01.810
Everything and anything man.
Like do you remember any of the conversation?

2996
02:51:01.811 --> 02:51:05.200
Like is it,
we have it on,
is it like a meaningful gap at the beginning?

2997
02:51:05.230 --> 02:51:07.780
Are you serious?
First Sleeve?
Yeah,
at the beginning of the first leak

2998
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:10.280
<v 1>a lot it was on video,
but then the second sleeve is like,</v>

2999
02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:14.600
like about 33 years old.
I still have to go back.
I still,

3000
02:51:14.601 --> 02:51:19.460
there's a few spots on it.
It's amazing.
Most of it is a memo to Musashi piece.

3001
02:51:19.700 --> 02:51:20.870
Who's the guy who is the,

3002
02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:22.930
<v 4>Oh and there's the graphics joker.</v>

3003
02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:26.320
I thought you got rid of the graphics Cherokee.
Yeah,
I thought you did too.

3004
02:51:26.470 --> 02:51:29.050
<v 1>I have to suck.
That's not quite done yet.
I got it.</v>

3005
02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:33.100
I think they should pimp that out.
It's not leave it.

3006
02:51:33.101 --> 02:51:36.570
Remember it was like really even before I knew what a graphics joke or was.

3007
02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:39.520
<v 4>And you drew it,
right?
Stupid idea.
Yeah,
I drew it.</v>

3008
02:51:40.090 --> 02:51:40.923
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3009
02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:43.500
<v 4>She's just to cry.
But I caught that shit.</v>

3010
02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:48.350
That's my Jujutsu explain it as much.
But uh,

3011
02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:51.000
this Jamison experienced that tattoo.
I did draw it.

3012
02:51:51.330 --> 02:51:56.020
<v 1>I drew that in 1990.
It looks like shit now.</v>

3013
02:51:56.230 --> 02:51:59.140
It's like the guy who better than water,

3014
02:51:59.141 --> 02:52:02.350
if the guy who tattooed it for me did a fucking brilliant job,

3015
02:52:02.351 --> 02:52:06.580
his name was Danny Williams and he died of cancer really recently.

3016
02:52:06.820 --> 02:52:08.230
And the bottom tattoo,

3017
02:52:08.231 --> 02:52:12.280
the really crazy looking Samurai guy that is a meal multi Musashi and he's

3018
02:52:12.281 --> 02:52:15.530
fighting a tiger.
And that's what happened.

3019
02:52:15.570 --> 02:52:19.080
What happened to sick artwork,
man,
that's all.
Uh,

3020
02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:22.670
that's all my man Aaron Dellavedova his work and he just said,
yeah,

3021
02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:25.680
he does brilliant work.
It's,
yeah,
the beach.
What was the,

3022
02:52:25.681 --> 02:52:29.160
what was the term for what for you?
Like where were you,

3023
02:52:29.430 --> 02:52:33.180
you went from like one tattoo and not smoking weed to like,
I don't,

3024
02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:36.600
maybe I've heard well,
what it was.
Um,
I,

3025
02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:41.880
I always liked leg tattoos.
I always liked the artwork of it.
I'm a big fan of,

3026
02:52:42.450 --> 02:52:45.090
I'm a big fan of music.
I'm a big fan of writing.

3027
02:52:45.091 --> 02:52:48.510
I'm a big fan of meat movies and cars and,

3028
02:52:48.780 --> 02:52:53.780
and paintings and anything that you do that expresses whatever you have inside

3029
02:52:54.091 --> 02:52:55.770
of yourself through some medium,

3030
02:52:55.771 --> 02:53:00.720
whether it's the medium of making a hot rod or it's the medium of even designing

3031
02:53:00.721 --> 02:53:04.290
clothes.
Like,
I'm like,
like I'm wearing some crazy tee shirt right now.

3032
02:53:04.291 --> 02:53:08.940
Some dude gave me,
it's a Bruce Lee who's a,
he's acting as a DJ.

3033
02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:12.120
I thought that was hilarious.
So I,
but it's great.
It's funny.

3034
02:53:12.570 --> 02:53:16.260
It's someone's idea that's expressed through clothes.
You know,

3035
02:53:16.261 --> 02:53:17.750
you can express it through furniture,

3036
02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:22.350
like my friends in this table tables Badass.
Yeah.

3037
02:53:22.410 --> 02:53:26.160
I mean you can express it through anything,
but it really,

3038
02:53:26.161 --> 02:53:28.140
it's all the same thing.
The eye,

3039
02:53:28.350 --> 02:53:33.350
the idea is that everything that a person can enjoy as someone else trying to

3040
02:53:34.051 --> 02:53:37.950
express some sort of positive idea through whatever medium it is,

3041
02:53:37.951 --> 02:53:40.870
whether it's a fucking,
whether it's les Miserables,
bowls,

3042
02:53:43.250 --> 02:53:46.280
50 shades of grey,
it's all the same thing,
you know?

3043
02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:50.180
But what was the turning point?
Do you remember the thing?
No.
Um,

3044
02:53:50.330 --> 02:53:54.690
I know I was probably some psychedelic drug related experience or it's likely,

3045
02:53:54.790 --> 02:53:59.520
yeah,
yeah.
What got you there?
Um,

3046
02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.340
well if marijuana is a gateway drug,

3047
02:54:04.290 --> 02:54:06.300
I'm really unfortunately a good example.

3048
02:54:09.480 --> 02:54:13.340
I don't think that is negative gateway.
I think we have to get over that idea.

3049
02:54:13.341 --> 02:54:15.860
And I think a big part of the struggle that we have in this country,

3050
02:54:15.970 --> 02:54:20.970
and it's a lot of conservative people misunderstand the position of people that,

3051
02:54:21.050 --> 02:54:23.630
uh,
support marijuana or cannabis.

3052
02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:26.840
And it doesn't mean that they're mutually exclusive and it doesn't mean that

3053
02:54:26.841 --> 02:54:28.400
they have to be in combat with each other.

3054
02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:31.850
It just means that for whatever reason,
as a society,

3055
02:54:31.851 --> 02:54:35.660
we have associated cannabis smokers and users with lazy bitches.

3056
02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:40.700
And that's stupid.
And I think that if I have benefited as a,

3057
02:54:40.701 --> 02:54:43.340
an unnecessarily aggro,
you know,

3058
02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:48.370
child of the 80s if I have benefited from the magical gift of marijuana,

3059
02:54:48.711 --> 02:54:50.750
then I bet you can too.

3060
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:55.190
It just needs to be used properly and it's gonna make you examine yourself in a

3061
02:54:55.191 --> 02:54:59.420
way that may be uncomfortable but is most likely necessary.

3062
02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:03.710
You know,
and the ideas that we have connected to

3063
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:06.170
<v 0>any sort of psychedelic experience,</v>

3064
02:55:06.171 --> 02:55:09.950
marijuana or pod knew you name it,

3065
02:55:09.951 --> 02:55:14.060
mushrooms automatically people of a conservative nature.

3066
02:55:14.061 --> 02:55:18.890
We'll assume that the people involved and doing this thing or being lazy or

3067
02:55:18.891 --> 02:55:21.470
they're being,
they're being frivolous,

3068
02:55:21.890 --> 02:55:26.240
they're being frivolous because they've decided to like seek escape through

3069
02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:28.970
chemicals rather than deal with the reality.

3070
02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:33.590
But if they really knew,
they would know that that's not the case.

3071
02:55:33.650 --> 02:55:37.460
If they really had experienced,
they would know that.
No,
it's exact opposite.
This,

3072
02:55:37.461 --> 02:55:39.770
I hate to fucking bring up this Goddamn Radiolab

3073
02:55:40.340 --> 02:55:41.173
<v 4>well show.
Again,</v>

3074
02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:46.200
they were talking about religious experiences and people who did acid and,

3075
02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:49.040
and they,
and there was a,
there was a,
they were talking about,

3076
02:55:49.490 --> 02:55:52.190
they took these kids at Stu at in school,

3077
02:55:52.250 --> 02:55:56.420
took him down to a church setting where a church sermon was giving,
going on.

3078
02:55:56.421 --> 02:55:59.780
They're all religious teachers.
Okay.
All religious teachers.

3079
02:55:59.930 --> 02:56:02.840
I'd like religious students,
they all take acid and they hear a sermon,

3080
02:56:02.841 --> 02:56:07.280
the church with the beautiful bells and they said that nine out of 10 people in

3081
02:56:07.281 --> 02:56:11.150
the test group,
so there's 2010 have a seat,
uh,

3082
02:56:11.170 --> 02:56:12.980
of a bullshit,
you know,

3083
02:56:12.981 --> 02:56:17.250
the placebo 10 until the one nine out of 10 had a religious experience.
Wow.

3084
02:56:17.330 --> 02:56:21.610
And they were saying that that nine of the 10 also went on to um,

3085
02:56:21.770 --> 02:56:24.650
teach in the ministry,
like nine to 10 deal.
It took acid.

3086
02:56:24.651 --> 02:56:27.980
And they were talking about the concept of whether or not you could do acid and

3087
02:56:27.981 --> 02:56:31.130
whether or not you could create original religious experience.
And if you could,

3088
02:56:31.131 --> 02:56:34.070
why wouldn't you have that all the time?
Why wouldn't everyone look for that?

3089
02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:34.421
<v 0>Well,</v>

3090
02:56:34.421 --> 02:56:37.750
what's what we were talking about earlier about like one day maybe we can get

3091
02:56:37.751 --> 02:56:42.751
our shitty brains to accept the state of opiate and Mgma and at the same time,

3092
02:56:43.540 --> 02:56:47.800
all the time,
I want like a low grade cocaine,
like,
uh,
what's going on?

3093
02:56:47.801 --> 02:56:51.280
I mean all respect to people who are on antidepressants and this is not an

3094
02:56:51.281 --> 02:56:52.230
antidepressant rant.

3095
02:56:52.231 --> 02:56:56.110
And I think quite honestly that there's quite a few of those rants that,

3096
02:56:56.111 --> 02:57:00.480
or they're ignorant.
And even though,
you know,
we had,
um,
a conversation with,
um,

3097
02:57:00.790 --> 02:57:02.050
Carrie Santa Maria who was on the [inaudible],

3098
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:05.490
<v 4>I fucking loved her.
That girl was so fucking,
I've,</v>

3099
02:57:05.491 --> 02:57:09.990
I've regurgitated some of her facts in conversation,
not realizing I'm doing it.

3100
02:57:10.050 --> 02:57:13.380
I fucking was.
So I was afraid to Google her and see what she looked like.

3101
02:57:13.381 --> 02:57:16.590
So I was like,
what is,
she's not hot because she was so hot on this podcast.

3102
02:57:16.740 --> 02:57:19.410
Just listen to her.
You were like,
oh,
she's beautiful smoking.

3103
02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:23.550
And more importantly,
she's very fascinating.
Very,
very,
very,

3104
02:57:23.551 --> 02:57:24.600
really fascinating.

3105
02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:28.570
And what was my point and taking psychedelics are three of them.

3106
02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:32.380
Three of them in a row.
Yeah.
Next week I'm taking her house.

3107
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:34.050
You want to double date?
Nope.

3108
02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:39.400
Why are you trying to like [inaudible] the fuck out of you?

3109
02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:41.590
But anyway,
the point was that is that

3110
02:57:41.650 --> 02:57:45.640
<v 0>she was describing her own personal benefit from,
uh,</v>

3111
02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:49.180
from using antidepressants and her own personal,
you know,
her,

3112
02:57:49.181 --> 02:57:53.050
her personal benefit from like regulating her state of consciousness,

3113
02:57:53.230 --> 02:57:56.940
but with the use of science.
And if you really stop and think about it,
like the,

3114
02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:00.340
some of the best feelings that I've ever had have been under the,
uh,

3115
02:58:00.341 --> 02:58:02.460
under the of chemicals.
You know,

3116
02:58:02.461 --> 02:58:07.020
whether it's right now or whether it's the first time I ever did anything which

3117
02:58:07.021 --> 02:58:10.520
was MTMA anything that's significance.
When,

3118
02:58:10.580 --> 02:58:13.260
when that feeling is so sensational.

3119
02:58:13.410 --> 02:58:16.050
Like what would life be if that feeling existed all the time?

3120
02:58:16.051 --> 02:58:20.490
We automatically have this thought in our head that that cannot be managed and

3121
02:58:20.491 --> 02:58:25.491
that needs to be discarded right away immediately for the state of consciousness

3122
02:58:25.531 --> 02:58:28.140
that you exist right now can never be elevated.
This is what it is.

3123
02:58:28.350 --> 02:58:29.610
But how do we even know that's true?

3124
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:32.940
<v 4>I Wa I,
I wonder sometimes because I go like,</v>

3125
02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:37.830
I feel like I spend my day chasing,
chasing a buzz where it's like,

3126
02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:42.090
like coffee in the morning and then there's just like dead period in the

3127
02:58:42.090 --> 02:58:47.040
afternoon when my quad before the beer.
When do you feel it's respectable?

3128
02:58:47.070 --> 02:58:49.680
Just start drinking at five 5:00 PM 5:00 PM

3129
02:58:51.210 --> 02:58:54.360
5:00 PM or you can say,
leave me alone.
Oh God.
At work.

3130
02:58:54.600 --> 02:58:59.070
Who keeps the fucking lights on some of the best moments of my life or when my

3131
02:58:59.071 --> 02:59:02.580
wife had a job,
we were living in an apartment complex.

3132
02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:06.030
We had a nanny only because I was on the road and sometimes the nanny and I

3133
02:59:06.031 --> 02:59:07.740
would overlap and I'd be there when she would be there.

3134
02:59:08.040 --> 02:59:11.700
The best feelings my kids are,
they're sunsetting in Hollywood.

3135
02:59:11.701 --> 02:59:13.560
My wife fucking them up in the door and just going,

3136
02:59:13.561 --> 02:59:18.090
did anyone open a bottle of wine?
Oh motherfucker.
I remember getting like chills.

3137
02:59:18.091 --> 02:59:22.170
Like it's Christmas Eve.
Like,
Oh and we crack open a bottle of wine,

3138
02:59:22.171 --> 02:59:26.160
pour one for the nanny.
We just sit on the couch at socks.
Fuck.

3139
02:59:26.340 --> 02:59:29.640
Oh your love.
I love those kind of moments.

3140
02:59:29.900 --> 02:59:34.310
<v 0>You love like ultimate relaxation moments where everybody agrees.</v>

3141
02:59:34.400 --> 02:59:36.680
<v 4>Yes.
It's time where everyone's on the same page.</v>

3142
02:59:36.681 --> 02:59:40.910
I think that's a one that opened the bottle.
Everybody agrees.
It's great.

3143
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:43.280
Why you like sort of the ultimate party meister?

3144
02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:47.350
It's like you're the guy that would get everybody.
Ah,
fuck it.
Bert was you shot.

3145
02:59:47.390 --> 02:59:51.350
Let's do shot.
Well,
we do a shot.
Give me a hug.
You fucks.
I love you.

3146
02:59:51.351 --> 02:59:55.400
And everybody would get together,
I think.
Yeah.
I love that feeling when you win.

3147
02:59:55.730 --> 02:59:59.540
Like it's like just fucking,
someone just goes,
uh,
I go,

3148
02:59:59.970 --> 03:00:02.690
who's going to be all grown up?
If I owed her a beer and someone will be like,

3149
03:00:03.380 --> 03:00:07.190
if you get one,
I'll get one.
I'm like,
we're fucking,
yeah,
right away.

3150
03:00:07.240 --> 03:00:08.071
Can love that feeling.

3151
03:00:08.071 --> 03:00:11.160
You think that's what the feeling people get when they connect with they smoke

3152
03:00:11.161 --> 03:00:15.300
marijuana is that someone liked it and then they're like,
Nah.
They're like,
okay.

3153
03:00:15.330 --> 03:00:17.230
Like it's such a great,
like

3154
03:00:17.760 --> 03:00:21.480
<v 0>there's definitely a thing that comes with being like in that sort of fraternity</v>

3155
03:00:21.481 --> 03:00:25.380
of people that know,
you know,
they know you'd smoked pot,

3156
03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:27.370
everybody's in this like,
oh,
we're all cool and then,

3157
03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:28.333
<v 4>right.</v>

3158
03:00:30.450 --> 03:00:34.190
<v 0>Geez.
You sort of accept that traditional notion of reality.</v>

3159
03:00:34.450 --> 03:00:39.260
Like if you've never gotten high,
you and I have very little to talk about.

3160
03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:43.790
I mean we can talk about a few things for certain.

3161
03:00:43.791 --> 03:00:48.680
We can talk about facts and Statistics and history numbers.

3162
03:00:48.860 --> 03:00:50.630
We can talk a lot about a lot of things,

3163
03:00:50.810 --> 03:00:53.420
but we can't talk about what the fuck is going on.

3164
03:00:53.421 --> 03:00:56.420
When you think about someone and then the phone rings and it's them.

3165
03:00:58.350 --> 03:01:00.070
<v 4>We can't talk that because you're</v>

3166
03:01:00.070 --> 03:01:03.110
<v 0>going to give me some scaredy cat answer.
You're going to go whoa.</v>

3167
03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:08.590
It's just sort of a coincidence.
There's no relationship whatsoever.

3168
03:01:08.591 --> 03:01:12.310
There's never been a statistical correlation between you thinking about someone

3169
03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:15.940
and then them calling you and that meaning anything significant whatsoever.

3170
03:01:16.300 --> 03:01:17.650
It's just nonsense.

3171
03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:22.920
I need you to get a ramp and put a tile where some shiny shoes with slippery

3172
03:01:22.990 --> 03:01:26.290
soles walk down the street like a gentleman.

3173
03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:30.100
I don't know,
but I know that when I,

3174
03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:34.630
a little light bulb goes off in my head and I think about Bert Kreischer and

3175
03:01:34.631 --> 03:01:39.631
then I looked down at my phone and it starts ringing immediately and it's Bert

3176
03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:44.920
Kreischer will call me crazy,
but I think something's up.

3177
03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:46.181
Okay.

3178
03:01:46.181 --> 03:01:51.181
I think there's something fucking going on when I think about you and then all

3179
03:01:51.281 --> 03:01:53.800
the sudden you call me immediately.

3180
03:01:53.970 --> 03:01:55.760
<v 9>It happens every day nonstop.</v>

3181
03:01:56.110 --> 03:02:00.520
<v 3>Yeah,
it's a lot.
And you know when it happens,
you ready for this Brian Red Band?</v>

3182
03:02:00.910 --> 03:02:03.690
<v 0>It happens when you live in your life correctly.</v>

3183
03:02:04.290 --> 03:02:05.850
When you live in your life correctly,

3184
03:02:05.851 --> 03:02:10.680
the universe gives you a lot of fucking secret messages.

3185
03:02:11.090 --> 03:02:11.460
You

3186
03:02:11.460 --> 03:02:16.230
<v 9>University,
that's what it is.
I like yesterday,
this is something crazy.</v>

3187
03:02:16.231 --> 03:02:20.130
As an example,
yesterday I was talking to my friend who's a ginger and I'm like,

3188
03:02:20.220 --> 03:02:24.240
is there such things as Jewish ginger's I've never even heard is like I've never

3189
03:02:24.241 --> 03:02:26.880
seen a Jewish ginger before.
She was like,
of course there is.

3190
03:02:27.180 --> 03:02:31.440
And then like two hours later to somebody else,
it's just like,
oh this guy,

3191
03:02:31.441 --> 03:02:35.760
he said,
ginger,
he's a Jewish ginger.
I've ever seen one.
I'm like,
all right.

3192
03:02:35.761 --> 03:02:39.570
I've never talked about ginger Jewish ginger's my whole entire life now twice in

3193
03:02:39.571 --> 03:02:40.000
one day

3194
03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:44.020
<v 0>there's a possibility that you attracted that there's a possibility that much</v>

3195
03:02:44.021 --> 03:02:48.610
like you ever sent an email on Google,
you know,
it could be about anything.

3196
03:02:48.670 --> 03:02:51.160
You can send an email and say,
hey man,

3197
03:02:51.161 --> 03:02:56.161
I'm looking to get a lifesize copy of the robot from lost in space.

3198
03:02:57.550 --> 03:03:01.690
And then you look in the corner of your Gmail when you get on and it'll be all

3199
03:03:01.691 --> 03:03:03.100
lost in space.
Shit.

3200
03:03:03.220 --> 03:03:06.490
<v 3>That's cause it's reading your email.
Right?
Right,
exactly.</v>

3201
03:03:06.491 --> 03:03:10.310
So you think somebody reading my presently,
oh I like this.

3202
03:03:11.140 --> 03:03:14.920
This is my point.
If reality is a simulation,

3203
03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:19.990
wouldn't it follow the same principles that your genes or your Yahoo has where

3204
03:03:19.991 --> 03:03:23.380
you'll see the corners were shit that you've sent emails about.

3205
03:03:23.470 --> 03:03:26.800
We'll be reoccurring themes and you're like,
I do that in life all the time.

3206
03:03:26.801 --> 03:03:30.750
I've put it out there.
But isn't it fascinating it out there,
Graham?

3207
03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:35.500
It mirrors.
It mirrors what we know is a program.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's fucked up.

3208
03:03:35.620 --> 03:03:37.160
It's true.
You're right.
Yeah.

3209
03:03:37.210 --> 03:03:40.900
It's just the fucking natural course of history of how life's going to go down.

3210
03:03:40.930 --> 03:03:43.920
It already happens in life.
God does.
It will.
The universe does it.

3211
03:03:43.930 --> 03:03:46.930
It trickles down to you.
You sound like you're ripe for a cult.

3212
03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:50.650
I couldn't fucking get you to sign up.
Right.
Let him give me some Blue Nike,

3213
03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:52.660
my deck in a house full of feathers.

3214
03:03:53.970 --> 03:03:58.220
I could be so quickly put on called.
I've been watching

3215
03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:02.450
<v 1>this documentary on the vice guys made a documentary about this fucking dude</v>

3216
03:04:02.451 --> 03:04:06.680
who's a,
uh,
the,
these,
the new Jesus.
He's a Siberian Jesus.

3217
03:04:06.681 --> 03:04:09.680
Have you seen that Brian?
Listen,
ladies and gentlemen

3218
03:04:09.860 --> 03:04:14.630
<v 4>pulled up.
No,
we shouldn't pull it up because it's a really long piece.</v>

3219
03:04:14.650 --> 03:04:16.250
You guys are crazy.

3220
03:04:16.300 --> 03:04:19.660
<v 1>It's at least I've only watched the first two 10 minute pieces,</v>

3221
03:04:19.661 --> 03:04:21.040
but it's fascinating.

3222
03:04:21.190 --> 03:04:24.160
There's a guy in Siberia that's created a village and he's like,

3223
03:04:24.161 --> 03:04:28.330
the second coming of Jesus is like the new Jesus and he has thousands of people

3224
03:04:28.331 --> 03:04:31.180
that are living up there.
Thousands.
They're all living up there,

3225
03:04:31.181 --> 03:04:36.090
but meanwhile they live in an unbelievably unbelievably beautiful place.
I mean,

3226
03:04:36.100 --> 03:04:40.060
it is stunning if you maybe maybe seeding and find some photos,

3227
03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:43.390
but it's staggeringly beautiful and this guy,

3228
03:04:43.570 --> 03:04:47.050
he's not appreciate anything bad except being a Vegan.
That's silly.

3229
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:50.660
<v 4>I can't really get it.
I got to have Vegan fucking,</v>

3230
03:04:50.661 --> 03:04:52.610
even when I was doing that clean program,
Jesus,

3231
03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:55.310
I'd have a chicken with fucking lettuce wraps.

3232
03:04:55.430 --> 03:04:58.550
<v 1>Oh,
I love spicy shit.
Yeah.</v>

3233
03:04:58.551 --> 03:05:01.670
I wish that animals aren't so fucking delicious.
The fucking amazing.

3234
03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:04.820
And I wish that they didn't fucking keep making animals.

3235
03:05:05.120 --> 03:05:08.180
Maybe they would just all live forever and everyone will be a mortal when you

3236
03:05:08.181 --> 03:05:12.540
have enough numbers now and just keep it going.
I had duck heartlands dude,

3237
03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:17.360
let me say that was the photo of the dude.
Who's the,
the Russian Jesus.
Meanwhile,

3238
03:05:17.390 --> 03:05:20.840
he's getting an awesome spot.
I don't think I ever saw Jesus smile.
Yeah,

3239
03:05:20.890 --> 03:05:24.020
well he does.
When Green Day's playing cause he's hurt

3240
03:05:24.070 --> 03:05:28.180
<v 4>the GSG all Jesus,
his pictures were like hip hop cover albums.</v>

3241
03:05:28.181 --> 03:05:29.080
I just was up

3242
03:05:29.460 --> 03:05:33.050
<v 1>the Australian,
Jesus is a guy in Queensland and he says he's,</v>

3243
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:37.240
<v 4>Jeez,
I was just in Queensland.
What's that guy look?
What are you doing?</v>

3244
03:05:37.241 --> 03:05:41.480
What are you doing?
Stand up.
No,
he did a triplet,
but Australia in Queensland,

3245
03:05:41.540 --> 03:05:43.340
Australia,
this country I've ever been to.

3246
03:05:43.580 --> 03:05:45.420
I'm telling you what to say this and I don't,

3247
03:05:45.421 --> 03:05:47.940
I'm not shitting on America and I'm not shitting on Kaniqua Canada.

3248
03:05:48.010 --> 03:05:50.380
You guys are second.
But Australia blows everyone out.

3249
03:05:50.710 --> 03:05:55.530
<v 1>I love,
I love the people there.
I love their attitude.
It's like a,
except more.</v>

3250
03:05:55.740 --> 03:06:00.390
We were so uptightness country,
we're,
we're really so unbelievably uptight,

3251
03:06:00.570 --> 03:06:03.140
especially when it comes to like going out and having fun and relaxed.

3252
03:06:03.150 --> 03:06:05.860
I'd moved to Australia in a fucking heartbeat in a heartbeat.

3253
03:06:05.861 --> 03:06:10.050
It's like there's this thing about America that America was sort of founded and

3254
03:06:10.051 --> 03:06:14.010
created by a bunch of people that have come here from somewhere that sucked and

3255
03:06:14.011 --> 03:06:18.180
they had enough and they just made it over to some new spot.

3256
03:06:18.480 --> 03:06:23.480
But I think that the type of person that it takes to be able to get in a boat

3257
03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:30.810
and travel across the ocean and land land,

3258
03:06:31.080 --> 03:06:34.830
I think it takes several generations before everybody fucking relaxes.

3259
03:06:35.340 --> 03:06:39.010
That's the bad ass motherfuckers that could get a boat had fucking

3260
03:06:39.140 --> 03:06:41.540
<v 4>do that.
Cause you just shook the,
the,
the,</v>

3261
03:06:41.541 --> 03:06:43.340
the loose leafs got shaken off the tree.

3262
03:06:43.560 --> 03:06:45.810
<v 1>They,
they were,
they're so gangster.
They gotten a gun,</v>

3263
03:06:45.811 --> 03:06:48.940
damn boat and traveled across.
Do you ever do that with no radio?

3264
03:06:49.130 --> 03:06:50.120
<v 4>You ever think about that though?</v>

3265
03:06:50.121 --> 03:06:52.370
When you travel with your kids somewhere and then you go,

3266
03:06:52.371 --> 03:06:54.800
how would we travel across America?
Like how would,

3267
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:59.830
how your family size up in a wagon train going from New York to La bye

3268
03:07:00.250 --> 03:07:02.710
<v 1>family would have either stayed.
I mean if you had little children,</v>

3269
03:07:02.711 --> 03:07:04.570
you did the state in Italy or Ireland,

3270
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:07.850
you would have done whatever you could do to stay where you were.
But my uh,

3271
03:07:07.900 --> 03:07:10.540
Grandfather's family came over here and

3272
03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:16.540
I want to say the early 19 hundreds of my grandfather's family came over here

3273
03:07:16.541 --> 03:07:20.200
from Italy and my grandfather lived on a farm and he said,

3274
03:07:20.230 --> 03:07:23.300
tell me stories about how they used to kill rabbits with their hands and grabbed

3275
03:07:23.301 --> 03:07:26.530
him by the neck and snap them.
That was like a normal part of your life.

3276
03:07:26.890 --> 03:07:30.010
And there was,
you know,
winter in square,
like they would run out of food.

3277
03:07:30.011 --> 03:07:31.030
Like there was no food.

3278
03:07:31.060 --> 03:07:33.850
Like they'd have to go and borrow food from people that were neighbors.

3279
03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:36.930
<v 4>So crazy times,
man,
it's crazy.
I know.
It's crazy.</v>

3280
03:07:36.990 --> 03:07:40.950
More crazy thing that is the like can I say this?
I said this guessing Lee,

3281
03:07:40.980 --> 03:07:43.680
but like the amount of humility your grandfather must've had,

3282
03:07:44.010 --> 03:07:46.790
he was a very humble guy.
Do you like to come here?
Almost two.

3283
03:07:46.890 --> 03:07:50.830
<v 1>Oh,
you know,
I,
he got walked on by my grandmother.</v>

3284
03:07:50.831 --> 03:07:53.560
My grandmother was in a really strong woman and she used to yell at him all her.

3285
03:07:54.040 --> 03:07:58.120
I was like a little kid because my mom had me when she was 20 and you know,

3286
03:07:58.121 --> 03:08:00.130
my mom did her best,
but she was really young.

3287
03:08:00.310 --> 03:08:02.890
You know when you're 20 years old and all the sudden you're raising a baby,

3288
03:08:02.891 --> 03:08:07.840
that's a parent.
I was 2021 I was 21 when I was born or when my,

3289
03:08:07.841 --> 03:08:11.980
um,
my mother was 21 rather when I was calling,
I was 21 when I was four.

3290
03:08:12.130 --> 03:08:14.320
I might as well,
Ben,
I would probably feel like,
oh my God,

3291
03:08:14.321 --> 03:08:17.740
this bitch is 21 she doesn't know what the fuck is going on.
I got to get up

3292
03:08:17.810 --> 03:08:21.410
<v 4>to 20 grand grandparents or tally immediate seven.
No,</v>

3293
03:08:21.411 --> 03:08:24.920
they're over 40 they could have been,
no,
no.
At the time you were bored.

3294
03:08:24.921 --> 03:08:25.520
I don't know.

3295
03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:26.480
<v 1>I don't know how old they were.</v>

3296
03:08:26.540 --> 03:08:29.870
I mean they care about me to wrap my head around now I don't want to do the
math,

3297
03:08:29.900 --> 03:08:31.660
but the point was,
Mike,
you know,

3298
03:08:31.661 --> 03:08:36.480
my mother was young and so like growing up or like a,
uh,

3299
03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:41.590
a young mother that doesn't necessarily know what the fuck is going on really

3300
03:08:41.980 --> 03:08:44.200
makes you realize at a young age like,
Oh

3301
03:08:44.290 --> 03:08:48.250
<v 4>shit,
it makes you start looking at everything a little differently.</v>

3302
03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:52.960
He doesn't know what's going on.
She,
I don't think she can make eggs.

3303
03:08:53.880 --> 03:08:54.713
She

3304
03:08:54.900 --> 03:08:58.340
<v 1>okay with that.
But they're both in his fucking crazy thing together.
Shit.</v>

3305
03:08:58.650 --> 03:09:01.650
And you know,
you realize like kind of early on knows the fuck.

3306
03:09:02.430 --> 03:09:04.890
<v 4>That's crazy.
I can't imagine being,</v>

3307
03:09:04.920 --> 03:09:09.090
I can't imagine that my biggest hiccup in life was getting into stand up because

3308
03:09:09.091 --> 03:09:12.150
my,
my,
I just that,
that I didn't,

3309
03:09:12.151 --> 03:09:16.080
I didn't have any humility at that time of my life and my dad gave me a speech

3310
03:09:16.081 --> 03:09:19.260
on my 26th birthday that was like fucking aggressive,

3311
03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:23.250
like [inaudible] like 20 seconds.
The 20th.
It was all my birthday.

3312
03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:26.340
Like he called me and I thought he's going to wish me happy birthday.

3313
03:09:26.820 --> 03:09:29.490
And he was like,
you're a fucking loser.
Oh my God.
He's like,

3314
03:09:29.491 --> 03:09:33.030
you make me embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed it.
You're my son.
I lie about you.

3315
03:09:33.090 --> 03:09:35.540
Oh my God,
he's,
do you know what that's like to love private type?

3316
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:40.130
Judge heard your son got his life's option by rob Oliver stone and he's in New

3317
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:43.200
York and standardize.
He doing here's I lied in fucking court.
He goes,

3318
03:09:43.201 --> 03:09:45.990
it makes me sick to my stomach.
I was like,
what can I do different?
And he goes,

3319
03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:49.770
nothing.
I was like,
well,
can I fix this?
And he goes,

3320
03:09:49.771 --> 03:09:53.800
I know I failed you as a father.
And I,
it it me to like,

3321
03:09:54.130 --> 03:09:55.720
it changed my life.
Like I went,

3322
03:09:55.840 --> 03:10:00.840
he taught me how to get taught me how to be humble enough to get a job in stand

3323
03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:04.060
up.
So you just needed to work the door.
But I thought I was above that.

3324
03:10:04.061 --> 03:10:05.500
I thought that I was better than that.

3325
03:10:05.501 --> 03:10:08.110
Like I thought that someone would just grabbed me and put me on stage and I'd be

3326
03:10:08.111 --> 03:10:09.790
discovered.
That's how I thought it happened.

3327
03:10:09.791 --> 03:10:13.600
I know you could literally be humble and say,
I want to do this.

3328
03:10:13.601 --> 03:10:16.330
How do I go about doing this?
Please help me test someone.

3329
03:10:16.990 --> 03:10:21.990
And he got me into it and literally fucking started doing it the next night and

3330
03:10:22.901 --> 03:10:26.230
six months later I had a deal and it was like I was a fucking,

3331
03:10:26.500 --> 03:10:29.260
one of the greatest things I ever did.
I look back at that.
So family,

3332
03:10:29.261 --> 03:10:33.040
there's times me like outside,
this is every single night hanging outside.

3333
03:10:33.041 --> 03:10:36.520
Jim Norton,
Bobby Kelly,
Patrice O'neil,
Collin like [inaudible] quaint.

3334
03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:39.400
Actually he did.
I didn't,
I've never actually met him until recently.

3335
03:10:39.401 --> 03:10:40.140
Just throw him in

3336
03:10:40.140 --> 03:10:42.710
<v 2>because I,
I started getting into a tough crowd mentality.</v>

3337
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:46.280
I started looking at the credits.
I'm tough crowd.
I was like me,
Bobby Kelly,

3338
03:10:46.281 --> 03:10:50.910
like [inaudible].
I'm honest.
I'd never,
I'd never met Nikki there.

3339
03:10:50.911 --> 03:10:53.060
So No,
I mean I've seen them come,

3340
03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:55.960
I worked the door when he'd come in and do the club,
but I never liked it.

3341
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:58.980
<v 0>There's ECM onstage,
there's fucking next brotherly love.</v>

3342
03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:02.670
Nick Depaulo to me is one of the most underrated comedians in this kind of hands

3343
03:11:02.671 --> 03:11:03.990
down.
No questions asked.
He's the Kinda guy.

3344
03:11:03.991 --> 03:11:07.110
You can tell his jokes to your friend at a bar and a fucking lose their mind.

3345
03:11:07.111 --> 03:11:11.940
He had a joke about her.
Do you remember when Katrina hit do is?

3346
03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:16.020
It's so cruel.
It was so,
it was so fucked up.
But he goes,
yeah,
they were.

3347
03:11:16.170 --> 03:11:20.520
They were writing rescue of rescue,
rescue signs on the row,
on the roof.

3348
03:11:20.521 --> 03:11:21.410
But I'm not sure

3349
03:11:21.420 --> 03:11:25.650
<v 2>doing this any justice.
I was like,</v>

3350
03:11:25.651 --> 03:11:26.700
there's no way I'll get through it.

3351
03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:30.080
<v 0>It was signing a rescue.
Uh,
you know,
signs on the roof,</v>

3352
03:11:30.081 --> 03:11:34.770
but there were misspellings them instead of help.
But said Hap once.
I'm happy.

3353
03:11:34.771 --> 03:11:35.810
The trick,
that fucking water,

3354
03:11:38.540 --> 03:11:43.070
if you want some hap drink that water,
Nick Depaulo I'm not,

3355
03:11:43.071 --> 03:11:45.320
I'm sorry nick.
I butchered your joke.
I apologize.

3356
03:11:45.330 --> 03:11:48.730
<v 2>I wish I knew his joke about,
uh,
he goes,
ah,
Guy,</v>

3357
03:11:49.380 --> 03:11:52.790
I'm not going to do this.
Ain't justice either.
They a lot of bills.
I,

3358
03:11:52.791 --> 03:11:55.170
they haven't said the n word.
A lot of people say that rarely.

3359
03:11:55.260 --> 03:11:57.420
I guess you'd never put $1,000 on a playoff game.

3360
03:11:59.820 --> 03:12:03.300
I knew I ruined that bit,
but no,
no,
no,
no fucking good.

3361
03:12:03.490 --> 03:12:07.660
Nickname follows is one of the funniest.
I watched naughty,
naughty,
naughty,

3362
03:12:08.090 --> 03:12:08.923
naughty and

3363
03:12:11.770 --> 03:12:14.400
I watched Nordion rd and nick

3364
03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:18.410
<v 4>on uh,
on,
on the fucking,
uh,</v>

3365
03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:20.020
<v 2>it's same thing Dan.
Patrick shows on,</v>

3366
03:12:20.021 --> 03:12:23.890
I want to watch it because I respect both of those guys so much that I go,

3367
03:12:24.220 --> 03:12:26.750
it's not the best shows sometimes,
but this is what I,
what I

3368
03:12:26.750 --> 03:12:31.750
<v 0>think that show would be fucking magic if it was uncensored and to take nick and</v>

3369
03:12:32.811 --> 03:12:34.440
rd and put them on regular radio.

3370
03:12:34.650 --> 03:12:38.720
It's like taking Joey Diaz and make him instead of talk.

3371
03:12:38.750 --> 03:12:42.320
Write with a Crayon.
Yeah,
it's nonsense.
It's fucking stupid.

3372
03:12:42.380 --> 03:12:44.870
I watch it all the time though.
Cause it's like I love nick and Arnie.

3373
03:12:44.871 --> 03:12:48.410
Someone with some fucking balls.
Please take that show,
put it on the Internet.

3374
03:12:48.411 --> 03:12:51.980
You'd make more money than if you want people listening and you could still

3375
03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:54.710
<v 1>put it on direct TV or whatever the fuck you're putting it on.</v>

3376
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:58.100
It's still would be,
but leave.
Let Nick Be Nick.

3377
03:12:58.101 --> 03:13:02.870
Let rd already let him be crazy.
Let him let him talk.

3378
03:13:03.260 --> 03:13:04.093
Complete

3379
03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:09.080
<v 4>unhindered.
The way he,
what did I,
we were talking,</v>

3380
03:13:09.081 --> 03:13:13.130
I was talking to someone recently about bomb lines and Nixon,

3381
03:13:13.160 --> 03:13:14.400
BombBomb lines I go to when you,

3382
03:13:14.401 --> 03:13:17.150
when you're doing bad in the hecklers attacking you and you have your comeback

3383
03:13:17.390 --> 03:13:19.550
and Nick Depaulo has a time.

3384
03:13:20.120 --> 03:13:23.900
I've once again a butchering whatever this story is because I don't remember it,

3385
03:13:23.930 --> 03:13:27.320
but nick said that he was getting heckled by this girl and it was her

3386
03:13:27.321 --> 03:13:31.520
bachelorette party and he was on the road and some podunk town and he was like,

3387
03:13:31.870 --> 03:13:32.900
he was like,
ma'am,

3388
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:36.500
I hope the next time you reach under your armpit you feel a lump.

3389
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:41.750
And he goes,
I've never had an entire crowd hate me more.

3390
03:13:41.751 --> 03:13:44.840
And they had to escort him to the green room,

3391
03:13:45.980 --> 03:13:50.360
but he's a fucking old school,
like old school.
Kind of like,

3392
03:13:50.390 --> 03:13:53.420
that's the kind of dad I want to meet dads at like my kid's school.

3393
03:13:53.421 --> 03:13:55.660
And I wonder if they knew who the fuck I am.
Like then,
then they,

3394
03:13:55.670 --> 03:13:57.770
then they do know who I am.
They figure out who I am,

3395
03:13:57.920 --> 03:13:59.750
they'll Google me and they'll go,
oh shit,

3396
03:13:59.751 --> 03:14:02.900
I didn't know you were this guy can be this guy around you.
Like I want to know.

3397
03:14:02.901 --> 03:14:05.600
I said,
I wonder if like parents,
cause he's got kids.

3398
03:14:05.660 --> 03:14:10.250
If they meet him and they have no clue of who he is and then like Google him and

3399
03:14:10.251 --> 03:14:12.530
then they're like,
oh my God,
I can tell this joke in front of you.

3400
03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:17.150
He's one of the funniest fucking human beings,
man.
I really,
very nice guy.

3401
03:14:17.210 --> 03:14:21.770
Did you ever do tough crowd?
Tough crowd was a definitive show on my life.
Yeah.

3402
03:14:21.920 --> 03:14:25.280
I would just have my first daughter show.
I've been doing the road and I would,

3403
03:14:25.310 --> 03:14:27.110
and I knew a lot of those guys,

3404
03:14:27.290 --> 03:14:31.080
most of those guys from doing stand up comedy or tragedy that chose cancel,

3405
03:14:31.110 --> 03:14:32.540
but it's so silly bullshit.

3406
03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:37.230
<v 1>Like,
like why would you ever,
I mean it's such an easy resource,
you know,</v>

3407
03:14:37.231 --> 03:14:39.680
it was easy to get comedians.
Everybody wanted to be on it.

3408
03:14:39.740 --> 03:14:40.940
It was very entertaining.

3409
03:14:42.890 --> 03:14:47.660
<v 4>Well you got to talking to him and it's pretty much a podcast.
It was a limited</v>

3410
03:14:47.910 --> 03:14:51.480
<v 1>like time,
a time limited podcast.
This,
listen man,</v>

3411
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:56.510
we're so lucky that we are existing in this time where you can do this thing

3412
03:14:57.060 --> 03:15:00.450
where you could do whatever the fuck you want.
No one's telling us what to do.

3413
03:15:00.451 --> 03:15:02.740
We're doing whenever we want.
We decided to keep going.
We did.

3414
03:15:02.741 --> 03:15:05.130
We decided to end the podcast,
take a leak and keep going.

3415
03:15:05.340 --> 03:15:09.730
There's no producers don't.
That's the of the beauty of

3416
03:15:10.060 --> 03:15:13.960
<v 4>situation.
This is when Greg Giraldo fucking dentist's,
sorry,</v>

3417
03:15:14.220 --> 03:15:15.530
hit pause for a second.
Brian.

3418
03:15:15.890 --> 03:15:20.210
This is Dwayne or keeping my money story because Geraldo never even went to the

3419
03:15:20.211 --> 03:15:24.140
nuclear weapons,
which is plagiarism.
He never even went to that.
You know,

3420
03:15:24.141 --> 03:15:27.620
he never even went to that,
but leary was so conti with them.

3421
03:15:27.621 --> 03:15:32.360
Like right off the bat.
Greg Geraldo was a fucking beautiful dude.

3422
03:15:32.570 --> 03:15:35.600
He was just the nicest fucking guy.

3423
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:39.980
He was very intelligent in a time where in my life when no one needed to be nice

3424
03:15:39.981 --> 03:15:44.480
to me.
There were two people that were distinctly nice to me and,
and,
and gentle.

3425
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:47.390
And that was bill burr and Greg Geraldo,
like,
you know,

3426
03:15:47.391 --> 03:15:51.330
Norton and Bobby and all those guys were always nice to me but men good Gerardo

3427
03:15:51.331 --> 03:15:55.530
and bill Burke took time,
pulled me aside and like,
they were fucking great guys.

3428
03:15:55.531 --> 03:15:59.350
I remember one time calling into my buddy cow head show,
uh,
and,

3429
03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:03.540
and because Geraldo was on and calling in to listen to your elders interview,

3430
03:16:03.541 --> 03:16:07.380
cause I just loved Greg and cow had told him and dread goes,

3431
03:16:07.381 --> 03:16:08.460
I'll put them on the phone and talk to him.

3432
03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:12.690
And I talked to Greg for like fucking 10 minutes in between a break in a song

3433
03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:15.600
and just was like,
man,
how,
how's everything going?
And he's like,
well,

3434
03:16:15.770 --> 03:16:19.620
it was a very sincere fucking fucking great guy.
He had a show,

3435
03:16:19.650 --> 03:16:24.510
I don't remember what network it was on,
but it was,
uh,
it was his sitcom.

3436
03:16:24.580 --> 03:16:26.520
It was on during when yours was right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3437
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:30.610
He talked about partying with the girl that was on your show.
Which one?
Uh,

3438
03:16:30.660 --> 03:16:35.550
the girl with big tits.
Who on newsradio girls are they tense?

3439
03:16:35.560 --> 03:16:38.760
Didn't that one girl with big tits?
No,
not who is the girl?

3440
03:16:39.250 --> 03:16:42.710
There was beautiful girls,
but I always thought why?
Yeah,

3441
03:16:42.720 --> 03:16:44.000
I was actually a big data.
Have they?

3442
03:16:44.310 --> 03:16:46.370
I thought her tits were so big they had to tape them on.

3443
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:51.710
Maura was the white girl with black hair.
Yeah,
she was though.
That's a release.

3444
03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:56.340
Listen nickels,
terrible misunderstanding.
She was beautiful.

3445
03:16:56.350 --> 03:16:58.920
Known that she's very beautiful and incredibly townhome.

3446
03:16:59.010 --> 03:17:01.290
Fucking want to try the white wine with her so bad.

3447
03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:03.010
<v 1>I did a scene with her once,</v>

3448
03:17:03.011 --> 03:17:06.580
I'll never forget this and I told her and she just sort of laughed it off cause

3449
03:17:06.581 --> 03:17:11.050
she's,
she's like really like you.
She wasn't,

3450
03:17:12.190 --> 03:17:16.390
she would never like brag about her talent like as an actor.
And she was good,

3451
03:17:16.570 --> 03:17:21.190
but we did a scene together and um,
I didn't realize that she was acting.

3452
03:17:21.610 --> 03:17:25.060
I thought she was saying something to me and I was like,
oh,
that's the words.

3453
03:17:25.090 --> 03:17:28.650
Oh whoa.
I go,
Holy Shit.
You bad ass bitch.
I go,

3454
03:17:28.780 --> 03:17:32.080
I didn't know you were acting like you just fucking rocked me.

3455
03:17:32.110 --> 03:17:36.010
Like she blocked me with what you were saying because the set of news radio was

3456
03:17:36.011 --> 03:17:36.940
very loose,

3457
03:17:37.300 --> 03:17:41.170
there was a lot of fucking off and there was also a lot of improvisation where

3458
03:17:41.171 --> 03:17:46.171
it's like Dave Foley was responsible for a huge amount of like what got on the

3459
03:17:46.361 --> 03:17:48.040
air or that show because it's sort of like,

3460
03:17:48.250 --> 03:17:51.250
he was like sort of like almost like a secret producer and it was because of the

3461
03:17:51.251 --> 03:17:52.870
guys who wrote the show were like,

3462
03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:56.770
they were so open minded and so smart and Paul Simms,

3463
03:17:56.980 --> 03:17:58.510
who is the executive producer was just,

3464
03:17:58.780 --> 03:18:03.010
it's really brilliant guy who recognized that there was a lot of people like n d

3465
03:18:03.011 --> 03:18:07.090
or like Phil Hartman or like Dave Foley or whatever who would have this

3466
03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:11.650
intuition while they were on stage working out the scenes that they would come

3467
03:18:11.651 --> 03:18:13.810
up with new things and to incorporate those new things.

3468
03:18:14.080 --> 03:18:18.100
So Dave was like constantly tweaking things and adding things and it was,

3469
03:18:18.370 --> 03:18:18.611
you know,

3470
03:18:18.611 --> 03:18:22.060
and being able to watch that and to watch someone do that and to be in that

3471
03:18:22.061 --> 03:18:25.220
situation,
I was like,
wow.
I'm like,
this is,
this is,

3472
03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:28.120
this is like an ideal situation.

3473
03:18:28.780 --> 03:18:31.280
<v 4>Uh,
I was the is um,</v>

3474
03:18:31.450 --> 03:18:34.810
this is gonna Sound Conti Conti but weird.
But uh,

3475
03:18:34.840 --> 03:18:38.440
so like last year was a very good year for me and,

3476
03:18:38.450 --> 03:18:41.830
and I'm also in the middle of our,
our school,
so we're like,

3477
03:18:41.831 --> 03:18:45.190
our kids are in third grade and like now we've been at school long enough,

3478
03:18:45.191 --> 03:18:48.490
they kind of bored and we know all the parents.
And so like I was this like a,

3479
03:18:48.491 --> 03:18:52.870
I was the resident famous comedian parent.
Like,
oh,

3480
03:18:52.871 --> 03:18:57.070
he's a comedian.
I think Dave Foley's kids go to our school now and Dave folded.

3481
03:18:57.071 --> 03:18:58.540
They were like,
have you heard Dave Foley?

3482
03:18:59.290 --> 03:19:02.650
He's spoken to PTA money apparently is fucking amazing dad.

3483
03:19:02.770 --> 03:19:05.530
Like I'm either that or it's a guy that looks like Dave Foley.

3484
03:19:05.890 --> 03:19:07.510
What do you mean these amazing dad?

3485
03:19:07.511 --> 03:19:11.650
Like he like he shows up and does all the shifts and they were like,

3486
03:19:11.770 --> 03:19:14.890
and I don't go to anything.
I don't even go to recitals.
Like I just fucking,

3487
03:19:15.130 --> 03:19:19.270
he's a very solid dude.
That was a great set.
But what I'm saying about Morris,

3488
03:19:19.290 --> 03:19:22.850
she did,
she was built,
oh yeah.
She's very pretty beautiful woman.

3489
03:19:23.230 --> 03:19:27.840
She didn't have big knocker.
She was fucking hot as shit.
Yeah.
She's very bright.

3490
03:19:27.850 --> 03:19:30.700
But yeah,
but Greg Giraldo across from you guys and you guys just to party,
right?

3491
03:19:30.701 --> 03:19:32.640
And Well Greg was right next

3492
03:19:32.670 --> 03:19:34.700
<v 1>store and um,
he was,</v>

3493
03:19:34.940 --> 03:19:37.790
there's a lot of guys who had TV shows.

3494
03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:41.270
There was a lot of guys who like got gigs back in those days.

3495
03:19:41.271 --> 03:19:44.240
It's like they got a development deal and maybe they had a few episodes.

3496
03:19:44.241 --> 03:19:46.030
Like my friend Tom Rhodes,
he had a show for us.

3497
03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:48.320
<v 4>Why can love Tom Rhodes a good dude?</v>

3498
03:19:48.350 --> 03:19:52.250
<v 1>He's a great dude.
And um,
I met Tom.
The first time I met him was,</v>

3499
03:19:52.251 --> 03:19:53.350
we were both on NBC.

3500
03:19:53.380 --> 03:19:57.920
I was on news radio and he had his own show and then he went over to Amsterdam

3501
03:19:57.921 --> 03:20:00.550
and it's just,
he's Tom's beautiful,
he's fucking awesome.

3502
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:04.880
But he never lost his shit,
you know,
he was,
he's always been cool.

3503
03:20:05.180 --> 03:20:06.040
He's always been like that.

3504
03:20:06.170 --> 03:20:08.130
<v 4>The night I met,
he's a,
he's a Tom Rhodes.</v>

3505
03:20:08.180 --> 03:20:11.840
<v 1>It's like,
in my opinion,
like a fucking ledge yet.
Canadian</v>

3506
03:20:11.860 --> 03:20:14.200
<v 4>Tom Rhodes is from Florida.
And uh,</v>

3507
03:20:14.230 --> 03:20:18.370
I've told him the story a number of times and he never really remembers it,

3508
03:20:18.670 --> 03:20:19.930
but we ran into each other.
And Amsterdam,

3509
03:20:19.931 --> 03:20:23.140
we did that show time special with Russell Peters.
And I said,
uh,

3510
03:20:23.590 --> 03:20:26.110
the fucking first night I met him,
I was working in the Boston comedy club.

3511
03:20:26.111 --> 03:20:28.990
I came downstairs and he was at the bar and I knew he was from Florida and I was

3512
03:20:28.991 --> 03:20:32.560
from Florida.
And I like to stand up.
And I walked up to him and I was like,

3513
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:36.460
I was like,
hey man,
I'm,
my name is Bert.
I'm a comedian.
I just started,

3514
03:20:36.461 --> 03:20:40.180
I'd love to ask you.
And he stopped me,
like put his hand on my chest is handled.

3515
03:20:40.190 --> 03:20:43.690
Manchester was like,
listen,
you start buying beers,

3516
03:20:43.691 --> 03:20:47.440
I'll answer every question you want.
And I was like,
all right.
So I started,

3517
03:20:47.441 --> 03:20:51.520
I put my fucking Dad's credit card down and I fucking bug beers and talk to them

3518
03:20:51.521 --> 03:20:54.590
about comedy for like three hours.
It was fucking great.
He was,

3519
03:20:54.810 --> 03:20:56.620
<v 1>well,
the one dude's that did,
uh,</v>

3520
03:20:56.670 --> 03:21:00.330
the icehouse chronicles and we had a long conversation afterwards when I was

3521
03:21:00.331 --> 03:21:03.810
with you.
Yeah.
He was like the comradery.
So cool.

3522
03:21:03.811 --> 03:21:07.200
Here it's like we have like real comedian comradery.

3523
03:21:07.260 --> 03:21:09.510
<v 4>He was hammered and I said,
yeah,
I was with the two.</v>

3524
03:21:09.540 --> 03:21:13.540
I think I was with the two I was with.
I had a guy with me to drive me and I,

3525
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:17.220
I was like,
Tom,
let us take you to your,
cause he was hammered.
Yeah.
But yeah,

3526
03:21:17.221 --> 03:21:19.700
we were trying to tell them there's no way you're drunk.
And he was like,
ah,

3527
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:24.680
don't worry about me.
I sleep in the car.
I wake up and I go,
yeah,
he passed.

3528
03:21:24.730 --> 03:21:28.000
He slept in his car.
Do you do that?
That's illegal if he's sleeping.

3529
03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:33.330
<v 9>Yes.
Yeah.
I just had a simulation thing happened to me.
Joe,
I uh,
that,</v>

3530
03:21:33.331 --> 03:21:35.700
that Denis leary video that we were talking about last night,

3531
03:21:35.701 --> 03:21:37.020
I watched this movie called happy,

3532
03:21:37.021 --> 03:21:40.650
which is all about depression and stuff like that.
It's a documentary on Netflix.

3533
03:21:40.651 --> 03:21:41.520
I recommend.
It's all right.

3534
03:21:41.850 --> 03:21:46.160
But there was a guy in the movie that was like a motivational to kids

3535
03:21:46.460 --> 03:21:49.280
<v 2>and I was like,
who is this guy?
It's the guy on the right,
right there.</v>

3536
03:21:49.281 --> 03:21:52.700
I've never seen this guy.
Never in my life.
Yeah.
And now he's in his,

3537
03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:54.650
he's going to be on the podcast.

3538
03:21:56.100 --> 03:21:59.220
<v 1>Let me tell you something.
The second time I ever did stand up for money,</v>

3539
03:21:59.340 --> 03:22:03.240
I opened for Lenny Clarke.
I used to say it was the first time,
but that's a lie,

3540
03:22:03.241 --> 03:22:06.060
ladies and gentlemen.
The first time I opened up a guy named more McDonald's,

3541
03:22:06.660 --> 03:22:09.360
that's the first time I ever got paid.
But the second time I ever got paid,

3542
03:22:09.361 --> 03:22:14.340
the truth is I opened up for Lenny Clarke and I was in a place called js and

3543
03:22:14.341 --> 03:22:17.130
Pittsfield,
Massachusetts and Lenny.
Um,

3544
03:22:17.310 --> 03:22:20.940
he's always been like super cool to me.
He's like,
look how fat Greg Looks.

3545
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.850
Does it look real fast?

3546
03:22:23.480 --> 03:22:28.340
<v 2>Well,
considering like comparing now Brian.
Wow.</v>

3547
03:22:28.410 --> 03:22:29.740
Oh,
Brian,

3548
03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:33.570
where you saw that a bit.

3549
03:22:33.740 --> 03:22:36.530
At least you know that Greg would have been going into hives.
A horrible joke.

3550
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:42.590
Yeah.
The big guy,
by the way.
Uh,
Lenny has lost a shitload of weight.

3551
03:22:42.620 --> 03:22:46.850
Yeah.
Lenny is really thin now back,
wait,
wait,
is this serious?

3552
03:22:46.851 --> 03:22:50.960
In that documentary he was pulling out towels because he wouldn't stop sweating

3553
03:22:51.200 --> 03:22:53.630
and I was telling,
I was talking to the girl was with last night and it's like,

3554
03:22:53.930 --> 03:22:54.651
isn't that crazy?

3555
03:22:54.651 --> 03:22:58.370
He's just standing there talking to kids and he can't stop sweating.

3556
03:22:58.371 --> 03:23:02.150
There's like sweat all over his body and documentary.
It's called happy.

3557
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:03.800
And I just saw it last night.

3558
03:23:03.801 --> 03:23:06.980
I never seen this guy before my life and I just pull up this video and he's in

3559
03:23:06.981 --> 03:23:11.830
this video.
It's so fucking simple.
Where's the part where Greg and we call fight.

3560
03:23:12.020 --> 03:23:15.560
<v 1>We did that movie together.
I'm,
here comes the boom,</v>

3561
03:23:15.561 --> 03:23:19.040
the Kevin James [inaudible] and Lenny Clarke was in that movie because it was

3562
03:23:19.100 --> 03:23:23.570
shot in Boston and Lenny played a local Boston guy,
Lenny Clarke.

3563
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:27.470
I fucking love that guy.
But he's,
you lost a lot of weight man.

3564
03:23:27.471 --> 03:23:30.960
He lost a ton of what he looks great.
I mean,
he's like really lean.

3565
03:23:30.990 --> 03:23:33.140
He doesn't ever,
I've got it all.

3566
03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:51.720
<v 2>Is this where [inaudible] it's,
it's,</v>

3567
03:23:51.780 --> 03:23:53.380
it's about the time,
I think right here.

3568
03:23:55.160 --> 03:23:55.993
<v 8>Gotcha.</v>

3569
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:58.880
<v 2>Well,
you got to tell you what happened.
The left,
Denis leary gets mad.
They'd,</v>

3570
03:23:58.881 --> 03:24:02.740
Greg Geraldo has prepared material.
It's really hilarious.

3571
03:24:03.390 --> 03:24:06.160
<v 8>And that's how he found out where they were buried.
The ball.
Yeah.</v>

3572
03:24:10.180 --> 03:24:12.010
<v 2>During the Dukes of Hazzard.
I don't know.</v>

3573
03:24:12.011 --> 03:24:17.011
Someone should like find this off air and figure it out because it's a really,

3574
03:24:20.920 --> 03:24:25.530
<v 8>there might be they're asking for is a non violent way to solve a problem with</v>

3575
03:24:25.531 --> 03:24:28.440
the country that we hate that Dustin's got weapons pointed at?
I don't think so.

3576
03:24:28.470 --> 03:24:30.780
No,
you're right.
Like Russia for example,
that big Russian war.

3577
03:24:32.820 --> 03:24:35.440
There are things that,
there are things that

3578
03:24:36.450 --> 03:24:38.550
<v 2>Denis Leary's upset.
What about</v>

3579
03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:41.200
<v 8>it?
But there are approach to their economic benefits that we're giving them in</v>

3580
03:24:41.201 --> 03:24:43.530
order to put them to stop developing their with him.

3581
03:24:43.740 --> 03:24:47.700
I heard recently they agreed to stop that stop building nuke if American women

3582
03:24:47.701 --> 03:24:49.500
agree to get their nails done at least twice a week.

3583
03:24:51.370 --> 03:24:52.770
But I ran the good boy.

3584
03:24:53.310 --> 03:24:55.800
You can't write so many jokes before the show was not a report.

3585
03:24:55.920 --> 03:25:00.160
It's unbelievable.
He's got to,
he's got a pocket full of yeah.

3586
03:25:01.050 --> 03:25:05.360
Don't know,
I'll have it was Mike,
that that's kind of what we do here.

3587
03:25:05.380 --> 03:25:06.390
Identify with a comedy writer.

3588
03:25:12.280 --> 03:25:15.270
You're a guy who did all the homework and then after three weeks any more that

3589
03:25:15.271 --> 03:25:18.090
needed to be done.
That's a good point.

3590
03:25:18.091 --> 03:25:19.520
And if you would try a little comedy writing,

3591
03:25:19.521 --> 03:25:20.760
have you show and still be on the air,

3592
03:25:21.570 --> 03:25:26.570
<v 7>hey [inaudible] hey,</v>

3593
03:25:29.641 --> 03:25:30.620
tell me all the time

3594
03:25:32.370 --> 03:25:36.390
<v 4>you just crushed him Pumpkin,
you know,
but that's okay.</v>

3595
03:25:36.520 --> 03:25:38.200
<v 5>Thing that happens when dudes get famous.</v>

3596
03:25:38.201 --> 03:25:40.230
I think you guy can come along and clown.
Yeah,

3597
03:25:40.280 --> 03:25:41.890
<v 4>dude,
tell me about,</v>

3598
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:44.750
it's a first time I went on the road and I realized there are killers that I've

3599
03:25:44.751 --> 03:25:45.570
never heard of.
No,

3600
03:25:45.570 --> 03:25:50.400
<v 5>please.
When a guy gets famous to a point where you're,
uh,
uh,
Tom Cruise or any,</v>

3601
03:25:50.401 --> 03:25:54.120
any,
any sort of a person's been in movies.
Yeah.
Dennis leary,
when that came out,

3602
03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:58.500
had been in a ton of movies.
He'd been in some really high profile movies.

3603
03:25:58.980 --> 03:26:01.350
Mean he thought of himself as a guy who had made it.

3604
03:26:01.530 --> 03:26:05.760
So I think he probably assumed he was going to get a certain level of respect.

3605
03:26:06.990 --> 03:26:07.823
<v 4>Sure.</v>

3606
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:11.210
<v 5>You did a little writing.
Your show would still be on the air.</v>

3607
03:26:11.390 --> 03:26:13.900
That was like a nuclear weapon that he didn't see common.

3608
03:26:13.980 --> 03:26:17.110
<v 4>He didn't see that to help me at all.
He got detonated.</v>

3609
03:26:17.130 --> 03:26:21.390
What's great about [inaudible] is that you,
oh bro,
that was hubris.

3610
03:26:21.420 --> 03:26:24.750
You look at the look on Geraldo's face and you can see his eyes twitching and

3611
03:26:24.751 --> 03:26:29.640
you can see him go angry going uh,
three,
two,
I got this,

3612
03:26:29.641 --> 03:26:32.580
I got this.
And then like making is make it as tactical call in his head.

3613
03:26:32.581 --> 03:26:34.080
You could see that happening almost.

3614
03:26:34.250 --> 03:26:37.850
<v 5>It's a superior mind.
Yeah.
It's superior mind.</v>

3615
03:26:37.880 --> 03:26:41.060
Just not as famous but a superior product.
Like what he would,

3616
03:26:41.061 --> 03:26:43.600
he would put out his points of view.
It'd be superior.
I'll watch this.

3617
03:26:43.760 --> 03:26:46.760
I got to get the idea that there would be like something funny and saying that

3618
03:26:46.761 --> 03:26:51.320
someone prepared the Glucodin me for Pitta bully.
Well that's the idea.

3619
03:26:51.321 --> 03:26:54.980
That is ridiculous.
Like that's so crazy.
Like,
oh look at the painter.

3620
03:26:54.981 --> 03:26:57.550
He went and painted like,
what the fuck?

3621
03:26:57.670 --> 03:27:01.310
<v 4>Well,
it's,
it's uh,
there's a,
there's a certain personality that,
and I,</v>

3622
03:27:01.311 --> 03:27:03.780
I'm not gonna speak,
I don't know,
I'm not saying this is Dennis leary,

3623
03:27:03.781 --> 03:27:08.520
but there is a certain personality that's so arrogant in that the way I say it

3624
03:27:08.521 --> 03:27:10.800
will be so much better than the way you say it.

3625
03:27:10.980 --> 03:27:14.380
As opposed to what I say is better than what you say.
So like,
Hey,

3626
03:27:14.460 --> 03:27:17.550
like you could hear the statement before him when he says,
well,

3627
03:27:17.551 --> 03:27:19.710
we're going to go to war with a country like the,

3628
03:27:19.770 --> 03:27:22.790
it was very arrogant and he was like,
yeah,
like that great Russian war.
Like,
yes,

3629
03:27:22.860 --> 03:27:25.870
that does fucking work.
You're not listening to the words you're,
you're,

3630
03:27:25.871 --> 03:27:27.390
you're overlooking the thought.

3631
03:27:27.850 --> 03:27:28.620
<v 5>Well,</v>

3632
03:27:28.620 --> 03:27:33.360
he has this idea that somehow or another he's going to be able to solve what

3633
03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:37.680
hundreds of scholars and heads of states and yeah,

3634
03:27:37.840 --> 03:27:42.650
diplomats and emissary workers and no,
no one can solve.
No one can solve it.

3635
03:27:42.651 --> 03:27:45.780
He's going to come along and tell you exactly how things need to be blunt.
It's,

3636
03:27:45.781 --> 03:27:49.330
is it co the,
the ideas of first of all,

3637
03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:52.900
communication between nations where they don't even speak the same fucking

3638
03:27:52.901 --> 03:27:55.120
language.
Yeah.
Difficult.
That shit is,

3639
03:27:55.390 --> 03:28:00.390
it's so fucking hard just to understand things and cultural context and explain

3640
03:28:02.381 --> 03:28:06.100
those different people that are in your country that you're sort of representing

3641
03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:09.490
because Koreans are not like Americans and Americans and all I Koreans and

3642
03:28:09.630 --> 03:28:12.550
people that live in North Korea do not understand how we're living in North

3643
03:28:12.551 --> 03:28:13.061
America.

3644
03:28:13.061 --> 03:28:16.600
And the people in North America for the most part really are fairly ignorant

3645
03:28:16.601 --> 03:28:18.460
about what the fuck is going on in North Korea.

3646
03:28:18.610 --> 03:28:21.760
And one of the big reasons is because we can't fuck them communicate with each

3647
03:28:21.761 --> 03:28:23.680
other.
But if we could communicate with each other,

3648
03:28:23.681 --> 03:28:28.681
if everybody in Korean in North Korea knew how to speak English and they all

3649
03:28:28.841 --> 03:28:31.990
could read the shit on the Internet about how the world is run and what the fuck

3650
03:28:31.991 --> 03:28:34.750
is really going on in the country and how the rest of the world views things,

3651
03:28:35.140 --> 03:28:37.990
they would probably slowly but surely take action.

3652
03:28:38.440 --> 03:28:42.520
But the fact that there's separate from the rest of the world.

3653
03:28:43.180 --> 03:28:47.260
In fact they speak this one very unique sort of a language.

3654
03:28:47.261 --> 03:28:52.261
It's difficult to learn and isn't translatable very easily to English or Spanish

3655
03:28:52.541 --> 03:28:52.970
or

3656
03:28:52.970 --> 03:28:57.810
<v 2>it's Korean,
not translatable is difficult.
See that symbol,</v>

3657
03:28:57.840 --> 03:28:58.700
you know the,
the,
this,

3658
03:28:58.710 --> 03:29:01.500
the way things are written and everything are good friends are Korean and that

3659
03:29:01.501 --> 03:29:04.110
when you go to,
we went to a Korean barbecue,
mind saves Roy Choi.

3660
03:29:04.111 --> 03:29:07.320
He's the guy that started the Taco truck.
The concept of the TACO truck.
It's him.

3661
03:29:07.860 --> 03:29:12.330
He started,
it started,
he was the first guy.
But the premise of these formation,

3662
03:29:12.510 --> 03:29:16.920
these gourmet taco trucks,
he's Asian.
Yeah.
Roy Choi.
He does.

3663
03:29:16.921 --> 03:29:17.940
He's good friends with Bordain.

3664
03:29:18.260 --> 03:29:22.190
<v 5>Asians don't give a fuck dude.
They get things done.
They get things done,</v>

3665
03:29:22.760 --> 03:29:23.320
don't they?

3666
03:29:23.320 --> 03:29:26.920
<v 2>They really get the thug.
They fucking get things done.
They really do.</v>

3667
03:29:27.820 --> 03:29:29.680
They're the fucking future of America.

3668
03:29:30.190 --> 03:29:33.760
<v 5>When you eat,
how the fuck did they ever figure out how to get,</v>

3669
03:29:35.430 --> 03:29:38.360
<v 2>I don't even know what you've said yet.
Full of full</v>

3670
03:29:38.460 --> 03:29:43.460
<v 5>like strangle hold on the manufacturer of like electronic parts and TV's and lab</v>

3671
03:29:48.330 --> 03:29:52.320
<v 2>cars.
Cars,
cars are over there now,
Lou and they're to wear in Detroit.</v>

3672
03:29:52.350 --> 03:29:53.970
No one's doing cars in Detroit.

3673
03:29:54.380 --> 03:29:57.120
Well isn't Chrysler still in Detroit and listen forward?
No,

3674
03:29:57.121 --> 03:29:58.230
but no one's in Detroit.

3675
03:29:58.231 --> 03:30:02.610
Detroit's apparently in peril because everyone took their business to Asia.

3676
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:05.600
Why?
It's more?
Is it more,
is it more a,

3677
03:30:05.601 --> 03:30:09.960
an idiocracy not idiocracy a theocracy.
Not The ocracy,

3678
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:13.840
what's the word I'm looking for?
Any audience.
See is that,
what do you,

3679
03:30:13.860 --> 03:30:18.000
what are you trying to like where it's like the idea of the state is better than

3680
03:30:18.001 --> 03:30:18.571
the person.

3681
03:30:18.571 --> 03:30:23.280
So everyone looks up to the state and it's something like that where they care

3682
03:30:23.281 --> 03:30:25.230
about their job.
Like Americans just don't care.

3683
03:30:25.680 --> 03:30:26.101
<v 5>Well,</v>

3684
03:30:26.101 --> 03:30:31.101
you know what happened is first of all the cars they made sucked that,

3685
03:30:31.411 --> 03:30:32.230
that hat

3686
03:30:32.230 --> 03:30:35.000
<v 2>in American.
Yeah,
this something happened.
We have to figure out,</v>

3687
03:30:35.040 --> 03:30:36.840
there's a part where we got really lazy.

3688
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:39.990
What the fuck went wrong from like 1973 to four

3689
03:30:40.010 --> 03:30:41.660
<v 0>tempo 90 fucking yeah,</v>

3690
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:46.340
<v 2>for tempo was a fucking was a,
that was a phone in job by the Americans.</v>

3691
03:30:46.580 --> 03:30:48.420
Like that's that car sat.

3692
03:30:49.520 --> 03:30:53.690
It sucked Dick in 1989 Ford tempo demos

3693
03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:56.570
<v 0>for Tampa.
What the fuck happened to the Mustang?</v>

3694
03:30:56.750 --> 03:31:01.040
Okay cause [inaudible] 82 months.
It was great.
And say this,
I can say this,

3695
03:31:01.041 --> 03:31:05.450
I have a Mustang today.
I have a Shelby gt 500 I fucking love it.
Okay.

3696
03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:10.750
But that's a 2010 and between like 1965 and 1972 or 73 they had some dope

3697
03:31:15.561 --> 03:31:16.190
fucking car.

3698
03:31:16.190 --> 03:31:21.190
Really liked to 69 but then something happened and like the 70s and the 80s like

3699
03:31:21.591 --> 03:31:24.500
you call that up fucking Mustang.

3700
03:31:25.270 --> 03:31:27.350
What are you a communist?
What did,

3701
03:31:27.351 --> 03:31:32.351
what are terrorist infiltrate the fucking the four plants and hold down the

3702
03:31:33.261 --> 03:31:36.950
designers by gunpoint and gay up all the drawings.
I go,
Huh,

3703
03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:41.270
fuck do you call that [inaudible] gave them I spell gay g,
h e y

3704
03:31:41.350 --> 03:31:45.700
<v 2>or none gave them Joe homosexuals like,
like,
cause I wonder if it was a,</v>

3705
03:31:45.701 --> 03:31:47.350
it had to do with homosexuality in the,

3706
03:31:47.351 --> 03:31:50.950
and the fear of homophobia and they took all these great gay designers that were

3707
03:31:50.951 --> 03:31:53.260
super closeted in the fifties and then got,

3708
03:31:53.261 --> 03:31:55.240
and then like there was this manliness and they disappeared.

3709
03:31:55.450 --> 03:31:58.510
<v 0>Are you trying to say that Dick Suck designed the corvette?</v>

3710
03:31:59.630 --> 03:32:02.150
<v 2>No,
there's no way you can tell me as a man,</v>

3711
03:32:02.300 --> 03:32:05.270
what is sexy without knowing sexy as a man.

3712
03:32:05.360 --> 03:32:09.770
What the fuck are you talking about Pete Townsend Corps vet is the sexiest car

3713
03:32:09.890 --> 03:32:11.810
you can put me in.
Is it really fun?

3714
03:32:11.840 --> 03:32:15.890
I just drove one from Miami to Marco Island and I tell you right now,

3715
03:32:15.891 --> 03:32:17.030
the second I sat in that seat,

3716
03:32:17.210 --> 03:32:20.180
I would let the steering a bit close to my face because I wanted it there.

3717
03:32:20.330 --> 03:32:24.020
It was just fucking,
it was a god and the car was a corvette,

3718
03:32:24.670 --> 03:32:29.330
a brand new brand new 3000 miles convertible.
Two new ones.

3719
03:32:29.460 --> 03:32:31.830
<v 0>Was it a four 26 I have no,
I have no idea.</v>

3720
03:32:31.831 --> 03:32:36.210
For 26 is they have the zero six [inaudible] zero six engine and suspension and

3721
03:32:36.211 --> 03:32:40.650
a convertible.
So fucking hot.
Like I just felt coolest shit in that car.

3722
03:32:40.651 --> 03:32:44.520
It's not a corvette,
Brian.
That's God damn Miata and it's pink.
How dare you?

3723
03:32:45.420 --> 03:32:49.140
How dare you hate America on this podcast?

3724
03:32:50.250 --> 03:32:54.500
Hating on my rock.
I got poop.
Well,

3725
03:32:54.510 --> 03:32:57.150
why don't you go poop,
man.
We'll wait.
Oh,
hold on.
Yeah.

3726
03:32:57.660 --> 03:33:00.660
What time is your raw comedy show tonight,
Brian?
And can kind of,

3727
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:03.270
can we guide people in your general direction?

3728
03:33:03.790 --> 03:33:06.980
I'm just going to try to get up somewhere now.
When you do that,
what do you do?

3729
03:33:06.990 --> 03:33:09.750
You just show up and say and try to sneak my way in.
Hey,

3730
03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:12.240
my name's Brian Red Band and you might know me on Twitter.

3731
03:33:13.310 --> 03:33:14.240
Is that what you're doing?
Yeah.

3732
03:33:15.170 --> 03:33:20.090
<v 2>Why don't you,
uh,
start a start up a room your own Brian.
Huh?
I did.</v>

3733
03:33:20.091 --> 03:33:22.060
I have like three rooms,
so yeah.

3734
03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:25.160
<v 0>Do you think ever will be all contained under one roof?</v>

3735
03:33:25.220 --> 03:33:29.270
Do you think that ever the full death squat family will have podcast studios in

3736
03:33:29.271 --> 03:33:32.160
one gigantic warehouses?
Cause that's what I'm seeing.

3737
03:33:32.480 --> 03:33:36.560
I'm seeing we also duplicate this at the onset compound and Texas.
Why don't,

3738
03:33:36.561 --> 03:33:37.800
why not Austin

3739
03:33:38.080 --> 03:33:42.780
<v 2>a thousands of acres.
We're our own lake plus deer to shoot.</v>

3740
03:33:42.840 --> 03:33:47.100
How do we get it?
How do we get our power?
Bitch,
did I say what?
What?

3741
03:33:47.550 --> 03:33:50.310
Maybe we can have our own fucking satellite.
Okay.
How do we get,

3742
03:33:50.620 --> 03:33:55.620
how do we get like a death squad like studio in a warehouse where we can make TV

3743
03:33:55.651 --> 03:34:00.390
shows.
I don't want to make it a CV.
So why not?
Why not?
I don't usually match.

3744
03:34:00.450 --> 03:34:05.340
I'm bad.
It just needs to be an umbrella.
Listen,
if I make a TV show,

3745
03:34:05.430 --> 03:34:10.200
here's my next TV show.
I'm going to play pool around.
Boring,

3746
03:34:10.860 --> 03:34:15.240
boring.
Some few bitch slap.
99% of the show is,

3747
03:34:15.560 --> 03:34:19.690
<v 0>we are very close to a sign.
I can't say with WHO.
[inaudible] there's a,</v>

3748
03:34:19.691 --> 03:34:24.520
there's a show that is a,
um,
uh,
a lot of it is based in the podcast.

3749
03:34:24.521 --> 03:34:25.780
What are you doing?
Taking text message?

3750
03:34:25.800 --> 03:34:27.570
<v 2>Because no,
come on them live on the air.</v>

3751
03:34:28.230 --> 03:34:30.810
This person said that they got a new phone number.
They're like,
sorry,

3752
03:34:30.811 --> 03:34:32.430
I got a new phone number and I thought they were lying.

3753
03:34:32.580 --> 03:34:35.880
But now they're sending me pictures of this.
Is that,
is that,
who is that?

3754
03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:39.960
Is that Kadafi?
Yeah.
All right.
So might be not the person,

3755
03:34:39.961 --> 03:34:43.670
I'm thinking of you getting someone sending you murdered people and what's,

3756
03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:46.350
what's,
what's that,
what's the new TV show you doing?

3757
03:34:46.610 --> 03:34:49.190
<v 0>Oh,
it's uh,
it's based a lot of it on his,</v>

3758
03:34:49.191 --> 03:34:52.430
like controversial subjects in a lot of it.
It'll be big.
It'll all of it.

3759
03:34:52.431 --> 03:34:56.380
We'll start off from the podcast,
like examining all sorts of different wood.

3760
03:34:56.430 --> 03:34:58.640
There's no tenant,
well,
we sorta have a tentative title,

3761
03:34:58.641 --> 03:34:59.990
but I'm not necessarily happy with it.

3762
03:34:59.991 --> 03:35:03.200
So the idea is that like the way we've done the podcast,

3763
03:35:03.201 --> 03:35:06.180
where we explore all these different ideas,
whether it's,
uh,

3764
03:35:06.290 --> 03:35:11.240
shamanism or ghosts or big foot or Ufo Ios or fringe topics,

3765
03:35:11.241 --> 03:35:15.950
crop circles,
reincarnation,
psychics,
and we're gonna,
um,

3766
03:35:15.980 --> 03:35:17.180
talk about it on the podcast.
Like,

3767
03:35:17.181 --> 03:35:21.920
I'll have a guy like you or Ari or Dunkin or Jolie or any comedian come on and

3768
03:35:21.921 --> 03:35:23.990
we'll say,
you know what?
It's like,
we'll do it right now.

3769
03:35:24.170 --> 03:35:27.440
What do you think about big foot,
do you think?
Do you think that is possible?

3770
03:35:27.560 --> 03:35:32.240
There could be an undiscovered primate that people have been talking about

3771
03:35:32.241 --> 03:35:36.770
reporting for ages and it's somehow or another alluded photography except for a

3772
03:35:36.771 --> 03:35:41.771
few really questionable photos and some really fucking shitty video that looks

3773
03:35:41.901 --> 03:35:45.710
fake as fuck.
Put all that aside.
Pull the hoaxes aside.

3774
03:35:45.711 --> 03:35:48.620
Do you think it's possible?
I think it's possible.
100% why do you think?

3775
03:35:48.650 --> 03:35:52.970
Cause I believe,
whoa.
Yeah.
I believe,
well I believe at lochness monster.

3776
03:35:53.300 --> 03:35:55.010
I believe in Tuba.
Calm.
You can fly.

3777
03:35:55.610 --> 03:35:58.220
<v 2>Do I believe I can fly?
Yeah.
Kelly pee on you.</v>

3778
03:35:58.221 --> 03:36:00.380
If you were a 14 year old girl and you didn't know why you were there in the

3779
03:36:00.381 --> 03:36:04.790
first place,
I definitely believe that I have the capability to fly in my body.

3780
03:36:04.791 --> 03:36:08.030
I just haven't figured it out and once we do tap into that,
we'll be able to fly.

3781
03:36:08.600 --> 03:36:13.190
But like Bill Hicks,
she used to say start on the ground floor.
Right.

3782
03:36:14.620 --> 03:36:19.340
Had a great joke about a young man who I'd asked it thought he could fly lept to

3783
03:36:19.341 --> 03:36:23.300
his death.
What a tragedy it goes.
What an idiot because he can fly.

3784
03:36:23.301 --> 03:36:26.840
Why did you start off from the ground go?
You feel like that?

3785
03:36:26.841 --> 03:36:30.410
I remember when Star Wars,
Star wars return of the Jedi came out.
No,
no,
no.

3786
03:36:30.411 --> 03:36:32.030
A empire strikes back came out.

3787
03:36:32.390 --> 03:36:36.190
I remember watching Luke move with his mind

3788
03:36:36.500 --> 03:36:40.300
<v 3>and I remember being in the back of my car trying to do that hard as fuck.</v>

3789
03:36:40.301 --> 03:36:41.350
Like staring at objects.

3790
03:36:41.410 --> 03:36:46.270
Go and like try to make sure it flies where dogs.
I was like,

3791
03:36:46.271 --> 03:36:47.860
that seems logical.

3792
03:36:48.130 --> 03:36:51.850
Well there's certain aspects of life that seems so preposterous.

3793
03:36:52.000 --> 03:36:54.790
Unrealistic electricity.
What the fuck is that?
It just hits you.

3794
03:36:54.850 --> 03:36:58.000
Have you seen those Tesla and like experiments where he's like touching

3795
03:36:58.001 --> 03:37:03.001
electricity and it was like a Bolton's flying big Tesla coil and is connected to

3796
03:37:03.011 --> 03:37:06.760
his arm.
Hold on.
Have you seen as photos?
Did Tesla just,

3797
03:37:07.220 --> 03:37:09.310
have you seen the new Tesla fucking car?

3798
03:37:09.730 --> 03:37:14.170
Did you see them all explode when hurricane sandy hit the beach in a,

3799
03:37:14.260 --> 03:37:18.640
in New Jersey?
What?
Yeah.
There was a whole warehouse that had like this.
Uh,

3800
03:37:18.850 --> 03:37:22.180
they were uh,
they had a dock and they had all these new uh,

3801
03:37:22.210 --> 03:37:25.730
Karmas that's what it was.
The Fisker Karma was the Tesla.

3802
03:37:25.820 --> 03:37:30.740
Oh that as well.
The grant.
It's looks gorgeous.
There's quite a few really?
Yeah.

3803
03:37:30.770 --> 03:37:32.450
<v 0>Beautiful Electric cars right now.</v>

3804
03:37:32.451 --> 03:37:37.160
But the Fisker Karma is the one and they have like 16 of them I think exploded

3805
03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:37.851
on the,

3806
03:37:37.851 --> 03:37:41.510
on the docs because they had them on the docks and the water came up on the

3807
03:37:41.511 --> 03:37:42.980
water,
hit these fucking

3808
03:37:43.350 --> 03:37:44.190
<v 3>electric cars.</v>

3809
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:49.550
They just [inaudible] just fucking blew up.

3810
03:37:50.190 --> 03:37:53.700
And everybody was like,
Oh okay.
Shit.
We,

3811
03:37:53.970 --> 03:37:56.110
I don't think they knew that would happen with Amazon.

3812
03:37:56.140 --> 03:37:59.850
You drive over fucking standing water.
What have you driving home from a flood?

3813
03:37:59.851 --> 03:38:04.290
Is Your fucking car explode?
Okay.
Cause I can deal with my car shorting out.

3814
03:38:04.620 --> 03:38:06.780
It's you sitting there scared.

3815
03:38:07.540 --> 03:38:12.300
If I can save like two bucks a gallon,
but my car explodes when I hit a puddle.

3816
03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:15.930
Is that going to happen?
Is that what the fuck is really going on?

3817
03:38:16.410 --> 03:38:19.140
That doesn't look that Tesla looks bad.
His Shit.

3818
03:38:19.460 --> 03:38:21.500
<v 0>We've one,
uh,
it was either murdered,</v>

3819
03:38:21.560 --> 03:38:24.980
murdered motor trend or road and track car of the year.

3820
03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:28.760
One of those big magazines made it the car,
the or the uh,
Tesla,

3821
03:38:28.761 --> 03:38:32.920
not the roadster but the larger car.
Something that something asks,

3822
03:38:32.930 --> 03:38:37.790
it's like a four door and uh,
apparently it's just a marvel of engineering,

3823
03:38:37.791 --> 03:38:38.624
but

3824
03:38:39.380 --> 03:38:42.680
<v 3>the real problem is going to be a row state taxes on roads.</v>

3825
03:38:43.010 --> 03:38:44.000
The roads are going to shit

3826
03:38:44.500 --> 03:38:45.333
<v 0>problems.</v>

3827
03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:48.730
Then another problem is the fact that everybody wants to pretend that buying

3828
03:38:48.731 --> 03:38:53.400
some sort of an electric car removes you from the fossil fuel food chain.
Yeah.

3829
03:38:53.500 --> 03:38:54.460
But it doesn't.
No.

3830
03:38:54.660 --> 03:38:58.360
And in fact it connects you with some even shady or minerals on like a really

3831
03:38:58.361 --> 03:39:01.600
large scale like lithium ion and all those different minerals.

3832
03:39:02.020 --> 03:39:03.820
A lot of those or conflict minerals,

3833
03:39:03.821 --> 03:39:07.630
they come from the Congo that come from Afghanistan.
They come from like,

3834
03:39:08.080 --> 03:39:11.400
if I was Brian Count,
I'd say I've got to Stan [inaudible].

3835
03:39:11.890 --> 03:39:16.330
If I was a amber Lyon,
I'd say,
uh,
was that she was fine

3836
03:39:16.690 --> 03:39:19.290
<v 3>brain please not in the bottom lane lane.</v>

3837
03:39:19.400 --> 03:39:22.250
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
the,
you know,
these,</v>

3838
03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:27.380
these minerals that you need to create a lithium ion battery.
By the way,

3839
03:39:27.381 --> 03:39:30.920
Matt Loves Brian Callan and mad love to Amber Lyon,
which is fucking with him

3840
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:34.130
<v 3>minerals that you need to batteries.
They come</v>

3841
03:39:34.130 --> 03:39:38.840
<v 0>from like really fucking imprisoned in poverished areas.
Their conflict minerals,</v>

3842
03:39:38.841 --> 03:39:41.240
lithium ion is officially liquor conflict mineral,

3843
03:39:41.510 --> 03:39:45.110
like a lot of shit that you need to even make cell phones if it's like,

3844
03:39:45.320 --> 03:39:48.670
I think the vice had a guide they had,
they did a,

3845
03:39:48.850 --> 03:39:52.630
a vice guide to travel episode where Shane Smith went to the Congo and they
were,

3846
03:39:52.700 --> 03:39:54.160
I don't know why they're not troubled channels.

3847
03:39:54.161 --> 03:39:56.780
One of them would love to see one of their fucking shows because it's too deep.

3848
03:39:57.080 --> 03:39:59.300
They go to the same shit.
Bordain does.
No,

3849
03:39:59.330 --> 03:40:04.330
they go way further than [inaudible] further,

3850
03:40:05.430 --> 03:40:07.550
they sent him in close.
It's not even close.

3851
03:40:07.760 --> 03:40:11.300
We're vice vice goes to the fucking Congo deep,
deep,

3852
03:40:11.301 --> 03:40:15.110
deep and talks to warlords.
Really?
Do they go looking for dinosaurs?

3853
03:40:15.410 --> 03:40:18.950
<v 2>Yeah,
I would,
I would,
I'd love to see that.
I could put that on.
Why not?</v>

3854
03:40:19.330 --> 03:40:22.660
We enjoy watching her on the Internet.
Why can't [inaudible] your correct.

3855
03:40:22.980 --> 03:40:26.310
<v 0>However,
most people that run these organizations,</v>

3856
03:40:26.311 --> 03:40:30.300
whether it's a network or you know,
you know,
cable or,

3857
03:40:30.330 --> 03:40:33.030
or whether it was broadcast television,
they,

3858
03:40:33.090 --> 03:40:35.670
they're very conservative because they're trying to sell advertising space.

3859
03:40:36.030 --> 03:40:39.450
So when a,
when a company like vice comes along and they have,

3860
03:40:39.510 --> 03:40:41.490
<v 2>and there were literally in there,</v>

3861
03:40:41.491 --> 03:40:45.360
they have no respect for any corporation at all because they'll do what the puck

3862
03:40:45.361 --> 03:40:48.990
they need to do to make what they think of videos where Hamilton Morris goes

3863
03:40:48.991 --> 03:40:53.130
into the jungle and he's taken Chris Drugs and a lie back.

3864
03:40:53.130 --> 03:40:57.510
<v 0>And you know,
I mean,
it's like they're not going to sell tide during those times.</v>

3865
03:40:57.511 --> 03:41:00.640
You know,
they're going to have to accept that they're not going sell time.

3866
03:41:01.020 --> 03:41:03.300
But they do see that's what's really stupid.

3867
03:41:03.301 --> 03:41:07.410
It's like there's this weird sort of game that we play.

3868
03:41:07.620 --> 03:41:12.090
Whereas we pretend that the people that see all the fucked up things that you

3869
03:41:12.091 --> 03:41:16.500
can find on the Internet are not the same people that wash our clothes.
Yeah.

3870
03:41:16.520 --> 03:41:20.860
That washed their clothes or wash my clothes by gas or you know,

3871
03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:24.930
any of the variables and the things where we try to target people.
We're all,

3872
03:41:24.931 --> 03:41:26.850
we're all the same fucking people,
man.
The [inaudible],

3873
03:41:27.420 --> 03:41:31.050
we just have access to different shit now.
We need to accept that.

3874
03:41:31.080 --> 03:41:34.500
You need to just stop pretending that we're living in some sort of a Catholic

3875
03:41:34.501 --> 03:41:35.850
school.
You know,

3876
03:41:36.180 --> 03:41:40.800
Sandra Bullock movie view of the world.
But it's not,

3877
03:41:40.860 --> 03:41:41.910
that's not reality.

3878
03:41:41.940 --> 03:41:45.780
Reality is there's a lot of fucked up shit about out there and I can find it
now.

3879
03:41:45.810 --> 03:41:47.910
I can find it on the Internet.
It's really easy.

3880
03:41:48.030 --> 03:41:51.600
So you need to sort of adjust your expectations accordingly because there's a

3881
03:41:51.601 --> 03:41:53.820
lot of evidence,
a lot of evidence that shows that reality.

3882
03:41:53.821 --> 03:41:57.060
It's pretty fucking slippery.
Yeah.
There's a lot of nutty shit out there,

3883
03:41:57.470 --> 03:42:00.090
but that tells the car looks bad is fuck yeah,

3884
03:42:00.420 --> 03:42:04.650
but it will explode if he hit a puddle.
What a horrible feeling.

3885
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:08.910
They look dope.
I liked the,
uh,
that's the four 26 at one that Brian just put up.

3886
03:42:09.070 --> 03:42:13.830
I see.
Uh,
the new corvette convertible that's got a 505 horsepower,

3887
03:42:14.370 --> 03:42:18.810
the last,
um,
version of this,
uh,
this engine,
I think it's called the ls one,

3888
03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:21.000
but it's a,
might be wrong,

3889
03:42:21.180 --> 03:42:26.180
but it's a huge fucking power and torque that's also in the [inaudible] the same

3890
03:42:26.491 --> 03:42:30.690
engine.
They supercharge it and the Zr one,
it produces 648 horsepower.

3891
03:42:31.130 --> 03:42:32.190
Like this is like

3892
03:42:32.370 --> 03:42:34.680
<v 1>for people who like talk about like muscle cars.</v>

3893
03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:39.180
This is like the greatest era of a muscle cars in the history of the fucking

3894
03:42:39.181 --> 03:42:41.100
world.
No one.
Yeah.

3895
03:42:41.101 --> 03:42:45.270
The muscle cars that people are creating now actually can take turns and they

3896
03:42:45.271 --> 03:42:46.620
actually have good brakes.

3897
03:42:46.830 --> 03:42:50.310
Like there's a Shelby Mustang they have now that's unbelievable.
The regular,

3898
03:42:50.311 --> 03:42:54.330
but they have the three Oh two boss Mustang that's like,
you know,
it's like,

3899
03:42:54.331 --> 03:42:59.280
they're like moderately powered.
It has 440 fucking horsepower.

3900
03:42:59.550 --> 03:43:01.050
It's unbelievably powerful.

3901
03:43:01.050 --> 03:43:04.800
<v 4>Well,
what's the,
is it the Dodge Dodge Challenger challenger?
Yeah.</v>

3902
03:43:06.030 --> 03:43:10.020
We went to muscle car though.
Then we went to drive,
um,

3903
03:43:10.440 --> 03:43:11.273
uh,

3904
03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:16.460
Lamborghini's and Ferrari's and Porsche's on a track for trip flip.

3905
03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:19.920
And the dude's just wanted to drive the dodge challenger.

3906
03:43:20.460 --> 03:43:23.130
They would take you out for a ride and they were like,

3907
03:43:23.160 --> 03:43:26.670
this is more fun for us to drive.
Why is that?
I have no fucking idea.

3908
03:43:26.671 --> 03:43:30.630
But they did everything.
They do the,
the,
the burnouts where they spin in circles.

3909
03:43:31.260 --> 03:43:34.440
It's just more fun.
Like those things.
I,
you know,
I think like,

3910
03:43:34.441 --> 03:43:37.740
I definitely have driven a ton of those,
uh,
Lamborghini type cars.

3911
03:43:37.920 --> 03:43:41.730
Those things are fun as fuck,
but it is a different drive than like,

3912
03:43:41.940 --> 03:43:45.810
it is really,
you don't feel as loose maybe as you do as a doll.

3913
03:43:45.811 --> 03:43:47.610
It's challenger like,
and it does challenge you.

3914
03:43:47.611 --> 03:43:51.870
You're fucking sliding and your if it's feeling it.
Yeah.
Well they have a,

3915
03:43:51.960 --> 03:43:55.400
<v 1>they,
they have a broad sort of a um,
uh,</v>

3916
03:43:55.450 --> 03:44:00.330
you could pick from like a lower horsepower engine to like a really ridiculous

3917
03:44:00.331 --> 03:44:01.510
engine.
Those things.
Yeah.

3918
03:44:01.860 --> 03:44:05.160
You could like ramp it up and there's a lot of people take those cars and they

3919
03:44:05.161 --> 03:44:08.410
ramped them up even more.
Like the Hennessy Hennessy makes like a 700 [inaudible]

3920
03:44:08.440 --> 03:44:11.880
<v 4>horsepower to love windows.
I love when you get like those special edition cars.</v>

3921
03:44:11.881 --> 03:44:12.440
Yeah,

3922
03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:16.920
<v 1>possible what they are though.
Like the muscle cars of old,
those things.</v>

3923
03:44:16.921 --> 03:44:19.590
You couldn't take corners in them like this.

3924
03:44:19.591 --> 03:44:21.540
These are completely different animals.

3925
03:44:21.541 --> 03:44:24.720
But the challenger is still like a muscle car.

3926
03:44:24.900 --> 03:44:29.900
Whereas like the Camaro has become almost like a sports car because they handle

3927
03:44:30.001 --> 03:44:30.600
so well.

3928
03:44:30.600 --> 03:44:31.051
<v 4>It might've been,</v>

3929
03:44:31.051 --> 03:44:33.810
it might've been a Camaro they were driving now that I'm thinking about it,

3930
03:44:33.811 --> 03:44:37.080
but like we were taking corners in the lamb,
Lamborghini,

3931
03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:41.160
I like 90 miles an hour taking corners fucking and say,
yeah,

3932
03:44:41.161 --> 03:44:43.350
you can do ridiculous shit with sports cars.
I drove,

3933
03:44:43.351 --> 03:44:48.351
I flew to Italy for a day to drive a Ferrari down the coast.

3934
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:51.720
Yeah.
Like I had to fly to drive a fly.
I think I texted you about it.
Yeah.

3935
03:44:51.721 --> 03:44:54.930
Which one did you drive?
Uh,
I have no fucking clue,
but it was,

3936
03:44:54.960 --> 03:44:57.480
I just drove down the coast and I had to chase car in front of me and tests car

3937
03:44:57.481 --> 03:45:02.310
behind me.
They just taped it and I just fucking Fillioux.
It was so much fun.

3938
03:45:02.460 --> 03:45:06.600
Like those paddle blah blah blah blah.
Just finalizing.
Yeah,
those paddle shifts.

3939
03:45:06.600 --> 03:45:08.700
<v 1>There's a lot of people are upset about that shit though.</v>

3940
03:45:09.180 --> 03:45:11.160
A lot of people think that a real sports car,

3941
03:45:11.161 --> 03:45:14.460
you should shift it manually and that just because it's quicker to shifted with

3942
03:45:14.461 --> 03:45:17.070
the paddles,
like you're missing out on part of the experience

3943
03:45:17.580 --> 03:45:22.490
<v 4>kind of agreement because I like shifting my own gears.
I just too fun about it.</v>

3944
03:45:22.520 --> 03:45:22.881
I do too,

3945
03:45:22.881 --> 03:45:25.220
but there's so many people that probably have never learned how to do that.

3946
03:45:25.221 --> 03:45:29.290
They can't learn on a Ferrari and I'm sure it's just a sales thing because the

3947
03:45:29.291 --> 03:45:29.980
paddle shifters are

3948
03:45:29.980 --> 03:45:34.840
<v 0>much easier.
Yeah.
Um,
way,
ways here,
but it's not as satisfying.
It's not,</v>

3949
03:45:35.020 --> 03:45:36.880
it's not that it's hard to shift your own gears,

3950
03:45:36.881 --> 03:45:41.470
but there's something that's like mechanically engaging about putting a clutch

3951
03:45:41.471 --> 03:45:45.940
in slide in the shifter for letting the clutch out,
he and the gas the same time.

3952
03:45:46.030 --> 03:45:46.990
There's something super sexy.

3953
03:45:46.991 --> 03:45:51.290
When you met a girl that knew how to drive a stick and you were like,
yeah,
like,

3954
03:45:51.340 --> 03:45:53.260
yeah,
you got it.
You're a good dad.

3955
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:56.320
Especially if it was like a fucking Mustang or something crazy.

3956
03:45:56.321 --> 03:46:00.510
This dirty pitches of it driving a big fat VA,
boom,
Whoa,

3957
03:46:00.780 --> 03:46:05.560
whoa.
She wants to drive.
When you go to the movies and you got to say no,

3958
03:46:05.740 --> 03:46:08.230
and you've got to not let her be on top of the first time we fuck either.

3959
03:46:08.231 --> 03:46:12.490
It's very important and establish dominance immediately.
Bert Kreischer,

3960
03:46:12.960 --> 03:46:16.870
you've got to grab that bitch and let her know the feeling of gravity and the

3961
03:46:16.871 --> 03:46:19.770
density of the bones in your hips.
You know what I'm saying?

3962
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:22.520
<v 4>Brian?
Hollaback.</v>

3963
03:46:23.250 --> 03:46:25.050
<v 6>Ooh,</v>

3964
03:46:25.420 --> 03:46:28.270
<v 4>so Bert Kreischer,
how much time you spend on the road?</v>

3965
03:46:28.271 --> 03:46:31.600
Lately I'm fucking Dick load.
I bought on the road every week.

3966
03:46:31.750 --> 03:46:34.450
I feel like I'm home two days this week.
I'm going to take a leak.

3967
03:46:34.451 --> 03:46:35.440
Talk to Brian about it.
Okay.

3968
03:46:36.250 --> 03:46:37.083
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3969
03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:39.930
<v 4>This is in the podcast.
It's been four hours.</v>

3970
03:46:41.810 --> 03:46:45.300
Five minutes by Brian.
I'll tell you a story.
All right.
Tell me a story,
sweetie.

3971
03:46:45.450 --> 03:46:49.860
Okay.
Um,
do you wanna hear the story that I had?

3972
03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:54.800
Uh,
gonna make it.
Oh,
okay.
I'll tell you a good story.
Story,
story.

3973
03:46:56.370 --> 03:47:00.540
And this is the reason no one would listen to the Brian and Bert podcasts

3974
03:47:02.430 --> 03:47:06.930
because I find you funny too often.
Oh,
thank you.

3975
03:47:07.170 --> 03:47:09.990
I find you funny all the time.
No,
no.
But we like,

3976
03:47:10.020 --> 03:47:13.950
like I listened to the podcast and when I hear you say things that fucking fit

3977
03:47:13.951 --> 03:47:16.920
maybe stopped Joe or like dice,
like you said,

3978
03:47:16.921 --> 03:47:19.950
like two or three things that made me laugh so hard during the dice podcast.

3979
03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:22.830
I'm smoking in the studio right now.
Like a bad boy.

3980
03:47:23.280 --> 03:47:26.880
What's in that room right there?
That's a,
behind me is just an empty room.

3981
03:47:26.880 --> 03:47:30.610
There's a lot of empty rooms here at the studio,
so I'll tell you this story.

3982
03:47:30.611 --> 03:47:34.320
Okay,
Brian.
All right.
Um,
so I checked into,

3983
03:47:34.590 --> 03:47:39.300
I did Columbus and then I did right after that I did at Kentucky,

3984
03:47:39.420 --> 03:47:42.140
right.
Checked into the Kentucky Hotel.
Uh,

3985
03:47:42.150 --> 03:47:45.060
the hotel in Kentucky and I have four backs.
I've shirts,

3986
03:47:45.061 --> 03:47:49.590
I've shirts for two weeks.
So I four bags a bellman takes my bags,
take some,

3987
03:47:49.890 --> 03:47:52.500
I have to take it,
let him take it in my rooms.
You know,
he's going to get a tip.

3988
03:47:52.880 --> 03:47:54.810
We go on the elevator,
he asks what I do.
I said,
I'm a comic.

3989
03:47:55.830 --> 03:48:00.060
We get out and second our door opens,
another door opens and it's a,
uh,

3990
03:48:00.210 --> 03:48:04.020
it's a older white dude and he walks out like three steps mindless and he

3991
03:48:04.021 --> 03:48:06.270
follows me down the hallway,
three steps behind us,
all the way,

3992
03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:09.420
all the way until we get to the end of the room,
the hall where my door is.

3993
03:48:09.420 --> 03:48:10.560
And I'm like,
is he going to my room?

3994
03:48:10.740 --> 03:48:12.540
It turns out he's in the room directly next to mine.

3995
03:48:12.541 --> 03:48:15.660
So as he goes to open the door and like,
like put his key in,

3996
03:48:15.690 --> 03:48:20.340
I jokingly in front of this bellman thinking,
he laugh.
I go,
hey man,
if you want,

3997
03:48:20.341 --> 03:48:22.710
we can open up that center door and hang out all weekend.

3998
03:48:23.280 --> 03:48:26.340
And the guy now is like nervous and not in these trying to get his key.

3999
03:48:26.350 --> 03:48:29.870
And he's like,
no,
I don't.
I don't want to do that.
And I go,
well,
it could be cool.

4000
03:48:29.871 --> 03:48:31.190
We'd like get to know each other.
Yes.

4001
03:48:31.520 --> 03:48:34.820
<v 2>I said this to this guy just fucking around him to kiss you or something.</v>

4002
03:48:34.821 --> 03:48:37.700
Just fucking ready.
Ever even bring that up.
I'm just fucking around.

4003
03:48:37.970 --> 03:48:42.700
Just fucking around as a comic.
Should do.
All right,
but what did he said?
Yes.
Uh,

4004
03:48:43.060 --> 03:48:47.170
<v 4>I don't think you will.
He's an older man,
but what if he did?
He's an older man.</v>

4005
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:51.430
No,
no.
Listen,
I'll tell you.
Let me tell you.
Let me,
I'll tell you the story.

4006
03:48:51.770 --> 03:48:56.290
So I get,
I,
I checked into the Kentucky and I go to do the Kentucky and proper,

4007
03:48:56.430 --> 03:48:57.610
uh,
whatever it in Louisville,

4008
03:48:58.420 --> 03:49:01.300
and I have four bags with me and the bellman takes my bags up the elevator for

4009
03:49:01.301 --> 03:49:05.350
me and I've got on them.
No,
it's not at all.
It's really,

4010
03:49:05.351 --> 03:49:08.240
it's one of the funnier things I've done in the winter.
Music to the back of it.

4011
03:49:08.250 --> 03:49:12.020
Yeah.
A it up with this.
This is a strong enough story to close the podcast.

4012
03:49:12.310 --> 03:49:16.210
Might be,
you might pull up roadkill,
ghost choir,

4013
03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:20.270
<v 1>beggars guild,
and we're going to play that in the background.
Come on sweetie.</v>

4014
03:49:20.271 --> 03:49:23.330
Let me design this thing.
I know what I'm doing.
Trust me.

4015
03:49:23.360 --> 03:49:26.990
<v 4>Oh,
did you pull up Miss d?
You can't kiss me.</v>

4016
03:49:27.220 --> 03:49:30.560
You got to stop that.
You know we're playing that out.

4017
03:49:30.620 --> 03:49:35.330
We already did that today with Brad Pitt.
Steven doorways,
the roadkill

4018
03:49:35.420 --> 03:49:38.730
<v 1>ghost choir and the song is beggars guild.</v>

4019
03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:42.340
We need to get a desk,
quad iTunes account.
Don't worry.

4020
03:49:43.320 --> 03:49:46.850
You just order things online.
You know we need real internet.
Hi.

4021
03:49:47.080 --> 03:49:50.220
<v 2>Hi.
Hi.
Hi Real Internet.
Hang out.
Death Squad.</v>

4022
03:49:50.520 --> 03:49:52.500
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay,
we'll do it.
We can do one this week though.</v>

4023
03:49:53.010 --> 03:49:56.310
We want to do Fridays then we could do Fridays.
There were Callan Fridays.
Yeah,

4024
03:49:56.420 --> 03:50:01.320
cause I have the ice house.
Okay.
Beautiful.
All right.
Now Bert Kreischer.

4025
03:50:01.321 --> 03:50:04.530
What were you trying to tell us?
To Christ?
Who are you telling me,
buddy?

4026
03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:06.593
What were you telling me?

4027
03:50:07.250 --> 03:50:11.960
<v 2>You're in Columbus,
Ohio.
Fuck.</v>

4028
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:16.790
Neck,
neck.

4029
03:50:16.940 --> 03:50:21.560
I just invented it so I never heard it myself.
Probably the wrong song for this,

4030
03:50:21.561 --> 03:50:22.820
but it's a perfect time.

4031
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:26.090
<v 1>So tell me what happened.
A little,
a little volume please.</v>

4032
03:50:26.250 --> 03:50:27.083
<v 4>Yeah,
a little more volume.</v>

4033
03:50:27.900 --> 03:50:32.430
So I check into the Kentucky Improv and a black dude checks in my bags.

4034
03:50:32.431 --> 03:50:35.460
He grabs her bags,
puts him on the trail trailer thing,
brings me to the elevator.

4035
03:50:35.461 --> 03:50:38.280
I gotta let him take it to the room.
He's earned his tip,
right?
Right,
right.

4036
03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:42.360
So we take them up to my room.
He says,
what do you do?
I said,
I'm a comedian.

4037
03:50:42.720 --> 03:50:47.690
He goes,
okay.
And we don't talk.
After that door's open,
take an elevator door,

4038
03:50:47.710 --> 03:50:51.330
open the doors next to us in the elevator next to us to open and an older white

4039
03:50:51.331 --> 03:50:56.100
dude walks out and follows us.
Any ghosts?
US down like the whole hallway.

4040
03:50:56.130 --> 03:50:57.570
Everywhere we go,
he follows us.

4041
03:50:57.571 --> 03:51:00.630
He's going wherever the fuck we're going to get all the way down on the end of

4042
03:51:00.631 --> 03:51:04.680
the hallway.
How far away is he walking behind?
Three feet behind us.

4043
03:51:04.681 --> 03:51:07.950
The whole time we smack them on the fucker unconscious.
It's awkward.

4044
03:51:07.980 --> 03:51:11.310
It's awkward,
and we're both know.
Didn't confront him.
You were all noticing it.

4045
03:51:11.580 --> 03:51:13.950
So we get to the last door and I'm thinking,
is this guy going to my room?

4046
03:51:13.980 --> 03:51:18.340
I would assume that guy's trying to do something bad kids on this.

4047
03:51:18.440 --> 03:51:21.660
Something really wrong going on.
But I would think no.
What would you do?

4048
03:51:21.661 --> 03:51:24.560
Overdo it.
What would the last thing you would do,
Joe?
Listen.
The point.

4049
03:51:24.570 --> 03:51:25.980
Here's what,
first of

4050
03:51:25.980 --> 03:51:28.830
<v 0>all,
when someone is mirroring you like that three,</v>

4051
03:51:28.831 --> 03:51:31.260
there'd being very disrespectful because they're not,

4052
03:51:31.290 --> 03:51:33.720
they're not just not just following you,

4053
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:37.350
they're letting you know they're following you and they're doing it in a very

4054
03:51:37.351 --> 03:51:41.210
arrogant way,
or they're being flirty.
Well,
they could be.
That's what happened.

4055
03:51:41.220 --> 03:51:45.300
Be psychotics.
Here's what happens.
What would you do?
Meet up immediately.

4056
03:51:45.301 --> 03:51:47.670
I would ask them what the is going on.
Watch what he does.

4057
03:51:49.310 --> 03:51:51.620
<v 4>It turns out he's in the room next to me.</v>

4058
03:51:52.700 --> 03:51:56.810
So he was going to his room.
So as he goes,
well,

4059
03:51:56.830 --> 03:52:01.610
you lost that was drunk.
Oh,
see you're paranoid.
Nobody was thinking about it.

4060
03:52:01.700 --> 03:52:06.070
We scared about life.
I have a lot.
I was thinking about black,

4061
03:52:06.080 --> 03:52:10.730
I knew I was a comic and I wanted him to news know that I knew Kevin Hart cause

4062
03:52:10.731 --> 03:52:14.090
that's what I thought he was going to save you.
No,
no.
Hold on.
And so the guy,

4063
03:52:14.380 --> 03:52:18.200
the old guy goes to open his door and I jokingly now told the black,

4064
03:52:18.230 --> 03:52:19.850
I'm a comic but I haven't done anything funny.

4065
03:52:19.851 --> 03:52:23.180
So I jokingly look at the old guy and I go,
hey,
if you want,

4066
03:52:23.181 --> 03:52:25.550
we can open up that connecting door and we can hang out all weekend.

4067
03:52:27.120 --> 03:52:30.450
<v 8>So wait,
it gets better.</v>

4068
03:52:30.451 --> 03:52:32.660
It gets better price to the guys name

4069
03:52:32.770 --> 03:52:36.050
<v 2>can't get his,
cause he's known,
panicked him and he can't get his door open.</v>

4070
03:52:36.051 --> 03:52:39.080
And he goes,
no,
no,
I don't want that happen.
And I go,
no,
it'd be cool man.

4071
03:52:39.081 --> 03:52:39.801
We'll open it up.

4072
03:52:39.801 --> 03:52:43.130
We'll hang out with like the darkness and just talk to each other at night.

4073
03:52:43.160 --> 03:52:46.760
And he can't get his door open and finally gets his door open and he goes,

4074
03:52:46.761 --> 03:52:49.520
I don't want that to happen.
The door opens and before we can close it,

4075
03:52:49.521 --> 03:52:53.390
I stick my head in and I go,
hey man,
if you change your mind,

4076
03:52:53.810 --> 03:52:55.400
knock and scratch.

4077
03:52:55.460 --> 03:52:59.090
<v 0>Sure.
So he goes down,</v>

4078
03:52:59.180 --> 03:53:01.390
<v 2>no,
and he shuts the door and he's fucking panicked.</v>

4079
03:53:01.391 --> 03:53:05.020
And I looked to the black guy,
the black guy is gone.
He's in my room.
Okay.

4080
03:53:05.140 --> 03:53:06.940
So I go,
fuck.
I did that joke for nothing.

4081
03:53:06.941 --> 03:53:11.140
So I go into the room and the black guys putting the bags down and he gets done

4082
03:53:11.141 --> 03:53:14.200
all the bags and I go to take,
you might want to get ready to cue the music.

4083
03:53:14.201 --> 03:53:17.950
Brian,
he,
I go to give them a tip and the black guy looks at me and shakes

4084
03:53:17.960 --> 03:53:20.210
<v 4>does that.
And he goes,
no.
I said,
well,
I gotta give you a tip.</v>

4085
03:53:20.211 --> 03:53:23.780
Maybe took my bags up here.
He,
no,
just knocking scratch.

4086
03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:28.210
<v 2>So I look at the black guy,
go,
okay.</v>

4087
03:53:28.270 --> 03:53:31.810
So I knock and I scratch the guy to the route goes

4088
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:38.040
<v 7>apart laughing.
He's on the ground.</v>

4089
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:42.810
<v 0>Like,
so the guy in an extra room called downstairs and,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,</v>

4090
03:53:42.930 --> 03:53:43.830
<v 2>no.
The Black Guy,</v>

4091
03:53:43.831 --> 03:53:47.850
the guy who I told the joke for in the first place heard the whole thing and he

4092
03:53:47.851 --> 03:53:50.310
goes,
no man,
don't do it.
You got knock on scratch.

4093
03:53:50.760 --> 03:53:52.770
So I knocked and scratched and the fucking guys,

4094
03:53:52.920 --> 03:53:54.130
<v 7>I don't want to hang out,
man.</v>

4095
03:53:54.270 --> 03:53:56.880
<v 0>Bert Kreischer that's rude.
Oh,
it was fucking the funniest.</v>

4096
03:53:56.890 --> 03:53:59.640
Getting better die with a lot of insecurity in your fucking with his head.

4097
03:53:59.641 --> 03:54:03.120
Funniest thing I've ever done.

4098
03:54:03.280 --> 03:54:06.830
He's so bad for that poor dude scare to Dickson his ass so bad the whole

4099
03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:09.200
<v 4>weekend.
I kept talking loud as fuck in my room.
Just going.</v>

4100
03:54:09.560 --> 03:54:13.040
I know he's listening to me.
Why don't you just knock on the door and say,

4101
03:54:13.041 --> 03:54:16.210
hey man,
I'm a comedian.
I'm really sorry it was,
it was past that.

4102
03:54:16.340 --> 03:54:20.510
It was past that.
It's past that.
