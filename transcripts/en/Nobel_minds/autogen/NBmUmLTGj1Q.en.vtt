goes that when you got the news about

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950
goes that when you got the news about
 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.000

this award is that it increases the

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130
this award is that it increases the
 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.130
this award is that it increases the
number of stories that people make up

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140

bit but I and when I'm in Sweden I try

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460
bit but I and when I'm in Sweden I try
 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.790
bit but I and when I'm in Sweden I try
to convert it to Swedish with sometimes

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800
to convert it to Swedish with sometimes
 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.980

it was barely mentioned but I did

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
it was barely mentioned but I did

composed roughly speaking of three

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409
composed roughly speaking of three
 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.640
composed roughly speaking of three
quarks each and that the quarks were the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
quarks each and that the quarks were the
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.430
quarks each and that the quarks were the
fundamental entities they're analogous

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440

had first as a sound quark it might have

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819
had first as a sound quark it might have
 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.289
had first as a sound quark it might have
been spelled k wo RK for example but

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299
been spelled k wo RK for example but
 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.479
been spelled k wo RK for example but
then I thought it was the right sound

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489
then I thought it was the right sound
 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.670
then I thought it was the right sound
for the fundamental constituents of

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
for the fundamental constituents of
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.740

quark but then I discovered the word

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540

thought well perhaps I can use the
 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.740
thought well perhaps I can use the
spelling there quar k so there it is

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750
spelling there quar k so there it is

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:45.530
yes very much in trying to preserve the
 

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.900
yes very much in trying to preserve the
heritage of biological diversity I'm

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:50.910
heritage of biological diversity I'm
 

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.430
heritage of biological diversity I'm
also somewhat interested in the

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440
also somewhat interested in the
 

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.720
also somewhat interested in the
preservation of cultural diversity

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:53.730
preservation of cultural diversity
 

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.280
preservation of cultural diversity
although that involves a great many more

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:57.290
although that involves a great many more
 

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:02.450
although that involves a great many more
paradoxes and contradictions but I've

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:02.460
paradoxes and contradictions but I've
 

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.480
paradoxes and contradictions but I've
worked hard on trying to help with the

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:05.490
worked hard on trying to help with the
 

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.390
worked hard on trying to help with the
preservation of a biological diversity

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:08.400
preservation of a biological diversity
 

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.170
preservation of a biological diversity
around the world and of course on land

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:11.180
around the world and of course on land
 

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.870
around the world and of course on land
the greatest diversity is found in the

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880
the greatest diversity is found in the
 

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.840
the greatest diversity is found in the
tropics and also the tropics are full of

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:17.850
tropics and also the tropics are full of
 

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.230
tropics and also the tropics are full of
poor and in many cases overpopulated

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240
poor and in many cases overpopulated
 

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.330
poor and in many cases overpopulated
countries so these are the main

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:23.340
countries so these are the main
 

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.300
countries so these are the main
obstacles so the but what is most

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.310
obstacles so the but what is most
 

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.300
obstacles so the but what is most
important to preserve is the tropics at

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:29.310
important to preserve is the tropics at
 

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.510
important to preserve is the tropics at
least on land and also the dangers are

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:32.520
least on land and also the dangers are
 

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.670
least on land and also the dangers are
greatest in the tropics so a lot of our

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680
greatest in the tropics so a lot of our
 

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.400
greatest in the tropics so a lot of our
work has concentrated on the tropics

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:37.410
work has concentrated on the tropics
 

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.210
work has concentrated on the tropics

so interested in ornithology oh yes and

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920
so interested in ornithology oh yes and
 

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.490
so interested in ornithology oh yes and
it was a very great field ornithologist

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500
it was a very great field ornithologist
 

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.060

the rapid assessment program it was then

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360
the rapid assessment program it was then
 

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.590

quite useful in nature conservation the

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600
quite useful in nature conservation the
 

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.060
quite useful in nature conservation the
idea is if a certain tract of land is

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.070
idea is if a certain tract of land is
 

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.400
idea is if a certain tract of land is
considered for possible preservation as

a national park or whatever how to

a national park or whatever how to
 

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.360
a national park or whatever how to
evaluate the diversity that's present

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:30.370
evaluate the diversity that's present
 

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.780
evaluate the diversity that's present
and the quality of the of the

environment to what extent is is this a
 

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.640

old fashioned way of course of looking
 

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.530
old fashioned way of course of looking
at an area was to have skilled botanists

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:49.540
at an area was to have skilled botanists
 

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.930
at an area was to have skilled botanists
and skilled zoologists of various kinds

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:51.940
and skilled zoologists of various kinds
 

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.130

trouble is by the time you do that the
 

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.840
trouble is by the time you do that the
area may not exist anymore so what we

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:06.850
area may not exist anymore so what we
 

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.110

did was to champion the notion of having

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.020

yes for a long time nobody could believe

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:05.080
yes for a long time nobody could believe
 

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.180
yes for a long time nobody could believe
that there was a peacock in africa and

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:08.190
that there was a peacock in africa and
 

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.680
that there was a peacock in africa and
nobody has seen it no outsider no you

would be wonderful to see one in the

would be wonderful to see one in the
wild all right I hope you will find it

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:30.740
wild all right I hope you will find it
 

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.450
wild all right I hope you will find it
thank you thank you very much for taking
