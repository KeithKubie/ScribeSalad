00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.370
We've got one more segue
option to explore.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.550
There's a third way to present a view
controller using only a storyboard

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.350
segue, no code.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.520
But don't worry.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.260
I haven't forgotten that we still
need to figure out how these

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.650
two view controllers should communicate.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.710
We'll get those dice values set,
I promise.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.988
We're going to take this segue that
we added earlier and delete it.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:24.690
And we'll replace it with a segue that
goes directly from the roll the dice

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.260
button to the dice view controller.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.110
We also need to remove the action
from this roll the dice button.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.759
The action that's connected
to touch up inside, that is.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.230
And finally, let's close our
outline view for a second.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.080
Open up the utilities pane,
click on that segue, and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.090
go into the attributes inspector.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.985
That's where we'll set the storyboard
identifier for this segue.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:51.315
And we're going to call it rollDice.

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:54.015
And now we'll run it.

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:59.495
Our view is appearing as expected,
but still no dice.

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:02.415
I think it's time to get these two view
controllers talking to each other.
