1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,210
Being a citizen of the European Union
means that many aspects of our lives are

2
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:07,980
regulated by a weird entity.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,260
It feels like a huge bureaucracy
is making decisions over our heads.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,390
Many Europeans think that their vote
in the EU elections doesn't count than

5
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:23,130
that. The EU is not democratic.
How Democratic is the EU,

6
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,940
really?

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,500
And does your vote actually achieve
anything in democratic states?

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,290
Public policies are based
on the will of the people,

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,260
but the people are not a coherent thing.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,940
Countless different groups are battling
for influence and power to establish

11
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,690
laws and rules that benefit
them. In a working democracy.

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,410
There are checks and balances that are
supposed to create a fair environment

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,330
where these battles can be fought,

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,530
term limits and stopped factions
from dominating too much.

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,530
But all of this ends at our borders.

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,450
International politics are
not democratic, but anoxic.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,460
No central authority is powerful enough
to ensure fairness or enforced laws.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,450
So the only law is the tyranny
of the strongest and anarchy.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,210
So for most of human history,

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,760
powerful countries took what
they wanted from others,

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,370
either by extortion or by violence.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,220
After World War Two the United Nations
were founded to overcome this anarchy by

23
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:25,800
establishing rules on how
countries should behave.

24
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,780
But since the UN has virtually no power
and its members often have opposing

25
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,450
interests, it's usually politely ignored.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,130
The EU is a construct that tries to have
rules and laws for its member nations

27
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,300
that are actually enforceable as the
European Court of Justice is able to make

28
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,410
binding decisions.

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,050
Originally the EU was founded to ensure
peace between European nations and

30
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,520
prosperity for the continent,

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,330
but it's also an attempt to gain
international power for its members.

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,060
It's like a superstate and it's striving
to be democratic and legitimized by all

33
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,280
of its citizens. To do that,

34
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,180
it has to solve the problem of different
actors wanting different things.

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,260
Only that its members are countries
with very different priorities.

36
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,510
So how does this work?

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,700
Since the EU is ridiculously complex
and politicians are even worse than

38
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,780
scientists at naming,

39
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:22,890
things will simplify massively
and omit a lot of details.

40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,080
You can find further reading
and explanations in our
sources document. Okay.

41
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,040
If you want to create a Democratic
Union of independent nations,

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,620
you have two options. One,

43
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,090
let everybody vote for
national politicians who
then make decisions for the

44
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:44,091
union together or to let every citizen
vote directly for an independent

45
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,700
institution that's able
to make binding decisions.

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,530
Both approaches have their upsides and
downsides and the EU ended up with a mix

47
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,740
of both of them. Next to the
European Court of Justice,

48
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,830
there are four main institutions
that we'll talk about today,

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,030
the European Council,

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,390
which is made up of the
heads of government or states
of the member countries,

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,350
the council of the EU with
ministers from the member countries.

52
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,850
The third one is the European Commission,
which is the de facto of government,

53
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,940
the EU having one commissioner
for each member state,

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,850
and lastly the European part of it.

55
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,870
The parliament is the only part of the
EU that is directly elected by you to

56
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,580
citizen in the European
elections. In principle,

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,230
all of these institutions of
the EU originate from your
direct or indirect vote,

58
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,460
be it at the national or EU level,
but some do more than others.

59
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,960
For example,

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,710
you vote for your national representative
and therefore contribute to form a

61
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:45,760
national government who's head of state
has a seat in the European Council.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,240
These leaders choose the president
of the EU Commission and its fellow

63
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,600
commissioners who eventually are
confirmed by the EU parliament.

64
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,670
So this is a sort of indirect democracy.
You didn't vote for the commission,

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,990
but you voted for the people who appointed
them and for those who confirmed and

66
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,150
police them. So in effect,

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,360
2.5 of the four main European Union
institutions depend on the member state

68
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,624
governments,

69
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,280
but since you as a citizen can only
directly vote for the European Parliament,

70
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,190
the question is how powerful is it?

71
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,830
How much influence does your vote have?

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,210
The European Parliament started
out with very little influence,

73
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,830
but has become more and more powerful
over the past two decades or today.

74
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:33,610
It has to approve new laws, which can
be binding for the member countries.

75
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,490
It also votes on how the EU budget is
spent and on international treaties.

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,290
All of this makes the parliament
very powerful and thus your vote very

77
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,124
influential.

78
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,510
Even on an international level
compared to national parliaments,

79
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,570
one major power is still missing though
the EU parliament officially can't

80
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,420
propose new laws on its own, which
is often the core of the argument.

81
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:02,410
The EU is not democratic enough and that
the European Parliament should be given

82
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,244
more influence.

83
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,650
Right now the member states governments
pretty much control the European Union

84
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,210
giving the parliament more power would
make the EU as a whole more democratic,

85
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,000
but it would also take
power from member states.

86
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,520
It's not clear which approach is better.

87
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,070
Ultimately it's for the member states and
us as citizens to decide how the union

88
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,260
should develop. Okay,

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,860
so can we draw a
conclusion here as a whole?

90
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,520
The EU is not as democratic
as most of its member states,

91
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,440
but it is democratic.

92
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,760
If you don't like decisions they
make regarding copyright for example,

93
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,480
you can look up what your representatives
voted for and vote them out.

94
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,270
The struggle to make it more democratic
is closely tied to who holds power over

95
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:52,060
what the EU keeps changing.

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,840
You dare citizen an not only
voting on the current politics,

97
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,640
but also on what system will
look like in the future.

98
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,110
There are many parties and politicians
that vow to make the EU parliament and

99
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,760
therefore your vote stronger.

100
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,390
Many others want to keep it
as it is or even diminish it.

101
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,620
It's for you to decide what you think
is better for the future of the union.

102
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,390
Currently,

103
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:19,070
it's equally important for the EU who you
vote for at home because these are the

104
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,460
people who have the most influence
in the European Union right now.

105
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,410
Opinion at home is also where the
EU is often used as a scapegoat.

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,380
Politicians, especially
before national elections,

107
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,880
liked to pretend the EU is all powerful
and mix up rules and laws of the heads

108
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,440
of the governments and citizens,

109
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,670
although often they were directly
responsible for what the EU did.

110
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Democracy is annoying and complicated
enough and very boring in the European

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,700
Union even more so than
in the member states,

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,720
but voting and caring about
how our political institutions
change and develop is

113
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,540
one of the most powerful
things we can do as citizens.

114
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,800
The last few years have shown that
extreme thing was can happen through

115
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,634
elections.

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,020
We have to decide if we want to
be an active part of this process.

117
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,180
If we don't take part in the struggle for
power, that is politics. Others, well,

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
and we might not like what they decide
for us because Europe is an important

119
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,674
topic for us.

120
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,580
We've translated this video into as
many European languages as possible.

121
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,560
A couple of European youtube isn't
aerated is and uploaded it to their own

all youtube ers who helped us.
